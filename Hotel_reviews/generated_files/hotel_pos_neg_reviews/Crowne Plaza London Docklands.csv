435995,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The pillows were old and lumpy Breakfast was a nightmare ended up in bar area running back and forth to get cooked breakfast a couple of items at a time The hot food tasted nice at least what we managed to get so many items ran out and not replaced quickly We usually do ale our time but gave up and left Really disappointing , Good location for O2 right by the Emirates cable car
435996,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The pool doesn t have no privacy people walking in the streets can see through the glass, The view from the room was beautiful the staff was friendly and hotel was really clean great location
435997,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The menu selection for room service could have a little improvement , The Beds were extra comfy and the breakfast selection was awesome Then staff are very friendly and helpful and the bar is well stocked 
435998,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Nothing for now to be honest It was a lovely pleasant experience Thank you to all the staff and management you re all doing a great job keep it up, Staff where so professional from the first point we got there till the time we left They upgraded us complimentary as we were celebrating something special Our room wasn t ready but they offered us complimentary drink whilst we waited 5 mins for the room to get ready Breakfast and restaurant staff were amazing especially SAMANTHA she s the absolute best In general all staff were so lovely in the restaurant unfortunately I can t remember all their names I can t fault the staff or hotel I look forward to my return 
435999,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, No sleep kit in the room this time as have had it before but not sure if this is still provided in the room , Excellent location for Greenwich O2 Westfield DLR and Emirates skyline Lovely spacious rooms clean and comfortable Nice city views Brilliant breakfast Lovely staff Professional and friendly 
436000,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Order breakfast in bed which had been reheated and was not good and unable to eat most of it Also was not informed that the only smoking rooms were in the standard rooms only and we had booked a king room which was no smoking so we had to pay 75 pounds for a room with a balcony Was not happy that this was not specified on booking com it was my partners birthday present so did not want a standard room ,No Positive
436001,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Shame the pool Had a water babies class on all day when we wanted to have a nice relaxing swim and the jacuzzi was small and not hot, Duvet pillows and mattress extremely comfortable White company bathroom toiletries were a nice touch too Really close to tube stop and sky track Lovely bar area serving fabulous sandwiches snacks drinks and main meals Best salmon sandwich I ve had for a while 
436002,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The room was dusty unfortunately Especially around the bed area and the TV I had allergic reaction to it , The room was spacious and the staff was friendly Food was big portions and very tasty I was given an upper room like how I asked Complimentary water was given aswell Breakfast was lovely too 
436003,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Location could have been a little nearer to the centre of London, Excellent breakfast facilities Very comfortable bed Room was a good size Very quiet 
436004,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, There were no plates We were seated in someone else s table that had been cleared There was hardly any breakfast left The coffee machine was very unreliable , The coffee was nice when the coffee machine worked
436005,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The check in desk design could have been better doesn t reflect the quality and comfort of the rooms , I think I loved that part of the city because it is quiet OK a bit far away but there was kind of serene environment don t know maybe because of the docks 
436006,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, I like showers but there was a bath tub in our room but that was no problem I wanted to stay in Docklands so chose this particular hotel but found it to be a little too far from the central London , Close to the DLR Very good reception staff Had a lovely evening meal served by a very nice Spanish waiter Breakfast was ok I ve had better Clean confortable hotel 
436007,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, We were attending an event at the Excel and the property was very nearby with a multistorey car park at the rear Lovely hotel friendly staff nice breakfast price reasonable for London and room was very comfortable 
436008,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, The amazing service I was upgraded to a king suite at no extra cost After the level of customer service received I wish I had noted names I wasn t disappointed in the room either Overall amazing service and experience 
436009,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Could have been cheaper 169 was alot of money, Bed was amazingly comfy and the room was lovely and cool on a hot day Curtains blacked out the daylight superbly
436010,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and very helpful we came back to our room after being at the o2 and there was birthday cake from the staff for my wife and a birthday card which was lovley think the guys name was cass who looked after us nice person hope he gets a bonus
436011,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The carpet in my room was damp there was a funny damp smell in the room and I found lots of black hair everywhere The dressing gown was stiff and scratchy, The bed was comfy and the little extras like shower gel and sleeping mist was nice With it being so hot the fridge in the room was great for keeping drinks cold 
436012,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, nothing parking little bit pricey but it is London, Everything First class hotel Staff restraunt facilities location room all brill stayed many times and one of my favourite hotels 
436013,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Long delay to answer phone to reception restaurant but once they picked up the phone service was good, Rooms are very clean beds are so comfortable
436014,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The card key wasn t working and we have to change it everyday The receptions are so arrogant We arrived early around 7 00 am but they kept on telling us to wait for an hour as the housekeeper was still cleaning the room That 1 hour lasted until 1 00 pm,No Positive
436015,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The fact I had to pay extra l too much chlorine in the pool and hot tub, I liked the view but I did not book this part from boooking com Booking com did not make it clear that their rooms are standard rooms and this is facing the car park I therefore called the hotel directly and paid 30 extra for an upgrade to a room on the 6th floor their highest floor and a view
436016,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The breakfast was poor cold I asked for it to be microwaved and they did as I asked not sure how hygienic this is but they did do as I requested the main menu was limited and pricey I would have loved macaroni cheese or omelette something simple The USB s between our beds were non operational did not work Having to charge appliance and sit on floor or chair which kept springing back when you rested your back on it I did not like that there was not a hand rail at the bath for support I cannot think why this would not be there already The cold tap function was difficult to operate it remained hot at wash hand basin I had to adjust taps allot to get it to come on The room service and breakfast menu options were there we did not use surcharge here and there put us off also we had a very early flight and continental breakfast alone did not start until 6am So we could not even order that when checked out 4 45am I mentioned to reception he basically said did you not say to reception yesterday having had an extremely sweaty day we just wanted to go to room and we didn t manage back out of room as we were exhausted from activities and we were packing and trying to rest on trying to pick breakfast at 11 55pm from door menu we noticed the time restraints so we did not get breakfast on departure which we were not reimbursed for Also requested taxi hotel had taxi service there so we took it he in my opinion ripped us off I have his registration number the taxi to property from London city airport was 7 15 tip not compulsory the taxi from propriety to airport was 15 I did not give a tip SJ15 VNT very disappointed with his charge as no meter was on display I don t mind paying for a good service but I knew the taxi wouldn t cost anymore that 9 50 and he basically charged us what he wanted , The location the cleanliness the comfy beds the bath was great spacious room towels good quality did not use gym or pool we were attending a big les mills fitness event and had no energy left to work out the bar was lovely rest rooms were spotless lift was quick and functioning easy access doors we tried the food menu what we ordered was hot good portion size and tasted good the dessert was fantastic although as we shared that maybe they could do a bigger sharing portion option we loved the room although as described it had some flaws which I m positive can be redeemed With everything said the bar drinks were served well and although service was a little slow we felt we got value for money service was pleasant well dressed and accurate I would definitely use this property again and request they update some of the fixtures and breakfast area promptly To allow a 10 10 rating they can address some failings We rated our stay on this occasion a very pleasant 9 Also there is a Tesco for convenience short walk from hotel The excel is a short walk the cable cars are a short walk there is several restaurants with a more ala carte feel to it Excellent busy area loads of hotel options 
436017,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, I wasn t happy with the lack of welcoming from the staff We had a problem checking in as we were told we could pay on departure I wasn t getting paid until the next day so we had to wait 3 5 hours in reception for my brother During this time the staff didn t even bat a smile help us in any way or give us an option Being a manager myself I do all I can do help customers and at least try to accomodate them Amy way I can The manager on shift was absolutely rubbish Not a smile not a welcome her tone was disgusting Saying this myself and my partner have just come back from a week spent in a 5star in Spain for 500 half board The staff were amazing welcoming and brilliant The staff at the Crowne plaza hotel could benefit from a bit of training instead of snooting their noses down at people Manners don t cost nothing either We paid 140 for the most rubbish night breakfast not included aswell for that price absolutely ridiculous My partner cut himself on the door stop in the room bearing in mind this is on the floor in the middle of the wardrobe next to the door with no warning The one in the bathroom had a rubber around it whereas this one didn t we couldn t open the window in our room my partner had no sleep because the air con wasn t working and the view was awful Overall the hospitality was disgraceful I will not be staying here again you were rubbish I would rather go abroad and if need to stay in London again I will book elsewhere Arrange some team training and the manager should spend some time with her team and teach them some skills rather than walk around with her hands in her pockets thinking she is the bees knees I am big on people skills and team building with my own team and she was the worst manager I have ever seen ,No Positive
436018,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Pool area could have been more impressive there was a swimming course for kids and the pool was completely full and loud so wasn t possible to take a rest on that time , We had short stay with my partner breakfast was really good the bar has a good atmosphere the hotel based in pleasant area 
436019,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, There s not enough information about the facilties and the staff don t really tell you everything about the hotel when you check in There s no leaflets or information booklets about what s available in the hotel , Nice relaxed atmosphere and great staff Family friendly and couple friendly 
436020,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, We were woken at 8am by a very loud cleaner talking and banging equipment This was really unfortunate as otherwise the hotel couldn t be faulted , The room is large and the bed is comfortable The pool is great The staff are friendly and helpful 
436021,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, There was a spa on site but nothing in your room to tell you about services and availability, Located well next to the London excel centre and the DLR line Bed was super comfy and staff were very helpful There was a multi socket charger for phones and tablets a hairdryer and an ironing board 
436022,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The bin in the room wasn t emptied when we arrived and there were a few crumbs on the floor Value for money wasn t great, The beds are super comfy Pretty close to public transport links Spa was amazing
436023,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, The location was perfect for what we needed It was literally a 2min walk from Royal Victoria DLR line station and across the river from the 02 which was ideal The hotel staff were so friendly and it felt as if they cared The hotel was immaculate and the rooms had so many useful facilities such as a genuinely good hairdryer and plenty of complementary toiletries 
436024,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, I didn t get a view from my window of my room and i paid a lot of money for it which was really annoying I asked to change rooms but the receptionist was not understanding , the bed pillows and duvet are really comfortable and the breakfast buffet is exquisite 
436025,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The shower was outdated compared to other hotels we have stayed in, The beds were lovely Very clean room The breakfast was nice The staff got my husbands lactose free milk without any issues which was very good service 
436026,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, On the downside we were lucky to get parking as they is not much parking if your staying at the hotel but there is parking next to it and it is basically the same price as the hotel The breakfast wasn t alright wasn t the best that i had scrambled eggs didn t really have any flavour the crossiants were quite cold , It s was boyfriends birthday so they had decorated the bed with some rose petals and given him a cake which was really nice When I was leaving my boyfriend packed my things for me so when I got home I realised that I didn t have my laptop or my phone charger and i called the hotel really early in the morning and they picked up and they had retrieved both my items for me which was great The location was nice next to emirates And they gave us a late check out time which was fantastic since we didn t have to rush
436027,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Having to pay 18 per day for parking is overpriced especially since the space is extremely limited The representation of the room online is not what you actually get The room was very small for an executive room We ordered our breakfast to be brought upstairs which came in a timely manner however on the first day the food was extremely cold burnt and cold toast the bacon was hardly cooked and the scrambled egg was inedible The second day I requested for my food to be well done So I received burnt bacon burnt sausage and the same scrambled egg with cold toast Being breakfast was included I still had to pay a 5 tray charge Because of the breakfast I did not bother go to the restaurant I went out to eat Other than that the hotel is well presented , The hotel is situated in a nice location however there isn t much to do locally The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was nice Being that we stayed at the front of the hotel the blackout curtains worked perfectly 
436028,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Breakfast was cold and I had to ask for my meal to be microwaved to reheat also on both days I had to search foe staff to ask for coffee that was my only dislike, Room staff and facilities were as expected having stayed at Crowne Plaza hotels previously I knew all would be good 
436029,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Really cannot think of any aspect of our stay that had any faults , Could not fault the hotel or the room Everything had been carefully thought out for ease and comfort Excellent breakfast Would stay at the hotel again when in London 
436030,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Air conditioning didn t work properly no cold air Ordered coffee in bar lounge was very weak Coffee at breakfast was much stronger and better quality , Staff very helpful and friendly room was a good size 
436031,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Not enough coffee sachets in room My car got damaged on car park someone deliberately ran a key down the passenger side , Comfortable beds and wonderful breakfast
436032,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, Lovely hotel and excellent customer service from staff close to where we wanted to go and easy to get too It was really close to the emirates air line too which we went on to get to the o2 The checking out time was 12oclock which is better than most hotels I ve stayed at in the past Would recommend to anyone that is going to the o2 to stay here
436033,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Well we did try get a table for dinner in the restaurant but it was our fault as we did not book and we was a big group, We was greeted by a very nice man at reception by the name Robert he helped us with all our questions and helped us with everything for the rooms even when we ha too add a person last min he was very certious and a pleasure too talk too
436034,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, There was nothing i didnt like about this hotel it was great i just wish i had stayed a bit longer , I am really fussy when it comes to hotel accomodation but i can honestly say this was fab i loved it it was super clean the bed was super comforatble i loved the pillows they were excellent not too hard and not too soft and i loved the breakfast it was superb This hotel was well worth the money i did get it at a reasonable rate too 
436035,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The local transport tubes were all shut No advance notice when booking made or since the booking was made which made travel very difficult and extended travel time by triple , Staff were good and the leisure club was well needed in the heat Breakfast was reasonable 
436036,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The staff in the bar area where not very good to the point I stood there waiting for a drink while they just chatted to each other To the point I just walked across the road into another bar to get a drink, In the whole the hotel was good apart from the bacon was rubbery
436037,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Nothing, Everything about it even gave cookies out when waiting to check in Only downfall was i didn t get time to try out the spa so would love to go back in future
436038,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Breakfast wasn t too good tbh It was edible etc but I would of expected it to be better at a hotel of this standard Also had to ask 4 times to be served coffee , Really nice place and they had our favourite tipple Guinness lol 
436039,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The drinks are expensive You can wait awhile for the lifts during busy times Also one of our cups on the breakfast table had lipstick around the rim , The hotel is very clean and tidy Whilst waiting to book it we were given a glass of iced water Nice touch Rooms are very spacious and every bed was a double in the twin rooms 
436040,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The shower in the bathroom was extremely poor no pressure at all the water trickled out Also the bathroom smelt quite strongly of damp drains , Breakfast was excellent Large comfy bed Lighting was either too bright or too dim couldn t control the spotlights in the room 
436041,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Bed not very comfy Would have liked to have been catered for two in a double room two packs of biscuits not one more coffee tea herbal tea sachets and two flannels etc as although very good friends would rather not share the one flannel Was concerned at how the window opened may sound strange but thought they needed a safety catch if above a certain height , The location as easy to get to and station so close by Excellent for O2 and Excel Great places to eat nearby Bar area lovely and relaxing and staff welcoming and friendly as they were at breakfast Good selection at breakfast something for everyone Definitely worth booking well in advance as price was a great deal 
436042,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, On Saturday night we were kept awake by six people out side shouting and drinking from 3am till 6 30am we thought they could have been moved on by the police as the Hotel staff were aware of the noise We did not let this spoil our weekend , Location to Woolwich as we were visiting our son who works there and a nice area to stay Frendly staff good breakfast 
436043,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Put on search engine closest one to 02 arena it should have said it was across the water missed last cable back and had to taxi round , Bed and pillow super comfy
436044,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Sadly the spa facilities let it down no prior notice that swim lessons were on so pool partitioned off 10 adults watching across what was left plus kids in the bit not being used for lessons and in the jacuzzi which ruined it for us as was a small space anyhow and was advertised as relaxing spa That it was not Prior notice at reception would have been good for hotel guests as we would have gone at a time around the lessons , Great location for o2 concert few minutes walk to zip wire great breakfast room was excellent very clean
436045,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, It was all in all great , The room was spacious and we had complimentary water which was great to see The bathroom was clean and tidy Also the jacuzzi was lovely There was no noise in the night which was nice 
436046,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, As a guest at the hotel you shouldn t have to pay for parking Also the staff who didn t speak very good english spoke too quickly Also i paid a 50 deposit which i still haven t had credited to my account They took the full payment including the parking and the deposit when we checked in On checking my account when we left they took payment of the car park and hotel but the 50 had not been credited , The room was tidy and clean lovely view of the river
436047,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, I loved everything I m in love with this hotel for real , I loved everything about that hotel it was fantastic from start to finish The hotel is located in a good location a super quiet place The receptionist who picked us up was super nice I loved her work five strokes she was young Italian and speaks portuguese from brazil The room was huge very comfortavel with everything organized the pool the jacuzzi the sauna everything perfect the restaurant was fantastic breakfast was worth paying for it because everything was great me and my boyfriend loved the hotel and this was the best Hotel I ve been to in my entire life And I assure you that we will come back this time with the whole family Thank you very much for the stay and thank you the receptionist for the excellent work and friendliness 
436048,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, wasnt very clear on how the process of the payment went I thought they took the whole payment there and then not knowing it was in a loop , It was very clean and spacious staff were very friendly 
436049,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, N A, This property is really well located The DLR is literally around the corner so really easy to get about There are coffee shops restaurants nearby
436050,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, Fantastic attentive staff where nothing was too much trouble It s the little things that make the difference toothpaste forgotten phoned reception and some was sent to the room Excellent service 
436051,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The room was boiling Even with air conditioning on coldest temperature it was very hot , The hotel was in a great location Really clean and breakfast was lovely 
436052,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, I ordered a drink that cost one price but when I went to pay they had given me a drink that cost a lot more saying they didn t have my original choice they did this without checking that I was ok with this it seems to be a regular practice as I saw a number of other guest have the same issue on both nights I stayed , the hotel was clean the room was spacious and I liked the little extra touches water in room etc
436053,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, What an amazing stay I was staying here with my daughter as we were going to a concert for her 12th Birthday at the 02 On arrival we were met by Riccardo who was fabulous he arranged a taxi for us in the evening we got an unexpected upgrade gave us all the information we needed They made her feel so special with a special balloon card and plate of treats for her birthday that were delivered to our room We mixed up times and missed breakfast but nothing was too much trouble they put together an amazing feast All of the staff were very polite and friendly nothing was too much trouble the hotel is very spacious and clean I would recommend to anyone visiting the O2 or nearby and we ll definitley be visiting again Can t thank the staff enough for the extra mile making her birthday treat magical experience 
436054,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Overly sensitive keycard system Couldn t get in our room and had to visit reception twice before a member of staff came with me and succeeded in getting in Took two or three attempts every time after that Room decorated in shades of grey very modern but a little drab in my opinion Didn t detract from the comfort though , Very friendly and efficient staff Spotlessly clean Excellent room service Food very good Large room lots of nice little touches 
436055,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Everything Samantha is a great asset to the Crowne Plaza, Beautiful hotel great location staff is great especially Samantha the best hostess in London
436056,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The main reason why I chose this hotel was the pool which has an acceptable size However it s just a depth of 1 20 m everywhere and the water was a little opaque and smelled a little like ammonia Well who does a bit of research knows what that means Also the whirl pool had lots of foam But not the kind of foam you would want to find inside a whirl pool It seems they do not exchange the water very often what felt a bit disgusting I just found it annoying I had to request a comb tooth brush cotton buds separately and they had to bring it to my room but then forgot the cotton buds The sound insulation of the room walls and especially of the front door could have been a bit better But I only woke up once at night due to a group of people passing by my room having loud conversations with lots of laughter , In general I was happy with my stay at the Crown Plaza Docklands London The staff was super friendly and very helpful Also the room was comfy and clean 
436057,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Car park was a bit confusing wish it was payable at the hotel , swimming pool was lovely and the breakfast was excellent The location to the Excel was brilliant and would stop here again
436058,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, I didn t appreciate the fire alarm going off in the middle of the night Completely ruined my sleep Limited access to stairs , Decent facilities and friendly staff 
436059,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, For 19 a head the buffet breakfast was appalling For three mornings on the trot the hash browns were cold and floppy tomatoes dried up beans ok mushrooms ok on two days and on the third undercooked Muesli was nice My colleague said the bacon wasn t great but I didn t have any Fried eggs looked good though and were being made fresh on view We even didn t like the marmalade which was most bizarre so I don t know if we were just unlucky and had an off one I ve had much nicer and cheaper breakfasts at a Premier Inn but I guess with buffets it very much depends on your timing as to how long food has been sat out We booked a room with air con but most of the rooms don t actually have air con so after a boiling night with what we thought was faulty air con we found out that on our floor it has two chillers that cool the whole floor and one of them had broken down so the other was working over hard and not managing We were moved to a floor with air con which was amazing but the fridges in both rooms didn t work but there is ice on each floor so we used that to keep our drinks cool , Nicely close to Excel so very handy when we needed to be there early for work We booked a twin room and had a double bed each which was nice and comfortable Plenty of plug sockets and usb ports for charging everything we had with us 
436060,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Nothing , This is the 3rd time we have stayed here We had a concert to go to at the 02 travelled over on the cable car Train back very easy to get into London by Royal Victoria station Cafes bars and shops around all excellent Very good location for the excel 
436061,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The aircon on our floor wasn t working 100 so it was on but not as cold as it could have been But that wasn t even that bad Just a bit hard to figure out how to open the window , The staff were lovely and couldn t have been more accommodating Any questions we had were answered instantly Breakfast buffet was very varied and had lots to offer and there was so much available to us 
436062,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The two young men greeted us like the King and Queen of England and made us very welcome On our next trip to London we hope you will have a room for us , Your staff was outstanding and helped us a great deal We got caught in the British Airways computer crash and our return flight to San Francisco was cancelled We were fortunate to find a room for the evening We had no luggage 
436063,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The room was very hot and so it was hard to sleep there was what appeared to be air con in the room but turning it up to full didn t produce any cold air The breakfast tasted nice bit I think the smoked salmon was out a bit too long I didn t have a very comfortable drive home , Very clean and up to date friendly and accommodating staff perfect location The on site bar was reasonably priced and friendly and there was a swimming pool available too 
436064,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Breakfast was hectic had to sit at dirty table Also queue for coffee , Perfect location for our visit to the Excel Lovely size room with a great side view Also close to cable car which we took across to the 02 Right next to station too
436065,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, Everything about the property was lovely from the staff to the bedroom not forgetting the location Being my wife s birthday we had a lovely suprise in the bedroom and our room was also upgraded I would like to thank Crowne plaza for there hospitality 
436066,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The key cards were faulty but eventually worked after like 8 tries in the door Not good if you re bursting to use the toilet haha , The hotel room was brilliant A lot bigger than I expected very spacious Would be booking with this hotel again 
436067,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, It would better if the breakfast cost include to the price, Location a little bit far from center but DLR is very near so its possible to go center approx 20 min but y target was Excel forum so its OK Staff Very helpful and kind especially thanks front desk manager ms Marta solving the deposit problem Bed and rooms are very clean and wide enough
436068,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Since we had a late check out we really wanted to sleep in however housekeeping kept knocking on the door every 20 30 minutes from 9 30 when I later mentioned this at the reception he responded very indifferent , We checked in really late at night so I asked if it would be possible to get a late check out and we did get that complimentary 
436069,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The temperature in the pool was a little low , The hotel was lovely Staff were very helpful espically Samantha in the restaurant was very helpful and friendly she made us feel very welcome The rooms were very comfortable and plenty of space I would definitely stay here again 
436070,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, I have stayed at other spa hotels but this stay was by far the best We stayed to celebrate my 2 year old daughter s birthday and the staff really went out of their way to make her birthday a special one especially the hostess Samantha I am so glad that we chose to stay at the Crowne Plaza for this celebration And just when we thought that it couldn t get any better we then sat down to enjoy the buffet style breakfast Bottom line you will not regret choosing to stay at this hotel We will definitely be returning 
436071,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Everything was perfect only there was no toothpaste or toothbrush, Really enjoyed the experience plus staff were helpful They didn t mind us call up reception for complimentary tea and biscuits 
436072,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Nothing, Close to amenities in particular the O2 Staff were very friendly and helpful and the bar prices for food and drinks were reasonable considering it was central London
436073,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The hair dryer nozzle did not fit the hairdryer in the room there were no robes in the room to use for the spa we had to call reception for them They did arrive quickly but were of poor quality and the hoops for the belt were broken The staff in the Bar area did not speak very good English it was hard to order anything from the cocktail list without pointing it out The main issue for me was the spa there were lots of families with the children jumping in and out of the hot tub and steam room The hot tub and steam room should be made adults only for those who have left their children at home and would like to relax , The room was a nice size comfortable and clean There was an iron and ironing board in the room The bed was very comfortable and the little sleep spray is a nice touch Customer service at reception was fantastic a very high standard 
436074,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Car parking machine had no light We struggled to pay with our mobile phone light Also breakfast was very basic, Room was upgraded for free Nice light and airy spacious room
436075,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, Good location close to the o2 arena easy to find hotel staff are very friendly rooms are nice and big gym and swimming pool spot on will stay in this hotel in future no hassitation
436076,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The room I had booked and pre paid for wasn t available we turned up the receptionist wasn t very helpful and didn t speak clearly the parking rate was quite a lot Would of liked to of relaxed by the pool but not many beds and kids were in there playing , Nice clean hotel comfy bed staff brought a big balloon to the room for my birthday which was nice 
436077,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The breakfast was worse then a little chef Cost a lot for 2 breakfasts and we couldn t eat half of it Very very disappointing Great if you don t have taste buds tho, I liked the bed that s it
436078,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Sadly our room had a very strong smell of mould which seemed to be coming from the bathroom The bed and bathroom did look clean but I couldn t help but wonder what was causing the awful smell I was also disappointed with the pool area which was very crowded so swimming lengths was almost impossible Also the stairs to the pool and the floors weren t clean particularly in the women s changing room and the showers needed attention too Sadly the spa facilities were more reminiscent of a public swimming baths, Lovely spacious room which was well equipped and the beds were comfy Enjoyed the buffet breakfast too although the hash browns weren t very fresh on either day but the rest of the food was great 
436079,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Free on site parking would be nice but no different to other hotels in the area, Excellent breakfast on site restaurant good location for Excel great staff hello Roberto lovely pool comfy beds and room Ice machine outside lift is useful

436082,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Spa facilities aren t as good as I expected fairly small which gave a feeling of overcrowded Groups of middle aged Eastern European men present which made my partner feel uncomfortable as they were staring ALOT Way too much chlorine in the hot tub burning sensation Otherwise very pleasant stay, Superb hotel were able to check us in early room as described with fantastic view A stones throw from DLR and cable cars so ideal for our night at the O2 Staff went extra mile and left a birthday treat of cake etc on the bed for our return which was a lovely touch 
436083,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The scrambled egg at breakfast was horrible wet and powdery and the fried eggs were under cooked and snotty Yuk , the rooms were very comfortable from the bed to the temperature and the overall decor the hotel was quiet which makes for a good nights rest 
436084,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The coffee machine at breakfast stopped working twice and this was the only coffee available This caused queues and unhappy guests , Rooom great as were the facilities 
436085,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Our only slight grumble was the breakfast buffet which didn t live up to the standard set by the rest of the hotel , The staff were incredible very friendly and helpful It was my Fiancees birthday and they left delicious complimentary baked goods in our room with a Happy Birthday banner which was a lovely touch The location is perfect for the O2 just across the river on the cable car which they keep open later when there is an event at the O2 if not there is always the tube It was our second stay here and we will definitely be staying again Our first stay was in a suite which was spectacular This time we had a standard room but it was still roomy had great views over the river the bed was just as comfortable The pool facilities were lovely and clean I can t wait for our next stay

436088,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The restaurant joined on to the facility service was poor , This is the first hotel that I ve stayed at that actually read my booking note and left a surprise for me in the room Top marks Oh and free cookies whilst queuing to check in Use of the spa was also a great addition

436091,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Felt the breakfast had been standing too long and would have preferred an option for boiled eggs or alternative not being able to order food after 11 Arrived 10 30 and by the time we had settled the kitchen had a problem with the ovens Staff were helpful and we ordered take out but it was after 12 before we could go to sleep which made the competition for my son extremley difficult, The friendly staff and comfort of the room

436094,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The website did not make it clear that there is parking at the hotel I left my car at the Excel centre for the duration of my stay only discovered at the end that I could have paid less had I parked at the hotel , I was upgraded to a room with a great view The staff were more than helpful the food was good It was all a little pricey but hey this is London 
436095,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Reception kept calling in regards to a mistake I made while booking but it was sorted the night I checked in but the guy forgot to tell the morning staffs, The view
436096,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The staff at breakfast could have been a little more tentative Had to ask for tea and coffee Food was ok not particularly busy but no eggs available and food was more tepid not hot , The bedroom had everything we needed very comfortable 
436097,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Staff on reception wasn t good on arrival She blatantly lied to my face and took 50 off my card as a deposit to then be told by another member of staff when leaving that it wasn t necessary Not happy, Facilities were great Room was excellent with lovely view Food was nice 
436098,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, Re Cashier 258 Your hotel receptionist was amazing She was very competent in her role extremely helpful and very approachable We have stayed at this hotel a few times and she is definitely the best first interaction we have had I wish i could remember her name but hopefully the cashier number helps as she deserves a special congratulations All the staff were great but she was exceptional she made our anniversary even more special
436099,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Upon arrival what appeared to be a supervisor shouting at a member of cleaning staff was a little of what was yet to come when we came back after evening out around 945 we thought maybe we could pick up a leaflet from the gym and see the pool We got out Of The lift and we re immediately comforted and questioned how we got there and told we shouldn t be there The young ladies tone was very degrading and after we quickly turned around for the lift she got in the lift with us and a colleague and continued to question how and why we got there It appeared to be a fault that the lift shouldn t go to that floor although I didn t see this as our fault The intension was to use the facilities and treatments the next day but felt we were not welcome which is a shame and will not be booking again ,No Positive
436100,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Quality of the breakfast Better quality ingredients in general Bacon looked budget and the containers steamed the hash browns which made them soggy Not what you d expect for the price When you are shown to your breakfast table it would be nice to be poured the first tea or coffee by the staff , Really clean Great quiet location about 15 mins walk to Canning station Really nice modern room with great views 
436101,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Not getting the river view i asked for a week before said i had to pay extra for it when others didnt Random banging on wall at 3am on 2 of the nights woke us up And pretty scary , Cleanliness small extras were really cool pillow mist free waters biscuits amazing toiletries Galaxy hot chocolate Omg those breakfast waffles were to die for And no supplement for them 
436102,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, They forgot to bring my chips with my food to the room and after calling them it took them 1 hour to bring it Lound and noisy neighbours in a next door room arguing at 4 am in the morning so hard to sleep and relax , Room setting and colours big bed lovely bathroom nice food
436103,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, On arrival the staff made it clear that as I had booked via booking com not to expect any perks or room upgrades as this would only be possible with a direct booking which is fine The pool area was dated but at least clean The amount of chemicals used in the jacuzzi was burning my eyes so be warned I decided to order some room service only to be told that this was unavailable and that I had to use external services The staff member on the phone was rude and offered nothing in the form of an explanation or apology In the morning checking out I raised these issues with the front desk and they had no knowledge of there being room service available the night before and offered no form of customer care I d suggest to anyone spending money on a place to stay in london there are much better places , The location suited me as this is tucked away in a quiet corner of london Also has a pool and spa 
436104,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, No room service or late night food available when asked for food at 1130 pm as not had chance to eat all day They did however offer a pizza delivery but I m gluten free They provided a bag of crisps for free which helped greatly , Made to feel welcome from the second we walked in The lady at breakfast was amazing So jolly and polite but seemed to make it a personal experience The gentleman on the desk at midnight was also lovely The rooms were clean and spacious and the breakfast was good value I d say for me it s an ideal location too especially if going to the O2 
436105,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, I found the reception staff rude and demanding One of the lifts broke and was out of action all weekend this meant waiting for ages to use the lift you can not access guest rooms from stairs Prices were very expensive at the bar and for room service Food was terrible avoid the prawn noodle soup The room we stayed in smelt terrible I overheard someone else asking to move rooms as there s also smelt bad ,No Positive
436106,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The shower curtain with shower over the bath Would prefer separate shower without bath Water temperature was good and hot , Walking distance to Excel The Emirates Cable Car across to The O2 centre The DLR stops st the back of the hotel A great walking venue around the Victoria Dock which is now residential The overall standard and facilities at the hotel was excellent

436112,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Parking at this hotel is expensive 18 extra a day You are better off parking in the streets behind the Royal Victoria Station where parking is free The hotel refused a late check out on Sunday which was bad considering we stayed 2 days there , Easy access good transport links to get into into the City Hotel was clean and presentable Good facilities 
436113,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, staff we extremely polite and helpful Breakfast was excellent The hotel room had everything we needed and was very clean 10 out of 10 would defiantly stay here again

436118,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Night manager treat it me like I was stupid The reception told me that I can park my car and ring the bell which I did After 5 attempts of ringing the bell about 5 mns waiting in the cold I decided to knock the window He finally show up and said in an arrogant way can t u see we have a bell I replied by telling him that I ve been ringing for at leat 5 mns I found his reaction very unprofessional and rude especially since I am a paying customer ,No Positive
436119,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Rude staff didn t come cleaning the room didn t fix our phone took 5 hours for a bottle of water order , Location I came many times before
436120,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, We had to pay 100 pound deposit and were told we would get it back on the day then we asked for it back on the day and the person at reception said 3 5 working days this should have been in the booking price or somewhere to say this when we were paying also the food we ordered up to the room on the last night was not good , The room was lovely 
436121,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Breakfast was chaotic Breakfast staff not great One waitress was just rude Too much food was cold or waiting to be replaced , Reception staff and both Concierges were excellent Polite friendly and helpful Facilities very good Car parking excellent shame about the 18 charge but a great facility Room was large and both bedroom and bathroom were spotlessly clean 
436122,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Staff on room was bit strange Not really nice I think they were east european and they were not happy when we asked for a baby blanket and they appeared with a full duvet Anyway grumpy as they were they took off Rest of the hotel was perfect btw , Nice location bar etc Wellcome was good including Kas the concierge 
436123,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Air con didn t work over night and the room was too hot to sleep in the reception staff didn t seem to concerned which was a shame, The rooms felt very homely and easy to adjust to
436124,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The price of breakfast I felt was a bit expensive , Really comfy room Cleaned very well and the staff were really nice Very close to where we needed to be o2 arena Good transport to get into London centre 
436125,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The appearance on the internet is that this hotel directly faces the river Which appealed to me as i sleep with a window open But in fact there is a road and quite a busy walkway in front of the hotel We asked to be moved to the back of the hotel and luckily there was a room ,No Positive
436126,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, On the last day of our stay Monday unfortunately the eggs bacon and tomatoes were all practically cold There were fewer people in for breakfast that day , The choice and the service were excellent The coffee was really good The rooms were very comfortable and the location was perfect for us as we were attending the O2 
436127,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The restaurant staff on arrival were so rude As we found out half hour later it turned out to be the end of there shift roughly 2 o clock ish The 4 of us had to wait a good 10 mins to be served drinks even though there was no que at bar we then ordered burgers I requested mine to be well done we were told all burgers were well done anyway mine certainly was no where near well done and was the same colour pink as the rest Disgusting I have a photo of proof of this burger also the price of breakfast 19 We didn t bother and went over the road to bonanne amazing breakfast and priced fairly at 5 95 , Used this hotel before and generally love it we were there for the c2c festival at the 02 convenient for the cable car 
436128,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Waiting ages for bacon etc to be replaced during breakfast Gym needs freshening up a bit, Spa pool and location Gym was a bit tatty but clean enough Samantha who was in charge in the restraunt for breakfast was the best I have ever seen she made us all feel so welcomed and important
436129,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, I made the mistake of going to the pool at 10 30 on a Friday morning Although we were told that there would be children in the pool this in itself was fine The fact that not only did I not have anywhere to sit or place my clothes whilst changing all space taken by mothers with masses of bags and not one would move anything and the constant kids slamming the locker doors and running around unguarded and to top it all having to hold my towel up against myself whilst one woman decided it was a great idea to film her child walking around the changing room I was naked and didn t want my body shown to everyone on Instagram Facebook or the family video This should be banned I love kids and understand the baggage that comes with them but some of these mothers were not only rude they let their kids run riot and filmed in the changing room This ruined my whole night away as one of the reasons we chose this hotel was because of the pool and steam Won t make that mistake again , The location staff and room were all very good 
436130,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Nothing everything was as it should be plus more I theorilly enjoyed every minute of it, This is the 3rd time I ve stayed at a crowne plaza hotel but the first time in London I really do have to say it was excellent out of this world for quality location and comfort I don t know what a hotel has to have to get 5 stars as this hotel is definitely worth it everytime value for money was outstanding and the food t the hotel reception was quite unique I m a chef and it was easily best hotel food I ve ever had top class thanx for a beautiful stay and a fantastic weekend see use next time and il def be staying again when I m in London miss it already
436131,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The food had no taste I had the sea bass with the rice and it had no taste to it I also had to wait 40 mins before I could even order due to not enough staff cooking There was a very bad drain smell at one side of the bar , Bed was comfy iron and board in room not all hotels have them in the room staff were very helpful 
436132,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Very confusing on Booking com website saying that the hotel was 1 600 yards from Canning Town Station the nearest station is in fact Royal Victoria on the DLR This made our journey more stressful as we had an event to attend at 02 We got off at Canning Town hoping to walk to the hotel to drop off stuff off and then get back on the Jubilee Line to North Greenwich We called the hotel for directions who informed us they we need to get on the DLR to Royal Victoria and walk from there On a late Friday afternoon in rush hour time we had to wait 25 mins for 3 trains as they were so busy we couldn t get on We finally arrived at the hotel and did not have time to get the DLR back to Canning Town and then change to Jubilee line to North Greenwich We got the Emirates cable car over to the 02 which was Fantastic but was an additional unnecessary expense Do not get off at Canning Town for this hotel get off at Royal Victoria,No Positive
436133,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The fact I ve had to pay twice for the same room and still haven t had a refund for the first time I paid The hotel claim that because I booked the room on an older card before I had to pay again and they would refund my original card This hasn t been done I also paid extra for one of their Valentine s packages I only got the rose petals on the bed but didn t see the chocolate platter we were meant to get or the room upgrade So I paid an extra 100 for some roses Unacceptable , Bed was very comfy room was nice and spacious and facilities excellent
436134,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, slow and poor communication between the department reception housekeeping so on, The facility was good but the staff that were on duty apart from Sasha needed training and did not deliver a good services
436135,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, We had to use plastic knife and fork in restaurant which wasn t ideal due to a wedding party and still had to pay the full price mmmmm Something to think about there , Friendly staff in bar the Restaurant especially Alessandro 
436136,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Nothing , Staff were perfect so polite and kind Gave us an upgrade which was very sweet and made my husbands day Room was very nice view was superb Breakfast was OK would give a 7 out of 10 for the food itself Food and drink reasonably priced Gym area could use a little tlc but it served it s purpose more than adequately Pool and jacuzzi area was nice and clean though water was a little murky All round an excellent birthday weekend Thank you very much 
436137,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The staff in the restaurant could have been better and prices for there food and drinks were expensive for mediocre standards, The bedroom was great very comfortable the hotel smart and stylishly done
436138,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Apart from the first reception staff and the barmaid all other staff had poor customer service skills and looked down ipon us as if we werent worth the time or effect, Location was good
436139,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, I Go to Excel show every year thought to stay at this hotel as opposed to other internationally recognised hotels this year Kettle did not work in the room iron scaled with no ironing board so had to iron on the floor Scaled marked my beautiful silk blouse which will not Come off the carpet throughout the room and halls stank of overuse hits you as you come out of the lift had to wait over 2 hours for dinner to be served a party of four people at 8 30 PM when only four tables were occupied with 6 front of the house staff wondering around at the bar the barman told us they could not make one Bloody Mary because they were too busy when we joked but it is easy and quick to make this drink they highlighted a long winded process we ordered one at the end of the evening anyway NO customer at the bar and it still took half an hour to come and tasted bland we did not make a fuss though and just had a laugh with the barman price included breakfast but when turned up to breakfast at 9 45 am had to join a queue of 15 people ahead all of us were told to sit down in the bar somewhere till they get some of their tables ready even though it was a buffet breakfast Wont be staying there again I am afraid , location
436140,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Not sure here it met and exceeded all of our requirements , Twin room they said what they didn t say was twin queenside beds Breakfast catered for every need even with my 11 year old grandson the staff made us feel very welcome and really put themselves out 
436141,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, I didn t like no real restaurant what they did have in bar food very poor And breakfast biggest let down they were out of orange juice from there on breakfast very poor , The bed was comfortable and the pillows were nice

436144,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, There are many catches to this hotel as they don t explain the extra charges and the main reception staff was quite rude and on top we requested a wake up call on both mornings and was told that there s nothing they can do about it as they don t have it written down Which I feel is very bad customer service and was told no re fund which is stated on there company policy that a refund would be done due to the problem would be made which is their fault as their staff didn t communicate , We enjoyed the facilities and the Gym and spa services were fab and there staff
436145,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Something small There was a sign at reception advertising a free drink with the main course in the adjoining bar restaurant I inquired about this when I ordered my meal but was told that that deal was last week s deal I feel in the interest of good customer relations and best practice that the offer should have been honoured as it was advertised , I was extremely happy with my stay in The Crowne Plaza The staff was welcoming and helpful I asked for a change of room on arrival as there was a baby crying in the adjoining bedroom I was given a new room within five mins The room was warm and clean as was the ensuite The complimentary tea water etc was appreciated I would definitely stay here again

436147,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The awful stinky bathroom I got with liquid flowing from below moving pillows That I had to wait at breakfast due to the staff taking the food from the fruit bar Really bad food for dinner chicken burger That the staff was unable to distinguish between my name and surname , Location is quite good WiFi worked fine
436148,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The hot food at breakfast would be better cooked to order as dried a little on buffet , All staff where lovely The room was great large and well equipped x whole place was very clean 
436149,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Staff were very rude and not helpful to my partner everything she asked for was either they can t do it or charge extras for it so there was a slim young guy in the reception that was not helpful with basic thing Anything we ask for take forever to get it and they still get it wrong, The room was ok but their staff some in the housekeeping and reception seem not to understand the guests request they may need more training there was only 3 people that were good polite and helpful Adriana and Sasha in the reception seem to know customer services well and an older Eastern European lady in the breakfast room 
436150,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, No coffee and only one robe in our room We had to ask three times and received the wrong items , The Waitress in the Restaurant was helpful and suggested my daughter and I shared a large steak meal

436157,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, I always use hard mattress and pillows Sleeping on a very soft pillows is very agonizing for me Also swimming in a pool with 120 cm depth is also abnormal

436161,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Not really in relation to Crowne Plaza hotel Initially thought the o2 arena was within a walkable distance but were informed by receptionist that it wasn t However silver lining was we got to ride the Emirates Air Line cable car to the O2 arena instead Which was a bonus There s wasn t really anything that we disliked about our stay , Concierge gentleman was extremely friendly and hospital Greeted with a smile and friendly conversation Made to feel very welcome This was followed great service from the gentleman on reception Impeccable service The hotel is lovely clean and luxurious 
436162,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Jacuzzi had too much chlorine in which caused my friends eyes to swell and she couldn t see The treatments were all fully booked but asked for cancellations if one became available which did happen but wasn t informed about it so missed out on a treatment, The room was good but very hard pillows personal preference spa was very nice Breakfast was good but bit overpriced
436163,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Restaurant and bar staff came across very rude We found the staff looked down on us as we were two younger girls much younger than most guests and felt that they gave the impression we didn t fit in When having a drink in the bar staff were very rude and demeaning Staff during breakfast were constantly around giving us funny looks and seemed to pressure us to leave which didn t make it a relaxing and pleasurable experience , The room was spacious and clean and in good location to o2

436167,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Lighting in hotel room wasn t the best was very dark and had to turn on all the individual lights and then open the curtains which meant people in the building opposite were likely to have a nice view in The pool was smaller than I imagined and wasn t the warmest The jacuzzi was small and full of people so didn t get the use it There were separate saunas in each of the changing rooms which neither of used as we wanted to enjoy the experience together The changing rooms were small with no private changing areas so I got changed in the disabled toilet baby changing area as I felt uncomfortable about getting naked in front of people so that sense of luxury sort of dipped for me at that moment Had to wait a bit for some of the breakfast options to come out as they ran out when i got there but sometimes that can t be helped , Room was really nice Whole feel of hotel was nice Pool facilities were clean and smart looking Staff were friendly and helpful

436171,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Woken up by a strange alarm sound at 6am one the day of check out, Hotel very modern and clean Excellent facilities and access Restaurant staff very friendly
436172,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Children s Swimming classes in the pool and there fathers hogging the jacuzzi A non working steam room A dying fire alarm like noise waking me and my wife up 3 times through the night And the hotel still holding 50 from my bank without telling me they were going to take it in the 1St place Having to pay 18 for parking as a guest 2 beds in our room which were quite small instead of 1 large and a very small gym, It was clean
436173,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, wfii wouldnt let me send emails but i could browse the net No hairdryer in room and the 5 charge for a tray for room service i thought was uneccessary , Loved the feel and image of the hotel and the rooms were great and clean I loved the beds and the linen so comfy I would love to know where i can purchase the same for my house 
436174,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Very expensive breakfast which meant we ate elsewhere TV channels limited unless willing to pay this included music channels which only showed short clips of videos which seemed a bit odd , Good location for our visit to see a show at the O2 Big twin room with 2 double beds and good shower 
436175,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Paid for breakfast but did not get any as breakfast starts later at the weekend This was disappointing and we asked several staff on reception but a slightly earlier breakfast was not an option Shower in the room was disappointing , Very easy to get to City airport and Excel exhibition centre
436176,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, A very noisy hotel noise outside from traffic even though windows are closed aircraft people talking loudly Other guests making noise , Location near to DLR attractions and proximity to central London
436177,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Requested a dockside view when searching for hotel and crown plaza came up with a price on arrival advised needed to pay additional 60 for 2 nights with a view Misleading A poor start to our trip , convenient for excel
436178,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, We had booked a standard twin room and were given a double bed in a disabled room This was severely inconvenient and they could not or would not change it Very irritating , The meals were good 
436179,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, Room was spacious with excellent facilities comfortable bed and good bathroom Sadly I did not have a chance to sample the food or drinks but the bar and restaurant looked very appealing 
436180,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The hotel is 0 8m from the 02 where we were going to see a concert in the evening However the only transport over the river is cable cart It is not a walkable distance from the centre of London and adds another hour and a half onto the journey But the cable cart was affordable fast and dropped us outside the hotel , When we arrived we were upgraded to a superior room The room was spotless with lots of little extras We were offered unlimited access to the spa and pool however we didn t use it as we only had a one night stay 
436181,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, Lovely hotel in a perfect location for an event at The O2 Staff very attentive nothing was ever too much for them Will deffo be using this hotel again 
436182,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, We had colds whilst in Old London town but plus side was the bar staff made us up especially an infusion of ginger honey and lemon Fab attention to detail , Excellent hotel in great location for our visit to the London Boat Show in the Excel We got a good advance booking price so made it a great value trip to London
436183,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Chilly in the bar area , Fantastic staff great location We could walk straight into the The Boat Show The boys loved the pool A very pleasant comfortable night 
436184,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, Fantastic location perfectly placed for Emirates cable car ride across the Thames and onto boat ride port great facilities spa looked amazing but didn t get time to use it friendly and helpful staff and delicious breakfast definitely recommended 
436185,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, General and room service staff great quality and content of room service poor for the Hotel rectified outrageous cost of a poor breakfast I will return for sure since they took good care of me 
436186,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Scrambled eggs were abit soggy and I arrived a little near end of service 11 10am and the beans were dry with hardly any left if breakfast is served u till 11 30am then it should stay constant and fresh until that time , The wide variety of breakfast and the bed and bathroom was extremely comfy and cosey
436187,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Problems with TV had to call reception 3 4 times to resolve and restart TV only one out of two lifts working so constantly havinng to wait ages for it to come and hope there was space to get on Breakfast time there was no one at the front desk to seat you and had to wait ages for certain items to be replaced checkout was far to long Not enough staff to manage checkout There was a long line and checkout should be much more simple , Good location great view close to O2 centre Tesco newr by and few restaurants near
436188,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The only issue was there was only 1 lift in service which meant there were occasions when we had to wait sometime for an empty lift , The room was very clean The bed was very comfortable The staff was very friendly
436189,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Was told had no tea left for breakfast Staff did not notify me of charges IHG points have not been added did advice staff at desk was a member Lift not working Housekeeper didn t leave no water in room called front desk was told was complimentary and cant deliver to my room Lift was not working could wait upto 10 minutes to go down from 6th floor I feel as i got robbed for my money thats all it was about rather than maintaining and providing the service promised I stay away every week due to the nature of my business and in last 4 years i have seriously not seen the worse stay ever I seriously feel let down and robbed of 500 I had to call 4 times just to get a house keeper to provide me with towels ,No Positive
436190,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, I don t like the only one lift work which is slow I don t like the restaurant when I went there dinning nothing is welcomed , I like the dockland view from the room and a reception nice lady always smiling 
436191,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, breakfast is crap we waited 20min to be seated outside the restaurant a few cereals and cold croissants left had to fight to get a cup of coffee not much choice of food overall, location and spa are top quality beds are comfortable
436192,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, It was unfortunate the entire pool area was out of action while I was there I would have appreciated a heads up before arriving this being the main reason I booked this hotel over others in the area Restaurant food was reasonable variety nothing more than adequate however , Staff friendly Good location for ExCeL Rooms well laid out clean and comfortable Car Park views actually give a good view of the City of London 
436193,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Pool not avaliable , The pool was out of order which was one of the reasons why i chose the plaza in that area there was no offer of compensation for this which was a shame the couple next to us were given drinks vouchers because they complained but we were quitetly disappointed yet still the staff did not offer any form of good will gesture for this which was disappointing 
436194,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, as per my last review breakfast waiting staff hold on to your plates they do not ask but just whip your plate no security cam in hall ways one couple were trying to sleep in hallway hence would be good if lift only works from room key etc , had issues with next door room very loud after 12 at night staff dealt with issue promtly
436195,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Busy at breakfast with no organisation from staff , The building itself is very nice rooms are spacious and modern and the breakfast is good with quality items 
436196,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Rooms were small and bed was very uncomfortable staff were lazy Popped out to the shop late night and stood outside for over 5 minutes in the cold ringing the bell had to call reception and ask them to open door Car park was an additional 18 00 which I thought was very expensive In your room I had not even a complimentary bottle of water in the fridge bathroom was so small both myself and partner could not brush our teeth at the same time I wanted a room with a shower as I have a bad leg but the gave me a room with bathtub and shower in the bath tub which is difficult for me to climb into Very noisy the next morning which woke me and my partner before we were ready to get up due to maintenance work would not stay again Absolute waste of 145 00 for 1 night People can see u on the pool from the main road this hotel should be a 3star and a lot cheaper , smoking rooms was the only bounus
436197,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Smell of chlor all over the hotel Hot tub smelly and filled with chlor Not recommentable for children , Very nice and clean rooms Staff very friendly 
436198,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Didn t like pillows too hard Dirty tea cups Dirty hand towels The heavy figurine ornament isn t necessary in the bathroom directly above the toilet on a high shelf , Nice room
436199,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Nothing, Attentive and helpful staff Clean room and comfortable beds doonas were so warm Buffet breakfast was delicious Easy and close access to train station making it easy to get round london
436200,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, There was obviously work going on in the building which was extremely annoying Loud drilling from about 9 10am till about 3 5pm Annoying when you just want to have a lay in but it won t be there all the time The breakfast however was poor And this is such a noticeable point because this isn t the first time I ve stayed at a Crowne Plaza hotel but this was mostly dry overcooked items of an English Breakfast It was that bad Sausages and Bacon was okay though Everything else was awful Quality must improve here , The bed was comfortable as usual with a Crowne Plaza hotel The television was quality and a good size however I would have valued some smart TV capabilities The sofa in the room was a nice touch Facilities were clean and easy to use and this was especially apparent in the Bathroom Very very nice 
436201,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, We were going to Rod Stewart at The O2 for a 70th birthday present He was unwell so the concert was cancelled Be warned if you do not pay cancellation you are stuck we could not get a hotel refund so still had to go , The breakfast was very good with everything you could want Good location for the O2 The Emirates sky cable car was magical at night Lots of Resturants nearby and in the O2 
436202,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Very warm in the rooms temperature couldn t be adjusted In a non smoking room it smelled like someone has clearly smoked in there After mentioning it to the front desk nothing was done Room upgrade of 61 GPB was of no value just to get a king size bed I o 2 queens and 4 drinks in the minibar described as a full minibar Why is a king size bed 61 GBP extra night , Close to London city airport Breakfast was good too bad they didn t serve cappuccino or latte at 6am 
436203,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The staff could have been more welcoming on arrival I think the lady who checked us in on arrival was fairly new but apart from that 10 10, It was in such a good location the rooms and spa were lovely
436204,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Room too hot and then air con too noisy and had to keep asking for coffee at breakfast when waiters should come and offer , Really friendly staff room very well equipped Really good breakfast Loved the fact that you could get a cable car to the O2 from just outside the hotel 
436205,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Nothing, The hotel was great when we arrived we had a complimentary upgrade because it s christmas the gentlemen said Had room service when we first arrived food was lovely Used the pool facilities which were superb very clean Great location right by the emirates airline which we used to get to the o2 Would definitely return 
436206,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Would have liked a bigger bed next time will choose a room with a large bed, The beds were comfy pool was a good size and spa facilities were great Food was good too and the price of the hotel was a bargain 
436207,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Breakfast was very expensive I don t think that you should have to pay for parking if you are a guest at the hotel After an enjoyable evening out with my daughter we decided to have a quiet drink in the bar This was ruined by a young couple who frequently stay at the hotel The guy was loud a real show off he greeted the staff as if they were his mates bought shots for girls that were attending a christmas party in the hotel we decided to leave the bar in the end when the couple had a row which we could overhear , very clean tidy modern room with great sized comfy beds Great location for attending the O2 the Emirates Air Line cable car
436208,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Aeroplane noise from City airport take your ear plugs Difficult to find from tube more obvious signposting would be good, Very close to Excel Comfortable and clean
436209,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Nothing , The staff were amazing so professional and polite especially Ricardo it was my partners birthday and they made it extra special for him it was perfect 
436210,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Spa closed and no notification prior to arrival to warn of us this We only booked here for the spa USB chargers in room did not work Said had both robes in the room none in ours The staff were not very helpful breakfast was ok but very limited for vegetarians one morning was waiting for eggs to be cooked when returned to our table they had cleared all our stuff away saying they thought we had left no offer to replace our drinks etc either , Good location for access to the o2
436211,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, It was 134 for one night the breakfast on top would have been 19 each We have just been to Vienna Berlin and Copenhagen with equal hotel status the breakfast was 12euros extra each Why London The Ibis hotel nearer to excel was advertising their rooms for 95 , the vicinity near he excel and cable car 
436212,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The breakfast buffet was pretty boring it went through the motions but didn t excite The buildings interiors looked tired especially areas such as ground floor toilets with tiling joints filled with silicone Lift had broken tile on floor etc The bedrooms were fine but again no character a bit 90s The smell of the Spa pool tended to creep into the main reception, I liked it but didn t love it 
436213,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Nothing really if I had to be really picky it would be that the iron was rubbish but nota massive issue for me , The food was spot on the staff were lovely and I would definitely recommend this place for a quiet out of the centre hotel Loved the room and the blackout curtains were amazing no light let in meaning ideal for a lie in Very clean and tidy as you would of expected for this type of hotel Bonus feature of USB charger points and plenty of plug sockets Room service very swift and everyone wry helpful and polite 
436214,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Scrambled eggs were made from powdered pack and runny too I can t blame anyone but myself but I arrived with my credit card buried somewhere in a rucksack and they couldn t be flexible enough to let me stay but the bag was like a giant woman handbag full of stuff so I couldn t search it They did finally agree to let me cancel However booking com had ti agree to let me cancel I couldn t ring so wrote I m still waiting for an answer from you If something didn t go wrong with the email I m pretty annoyed with Booking com and might consider more direct bookings Please don t let me down like that I Booking com and am , Health Club Room extras Comfort View of ruver
436215,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, A few minor damage bits in the room didn t make it 100 perfect, Free upgrade on arrival to include breakfast and a very nice clean hotel Thoroughly recommended
436216,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, I was working around Liverpool street area and this hotel isn t as central for me as I would like , My room was a non smoking room but stank of cigarette smoke when I walked in The previous guest had been smoking out the window as there had been several cigarette butts stubbed on the window ledge The hotel did manage this extremely well and moved me to a new room with an upgrade Well done to them for turning a poor experience into a good one 
436217,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, We originally were attracted to the hotel for the facilities swimming pool etc However these were all out of order while making the whole first floor smell like chlorine This was not a be all end all situation but it would of been nice to have a complimentary something for such a selling point not to be of use , It was a great location for the O2 arena with the emirates cable cars just outside the doors that take you door to door the scenic route The rooms were lovely and the bar staff were great fun 
436218,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, If you ordered and paid for for extra breakfast items it took a very long time for them to arrive Some staff in the restaurant did not speak English very well which caused some confusion In addition I felt the quality of the food was not what I expect in this type of hotel , Great location if you are attending visiting the O2 arena The rooms are very nicely decorated and the beds are very comfortable 
436219,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The rooms of the hotel were smelling We changed rooms twice because a window was broken and cold air was coming inside The lounge bar in the hotel felt like a PUB and not a lounge at the hotel It smelled very strongly of beer The restaurant had not charm and was connected to the bar of the hotel which made it noisy Very disappointed for a Crown Plaza Hotel and very expensive for what I ve got , The location as I fly often from City Airport
436220,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Poor lighting in room for applying make up Couldn t reach any of the mirrors while drying hair Poor reception on TV Room wasnt cleaned all day then wanted to clean it at 4 30pm when we were back in it No late bar for residents Asked for a Thames side view didn t get one Wifi too slow Strong smell of chlorine in reception from pool , Breakfast
436221,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, We stayed here because we were going to the O2 It was an excellent location The Emirates cable cars are across the road which take you to the O2 Close to Stratford which was great for shopping Breakfast was very good Staff were very friendly and helpful Room was a fair size A great stay Would definitely recommend and will stay again 
436222,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, no nozzle on hairdryer minor thing wished we had time to use bar restaurant, Nice size room everything to hand especially chargers for mobile phones and enjoyed the pool jacuzzi The cable car nearby was an amazing experience to the 02 Had biscuits with our tea 
436223,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, We asked for a standard room and we re put in a disabled room with no bath We did speak to someone who said we d be able to switch for our second night Key cards were dodgy to enter the room even when we got a new one the door didn t want to open for a few minutes , Staff were really nice and seem like they would accommodate anything they could Super comfy bed and bedding Great location for the o2 a minutes walk to the DLR and Emirates Airline Tesco Express right next door if you ve forgotten anything 
436224,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The fact people passing by could see through to the pool window to you when your swimming or in the hot tub, How friendly the staff were Amazing facilities 
436225,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Check In was a long slow process Check out was even worse 20mins one customer in front of me service in the Bar was a joke it was not busy but again took a lot of waving to get served and then we were forgotten the free water in the room was not restocked over night I was left the 1 2 drunk one from my first night when I went to use the mini bar there is a note inside saying please ask for this to be stocked if you need it defeating the object at 3am when you need a cold glass of water or pop over priced hotel brand where customer service is low on the priority , location to the excel is fabulous especially after a long day in London breakfast and the gym is very good parking is ok if you time it correctly location to the emirates crossing is very good the restaurants at the O2 are very good note the sky train closes at 9 and a taxi back round is expensive if you miss the last flight 
436226,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, We were disappointed with service from the bar staff We wanted a coffee before retiring for the evening There were 4 members of staff on duty All of which ignored us Finally a man came over to where we re waiting and made a phone call rather than serve us A girl then asked what we wanted We replied two lattes please She told us the coffee machine was being cleaned and was therefore unable to make us a coffee We felt this was poor customer service , Great location for a gig at the 02
436227,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, We were staying for Rod Stewart concert at the O2 for my friend s 70th birthday present The concert was cancelled at the last minute due To Rod Stewart being ill We could not get our stay rescheduled or a refund so still had to stay at the hotel Which was an expensive mistake as we booked for 2 nights , The double twin beds were comfortable and large Fridge useful Tea and coffe making facilities Air con and window that opened 
436228,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The extractor fan in the bathroom did not work, Good spacious and quiet room Efficient and friendly staff on the front desk Delicious freshly cooked omlette for breakfast
436229,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, View could have been better Partial river view , Lovely warm pool Exceptional breakfast choice Gorgeous room bed extremely comfy with aqua accessories Relaxing stay after a busy week Very nice dinner couldn t fault it with friendly service 
436230,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The price has gone up and it was a lot for only a couple of nights It s still worth staying if you need somewhere with good quality and a good location , Really friendly and helpful staff great location and always a wonderful experience We stayed for Comicon and it was lovely to see the staff so enthusiastic and helpful 
436231,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Had to ask for additional Coffee and towels as they forgot that a Queen room might have more than one person in it , This is a great hotel for the O2 so easy to get to either by DLR or by Sky Way Good food comfort and friendly staff 
436232,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, It cost me 19 for 24hours parking using Booking com When I got there the reception said that Booking com shouldn t use this I had to park in the Victoria Multi Parking behind That cost me 15 for 24hour This was cheaper For 24 hours it cost me 19 via Booking com and then 15 yet again Please return 19 that Booking com ASAP ,No Positive
436233,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Room service menu could do with a re fresh hasn t changed in a long time, Very comfy rooms helpful staff great breakfast Thanks for making our anniversary extra special 
436234,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, Lovely service overall Members of staff were great Spa facility and treatment staffs also lovely Hotel room was clean bed was comfy everything required was in the room 
436235,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Can t really find a fault , This hotel is great for a weekend stay in London 35 mins from Oxford Street via the DLR and Tube The hotel itself is well run with comfortable rooms and a great breakfast We ll definitely be back 
436236,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Bacon a bit under cooked for our taste but apart from that couldn t fault our stay , Bed to sink into gorgeous Pool lovely and warm Breakfast had very tasty sausages and nice hot chocolate Room extremely good with lovely aqua accessories and best of all river view Looking forward to my stay next weekend It is ideal for the 02 
436237,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, We were a large group of ladies on a 30 year reunion The hotel lived up to our expectations The Crowne Plaza is in a lovely spot near the river with leisure facilities great bar fantastic rooms comfortable beds and a tasty hearty breakfast Best of all were the wonderful staff They helped me plan a great lunch celebration at the hotel and bent over backwards to cater for our every whim 10 10
436238,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The room for the offer price, What was offered on the booking com site and what was give were two different things If this was a 400 plus discounted to 155 then was nothe with it
436239,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The continental breakfast is lovely and lots of choice The hot breakfast has a good choice but when we went it wasn t piping hot , Great hotel Have stayed here before for concerts at The O2 and it has always been good Lovely rooms good location and really friendly helpful staff 
436240,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, staff not friendly u need to ask someone to help u with ur bags and u need to go with them and help them which is ridiculous in 4 stars hotel wifi wasn t working clients were suffering couldn t work properly mini bar is empty u need to ask to fill it which I was really surprised I hate every minute I stayed in this hotel awful , i didn t like anything in this hotel

436245,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, I had to re visit reception 4 times because my key card stopped working I know of at least 2 other guests who had the same problem Credit to one of the reception team who told me to call down from the corridor phone if it happened again they would come up with a replacement Breakfast over priced at 19 walk up or 11 pre booked, Bed pillows were very comfy which made for 2 great nights sleep All of the reception staff were very efficient friendly
436246,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The receptionists where rude on enterence I seemed to be rushed to my room we got a room without the bath that we requested so we changed room to one with a bath but it wasn t as it shows on the Internet also we only had one robe in the room it just seemed very unorganised a guy Came and dropped off thekey card for our new room and didn t say a word he came across very hostile I expect better from a hotel such as crown plaza , The breakfast service was amazing all the staff and chefs where friendly
436247,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Breakfast could be included in the price of the hotel stay but unfortunately isn t , we loved the location and the bed was super comfy The staff was also really friendly they upgraded us

436254,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Our bedroom door couldn t lock on the inside we have told reception so this should be fixed ASAP In the spin dryer in the spa changing rooms there were 2 nappies shoved in the dryer but this is a reflection of people who stayed there not the hotel Also there is not much around this hotel but that was not a problem for us as we did find a very nice Thai restaurant close by and we used the spa facilities at the hotel , Lovely relaxing spa excellent facilities Room was lovely very comfy beds fridge included Breakfast had a huge choice Hotel right near the station 
436255,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, I loved the room two spacious double beds in one room came very handy as we were 2 friends travelling with 1 child each The room had everything we needed and aircon was very good Pool is not very big but nice lovely breakfast too I loved the fact that this hotel is not too far from London attractions and transport yet still in a quiet and modern area Customer service was excellent throughout

436266,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, I was not impressed with breakfast food was ok when it finally came out I like the variety and the quality was nice too I just found the atmosphere poor and very hectic The staff were dashing about which I do understand being busy but every single person that I asked for something at breakfast looked at me as if I was bothering them Made me feel quite uncomfortable to ask for anything , The hotel was fantastic great location lovely comfortable bed and nice staff at reception especially the gentleman on concierge from 12pm onwards on the 1st October I would like to make a special mention to him and how very friendly and helpful he was 10 10 
436267,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, 3 tea bags only in room 1 hot chocolate 1 packet of biscuits which is a bit mean for 2 people had to ask for more Breakfast was very busy Limited choices No smoked salmon Not as good as we expected, Bed linen was good bathroom and towels all good
436268,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The fire alarm going off at 1am disturbed my sleep which resulted in me not getting a good rest and the expensive room service was pointless too since I had to go downstairs to pay by card after, The breakfast was really nice I also found the bed very comfortable

436271,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Paying cash but being told another 100 was needed as a deposit Not a single member of staff could give an explanation for this Then on checking out had to argue the return of the 100 as know knew it had been taken NEVER EVER AGAIN plus the tills went down wifi does not work in the rooms try of food from room service left in the corridors hours terrible, Leaving
436272,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Only criticism I could make was the revolving door in the entrance needed to be motorised Otherwise everything was lovely and would definitely come back again,No Positive
436273,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The breakfast was poorly run with people waiting around for food for 10 minutes There was also a Saturday night fire alarm when as soon as we got down to the lobby they told us to go back to our rooms , The hotel is very close by to the Royal Victoria tube one stop away to Charring street where you can change lines to access Bank North Greenwich for the O2 arena There is a Tesco extra next door to the hotel for all your amenities We treated ourselves to a massage which was a reasonable price at 38 The rooms were modern clean and spacious 
436274,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Only a suggestion a grab rail over the bath shower would be useful for people who are not disabled as such but could use some support getting in and out of the bath , Everything was really good

436285,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Ridiculous sum which is reserved on check in for any extras we arranged to have the minibar emptied prior to our visit Attentiveness also lacking with special requests Staff need to be trained in having eye contact with guests Could go pass a well manned reception desk a couple of mornings with no contact with staff On return to hotel nobody acknowledged us either Just felt impersonal No precence of senior management to give a little feedback Such a pity as location facilities are great I ve served the hospitality industry for over 20 years rarely have time ro take a family vacation so I am disappointed after paying a Good rate , Lovely breakfast variety especially the poached eggs 
436286,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, One night I couldn t sleep because of noisy residents who had checked in late at 0100 in the morning The manger apologized to me and gave me a 50 discount for that night , Location reception staff Though breakfast was limited yet Samantha makes it a special one for all guests 
436287,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, At breakfast the plates were cold and the buffet could have been hotter The tea offered was not freshly brewed which spoilt the meal, Very good room with plenty of space and located in the quiet area The meal in the evening was excellent

436300,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, I asked if I could check in between 12 1pm but my room was not ready until 2pm, The cleanliness of the hotel was brilliant and the rooms were very nicely laid out with plenty of space 
436301,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Large wedding and music could be heard all around the hotel until late or I fell asleep had a 04 00 start to my Sunday morning so maybe would be an issue should I want to stay in this area again I appreciate the hotel cannot help noisy guest returning to their rooms but being a wedding venue naturally allows this situation As I had an early start I was annoyed at myself for not considering and other hotels in the area appeared not to have this issue , Help and advice from the staff when required actually responded to email requesting additional information

436311,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Water babies class in the pool at 10am not what I was expecting when I went down for a quiet post breakfast pre checkout swim Would make much more sense to be at midday during checkout time Other than that 10 10 for hotel, Bar was fantastic slow service but completely worth it for the taste of the cocktails Room was immaculate loved the room loved the view definitely worth extra for view of the docklands
436312,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The ladies toilets provided in the reception area were a disgrace on both occasions they were visited Who knows where the cleaning staff were Abysmal , Some of the staff here are brilliant Samantha was exceptional full of fun and very helpful A great member of staff Breakfast was exceptional and all the serving staff deserve praise 
436313,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Staff at the reception were below expectations Welcoming was not friendly at all On saturday we called at midnight because of some loud noises other clients were making and they told us that they would look into it One hour later we had to go to reception because they hadn t solved anything and the solution was to hang in there because there was an ongoing party that was about to end Also disappointed with the car service they didn t provide us with any info and when we had to pay to the driver instead of a closed price at the hotel we found out he didn t take credit so we had to run to the nearest ATM , All the staff at the bar were great Jarson Adina Martin Joanna and all the others that I didn t learn your names sorry Also every day we had a different cookie and some chocolate in the room Loved those little details

436319,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The pool facilities were not staffed There were several children jumping and diving into the pool even though a notice forbids Plastic cups floated in the pool as kids had obtained them from a water machine This could have been easily solved by random checks by staff I reported this to the pool desk but the chap did not seem interested Complained by email and still issues not accepted or addressed such a shame , Location was very good with connections to central London Very good room 
436320,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The tea and coffee were not refilled in time for check in We upgraded our room on arrival however had to request the mini bar to be filled at 5 30pm after checking in at 9 30am It then took an hour to arrive Very disappointing , I would like to praise the concierge staff that day 2nd and 3rd July 2016 he was amazing It was a male member of staff with big hair very vibrant welcoming and gave us some fabulous tourist information A credit to your team and a pleasure to talk to

436330,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Found lots of hairs in the bath when we checked in and dust on sides One pack of biscuits by the kettle so we shared them one each very nice though Breakfast was very hectic we were not informed what we needed to do or how it worked eg help yourself but were deliver tea and coffee to table So was left to figure it out by asking others There was one brown sauce for the whole room that every time I got it it got whisked away and 2 tomato sauce which were both empty No sweeteners for my tea needed to ask 2 waiters and waited 15 minutes to get some Disappointed end to our holiday , OMG the beds were so comfortable and felt so fresh and clean The black out curtains make for an excellent nights sleep and didn t hear any other guests moving around Amazing nights sleep Wine glasses in room and small fridge plus bottles of water which came in very handy The facilities were lovely they provided you with towels to use in the pool Great for the O2 cable car across the river right into the car park no hassle Only took a jacket as weather forecast said no rain but it tipped down Lucky they had a spare umbrella borrowed for the evening

436334,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Sadly the spa facilities were terrible There were no towels available to us when we checked in And these were only provided after my wife asked the attendant to bring some to us as soon as possible which she did do The changing rooms were untidy and dirty There were wet dirty towels left on floor and bench Empty plastic cups half eaten food and general rubbish In the female changing the spin drier for swim wear was not working We both felt very self conscious as we had to go down 2 flights of stairs in our swim suit shorts and no towels for modesty Then there was back to back swim lessons in progress with a line of parents sat on chairs by the poolside the pool is very small staring at everyone The hot tub was great though , Perfect location for the O2 Our room was large and had a fantastic view over the Thames The complementary mini bar was a lovely surprise and we loved the availability of ice on each floor Our room was missing an extra towel and robe which I had to ask housekeeping for as she was servicing another room She was very helpful Check in out was a breeze Loved the late checkout of 12noon The hot tub in spa area was great Hot and powerful Breakfast was epic The choice was good but the clincher for my wife and me was that it was lovely and hot and eggs made fresh to your preference Excellent value for money Sadly lacking in the spa area 
436335,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Nothing I didn t like, Beautiful rooms and lovely views Staff were lovely and friendly and made us feel welcome we got bumped up to a king superior room with a view which was so awesome
436336,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Couldn t fault anything , On arrival we were presented with a refreshment whilst waiting to check in At checking in we were then upgraded to a better room with a river view The staff were so lovely Really great atmosphere 
436337,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The toilet handles In our room this did lead to a problem but it is how problems are dealt with Reported the problem and it was sorted whilst we were out Brilliant service Paying extra for disabled parking when the car is essential for your visit The hotel is near to the airport so you do have the noise of the planes However we were not aware of them through the night They did seem to stop around midnight or I slept through them and start again around 7 a m Not a problem for us though , The welcoming attitude of all the staff The reception staff smiled and the breakfast staff were excellent Everyone offered assistance My partner is disabled and the bedroom wet room and facilities were excellent Very spacious The in house staff made sure we had everything we needed in the room on the second morning coffee toiletries etc with a smile We ordered a car from the hotel to take us to the O2 and the driver did everything he could to get us as close to the entrance as possible If you have visited the O2 you will know that the walking distance to the entrance if you have mobility problems is horrendous We were very impressed with the hotel Some hotels could learn from this example What makes a good hotel the staff 
436338,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, As above Not customer care oriented staff, Very clean environment but people are not friendly enough even at the reception They lack training in customer care
436339,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, I booked myself and my three staff for a relaxing massage and mirning in the spa After our massages we went Fuentes to enjoy the pool sauna jacuzzi and sauna but were unable to do so due to screaming crying babies having swimming lessons mothers singing nursery rhymes and generally total chaos It was the most unpleasant disappointing experience in a hotel I will never stay there again despite the fantastic location to the excel where we were exhibitors Management were poor in their emai response stating that baby swimming lessons were displayed on their website If find is a total fob off and poor customer service For this reason I will refuce my entire hotel rating to zero out of ten The sign as you walk into the spa on the wall attached does not live up to its promise Also a general service charge of 12 5 is added to the bill in the Resturant I asked a waiter if the tips were split fairly and was third they all get split at the end of the month The previous month the waiter received 100 in total I refused to pay the service and tipped in cash How disgraceful to keep tips from your staff , Rooms were lovely breakfast was lovely

436359,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,No Negative, Lovely hotel the room had everything and more The buffet breakfast was excellent and there was lots of choice and the staff were helpful The only slight problem I encountered was that I asked for a very quiet room and the room they gave me was next to the lift as people early in he morning queued for the lift I was woken up other than that the stay was very comfortable and I would return 
436360,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, N A, The children were made very welcome A free upgrade so we looked out over the river view of the cable car and the O2 Warm milk and cookies at bedtime No height restriction on the carpark and we were able to leave our vehicle all day in this prime location for 16

436401,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, When booking room on this website I was given option to input any special requests for special occasions etc but this was not taken into consideration at all at the time of check in rather the focus of this encounter seemed to be to push the customer to pay to upgrade their room Although good breakfast options were available only minimal variation from day to day View of carpark from window forced to upgrade to have any better view Better upgrade offer from Booking com than when checking in and told I was being given a special price Not a smart tv so unable to cast or stream Gym entrance was on 1st floor and it was not possible to take lift directly up to your room but had to take lift down to ground floor and then back up again , Nice fresh breakfast Bed was comfortable and room clean Good size modern tv Usb wall plugs with an adaptor for device charging Fast wifi internet download speed only Good shower and clean bathroom Iron ironing board and hairdryer all found in room Reasonably sized pool with ok fitness facilities Small Tesco beside main entrance Close proximity to dlr

436409,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, The only tiny bad thing I could mention was being woken up at 4 15am by extremely noisy people outside the room but this was not the hotels fault However I would say that fitting door closers on all the doors would be helpful as u had to stop the doors from slamming every time u opened them , The location for our visit to the O2 was fantastic as it was a few mins walk to both the cable car and the tube The bed was extremely comfy The breakfast was amazing with such a huge choice you could have literally stuffed your face We would definitely stay there again

436412,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, We chose Crown Plaza because of its location and especially because it had a Spa The Spa area was smaller than I expected and the Sauna was located in the individual male and female changing rooms It would have been nice if this was where the other spa facilities were , We came for a short stay on our wedding day Our room was upgraded and was nicely decorated to welcome us as newly weds This was lovely It just about had a view over the river and you could see the cable cars too Our breakfast was lovely with plenty of choice

436430,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, Initially put in a room with a walk in shower so not a great start But they did make up for it with a free upgrade to king Size room However we did have issues getting into the room with the electronic cards Once that was sorted the rest of the experience was enjoyable , Great location very close to the 02 Accessible via the Emirates Air Line which was also a pleasant experience

436448,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, the mens changing rooms on first floor should have regular inspections to ensure no towels etc are left lying around my room could have done with a little more lighting that is all the fault I could find over two days , basically I liked more or less everything and it is very hard to identify any real faults Ordered room service which was uber quick good pool and facilities and very attendant and friendly staff that made for a very good two night stay Very close to the DLR so travelling easy one change 20 min journey to embankment is not an issue Stayed at other hotels in the same area but will choose this hotel in the future PS Twin double bed rooms are lush

436477,Crowne Plaza London Docklands, On our first night we thought we would eat in the Bar Grill We were slightly disappointed with the menu and it did lack atmosphere in the bar I am sorry to admit we did go elsewhere to eat The shower was just ok for the quality of the hotel and the bedroom the shower did not live upto the standard , The purpose of our stay was to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary When we arrived our room had been upgraded to a room with a view On entering the room it had been decorated with towel swans on the bed and red roses and rose petals We also had a card congratulating us on our Anniversary and wishing us many more happy years together Such a lovely thing for the Hotel to do The staff were all very polite and friendly Breakfast was perfect too We would most certainly stay at the hotel again and also recommend to friends and family
