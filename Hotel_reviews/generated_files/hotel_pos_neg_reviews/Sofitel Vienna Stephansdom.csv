418203,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, You can easily walk to the main streets of Vienna but location wise I would say the hotels situated at the ring are more beneficial The shower area is nice and modern but water tends to splash all over a barrier between the booth and the sinks would be nice Air conditioner control in our room was a little odd as we had to push the on off button many times to make it function in a way we wanted , Sofitel Vienna is surely the kind of hotel that one could remember clearly among numerous lodgings in countless cities one travel to The architecture of the building design and layout of the rooms and the views of the city were very well put together Staff at the lounge on the top were very attentive and the breakfast was spread out in a delicate sophisticated way that meets the standard of other design merits of this hotel The taste was of course wonderfull too Just wish I had more nights to stay at this hotel 
418204,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, Some of the furniture in the room a little ragged and worse for wear chair arm corners worn away and some cabinets badly scratched and scuffed More wear and tear and choice of fabric for the furniture really But very clean otherwise , Interiors well designed and living quarters spacious Wonderful views over Vienna from the room Very comfortable beds as expected from a Sofitel nowadays Thoughtful and very useful free minibar that is restocked daily Conveniently enough located to the old town tourist bus stops and also a good Billa supermarket just around the corner 
418205,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, can t say it s big room or luxury room for the price , Very nice hotel at a great spot Nice view and exceptional stuff make this hotel my choice for also my next trip The beds are superb 
418206,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom,No Negative, Victor and Marlene helped us so much since our last hotel left one of our bags at the concierge and they drove to pick up our bag so that we could have it before our flight Also Claudia from the front desk was so helpful to us during our stay with directions and recommendations of things to do All the staff were extremely nice and always had a nice demeanor Very respectful and with a smile The hotel really aims to please their guests The room was great It was the grey room and the modern decor is very cool We had complimentary drinks in the mini bar that they restocked every day and the front desk also gave us cold water bottles before we left When we told them we needed to get to the airport by a certain time they ordered the taxi and had it loaded with our bags in advance so when we came back from our walk everything was packed and ready to go We will definitely come back to the Sofitel 
418207,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, I think the price is a bit high it could be less because even it don t include the breakfast The elevator takes long time , I like the room design it was all white and the most beautiful thing in the room was the view from the big window it was amazing The concierge was helpful The location was great few minutes walk to the shopping area and the place 
418208,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, the room was clean but checking the furniture lots of scratches of the wall paint the closet The location was not optimum since you need to walk for about 10 to 15 minutes till you reach the central area with chops and restaurants Other wise was good Its good if you want a place away from the crowd , comfort bed
418209,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom,No Negative, Simply perfect the athmosphere the location the view from the room the breakfast the staff It is a hotel where everybody really would like you to enjoy every moment of your time It was an unusual hot day when we checked out and the staff has prepared 2 bottles of mineral water into our car there is no need for furhter words 
418210,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, We ate breakfast out each day as the cost of the hotel breakfast seemed excessive , Loved the white room well designed with plenty of cupboards drawer space Had to ask for more hangers and housekeeping were straight on to it and charming with it Really comfortable bed Went to the restaurant one evening which was a great experience if a bit expensive We walked everywhere which was easy from the hotel 
418211,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom,No Negative, This hotel is a must Our room was large and ultra contemporary The restaurant upstairs was fabulous Food excellent and floor to ceiling Glass windows that like to see all of the Glass windows that let you see all of Vienna The location was close to everything My son and I both loved it 
418212,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom,No Negative, The hotel is well located within easy walking distance of the main city centre On arrival the staff were welcoming and we got our favourite room with a city view Cocktails in the Sky Bar are a must with Rene the friendly mixologist The rooms are spacious bed comfortable with a large bath and shower area with Hermes products The icing on the cake was the nice touch on departure when our car was brought up by the valet with complimentary water bottles sweets and a hand written note wishing us a speedy return This is not our first stay here over the years and it is refreshing to see that the standards have been maintained Finally the concierge provided us with good advice for our stay 
418213,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, To much white everywhere I would like to see some art inside this minimal design rooms Some of the white furnishing looks dirty becoase of the painting , Quiet and nice room Bed comfort was A1 The room was very clean I like also the 24h open gym and jakuzzi I like the roof restaurant view but dosent like the menu selection I didnt enjoy it Relativly expensive but not so tasty we have a dinner for 3 pax 
418214,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, average welness its just huge area there is only one small sauna made of low quality material floor was really burning steam a and two small jacuzzi realy very poor fitness one strange room with few cardio machines, nice design bed was perfect nice view
418215,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, They have central heathing cooling system that couldn t really be adjusted from the room nor by their staff as we actually asked them so overall it was pretty cold in the room , Breakfast was very nice with great views 
418216,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, On arrival the staff were not particularly welcoming and the friendliness did not improve during our stay While the view from the upstairs restaurant and bar is impressive we consider the prices to be unreasonably high for what is on offer which made us as hotel guests less inclined to spend time there Especially since there are places of equal stature providing better hospitality and value for money elsewhere in the city , We had a fantastic view The room was spacious and well designed The beds are extremely comfortable 
418217,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, Check in was a disaster We arrived at around 1pm and somewhat understandably were asked to have coffee while our room was cleaned 90min later after a mediocre lunch we were told they d just begun cleaning we didn t get into our room until 3 30pm Not great Manager tried to be helpful but in the end couldn t do much Next day breakfast at The Loft was decent but staff was unhelpful Asked one question to a waitress about the food being offered and the response was I kid you not I don t know and she promptly walked away The thermostat did not seem to be working and when we informed front desk they sent someone up who pressed the buttons and told us it wasn t working but did not know how to fix it Essentially telling us what we already knew The operation of a thermostat isn t exactly rocket science The king bed was essentially two twin beds pushed together with a mattress topper It was lumpy and uncomfortable but maybe you prefer super soft mattresses We do not , Room is very clean and it is a 20min walk to all the main tourist areas Having a restaurant on site was convenient on rainy days when we couldn t go out to look for places to eat 
418218,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, They put 2 beds together to make 1 king bed size It was expensive The internet was slow The black room does not seem good as in the pictures , The staff and the location are very good 
418219,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, Nothing , The room was very modern and very cleverly laid out with mirrors in the right place sliding shutters instead of curtains lots of space a very comfortable bed and a panorama of Vienna only surpassed by the restaurant a few floors up 
418220,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, It was so nice to stay in the hotel I didn t even wanna go outside for sightseeing , Everything is perfect Nice staffs nice room nice cleaning nice location Worth the price 
418221,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, All in all good but a little impersonal check in process but very nice check out Breakfast is very expensive if not included in the price but is excellent , Bed and bathroom excellent and the view from the breakfast room alone worth a stay 
418222,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, nothing, everything amazing big rooms superb beds rainshower and bath free nescafe and beverages Excelent restaurant and bar at the rooftop with amazing view at Vienna
418223,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, Husband and I had a babysitter watch our baby for two hours during dinner time who was booked through the hotel The babysitter asked for us to pay for her taxi even though we arrived an hour before we agreed would be the time to pay taxi service as well Not a big deal but the miscommunication was strange , The room was just like in the pictures beautiful and always clean The staff were so happy to help at all times 
418224,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom,No Negative, The hotel was fantastic and the location perfect The staff were absolutely amazing and very helpful thank you Sophie for the Vienna city map and how to get about the lovely city 
418225,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom,No Negative, Liked the fact that we could walk to most places of interest Trains were convenient Jazz clubs were close by and amazing coffee shops to pop into for a quick warm up 
418226,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, It was too cold to walk anywhere and enjoy the location not the fault of the hotel just something to consider , The view is second to none perfect for a luxurious getaway 
418227,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, The 2 single beds put together to make one large bed was a little annoying as they kept moving around and creating a gap in the middle of the bed The room service food was average but pricey , The room view service and location We were travelling around Europe on our honeymoon and this was definitely one of my favourite hotels 
418228,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, Room is decorated in a stark white which shows off the wear and tear TV was not functioning properly strange light switch situation , Hotel property itself was very nice great staff and Das Loft is a very cool place to grab a cocktail Nice to have drinks provided everyday in the mini bar free of charge 
418229,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, The hotel is overpriced for the facilities it provides It is not possible to eat or have a casual drink in the hotel in the evening as all the tables are prebooked Reserved tables are empty but unavailable which is very frustrating even at breakfast , Excellent location
418230,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, The one bad experience we had was at breakfast which we didn t have included but we tried it one morning My husband ordered the scrambled egg whites When his eggs arrived they brought regular eggs No problem I called the waitress and pointed out the error She gave me attitude and brought out the correct order However as my husband took a bite of his dish there was a long hair hanging from his fork When I called the manager over and explained firstly and attitude of the waitress and secondly the hair incident he didn t apologize All he asked was if we wanted it redone No of course not Appetite was all gone Then I had to even ask them to remove it from the bill Pour customer service and attitude completely uncalled for in a top rated restaurant , We loved the view and bar on the top floor The rooms are stylish and comfortable superior queen While we didn t use it the spa looked amazing and the neighborhood has some cute restaurants We dined at cafe ansari a couple times and the coffee at Balthasar is amazing 
418231,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom,No Negative, Really friendly and helpful staff amazing food good spa facilities Had an amazing room with city view that I just upgraded on place as it got free 
418232,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, The gym is extremely small an investment is required to have some basic equipment as it is now it would have been better not too offer ti customers at all rather then disappoint them, Excellent design of rooms and hotel overall plus great stuff
418233,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, Some furniture in the room would need a renovation , Breakfast is really fantastic The staff is friendly and attentive Amazing view In the room we had the surprise as a bottle of champagne 
418234,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, Restaurant very busy for dinner Hard to get a table Difficult to go too far for food after a long business day Would be nice if a few tables were available for hotel guests at short notice , Nice location Friendly staff Excellent breakfast Amazing bar with great views Concierge staff wonderful in their recommendations and dinner bookings Will definitely come back 
418235,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, after 1 day you have to pay for wifi , Fantastic glass walled restaurant bar on the 18th floor great breakfast wecoming drink at the bar excellent staff super location
418236,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, I found it very dark everywhere To much black and glass you were having to watch where you were walking You could not read the menu in the restaurant the lighting was very poor in hotel, I loved the room with the stunning views from the 12th floor Also a beautiful view at night from the restaurant on the 18th 
418237,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, breakfast is expensive there were scratches on a number of the surfaces and couple cabinet door were broken, Good location Close walking distance to shopping and government easy access to subway bus train station and airport train comfortable beds quiet conditioner interesting modern design complimentary water and juice every day amazing view over downtown all staff speak English
418238,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, Expensive parking 30 euros per night Chair in room had some black stains, Location Bed was really comfortable Staff were nice and very helpful Clean bath
418239,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, Their concierge parked our car in the garage and scratch it We talked with hotel manager and asked for video record of garage because we were 100 sure it happened there but he said that their concierge could not do that and that only he can look at the video not us only if we have police warrant we can see the video Guess what his answer was that he saw the video and that it us not their fault at all Before taking Your car from them make sure You take a good look if it has any scratch ,No Positive
418240,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, The bath could be more comfortable for your head but this is only a minor issue What other hotel has a fantastic view of Vienna whilst having a shower or bath , We rang the hotel the day before to confirm our booking and to ask if we could store our bags before check in This was no problem The next day at 8am we arrived to the hotel expecting not to be able to go to our room until check in time but to our surprise the staff behind the counter warmly welcomed us and stated we have been complementary upgraded with our room to the 17th floor This room was overlooking the Chapel and the room is ready now The room is perfect and we would definitely recommend staying here 
418241,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, The arm chair in the room should be changed it had some wear and tear and was not white anymore which did not fit with rest of the decor , Cool architecture and design Rooms were very modern and WHITE Great bath tub and Hermes amenities Beautiful bar with amazing views Very crispy 
418242,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, , The staff was very friendly helpful and always looking to make our stay relaxing The hotel is situated perfectly to visit Vienna s top places The view from the bar on the top of the hotel is unbeatable but also the view from the junior suite In particular the concierge Wolfgang was helpful when reserving tickets when every other person told us there is no possibility to acquire such tickets Thank you again Wolfgang that was great 
418243,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom,No Negative, Stunning place to stay The room was beautiful with a stunning view out over Vienna The staff were very friendly and out to help The breakfast in Da Loft was delicious 
418244,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, Pretentious staff not all disrespectful Weak Wifi Bad communication with guests , Nice Spa and good sized room Fantastic breakfast with a great view 
418245,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, Poor Service in the 18 rooftop bar Rooms like staying in a grey cardboard box Not particularly clean but probably due to the finish on the surfaces as opposed to the cleaning staff , Excellent reception staff Great Location Wonderful views Clean comfortable beds Clean fluffy towels Nespresso machine and coffee tea fridge with water and juice in room 
418246,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, The slope at the shower is not steep enough to drain the water , The breakfast on the top floor was the perfect start of the day One thing worth mentioned about this hotel is their staff All the staff are super attentive and friendly 
418247,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, I felt whitelether furnishings chair and armchair should hv been replaced long before now White was grey and leather picked off at edges, Food v good staff v attentive and friendly room v well cleaned bed super comfortable
418248,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, Ok but frankly could have been better Several small things spoil the picture Restaurant on the top floor is worth to visit but EUR 32 for breakfast if payable on spot is not really value for money ,No Positive
418249,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, On check in the receptionist did a really hard sell on us upgrading to a suite for an extra 150 per night at which point I nearly walked out Rooms are very cold and austere the lighting is very very poor It s a cold businesslike hotel and isn t geared up to leisure travelers who want to relax and enjoy beautiful Vienna , The location of the hotel is perfect and the view from the rooms is the reason to book this hotel 
418250,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, Didn t get to try breakfast because it was 36 per person , Staff were fantastic catering to every request at any time of the day or night Very well located just across the bridge from Schwedenplatz underground and the main shopping strip leading to Stephansplatz In room design and facilities were world class and amazing view over Stephansdom 
418251,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, Its not cheap Expect to pay dearly for extras eg parking is 30 euros per day if you want butter with your breakfast it s 3 euros Also they re guilty of one pet peeve of mine which is that they don t tell you the prices for lots of things in advance I can t fault them for this too much though as the client that they re targeting probably doesn t care about these incidentals too much , Amazing hotel architecture and interiors really are something special All services are 5 star The bar at the top is absolutely incredible and the food served there is top notch 
418252,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, We got a nice corner room which was a bit to sterile no decoration no carpets with more that a bit ab used furniture This style is really easy to clean but time and previous guests left many wounds on all surfaces Windows covers movable woody surfaces are very fancy and a good solution to spare curtains but they should have grips to be moved one of ours was broken and don t replaced since long time we could appreciate all fingerprints on the surface left from people who were trying to move the surface to be open or closed as we did too Standing lamps are of cheap quality and had suffered from many injuries due to easy falling down We spend Christmas Eave with a dinner arranged by the Loft restaurant 185 per person Terrible overpriced and not really good Pigeon was so skinny that we could only lick bones really not good choice And we needed to ask every time for a few drops of wine we paid for Travelling a lot around the world we were a bit disappointed with the above issues , Excellent located modern facility with phenomenal view of the city Great breakfast Excellent staff in the reception very professional concierge team Loft restaurant and bar is a must to visit and spent some time looking at Vienna in friendly atmosphere and decent good arranged DJ music cave drink prices If you would like to be out of the crowd and everywhere in 5 10 minutes walking distance this is the place to stay in Vienna 
418253,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, The price for breakfast is pretty steep considering the selection Minor problems with tv set it wasn t working the last evening but we did not really need it anyways , Fantastic view from the room at the 14th floor and from the top floor restaurant Very modern spacious and clean room Bathroom has both a bath tub and a separate shower cabin 
418254,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, Nothing, Hotel is the wrong word for Sofitel Wien this is a building to celebrate modern architecture From the magically aircon perfumed entrance hall through the sheets iof sandblasted glass most of the walls in the hotel through the color scheme and the delicacy and mnimalism of the room desgn and finally the 18th floor panorama i will return 
418255,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, Breakfast variety was not as expected though quality was impeccable, Great location with an amazing view The restaurant on the top floor is amazing at day and especially at night 
418256,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, Breakfast was great yet a bit overpriced in my opinion slow wifi connection , Kind welcoming and Helpfull staff great breakfast excellent location very clean 
418257,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, I felt let down by the hotel Definitely for the price it offered very little No swimming pool just a jacuzzi which is open after 10 am The steam room was smelly Smell was something like fatty food Was really unpleasant Most spas and steams room rooms smell of eucalyptus or essential oils , The bar has an amazing view 
418258,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, they took 5 euros to bring up a bucket of ice usuly i tip 3 10 euro but to take it as a mandatory, the architecture jean nouvel has done a magnificant job
418259,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, Nothing, The location was stunning with beautiful views over the Danube and across the city Our room was huge and luxurious The staff were friendly and accommodating We had three fantastic nights at this lovely hotel and would definitely recommend it to anyone 
418260,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, The white room lacks warmth in design It s beautiful just too white , Courteous pleasant staff Perfect location for solo travelers who would like to explore the city 20 minute walk from the Museums and there is a train station just across the street that I used to see the Schonbrunn palace 
418261,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, The room is a little bit too WHITE and we can feel the lack of warmth of the place Breakfast is not at the level of the hotel , we had lunch there It was really good 
418262,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, The AC broke down and they were not able to get it fixed after a few trials Finally offered to change the room for us but only after one night without AC , The staffs were friendly good Eames shampoo and convenient location 
418263,Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom, For the 5 days of our stay we stayed in the White room Suite The electricity of the entire room kept on turning on by itself at 3 am in the morning The electrician claimed to have resolved the issue by the 3rd day but alas the last 2 nights were as horrible as the first 3 Their room service poor choices and way too salty for anyone s taste They ended up only cutting 60 Euros from our bill for a horrendous Sofitel Experience Utterly disappointing for this hotel to be claiming its 5 star rank among those in Vienna , The view from the 18th floor restaurant was absolutely breathtaking and spectacular The food in the restaurant is incredible and should always be the highlight of your stay We ordered the crackling pig and the lemon lobster risotto The best I have ever had
