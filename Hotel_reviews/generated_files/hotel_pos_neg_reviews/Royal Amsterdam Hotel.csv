427742,Royal Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, Location was very convenient to all Amsterdam attractions and most a 20 minute walk away The windows have double glazing so the noise from the Rembrandt Square at night was minimal The room clean and well maintained every day The staff were outstanding and went out of their way to make my stay perfect and answer my questions as a solo traveller 
427743,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, Air conditioning didn t work very well so the room was very hot at night and we were asked to leave a 100 deposit when we checked in to cover any damages which we weren t warned about before we arrived We understood why they asked for it though and were happy to pay it but a heads up at the time of booking the hotel would have been appreciated Not sure if this is an issue for booking com itself , Overall we were pleased with the service we arrived early and they took our bags before 2pm check in and they informed us of the restaurant discount in advance We had booked a twin room but they turned it into a double room for us and they brought us some milk for the room even though they don t normally provide it us Brits need our tea Excellent location plenty of places to eat and drink nearby Food in the restaurant was lovely too hige portions and very tasty 
427744,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, The cost of the breakfast we ate out every morning as didn t want to spend 13 for it ever morning , The staff were happy to book the Madam restaurant for us as I couldn t access the Internet to do it and tried to book Ann Franks for us unfortunately we couldn t get booked in but both times the receptionists were very helpful Nothing was a problem 
427745,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, The room was terribly small I m not usually one to moan about a small room especially in Amsterdam where the buildings are very narrow by nature so you have to expect some degree of closeness but this was way beyond that The room we stayed in for a very expensive 240 per night was the size of a utility cupboard from back home The bed barely fit You had 2foot of space at the side of the bed you had to squeeze down and then shimmy across to your side on Very claustrophobic feeling Not worth 240 per night Towards the end of our trip we stayed in a budget hotel for 70 euros per night which was triple the size room wise , Staff were very friendly very helpful and welcoming Location was really good right in the corner of Rebrant square which was a real sun trap for having lunch downstairs Tram stop right outside of which you can get a tram very easily to any part of Amsterdam 
427746,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, The breakfast wasn t great the food often looked stale and not appetising Coffee only from a machine Because the breakfast area is also used as a bar it felt sticky and dirty , The staff were friendly and super helpful at all times Beds comfortable and room clean 
427747,Royal Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, Room was extremely small it was difficult to find a place to put my samll size of suitcase on the floor and there was NOTHING as equipment Even not a place to hang your clothes Staff is not very friendly either 
427748,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, For the money we paid to stay here for one night in the smallest room possible and no balcony we should have gone elsewhere And the credit card which was used to pay for this was presented as requested but still we were unable to use it as the person whose name it was in my wife who paid for this for us was not present The card was but not my wife Even worse on check out we overheard a poor traveller being denied his booking simply because he had to replace his card with a new one as the strip had worn out Very disappointed and will not stay here again , NOt very much sadly 
427749,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, The bed was not comfortable for two persons and we were having room service the first night and not the second one the man in the reception said it was not possible even the other workers told us it was possible the room service the first night was very good and very good location ,No Positive
427750,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, The shower being directly in the room and the doors were not opaque Rubbish on the roof top directly outside the window , The bed was very comfortable 
427751,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, The rooms are tiny and especially the bathrooms Sliding door between bathroom and the room is not very smart with regards to noice There is practically NO reception area the reception is a 1 m2 booth in the end of a narrow corridor that s all Not a 4 start hotel at all The best description is modern standard but extremely tiny , The staff is very friendly polite and serviceminded and the location is very central Technical standard of bathroom is good 
427752,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, Rooms are too small and windows are not isolated so you ear all noises from the square even at late hours, Middle of Amsterdam and very clean Style is very modern
427753,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, There was no minibar in the room This is a real pity for guest s comfort and for their revenues There was no desk telephone was on a leather pouf Soaps in the bathroom are too small in quantity we were 3 people Reception staff is very professional and well prepared but not that smiley friendly attitude I didn t feel I was given a warm welcome but just a very professional one , Location is definitely excellent Room was really clean Very good shower Its Bar Restaurant is pretty nice stylish and welcoming I enjoyed the ashtray on the balcony fantastic balcony 
427754,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, Room was quite small but very clean with great location , The staff at reception were extremely helpful and friendly Location was fantastic We had a room with a balcony that we loved Only negative was the room was small

427756,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, Small room bit tatty , Very central location with loads of places to eat drink smoke All major sights are in walking distance Staff are very friendly helpful 
427757,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, Minimal toiletries room is basic and small but comfortable enough , The best thing about this hotel is the location You can literally walk to most of the main attractions from the hotel The hotel is right by Rembrandt square where you can find lots of restaurants bars etc Comfortable bed Breakfast is fair Friendly staff 
427758,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, Very small room beds positioned uncomfortably 2 singles pushed together in a corner so hard to get in out for the one sleeping against the wall and mattress too soft Although staff very friendly 3 out of 4 don t speak any Dutch which is kinda strange when you re working in a Dutch hotel , Friendly staff nice environment 
427759,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, The room was to small I knew it would be small but small isn t the right word it is tiny The room was clean on the surface but not under the bed, Location is great Staff is friendly Breakfast was good and the restaurant also good

427761,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, It took 20 minutes to check in in the middle of the night don t know why this had to take so long Hairs in the bed unflushed toilet no coffee bottle of water in the room , Great Location Small room comfortable bed 
427762,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, Staff were terrible We didn t pre pay and accidentally ticked the breakfast option on booking com we advised the hotel at check in who made us feel like it was a big problem but will be sorted They made us pay a bond for our time in the hotel On check out they deducted the breakfasts costs from the bond which we never ate during our stay We felt robbed The staff were very rude and very unhelpful Be warned, Location was the only positive
427763,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, The small room is very small It s enough for a single person at most , Tasty breakfast clean and nicely furnished room helpful and polite staff perfect location
427764,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, I paid 750 euros for balcony room New Year s Eve price was a disgrace for how small my room was beds were really uncomfortable couldn t swing a cat in the room if you know what that means had no sleep through noise nye as hotel had a party which I didn t complain about but I did leave do not disturb on the door for the cleaner MALE to walk in my room 9 00am shouting house keeping Lift was also tiny and got blocked by cleaning trolly ended up taking the stairs don t think this is a 4 star hotel wouldn t return for the price really steep room does not even hav a mini bar or a iron never before experienced this in a 4 star Television also really rubbish photos are below,No Positive
427765,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, at the check out day the receptionist called our room once at 11 20 am at that time we were sleeping because of the new year eve she told us that we have to check out in 10 minutes or we have to pay 50 euros I moved from the bed and closed our luggage and we were in the reception to check out at 11 32 She said pay the 50 euro or i ll call the police so rude very very small rooms I booked a standard room but they gave me a better room and forced me to pay extra charge or wait 3 more our I travel every where monthly and I didn t write any review about any other hotels but the bad treatment makes me write about that bad experience , good location
427766,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, The room was tiny, The staff especially the Italian receptionist Helena She is extremely helpful and a pleasure to deal with the best customer service I ve experienced in a hotel so far 
427767,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, Take the bigger room the little room is tooo small for two people other than that the hotel is a boutique hotel beautiful wonderful bed wonderful staff I would go back there ,No Positive
427768,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, Shower spilled into the bathroom area rooms were a bit small, Location was perfect Eliza staff was very friendly helpful in planning our 48 hours in Amsterdam Rooms are very small definitely not sound proof but we were more interested in sight seeing not hanging out in a room all day We found the staff to be more than accommodating filled our every request with a sincere smile If you re looking for easy access to the tram it s the perfect place to be Hotel is in Rembrandt park approximately 3 4 of a mile from Centraal station with a short tram ride to all areas of interest Final thoughts amazing value for its location Would definitely recommend return to this hotel Thank you again for a lovely stay 
427769,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, Walls are paper thin You could hear people in the room next door and in the hallway So people coming in after 3am could be heard , Staff were friendly and helpful 
427770,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, The room was so small that I couldnt walk around the bed and had to crawl on the floor to get to a powerpoint to charge a phone Not a double room The shuttle bus that I was told would take me from Airport to hotel was not available I had to hire a taxi When I enquired at the hotel about the shuttle bus to the airport I was informed that the hotel do not sybscribe to the shuttle bus service , Comfortable bed Very clean Staff friendly 
427771,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, Restaurant was swarming with mice have photos to prove My room was dirty when I arrive and I found someone had been using drugs there before I came and couldn t be bothered to clean up the evidence, Nothing
427772,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, The square outside is busy around the clock and the rooms are not sound isolated I did t sleep at all the first night and left the hotel although I prepaid for two nights Avoid this hotel ,No Positive
427773,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, The only thing we didn t like was the terribly offensive odour in the elevator and hallways The lobby and room were fine never any odour there But the rest of the hotel smelled like you had your face in a cat litter box It was BRUTAL at times Thankfully it never seemed to follow us to the room or linger on clothes But it was very strong any time we rode the elevator and in hallways near the stairs , The staff were incredible We arrived very early and our room wasn t ready But the front desk staff checked us in took care of our bags and sent us on our way to explore the city while our room was prepared When we got back our bags were upstairs waiting for us in a small but lovely room It was recently renovated so it s very modern great furniture and a beautiful bathroom The bed was super comfy and being one of the few rooms with a balcony in Amsterdam we had an incredible private outdoor place to sit and watch the square below Among our favourite hotels in the city without question We will be back for sure 
427774,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, The breakfast wasn t particularly inspiring it would have been nice to have a decent coffee The room was very small but of a good quality I think it must be the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in , Great position friendly staff clean rooms The staff were very helpful when we asked for local information Even though this hotel was on a very busy square with lots of nightlife our room was very quiet we didn t hear a thing We had a great nights sleep on some very comfy beds 
427775,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, I had a bad night due to the leakage in the hotel AC and entire entrance of my room had water and I had to use the bucket to limit water spreading in my room over the night This was a bad experience since I couldn t sleep Hotel did offer me for free lunch and dinner with including guest , Staff is very friendly and takes steps to resolve the issues Special mention of the Front Desk staff Elena as she takes care of the guests very well 
427776,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, it is a room for hobbits No space to move or sit anywhere the bed is for hobbits too Payed 220eu for 1 night but there were no much options on saturday night , it was perfectly clean
427777,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, A little narrow building so hallways are a bit small Rooms are fine though Mine was lacking a working station but didn t bother me that much , Right on Rembrandt square you are close to many locations on foot Helpful staff clean tidy and with good wifi Breakfast adequate I will choose it again
427778,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, The room has only bed and narrow paths to Access it This is crazy It is in a central place but if you are double in this room then you just get mad There is no chair no table nothing but only bed , The equipments are quality brands phone cisco dryer aliseo That s all 
427779,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, We booked the cheapest room category and did not find a mini bar there when we came The receptionist told us that it is not included in standard room but she kindly offered us to put our food to the kitchen s fridge We accepted it, Very helpfull staff Good location
427780,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, Everything was great , It has an elevator It s a small one but reliable Great little smokie down the street Walkable to everywhere from Rembrandt Square We would recommend this very nice hotel and staff 
427781,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, The hotel is built on a very small area so the rooms are rather small The toilets and shower areas are rather narrow and restricted I couldn t find a socket to plug in my mobile charger The hotel is good for a business trip or a bunch of friends who will spend most of their time outside and come back to the room to sleep I thought it was a little bit expensive If you are a family of 2 parents and 3 restless kids or a couple looking for a luxurious few days then look elsewhere , Location is the biggest plus The hotel has the main Rambrandt square as its front yard Staff are very friendly Rooms were very clean Excellent location to experience the pulse of the city 
427782,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, No tea and coffee making facilities and I was made to pay for trip again with credit card for id When I had my passport as id Costing me an extra 30 for one night had already paid in full for group trip in January very annoyed , Bed was comfy

427790,Royal Amsterdam Hotel, The windows were very very bad isolated from wind and coldness I had the maximum tempriture on the heater but it doesn t help because the wind was intering from everywhere if the windows Solution change the windows with a three glass window with Argon gas inside slicone could be a cheap alternate You may put silcone around the windows ,No Positive
