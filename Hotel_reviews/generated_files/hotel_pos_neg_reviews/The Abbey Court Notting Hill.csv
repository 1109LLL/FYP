99237,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, The lock key to the room was not exactly up to date , Very nice big room with comfy beds and nice green view to the street room number 12 We liked the coffee tea facilities in the room and the bottles of water supplied every day Lovely breakfast room downstairs and lots of fresh fruit and berries Entrance to the hotel was closed and you had to ring the bell to enter This gave a feeling of security Nice and friendly staff Only a couple of minutes to the underground with 3 different lines The hotel was just around the corner from busy Notting Hill Gate yet still fairly quiet at night 
99238,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, The furniture in the room is shabby wallpaper wall to wall carpet and bath tub should also be renewed , Nearby underground station The hotel is located in a nice street 
99239,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, Lack of AC in the room , Perfect location close to the city center Within walking distance is everything Good and tasty breakfast and bar well equipped Staff professional and helpful with each demand 
99240,The Abbey Court Notting Hill,No Negative, Good firm bed Firm pillows Thick soft towels Very convenient location Subway two mins away Nice and Safe residential neighbourhood Close to heart of London 
99241,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, I was on the top floor where the shower water pressure wasn t great Also no lift which was fine for me but others may struggle , For a London hotel the room was lovely and spacious Very clean with added luxuries like trouser press and dressing gown 
99242,The Abbey Court Notting Hill,No Negative, Very cosy room and a bath wih golden taps good relaxing after a long day walking Breakfast with care Very short walk to the underground We had a lot of hotelrooms in London but this was the best 
99243,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, No lift and no help with very heavy suitcase I packed for 7 weeks of different weather so needed more than usual I did not buy the breakfast as it was too expensive and could get less food for less money elsewhere , It was hot at night I asked for just a sheet instead of the comforter which was way too hot Wonderful location
99244,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, As most of London expensive triple the budget we normally spend on accomodation which is a shame as we only use it to sleep TV had no signal Our room was next to the breakfast room so in the morning from 7 30 AM it could be noisy sometimes Hopwever very silent for the night , Very good room silent at night was below ground level Very friendly personnel 24 24h reception Neighbourhood with easy access to the centre via underground 
99245,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, No fault of the hotels as this is a period building there is no lift elevator so a few trips up and down the stairs We arrived by car on a Saturday and could part directly outside for an hour or so whilst we checked in and off loaded the luggage The car was then returned to the car hire depot , Excellent location just 50m to the Notting Hill Gate central line circle line stations so easy access to Regent St and the other main tourist attractions Close to Hyde Park Kensington Gardens Portobello Rd 20m bus ride to Camden Lock and the Stable Camden markets Room was very large for most hotels never mind London we had a large 4 poster bed and a sofa bed for 3 adults 1 child and an infant and never felt short of space We had a good morning routine where all 5 could be showered and ready to go out in less than 90 mins 
99246,The Abbey Court Notting Hill,No Negative, Location is AMAZING Could not be any better The staff were really nice the room was very clean and comfy The give you new cookies and water soda every day The water weren t always hot enough for a shower but we didn t try telling any one so they might have been able to fix it Will come back again 
99247,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, Room service , One of best hotelles I ve ever stayed at Very good memories and the staff are very friendly The general manager is very respectful and friendly man I had a quite brother brother talk with him Definitely this hotel is recommended 
99248,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, This establishment can in no way be considered anywhere near four star standard Tired dated shabby at best it s two star standard Charging the rates it does its a rip off ,No Positive
99249,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, No elevator which didn t matter for us but good to know Floors were creaky and so I was worried about disturbing others Double beds were two singles pushed together with a double sheet but therefore functioned like two single beds , We really enjoyed our stay Very friendly and helpful staff Beautiful building and nice rooms Great location It was really great to have a 24 7 reception 
99250,The Abbey Court Notting Hill,No Negative, 24 hour concierge Room was fantastic and very large Location was 2 minutes walk from the tube so perfect and lots around the area I was there for work so was perfect 
99251,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, Perhaps a few more drinking glasses in the room at least four as we brought some wine and had to ask in reception for glasses , We had the quad room with the four poster bed and sofa bed The room was large the bathroom very clean overall the room was very comfortable great for a group of three or four for a weekend break Location also AMAZING short walk to Portobello Road Notting Hill and Notting Hill Gate Tube station 
99252,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, quality of room room was dark and drafty in the cellar bathroom showed fungus in the wall tub old shabby and destroyed , site central location staff friendly and obliging
99253,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, My room was in 1 that should be mention in room type in pricelist while booking so there was no window view at all only pavement Room was dark Hotel is very viintage but in the bad way Waiter in hotel restaurant doesn t speak English Food for breakfast comes through laundry room , Great location 200 metres from Subway Central Line next to Portobello Road Market and other nice locations in Notting Hill but on nice and calm street
99254,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, Needs a refurbishment, Brilliant location as is a stones throw from Knotting Hill Gate My visit was purely to take part in the Royal Parks Half Marathon and fortunately I was alone as my wife would have taken half a step in to a room and ran straight back out Decor is dated as the property looks like it was last refurbished in 1920 With that said the sheets were clean and the jacuzzi bath tub was a nice touch especially after a long run Staff were very nice and for my purpose it was perfect
99255,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, It was probably great 10 years ago everything looked a bit tired and in need of new carpets painting and decorating, great locality the bed was comfy and clean loads of hot water the room had everything you need 
99256,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, Maybe it s just the state of middle priced b and bs but we were taken a bit aback by the overall worn and gentile shabbiness It seemed very clean but some new paint and rugs would go a long way , The staff were extremely warm and helpful and the location was superb quiet street and one block from tube and buses and bikes Beds were comfy This was one of the best small continental breakfast buffets we ve seen good food meticulously maintained and in a charming garden breakfast room on the lower level 
99257,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, Tired rooms and bathrooms Only four tables for breakfast no where near the number required for the amount of guests As they could not accommodate us so went elsewhere for breakfast , Location
99258,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, The classic style of the house is nice but some of the stuff needs to be renewed like the shower head and bathtub knobs It was quite warm in the room after a moderately warm 20C day despite sleeping with the window open and the fan that was already present and helped a lot No elevator but for us that was fine The beds were good and comfortable but not perfect a slightly better pillow would help a lot already For sure good value for money and we ll be back , Breakfast superb great choice all fresh fresh coffee and fruits toast continental or english breakfast in a super cool location in the basement back of the hotel Spacious room ask for one on forehand they differ in size with streetview Sound proof super friendly staff Location is perfect idyllic street in Notting Hill style and only meters yards away from Notting Hill Gate station 
99259,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, Room quite small Additional charges for cooked breakfast items not that it affected us , Breakfast times were good Staff friendly Service good Very central to where we wanted to be 
99260,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, Unfortunately due to the architecture in the area many hotels are converted townhouses The windows are all on the sides very close to the adjoinging buildings so no view Could be claustrophic But the rooms were comfortable if this isn t an issue for you , Xlnt location in Notting Hill Easy to get to Metro Station and walkable to many great areas Great food in many very close locations Good size room nice staff 
99261,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, Had a room at the front of the house with a street view which was great But Friday night noise on the street made sleep impossible , Great location in Notting Hill Felt like a B B on a residential street Comfortable room and beds Overall loved our stay here 
99262,The Abbey Court Notting Hill,No Negative, Excellent location right near with Tube station but in very quiet nice street 7 minutes to the big park 5 min from Portabllo market 1 station to the big shopping center Very cozy old style small hotel with very picturesque restaurant room it is nice to drink coffee in the morning 
99263,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, Doors very noisy when shutting due to heaviness The telephone style handpiece proved difficult to handle when showering the head so heavy it would not stay in an position on the wall , Breakfast was Fresh With A Nice Mix Of Foods Location great
99264,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, Holding the shower in the bath, Room abit dated but nice enough Bathroom small had to hold shower up in bath Breakfast was very nice staff were very friendly Good location to shops tube 
99265,The Abbey Court Notting Hill,No Negative, The location near the tube the friendly and helpful staff and the clean and relatively spacious room all combined to give us a relaxing break in London 
99266,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, 3 flights of stairs but that s unavoidable on the bright side good for a bit of exercise , Very civilised decor and the bathroom was very good All very clean The breakfast room and breakfast also very good
99267,The Abbey Court Notting Hill,No Negative, The location at the Nottinghill tube was great we were in London for our daughter s wedding so had non touristy needs eg taxis to suburbs men s hire shops hairdressers of course someone willing to take the happy parents photo The staff were accommodation at every pint at every moment Our granddaughter left parts of a Velcro book in the lounge which we were unaware of but the hotel staff have found them not only returns them to us but remembered the 3 yr olds name Personal service with a smile 
99268,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, If your e looking to have an easy time with wifi thermostat i e modern amenities etc this is not the place for you I was put in a lovely pretty room but it was in the basement never even thought to ask NOT to be put in a basement bc didn t know hotels had rooms here which was on the cold side and I then discovered there was no way to adjust the thermostat other than to put on a space heater i e no a c in this hotel and rooms can vary be stuffy or too cold Staff was helpful and attempted to move my room but the next room was worse too hot Also wifi in the basement was not reliable and this was frustrating as was the dark view outside I was initially moved to another room upstairs at my request which was stuffy temperature wise and the lack of a c was a problem Also the locks on the doors are not easy to maneuver old locks and keys which are cute but I got stuck in one of the first rooms I was given bc the door was old and broken , Great location in adorable notting hill quiet block attentive staff very well kept boutique hotel with an old world charm If they updated it a bit with more modern amenities new locks on doors a c etc it would be a real gem 
99269,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, No bad experience but room was depressing very old wallpaper peeling off walls holes in table cover by side of bed Lots of stairs to climb we were right at the top and no elevators Bed was uncomfortable and room was cold Staff bought up a heater said that heat would only come on when it was determined by a certain temperature outside and did not say what that was , Very courteous Staff and very accommodating

99273,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, Value for money is low but thats because the prices in London are too high on an average My room was placed in the cellar That was more or less ok but it could have been notified when ordered , Location is great and the girl at the desk was really nice and helpfull 
99274,The Abbey Court Notting Hill, The ceiling was too noisy to sleep well It should be due to the old floor in the upsteir room nevertheless it was too heavily noisy, Location we can get it by a coupe of mins walk from Notting Hill Gate underground station
