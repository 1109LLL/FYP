393918,Hotel Grums Barcelona,No Negative, Brilliant location close to metro and walking distance to the rambla We got a relatively spacious room Water bottles were provided daily Great breakfast buffet 
393919,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The rooms were not very clean there were hairs on the toilet seat on the floor some pieces of plastics stuck to the walls in the room etc I have put the do not disturb sign on the door but when I came back the cleaners had entered the room without paying attention to the sign and made our room still didn t clean it properly though The rooms were very basic view was not good at all I have asked the hotel to book a taxi for the airport and the taxi has added 10Euro to the amount on the meter and said when the hotel calls us we add this charge I think the hotel should have mentioned that to me , Location was good staff were nice 
393920,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The price for the room was horrible 260 for one night for a relatively standard room but Barcelona in general was very booked at the time , Nice hotel with very friendly staff Good breakfast Amazing king size bed 
393921,Hotel Grums Barcelona,No Negative, Hotel is in an older building but rooms are updated Comfy pillows They provided bottled drinking water for free in the mini fridge Location was convenient to public transportation 
393922,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The distance from La Rambla was a bit far to be a convenient walk however still doable , Beautiful modern facilities the staff were extremely helpful Very clean and tidy Room was cleaned and towels etc replaced every day Definitely recommend
393923,Hotel Grums Barcelona, I would say give the guest at least 1 day complementary for the spa , We got a free room upgrade they didn t have the rom we originally booked but not complaining we got a better room with a huge balcony with tables and sun bed The Hotel location is a few minute walk to La Rambla 
393924,Hotel Grums Barcelona,No Negative, This Hotel was in a great location 5 minutes walk to La Ramblas and 10 15 minutes walk to the beach Really enjoyed my stay here Rooms were spotless clean and had everything I needed 
393925,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The street the hotel is on and the area surroundings are not good It was very expensive 2300 for 7 nights so I expected a nice area but was quite disappointed with the appearance Breakfast was expensive for 14 per head When I went up the other end of Las Rambles where some of the hotels were cheaper they were actually in a much nicer area , The room was lovely we had a family room for 4 occupants Staff were very helpful Hotel was close to the metro 15 min walk to Las Rambles 20 min to the Marina and 30 mins to the beach 
393926,Hotel Grums Barcelona, I think the access to sauna and pool could be included in the price It wouldn t be that much more and business travellers could have it then included in their regular rate , Cleaning staff was very nice and friendly 
393927,Hotel Grums Barcelona,No Negative, Room was comfortable and amenities great Location fantastic as you get to explore Barcelona and walk to most places We much prefer this area than Las Ramblas as it is more authentic and less crowded Great front room service 
393928,Hotel Grums Barcelona, As many here mentioned bathroom lacks additional curtain to prevent water on the floor The smell in the bathroom is also not good Coffee for the breakfast is pretty bad , Well sized room private terrace cleanness friendly staff to name a few It is well situated not far from the city beach and Montjuik though this area is not too busy with tourists Breakfast is decent except coffee which is a shame for the place 
393929,Hotel Grums Barcelona,No Negative, Breakfast was excellent with great healthy variaty of choices and you could serve it also in a small garden terrase Rooms were clean Staff friendly and supportive every morning were showing us best routes on the maps and how to reach them with public transportation Family rooms were with 4 beds large enough 1 3m to sleep comfortable Hotel is few minutes walk from La Rambla and Port of Barcelona 
393930,Hotel Grums Barcelona, We had food in our room to have for lunch and when we came back from our day to eat our lunch the cleaning people I m assuming had eaten our food That was quite unprofessional , The staff was AMAZING They were so friendly and helpful showed us a lot of great places to see in Barcelona and the best ways to get around The rooms absolutely beautiful They were modern clean and the beds pillows were extremely comfortable Also the breakfast was fantastic they have a buffet breakfast for 12e person which is so worth it Fresh cooked eggs bacon vegetables fresh fruit coffee the list goes on I would recommend and stay at this hotel over and over again 
393931,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The bathroom and shower wasn t private enough The was only a foggy window that kept the privacy A little pricey for what you get , The room was spacious and comfortable The staff was friendly The location was convenient to restaurants beach and shopping 
393932,Hotel Grums Barcelona, It was a very big disappointment The staff tried There wasn t even a place to put your luggage No luggage rack The shower had no door or curtain The water ran on the floor There was no miirror in bathroom which was tiny and no place to put anything , It was 550 for a hotel like Days Inn but not as good 2 days at a very poor hotel 
393933,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Parking overpriced as per all city hotels Also it seems to have acquired the habit of some Spanish hotels to have glass doors on the toilet not a good look There was even glass in the shower room that showed the entire room your naked silhouette Fashionable stylish yes but to a repressed Brit not so good , Very friendly staff Offered me an upgrade to a bigger room for some reason 
393934,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Nothing, Very nice hotel a bit out of the center but very interesting when you need to go to the airport next day We even got a free upgrade to a room with a huge terrace
393935,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The Hotel is in a reseidential area surrounded by apartments and view from room was lines of laundry Hotel has 4 star rating but I think 3 star would have been generous Rooms was basic 3 single beds with laminate flooring Small wardrobe and no drawers for storage Bathroom had walk in shower with screen but no door and floor got very wet after shower Shower tray was so slippy it caused one of us to fall Toilet was in bathroom but stangely wash hand basin was in bedroom I do not know what kind of designer thought that toilet and wash hand basin should be separate Basin unit took up substantial space in room that could have accomodated a set of drawers Towels were grey and thin Cleaning was cursory both before we arrived and during stay On arrival there was a former occupant s dirty face cloth in bathroom Gross 2 lifts and one broken on two days Bedroom hallways dirty Had to seek out staff for service in bar in evenings Not worth price and certainly I will not be recommending or returning , The property location is relatively close to sea front There was a supermarket next door and good cafe for breakfast two doors down 
393936,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Room 111 Advertised as sound proofed but it was very noisy We could hear every door open and close and people talking in the hallway We were backed on to the eating area outside so there was noise from that too We had to also keep the curtains closed as it wasn t private Another feature which is advertised is the flat screen TV don t bother it s all in Spanish There is no hospitality TV system or premium channels or options for movies room service etc just the basic stations For the price we paid 650 for 4 nights I wouldn t return , Room was big and modern
393937,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Location is ok for business travels but a bit far from the sights if you re a tourist , The room was big and airy And clean The staff especially breakfast staff was friendly and accommodating 
393938,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Nothing really except we did not get the room confirmed to us by the hotel prior to travel , We book the Executive Room on the 6th floor for the spacious balcony If you are not a beach lover or poolside person these are ideal as you can still do a little sun bathing in the afternoon 
393939,Hotel Grums Barcelona,No Negative, The best assets of the hotel are Quim Pablo at the reception They made us feel so welcome they were full of advice knowledge and genuinely reflect their pride love of Barcelona 
393940,Hotel Grums Barcelona,No Negative, I love the deco of the room Very comfortable bed I love the fact that you could open the class door to get some natural air I loved the extra kits provided I e nail kit shoe shine pocket tissues etc 
393941,Hotel Grums Barcelona,No Negative, Staff were so helpful Location is amazing walking distance to La Rambla and a Metro station It is located in a very nice quite area there are supermarkets beside the Hotel restaurants at the main street and shopping mall 10 mins walking from the hotel 
393942,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Rooms very tight Bathroom sink situated in bedroom to give illusion of room being bigger Doesn t work and is unhygienic Bathroom tight Towels small and on light side Reception area uninviting Definitely not four star , Beds very comfortable Breakfast good Nice decor in public bar and restaurant Quiet location Lovely staff Most helpful 
393943,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Breakfast was ok but could be better Not the best I had but it did the job All tasted well and was fresh Shower in hotel room should have extra door , Nice hotel with good location Bathroom was not very well planned with sink placed in bedroom Shower sprayed all over toilet Shower door should be installed to avoid wet floor Otherwise nice toliet and room Taxi required to get to hotel app 30 from airport 
393944,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Wash hand stand is situated in the room rather than in the bathroom This is very inconvinent if there is more than one person in the room There is not mirror in the bathroom Very expensive for such a hotel We paid EUR300 for room with three beds a night and it did not include breakfast Far from the beach , Clean modern rooms Good breakfasts for EUR11 Hotel looks nice 
393945,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Nothing special about the hotel Not sure why it was rated 8 2 on Booking com Very average room though we were given a family room with extra beds located opposite lift shaft so noise well into the night as people arrived and left small child bouncing ball in room above somewhat irritating Immediate area had people sleeping rough and drinking in nearby play park but nothing threatening , Location good Street quiet enough Was ok but would look elsewhere next time Close to excellent local restaurants off main tourist routes Wifi etc worked well Bed comfortable 
393946,Hotel Grums Barcelona, No privacy at all one can hear everything thats going on in the next room Room was cramped compared to other 4 star hotels , Bed was very comfortable clean room Nearby park 
393947,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Terrible neighbourhood lots of drug addicts in the streets in area towards the Rambla if going north to Pueble sec it was a bit better toward Montjuic park but also there if You went one block too close to Rambla Your felt insecure because of high people around , The nice concierge and reception staff
393948,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Bad smell in the room Towels must be replaced to newer No bath gel replacement for two days Towels should be more than one shower per day, Friendly staff
393949,Hotel Grums Barcelona,No Negative, Very close to the metro stops at Paral lel and Drassanes which means it s very easy to get around on the L3 metro line It s also within 10 minutes walk of the many pintxos restaurants on Carrer de Blai 
393950,Hotel Grums Barcelona, we had a triple room and the bathroom wasn t seperate shower cubicle and toilet were just frosted glass , Excellent location easy to travel to all of the main attractions The room was clean and comfortable 
393951,Hotel Grums Barcelona, I sent 2 e mails for the booking customer service and I got nothing nobody answered my question or send me e mail it was unethical not responding to the customer questions ,No Positive
393952,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Room was missing a desk and a coat hanger for wet jackets Expected bedroom slippers given the 4star category but they did not give any , Super sized bed was very comfortable and breakfast selection very good Location was in a quiet street 
393953,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Leisure facilities were closed off We d purposely booked this hotel for the spa and pool which were not available and if we d taken this out of our decision we could have found cheaper accommodation which was frustrating , Bed incredibly comfortable Third bed in family room equally good quality to ours 
393954,Hotel Grums Barcelona,No Negative, They upgraded us It was our first time in Barcelona Loved it The room was clean and had a patio The staff was very friendly and the breakfast buffet was generous 
393955,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Nothing to mention , Great location for exploring Barcelona and its surroundings Good breakfast friendly staff and excellent service Everything that you are looking for when you travel for a weekend 
393956,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Poor ventilation in bathroom Needed to remind staff to add water to fridge , Mont Juic and la Ramblas both at walking distance Nice small cafeteria next to hotel great for breakfast Very quiet area 
393957,Hotel Grums Barcelona, rooms feel kinda thin walled so it can get a bit noisy when other guests arrive late at night if you are next to elevator the sound of it going up and down can be a nuisance so if you are a light sleeper bring some earplugs , very friendly stuff and great service gracias nice hotel neat rooms pretty good basecamp to explore the city on foot at day or go out at night metro station near by good breakfast buffet but cheaper options available as well supermarket small shop and other options right next to hotel
393958,Hotel Grums Barcelona, It was noisy There were smell of canibes all the time during my stay which it was 4 nights When I talked to the staff they just look at me as we can t do any thing about it Fortunately at the check out after I said it repeatedly I will write a review about this manger came and give us a discount on the room , The location Good Beds and mattresses Free WiFi Clean room Rooms are not too small 
393959,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Better choice for evening meals limited choices, Great for family and Business stays Staff spoke very good English and where very helpful and friendly 
393960,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Didn t like the fact the stairs were full of mattresses so if there was a fire you would have no chance as the whole fire escape was blocked very dangerous ,No Positive
393961,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The description of the hotel made it sound like it was in a really nice area It was very local full of homeless people beggars and people drinking on the streets Every time you went to walk out you was approached by these people It wasn t anywhere near Barcelona port which It said it was I asked for a high rise room in which I thought with being next to the port I would have a lovely view Our view was situated next to high rised local flats so was no nice views At the time of booking the hotel price was 325 and when I got there I got charged 355 Wasn t happy about that at all Breakfast in the morning Scrambled egg Had black streaks running through it I had put some on my plate to take to my table when I sat down the Stench of small that was coming from it was disgusting I told the lady that was working in the seating area she removed it back into the kitchen I have taken pictures of the egg it was disgusting So basically I paid 40 for two breakfasts for two of us for eating crossunts and orange juice I wouldn t reccomend this hotel based on value for money or the area Food was awfull sorry, The staff were really nice and helpful helped us plan our trip around Barcelona and the bed was the comfiest bed ever 
393962,Hotel Grums Barcelona, my boys can not go on swimming on our first night as we are not told that you need to book it, Bed are comfy linens are great staff are ver accommodating
393963,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The tiny sausages Could change that to proper sausages Tastes blah as well , The spa The bed linens are so soft and the mattresses firm Very comfortable sleep The staff too are very warm smiles a lot and friendly especially the lady at the reception and at the breakfast buffet 
393964,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Hot breakfast items were already cold by 0920am The rest Of The breakfast was great , Bed was exactly to my liking Not to soft Best sleep I ve had in a hotel in a long time 
393965,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Paying extra to use the spa should be included in your price , Breakfast was nice but not worth 11 location didn t look the best but walking distance to everywhere Rooms were very spacious and clean 
393966,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The room was a bit tired but clean and everything functioned so it wasn t an issue What bothered us is that we could hear everything that happened in the corridor or even some noises from the neighbors rooms , Great location delicious breakfast comfy large bed Good wi fi connection We ve been provided early check in w o upcharge Overall impression is very positive 
393967,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The view from my room wasn t that great but wasn t there to spend time looking out my window, Hotel was nice staff really friendly the rooms where nice and the bed was comfy bathroom facilities was good nice that the shower was in a different room The hotel was in a nice location not to far from where you want to go 
393968,Hotel Grums Barcelona, There s not a lot that I didn t like , The receptionists were brilliant Engaging and knowledgable and very accommodating A great start to a great trip 
393969,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Nothing to mention here, The entire experience from beginning to end was fabulous Friendly helpful staff and an amazing room Location was also brilliant just a 10 minute walk into the main city centre 
393970,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The room had a weird smell even after the daily housekeeping service Not the most pleasant scent after a long day of tourism Pillows were not so great The rooms overlooking the patio had their views locked in by the neighboring apartment buildings , I guess the price is OK if you book here with a good online discount deal 
393971,Hotel Grums Barcelona, the room was nice but there are some marks of unfair usage , The hotel is located just few hundreds meters from the touristic harbor where the Rambla ends to the sea Metro station takes 5 min walk I found everything comfortable 
393972,Hotel Grums Barcelona, We expect the spa was included in the price of the booking and the that it was bigger than it really was Second day no hot water and third day no water at whole In the room it is not specified what is the reception number in case with need to call them , We like the bed it was comfortable
393973,Hotel Grums Barcelona,No Negative, Comfortable beds and ideal room size for 2 mother and teenage daughter while having a small fridge rather than minibar as well as tea coffee making facilities in the room was really useful Friendly helpful staff including booking an early taxi for the station Thank you 
393974,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Beds uncomfatable shower flooding breakfast disappointing , Free WiFi staff very helpful Great location walking to metro and city Cafe next door did a much better breakfast and good value 
393975,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The room and bathroom were a little bashed up The bathroom needed some updating better cleaning and only had one mirror in the bathroom The room was noisy at times , The staff were so helpful as soon as we arrived and they made our sight seeing effortless They gave us all the information we needed The service at reception and the restaurant was very good The beds were very comfortable and had a good shower in the bathroom 
393976,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The room was too hot and it was impossible to adjust the temperature and the ventilation system makes a lot of noise particularly noticeable during the night Quite pricey but Barcelona is becoming increasingly so 4 50 for a beer in the Born area , Location is handy An interesting 15 min walk to La Rambla through the Raval area Loved Nou de Rambla street vibrant colourful area Keep your wits about you at night though Hotel was comfortable and the staff were great including the people working in the Spa a great little place for relaxing with a sauna and steam room and massage We had the executive room which was clean and comfortable Nice terrace but not really as big as photos would have you believe 
393977,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The room furniture and wallpaper is worn out and very basic We booked this hotel for the spa During our stay all 4 nights the pool heating wasnt working so we could not use the pool Very dissapointing While taking shower in bathroom water comes out of shower area It becomes a mess Breakfast is limited choise Also dinner menu was very limited and dishes very strange , Location is very good La ramblas is at 10 mins walking distance Lady at reception and at the spa both were very polite Reception and restraurant look nice Rooms are not 4 star Tip eat your breakfast in the cafe next to the hotel Next to the hotel there is a small supermarket and at end if the street a lidl 
393978,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The cleanliness of the halls and the reception area was very poor There was extremely unpleasant smell in the corridors I am pretty sure that it was because of the carpets Also the sink was in the room not in the bath very strange and uncomfortable , I am impressed of the cleanliness of the room Of course the bed was very comfortable also 
393979,Hotel Grums Barcelona, hotel very nicely done up but a bit soul less the gym is two machines in a small dark room with no air con and no room to stretch or do weights even , Fairly good location could walk to everywhere metro nearby too but not actually anything to do right near the hotel bit of a creepy dark walk home at night very helpful and friendly staff 
393980,Hotel Grums Barcelona, scrambled eggs really not good Probably from a mix or powder Hotel in Spain should really serve fresh OJ Do not order hamburgers in room not good Took 90 min to get cheese burger w FF Overcooked meat normal bread buns no sauce Picture very deceiving as always Room needs a normal desk for business travelers and a place to hang coats outside closet , 2 days business trip Good choice of food Clean hotel and very modern Great location in a more quiet area of town but walking distance to metro quick access to freeway very close to shops and restaurants Nice staff 
393981,Hotel Grums Barcelona, I couldn t get any hot water in the shower Normally I would ve just called as I m sure it was an easy fix I was leaving so I just took a quickie cold shower that got my blood going ,No Positive
393982,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The A C switched off twice on one of our two nights of stay don t know why and didn t bother to complain either not a big hassle Washbasin in the bedroom instead of the bathroom wasn t ideal for us but not bad either Felt that the breakfast extremely overpriced 13 Euro pp so didn t take it, Decent location 5 min walk from metro well kept friendly helpful staff
393983,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The gym is just 1 treadmill and 1 bike and the spa pool is too expensive for what it is , Really tasty breakfast buffet The air conditioning in the room worked well enough for a good nights sleep early September 
393984,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Reception person when checking in early was helpful but not overly friendly but possibly had just worked a night shift Other staff were much more riendly , We used it for a one night stay before a cruise as it was close to the port but would be good for longer stays as well A walkable distance from La Rambla Great little caf next door 
393985,Hotel Grums Barcelona, There is quite a lot of noise from the other rooms You can hear the shower from the other rooms one by one , Breakfast was extremely nice and lots of different tasty food 
393986,Hotel Grums Barcelona, No washcloths shower was a little weird only had glass covering half way Therefore water got all over the floor Breakfast not included , Nice room good location Free water in room 
393987,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Sink was in the bedroom instead of in the bathroom Very inconvenient, Location was good and excellent car park Helpful and friendly staff on reception
393988,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Housekeeping didn t keep room to standard expected or replenish consumables everyday, Excellent location to the marina without the high prices of the hotels that are directly on the marina 
393989,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The breakfast has nothing warm or hot even the eggs served cold except tea and coffee they are hot , The staff is nice and very helpful specially at the reception 
393990,Hotel Grums Barcelona, There wasn t anything that I disliked about the hotel or the trip Everything was good , The hotel is in a great position to reach all the sights restaurants all by foot Great trip away 
393991,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Smoking rooms availability or the terrace being open a lot longer, I liked the friendliness and everything was very close by and staff were very helpful
393992,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Sink and bath plugs didn t work Small room which we knew about but functionality poor because of area taken up with entrance corridor, Location excellent very helpful staff
393993,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Breakfast Whilst the food was pretty good there were plates left on tables and not cleared and some food was not replenished , Rooms were lovely Close to cruise port Check in and check out were quick and easy 
393994,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Too poor information about taxi rate We had to pay much more than informed by staff They should make more accurate appointments Area poor for a 4 star hotel , Kind staff Rooms o k Breakfast o k Service o k 
393995,Hotel Grums Barcelona, one thing i would say is that the pictures for the hotel could be more accurate its much nicer than the pictures show I was wondering why it was priced how it is but then when i got there i realized if it had a pool it would be perfect , the hotel and room was so nice Much bigger and nicer than i expected it to be from the pictures the bed was very comfortable good air con in the room mini fridge in the room very nice shower staff were very friendly and helpful if you need to find anything in barcelona the location was great for us located in a residential area which was just off a main street which leads to the ramblas and a half hour walk to the beach 
393996,Hotel Grums Barcelona, I couldn t stay longer, The friendliness of staff and the relaxed atmosphere of the hotel makes this hotel superior It is very clean with large rooms with plenty of storage 
393997,Hotel Grums Barcelona, In the day we ve arrived our room had such a strange tap with broken hand on the next day it was replaced on a new working one without even saying to a reception with this problem they just fixed it Breakfast quite expensive in my opinion so we didn t take it , Room was just great and cozy and absolutely clean all the time Sheets were changing every 2nd night Staff was so nice and welcome WiFi worked well Also they have a nice spacious backyard Location is pretty much close to the city center Just good service and it was worth it for the price we ve payed 
393998,Hotel Grums Barcelona, If I really had to find something Only thing I can clutch at is a few more hangers in the wardrobe Nothing to dislike , Didn t have breakfast but food looked nice Out door space a bonus Receptionist on arrival was extra helpful full of great info so thank u to him Location was quiet but close enough to all the places we wanted We will go back and try the lovely spa next time 
393999,Hotel Grums Barcelona, It would have been nice to be able to get an earlier continental breakfast i e coffee and a croissant before 10 30 am especially on a Sunday when most things don t open until later , It was a clean and quiet place to stay 
394000,Hotel Grums Barcelona, THE WiFi was very slow and reception was poor in the rooms Also the garage entrance was very small If you have a long car I wouldn t recommend it since I almost scratched my car when entering , Location was close to main sites en restaurants
394001,Hotel Grums Barcelona, At breakfast the majority of tables were not cleared Food was not replenished Had to ask on both mornings of our stay for certain items of food to be replenished Repeatedly asked room number by different staff Frustrating , Got an upgraded room for our anniversary 
394002,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The price of the breakfast was 16e which was awful for what you got, the location and the room was clean but the sheets were not changed daily I had a small cut and there was blood on my bed for 3 days The Aldi underneath the hotel
394003,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Nothing bad in this hotel for us , This was our 2nd stay at the Hotel Grums the rooms are spacious and clean and the big double bed was really comfy especially after sightseeing all day Its modern and the staff are super friendly its a 5 minute walk to the Ramblas Location is more residential but don t let this put you off as its quiet and ideal for the port 
394004,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The drain smell as you enter the hotel only at the entrance , Lovely little hotel a little off the central area but we liked that Clean modern lovely large comfortable bed spacious roof terrace Mineral water in room daily Good breakfast
394005,Hotel Grums Barcelona,No Negative, The room was bright and spacious and the bed comfortable The staff was very helpful and friendly A nice relaxed atmosphere in the restaurant where I did not feel awkward as a solo traveller 
394006,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Internet patchy no other concerns , Excellent breakfast huge room lovely decor great shower very modern thoroughly enjoyed our stay location close to port and Columbus monument and lovely parklands 
394007,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The hotel location apart from being close to the city and the port wasn t in the nicest area of Barcelona and had to have wits about you , The room was very modern and lovely decorated I travelled as a couple and were given a very spacious room with two double beds and a view onto the street Room was perfect modern clean and looked exactly as had been shown in the picture Hotel was gorgeous and staff were extremely catering Couldn t have asked for a nicer hotel the place had a lovely feel to it Equal distance of a 10 minute walk to both la rambla and the port Loved every minute 
394008,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Just a tiny thing for the short time you watch the TV they need at least one English speaking entertainment channel only BBC World News , The location of the hotel is excellent Beautiful park on it s doorstep with beautiful views As it is in a residential area very quite Love the room with the large balcony great space for those who like to sun worship The staff at Reception as always were helpful and polite to us Looking forward to next trip 
394009,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The AC was not working had to talk to staff multiple times to get it working fine The bathroom for the deluxe room did not have a sink inside it was in the bedroom area The lobby smelled like Chlorine due to the spa being open underneath Staff at the lobby mistook me for not having paid my stay beforehand during booking so double check with them always Also taxi drivers weren t familiar with the hotel or its location so always carry the address with you at all times , Location is good not far from La Rambla or Montju c so it s quiet The room was spacious 
394010,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Shower and toilet could have been more clean, Location is walking distance from Barcelona Center and just a small walk from Mont Juic which is great We have been to this hotel before and good value overall
394011,Hotel Grums Barcelona, There was a little bit of smell at the entrance area of the reception and in the bathroom I guess the proximity to sea must have been the reason Breakfast is extra which isn t great but there are plenty places around for alternative , Location is excellent greatly placed for Montjuic port beach La Rambla and Barri Gotic It s in a very quiet street too with great restaurants and metro station round the corner Really large rooms with massive and very comfy beds Rooms are decorated in different styles I got cubism 
394012,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Room starting to look a little shabby in places Bath promised but only got a shower Spa was closed for refurbishment, Very Comfy bed friendly very efficient staff
394013,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Only one sun bed on the terrace , The staff were very friendly and helpful It was my daughter s 21st Birthday and they arranged cake and candles that I forget Rooms very clean and we had a text r ace which was lovely to enjoy the sun on 
394014,Hotel Grums Barcelona,No Negative, Booked this with my friends for 4 night the staff is extremely nice and helpful and the rooms are very clean and comfy we made a good call on this place
394015,Hotel Grums Barcelona, There was no luggage rack in the room Hotel is far from attraction centers for walking , Hotel is close to Paralel metro station Room was clean bed was conforable Good choice for business purposes 
394016,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The bed not comfy as it was two singles joint together Bedsheet not changed although bed was dressed neatly , The breakfast was excellent and healthy The bed was neat and room tidy 
394017,Hotel Grums Barcelona, sound insulation between rooms and door not great you could hear talking wood floors means u hear footsteps next door location is OK but not best part of town bedroom view of flats opposite streetside , Bedroom modern clean functional and equipped as you d expect It s easy walking to the harbor and Ramblas about 10 mins Airport side of town 25mins Nice staff and helpful i was only there one night but bar was nice did not see the Spa Bathroom sink was in the room but wc and shower separate Breakfast ok nothing special
394018,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The room we were given first time was very small The sink was in the bedroom and not in the bathroom We walked past another room on the same floor which was very large and spacious which were what the pictures showed online but we didn t expect the room to be as small as it was The breakfast Wasn t great There was a lack of variety of food The scrambled eggs were watery and there wasn t much of an option for those who do not like to eat meat for breakfast The croissants were lovely but they ran out very quickly and the waiting time did take a while for a new load to come out But there is a cafe right next door to the hotel which is cheaper than the price for a breakfast in the hotel so definitely check the breakfast list before paying for it in the hotel They have a small spa downstairs but you have to book a time slot for it and pay 9 but we weren t aware that you had to pre book to use the pool There is a big difference in what you receive from the basic room to the terrace room with the basic room you do not get robes or slippers and get a couple towels however with the terrace room you were provided with double the amount of towels robes and slippers, The beds were comfy and was in a nice location for sights and walking to town The rooms were cleaned and fresh each day without fail We were able to upgrade with no issues which was lovely the room had a terrace but the electronic roof over it wouldn t work Staff were friendly tooo I would stay again but would consider breakfast and room sizes first 
394019,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The foyer could have been better I did not like the rug in there the car park was horrible I did not like it at all some times the gate would close on you before you had gone through it we had to ring the buzzer to stop it smashing into our car quite dangerous , Did not eat in hotel hotel room was very clean 
394020,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Sink inside the room , Centrally located with easy reach to metro and tourist spots downside hotel was too near to the city which made us spend much of the time outside the hotel Superb location 
394021,Hotel Grums Barcelona, the heating doesn t work properly for the winter it was cold for me in the room , excellent staff large modern and clean rooms good breakfast near the metro station 3 min supermarket nearby 1 min 
394022,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Maybe a few maps and directions of the city in reception area , Our room was excellent good size the bed was huge and really comfy bottles of water replenished Hotel was perfect 
394023,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Spa seems bigger at the pictures Sauna didn t work Hamman was not really hot When you leave the Spa the air is pretty cold due to air condition Since we couldn t get into our room before 2pm we went to the spa where we got with pleading 2 towels I booked a massage and after we got changed for the massage I bit for a dry towel since the others were wet and we didn t get one In the evening we wanted to have dinner in our room The room service menu was from a local pizza delivery So I called the reception nobody from room service picked up the phone to get a menu from the restaurant After waiting 30minutes and more calles that left unanswered neither reception nor room service picked up by that time we decided to went downstairs At the restaurant was only 1 waiter really stressed and told us for room service you have to order at the restaurant and after that they ll bring it up I was surprised because reception didn t give us this information We stayed at the restaurant where not even music was playing The food was ok but definitely not 4 for the next time we ll have dinner outside , staff was nice good location for visiting barcelona Massage was really good Breakfast was great 
394024,Hotel Grums Barcelona, My have been attacked at 10 pm next door by a pickpocket My computer has been stolen in my car right in front of the hotel at noon time I dont think this has anything to do with the location of the hotel It is a city problem Bankrupt country No enough cops to police the europeans thief s who come here to have fun Last but not least if you leave Spain thru the port of Barcelona no cops either to stamp your documents to recover the taxes paid during shopping , Everything was perfect except what went very wrong 
394025,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Electrics in the room a bit shady but got most of them quickly fixed by the maintenance guy The limited spa hours for kids also a bit disappointing but understandable , The breakfast was great despite the additional cost well worth it Very nice overall experience 
394026,Hotel Grums Barcelona, It s a little bit expensive I didn t like that they charge an additional cost for breakfast The opening hours for the ym and pool are quite limited And you are actually not able to use them if you don t pay an additionnal charge , It has great facilities it s comfortable it s really clean and the staff is extremely kind and helpful 
394027,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The only thing we didnt like was waiting so long to be served at the bar because martin had other jobs to do so we felt that they should hire some body else or get the front desk to do room service to take the pressure off the bar staff but that was all Martin was great even though he was run off his feet, The hotel was in a great location and the room was very clean and spacious and the balcony was fab the food was very nice staff were great especially Martin the bar man waiter room service he was excellent
394028,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Lack of anywhere to use a laptop in the bedroom Lack of electrical power sockets both in the bedrooms and public rooms Poor lighting in the basin area , Quiet convenient location Helpful staff Wide double bed The provision of a printer for public use 
394029,Hotel Grums Barcelona, It was kind of uncomfortable to have a sink inside the room rather than bathroom Also I was missing simple thing like you even find in 3 hotel body lotion Instead there is quite a few things like a shower cap which is much less important , The location is really nice the main street is just like 5 mins walk the hill for a cable car is just nearby and also the sea is easy to reach The rooms are bright with wide windows as I expected Cosy

394031,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The consequence of water in the bathroom is starting to show its marks, Peace during breakfast Comfortable beds 2 bottles water each day in the fridge
394032,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The Bathroom was extremely tight and awful The water of the shower was very weak The shower has half glass covered so the water comes out and fill the floor of the bathroom everytime i use the shower The WiFi internet is really bad has a weak signals in the rooms and horrible It works good only at the lobby and the lounge The floor of the Spa was very dirty and smelly specially the steam it deservs 2 stars hotel not 4 stars at all , Stylish modern room Multi functional TV has USB ports Cleanliness Quiet rooms and hotel Excellent sound proof Helpful staff
394033,Hotel Grums Barcelona, Service was slow there was no one at the entrance to help with our luggage the shower didn t have a tray to keep our own shampoo and soap no towel rack in the shower The towels should be placed in the bathroom and not near the basin in the room where it occupies space , Rooms are very spacious and clean food dinner was excellent

394037,Hotel Grums Barcelona, The actual street the Hotel is situated in was very shabby And the area outside for sitting at the back of the Hotel was far from pretty , The hotel was close to Gothic quarter and you could walk to most places of interest
