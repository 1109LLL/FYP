289126,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The hotel is renovating and this is something I would have gladly been told when I contacted the hotel last week or when we checked in There was a sign in the elevator about the renovations this is how we found out and the fact that the buttons of the elevator were hidden under tape The corridor of our room was under construction and workman started at 8 in the morning also during the weekend Just mentioning the renovation in advance or a simple question about it at checkout would have been nice and acceptable , The location was good next to the MuseumQuertier with nice restaurants for breakfast and diner The city is in walking distance and the metro is around the corner

289145,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier,No Negative, Very central hotel with metro distance of 50 meters as well as bus stops for transition to the airport Comfortable room but the only negative I have to say is that anointed a light renovation for example be painted the walls also from 12 noon onwards offer free beverages in the space of the trap Exceptional girls in reception

289147,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, For a hotel the furniture was definitely too old and in bad shape My room had an old door with a gap at the bottom that was so big that light came in from the hall Consequently there was no sound barrier whatsoever to the hall The window was old too and not tight enough to keep the wind out It was basically an old and rather run down room pimped with some new wallpaper and thankfully also a new bathroom , Nice lobby free cold and hot drinks in the afternoon and evening Great position at the back side of the Museumsquartier Bathroom was OK 
289148,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Room was next to stairwell and cleaning staff were very noisey in the morning They would start hoovering at 7am and when moving around the building be quite loud , Location very clean friendly staff

289150,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The staff in breakfast were very curt and seemed irritated that you actually need cutlery and help with using the juicer at first , Location is great just a short walk from Museum Quarter which is great The rooms on the front are quite noisy especially the lower floors where we were as the road outside is busy though The breakfast is nice but the staff are very abrupt and curt 
289151,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The fact that sometimes it was a bit too chilly the windows weren t well sealed and the cold wind got into the room , We had a pleasant staying at this hotel At the beginning there was a problem with heating the room but they solved it The personnel is great warm and helpful to guide you for important points of attractions in the city The bed was comfortable we slept ok considering that we had our daughter with us

289155,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, I never got past the lobby A taxi arrived and I was driven away from the boutique ViennArt in the city center to a less desirable area of the city to check in at a chain hotel a stones throw from the Westbahnhof The room I was given was perfectly adequate and had I been looking for a budget hotel I would have been quite pleased However I wound up paying over 500 for two nights in an average accommodation in a sketchy part of town well away from the city center when I had deliberately booked at a higher rate expecting both location and accommodation of a certain quality , Upon arrival a very efficient and cheerful young lady informed me that there had been some problem with bookings and I would not be staying in the Hotel ViennArt but my reservation would be honored at the same price same conditions at a different 4 star hotel She invited me to have seat in the lobby as she called a taxi to be paid for by the hotel and offered me a complimentary Vienna Pass for the duration of my stay 
289156,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Walls need fresh painting With that it would be an ideal place to stay , Location is great receptionist was very friendly and nice It was pure pleasure staying at this hotel 
289157,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Street facing side was much louder than I d like I stayed in a junior suite on that side but I didn t care for the noise The smaller room on the backside of the hotel was much quieter although the room was smaller As usual parking pretty much anywhere in Europe is a painful experience suffice it to say you ll park about three blocks away and a bit tricky to get too On a good note though the parking area is clean and secure and dare I say spacious For Europe anyway Another good point is reduced parking cost for the hotel That s more like a plus plus , The location close is only two blocks to the museum quarter Everything that most people would like to see is within fifteen minutes Sch nbrunn and the Teknik Museum are the only things distant but then again those two locations are distant from everything else Breakfast was pretty good and the staff was very accommodating Secure parking see below 
289158,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, our stay in hotel 3times we saw cockroches n insects That was shocking n shameful to Hotel property, Hotel Surroundins was suitable n staff was kindly spoken

289160,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The beds while comfortable aren t very well made and some of the bars in the bed frame fell out in the middle of the night Not a difficult fix but still not ideal to wake up to , The location is ideal in a lovely room with friendly staff Considering where it is the price is pretty good too 
289161,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Didn t like the fact that I could not take a tea or hot chocolate to the room from the lobby facilities I was freezing and need to warm myself and after an all day walking I have to stay in the common area to drink a tea Perhaps they should consider some seasonal electric jugs to put in the rooms to suit the cold winters that Vienna has , The breakfast was amazing That was definitely my favorite thing from the Hotel The bathroom was very clean and great shower Was very well located indeed 
289162,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Could use less scented products when cleaning room , The location is perfect and the staff is excellent and very happy and helpful Hard to ask for a better breakfast and the price is more than fair

289170,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The room was clean but the bathroom misses a mat and a hanger Generally the comfort of the room was more adequate to a 3 stars hotel However the atmosphere is cosy , The hotel is centrally located near Museumquartier with easy access to metro and in a walking distance to Museums and Hoffburg The staff was nice The breakfast is good with a variety of diary products meat and fruits coffee and juice Coffee and refreshments are served all day long in the breakfast salon Wi fi was good in the room and lobby

289181,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The hotel had no charm the shower was very small and had no shelf on which to place toiletries no wash clothes were provided nor was bar soap however liquid soap was by the sink and in the shower I did not like that if you did not pay for the breakfast you could not even get coffee until after noon I was in an upgraded double room it was very small I understand this is common in Europe and looked more like a college dorm room There was no air conditioning They provided a floor fan and the window opened but there was no screen and with the window being equal to the roof I was uncomfortable leaving it open My friends had an upgraded double room it was much nicer and had air conditioning , The location was great everything was within 30 minutes walking distance and there was a lot to do and see within a few blocks 
289182,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The shower water flow was economic and the shower did not have a thermostatic valve hence the temperature varies when other taps flush were used in the block, Good Breakfast

289196,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, No air conditioning so the room was continuosly very warm and very uncomfortable Our room faced onto the main road and was very noisy from passing traffic and if the window was open to cool down the noise was extremely loud so had to keep the window closed most of the time A fan was provided by the hotel but this doesnt really compensate for no A C , Staff very pleasant and helpful Great location next to the museum quarter Free soft drinks and coffee in the lobby Buffet breakfast was good Lots of choice 
289197,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, We only stayed one night The person who checked us in was pleasant and efficient However the check out process the next morning was not handled so well At peak departure time the only available receptionist first spent several minutes explaining sightseeing information to a couple checking in early Then with a line of people waiting to check out she twice was willing to let a queue jumper push to the front She explained that he was only going to be quick because he was checking out Others who were there for the purpose pointed out to her and the queue jumper they had been waiting patiently in hope of the same quick service This was strike one Strike two was that when I eventually got served the same receptionist said I needed to pay for two breakfasts charged to my room the day before It took her a while to comprehend that we had only checked in the previous evening Fortunately there was no strike three against somebody who was apparently having a rough Sunday morning ASIDE It always id wise to check one s the bill at hotels before paying My advice to the hotel manager is she or he needs to ensure that ALL their reception staff are trained to serve customers in an efficient and courteous manner Otherwise our stay was perfectly satisfactory , The price and location were good and the hotel clean and tidy Basically what you would expect and as advertised

289217,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, It s not really an ArtHotel its only the lobby which looks nice The room I had was somewhat run down and the furniture showed wear and tear And the room was faced to the street which means it was very very noisy The traffic starts in the early morning ,No Positive

289230,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier,No Negative, Staying here was a great pleasure the staff was really helpful as they helped me daily with my baby stuff even upgraded my room because the other room given to me had poor ventilation I totally recommend 
289231,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The price of the breakfast I felt was a little high and preferred to go out to a cafe where the prices seemed far more reasonable , The location of the hotel was excellent just a short walk from the Volkstheater U bahn stop As the hotel is in the museum quarter there was plenty of places to visit and after a day of sightseeing bars and restaurants were all in walking distance 
289232,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, In very hot weather the lack of air conditioning might be a problem we had temperatures in the low to mid 20s and that was OK as it was quiet enough outside to leave the windows open at night , Very quiet for such a central location Availability of free coffee and juice up till midnight in the hotel lobby

289244,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, My room was close to the elevator and every time there were people coming out or getting into the elevator i would hear them talking The hotel markets itself as a 4 star hotel but i am of the opinion that it s a good 3 star hotel just my opinion , The location is good Staff are friendly and helpful It s close to the public transport You can access touristic areas like the Sisi museum by a short walk 10 mins They have a great breakfast with a wide selection They even offer sparkling wine
289245,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The room was a bit old and noisy since it is on the road I had minor issues with the WiFi but only the first day , It s my favourite hotel in Wien Friendly staff great breakfast cozy rooms and the lobby is just great Above all the location in the heart of a wonderful area Good quality price ratio 
289246,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Value for money is terrible breakfast is overpriced Terrible wifi disconnecting all the time and requiring relogin every few minutes Expect small rooms that look nothing extra could use renovation and a very noisy surroundings The walls are paper thin and you hear even TV of the guest in next room When they start cleaning other rooms early in the morning prepare to be waken up by incredibly old and noisy vacuum cleaner I was really disappointed by the overall style of the rooms didnt look comfy at all and I see no reason why this hotel deserves the 4th star Ive been in much nicer 3 hotels, Location is really the only positive
289247,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, WiFi system was a little inconvenient it tended to disconnect and required to enter password each time But when it worked speed was pretty good , Good hotel at the very center of the city Clean and tidy Nice design of interiors Breakfast was diverse and tasty Free drinks during the day are very convenient 
289248,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Nothing really bad The only thing I can come up with is that for wifi you have to log in anew every day or even after a longer period without activity Though it s not a major thing , Excellent location close to everything Metro station steps away Comfortable rooms Small hygienic pack is a nice touch The design looks a bit old fashioned but imho it suits the city very well 
289249,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier,No Negative, Everything about this hotel is a reason to want to come back The cherry on the cake is the availability for free of coffee tea and softdrinks from noon till midnight This hotel is super Note in Vienna one can use UBER 
289250,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Have to log in to connect to WiFi every time Would suggest a deluxe room due to A C seemingly not available in the other rooms although it wasn t very powerful We were upgraded to a deluxe room for free , Perfect location nice clean room helpful staff very good value Excellent overall 
289251,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier,No Negative, Only a few minutes walk from the main shopping street underground and museums Staff were very polite and helpful Free Coffee tea and soft drinks available after 12 midday Would highly recommend staying here 
289252,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Room was very basic especially for a 4 No air con no iron and ironing board no kettle or drinking facilities within the room The in room fixtures were also very basic The hotel entrance and reception area is beautiful it s a shame the room didn t match , Location was a plus close to the underground station and within walking distance to all the museums 
289253,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, small room wouldn t class as 4star hotel lobby is lovely but rooms arent great beds were heavily scratched corridors were noisy you have to physically lock the door with your key on the inside which poses a fire risk Rooms were stuffy The most annoying thing was that they had made my bed up in a twin room under a wall lamp that I must of hit my head off a dozen times in the 2 nights i stayed because they intellegently placed the light directly above your head in the perfect spot to hit it sitting up or getting out of bed What away to start the morning with a little light concussion , locations great staff are helpfull too
289254,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The hotel is divided in two sections the one with standard rooms and the one with superior rooms The standard rooms are far from 4 stars small and with old furniture I think this is not completely honest because a standard room in my opinion should follow THE STANDARD of the amount of stars that the hotel displays and a superior room should be superior TO THAT , The staff is really helpful The hotel is clean the lobby and the bar are very nice and free coffee and tea in the afternoon is a really nice touch 
289255,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Some of the premises staircase corridors would merit a facelift but it seemed work was underway , Great location in museum area very close to Hofburg and walking distance to the center Pleasant staff Clean and comfortable Close to the underground and some nice restaurants close by 
289256,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Week w fi connection in the room, Very good location close to city center and metro station 1min spacious room clean basic good breakfast friendly staff 
289257,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Room decor is basic and some of the furnishings could be updated The room keys are clunky a card swipe system would be beneficial here Wish the hotel offered a basic breakfast or had coffee making facilities in the room The fact that we could not take coffee tea back to our room was a tad mean , Go for a superior room as they are a bit roomier especially if you re there for a few days Location is great a short walk to all the museums transit shops Staff is friendly and the place is clean and bright 
289258,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, 543 euros for 4 nights was too expensive when breakfast was not included which at 15 euros per person was too much extra to pay The duvets were too small and we both needed to keep recovering ourselves during the night Windows in room 410 were above head height , The location was very good Staff were always very helpful and pleasant The room and all of the hotel was very clean There was always plenty of hot water Heating was easily controlled to our comfort using the radiators valves The room was well equipped with a safe fridge etc 
289259,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Nothing, We book a premium double room for 2 night at 150 was a beautiful room spotless clean huge bathroom was just perfect the free soft drinks and coffee in lobby was perfect after a day out exploring Literally 5 minster from muesum quarter and 20mins into town We got the CAT from the airport to town centre and the the underground to the hotel with no problems l Will Deffo stay here again 
289260,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, I specifically asked for a quiet room and I was placed beside the stairs and the lift It s pretty noisy so if you are a light sleeper it s worth reconsidering Also the girl who checked me in has no interest in making guests welcome All other staff were pleasant, The location is excellent perfectly situated between the city centre and the trendy Neubeu neighbourhood The bathroom was spotless 
289261,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Rooms a bit tired need to look at the plumbing bit smelly No air conditioning would be quite warm in summer I suspect , Location location location MuseumQuartier lots of good inexpensive restaurants 20 minute walk to city center
289262,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Room was only made up for one when we arrived but staff sorted straight away with no fuss Doors and corridors also a bit noisy so not very peaceful in the mornings when people moving around, Great location good staff and really well priced Free soft drinks afternoon evening and a really nice space to enjoy them in
289263,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The price of the breakfast is a bit high if you compare it to the roomprice We went for breakfast in at Cafe Espresso on the Burgasse 57 , Because we were early and the room wasn t ready yet we were given a better room straight away Thank you for that We liked the Lobby with the free Coffee bar and the good service of the staff We had a problem with the safe and the girl from the reception helped us immediately Very good location right next to the museum and the main Shopping street of Vienna We were also pleasantly surprised of all the nice local shops and cafes around the Hotel in the 7 Distict 
289264,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Wi fi doesn t work well the breakfast is overpriced You have plenty of places to take it nearby, Excellent location 200m away from the Volkstheater subway station Clean spacious and comfortable rooms The bathroom is a real plus Easy parking in Museumquartier underground parking

289266,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The tram that goes in the street is really loud at night , The room was very cozy and comfortable amazing bathroom and the hotel was close to everything museums restaurants city center 
289267,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The room does not fit four star category it could look a bit better and it could use some renovation but it has all you need and it was clean , The breakfast was really good with fresh fruit The bad in the room was comfortable and firm hard just the way I like it What was amazing was that the room has enough sockets and on the right places 
289268,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Not further than this , We both really loved all specifications given the room was so comfortable and clean the location of the hotel was truly in the heart of Vienna People can arrive to Museumquartier directly using CAT train or U3 metro line that was a plus for this hotel The personnel was so helpful and positive they could solve any problem just by smiling 
289269,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier,No Negative, This hotel was perfect for our needs one night stopover in Vienna central location in Museumsquartier a 5 minute walk to the bus station for the airport Very efficient staff quick check in and out We benefited from a free upgrade to a junior suite Spotless clean room very comfortable and large bed beautiful bathroom with both bathtub and shower Another plus free beverages soft drinks and coffee tea in the lobby between 12 p m and 12 a m All at a very good price on Booking com
289270,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier,No Negative, Loved the location as I like being near the action but not directly in the heart of it This area felt more like a neighborhood and offered all of the ease that comes w it grocery 1 2 block away local cafes bakeries restaurants etc Quick 2 3 min walk to the Underground Metro station of U 2 and U 3 and trams as well Very walkable to city center about 10 min walk to Opera House 5 min to Hofburg Palace and the museums Felt very safe and as a single female traveler I put that as a high priority I felt safe throughout Vienna easy city to visit get around Would stay in this area again Liked that the hotel offered coffee tea hot choc service for free from the hours of 12 00 noon to midnight I did not pay for the breakfast Found it easier and cheaper to pick up some items at the grocery store bakeries room had a refrigerator and I used that to hold some items I always travel w ear plugs and feel like you might need them due to early morning trash trucks on the back streets and noise from other room guests nearby that might be loud As it was unusually mild temps during my stay I actually opened the window to get fresh air into the room almost each day I liked having that option Very clean room Just so you know the lobby area comes across very modern but my room seemed to be in an older section that did not match the lobby pictures you see but the room was still just fine Plenty of hot water clean safe great location public transportation access refrigerator etc which is what really matters to me 
289271,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The justification that our internet is not compatible with apple products is not the best statement in nowadays Should definitely improve the internet connection at least for apple products, Centrally located clean rooms
289272,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier,No Negative, Very nice rooms clean new very good design The location of the hotel is excellent there are many restaurants bars and shops nearby city center is a short walk away Free coffee and beverages in lobby are also nice addition 
289273,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, There was a sense of sugar coating I was on the top floor right at the back of the hotel and although it was a fantastic stay it seemed like they had updated a very tired hotel There were still elements of it there , Location is fabulous literally exactly where you want to be i was travelling alone with my seven year old son so was handy as he didnt get too tired Cleaning was amazing fresh sheets every night Spotless rooms 
289274,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier,No Negative, The area has has great restaurants and shopping The access to the museums couldn t be more convenient The metro system is fabulous and just around the corner 
289275,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Room was incredibly hot with no apparent way to control temperature We had to sleep with window open which meant we woke up at about 5 30am when traffic noise began Trams were particulary loud I suspect had we not been at the front of the hotel it would have been bearable The ideal of course would be that they provided manual control for heating controlling in the room I would however stay again but ask for room at rear , Friendly staff who spoke good English Very clean and in a good location Excellent value for such location in a major city 
289276,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier,No Negative, Great location friendly staff very clean nice rooms great breakfast and value for money it was the second time we ve been there and if we visit Vienna again in the future Viennart hotel is our first choice for accommodation 
289277,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, A bit pricey they do not have free cancellation options , Free drinks from 12nn to 12 am Complementary toiletries kit on the first night Spacious room very good location couple of minutes away from the subway and from the shopping street Comfortable stay here in Vienna 
289278,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The wifi signal was weak in my bedroom , Perfect room And tea juices and coffee offering during all the afternoon and evening Near by foot to many touristic points 
289279,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier,No Negative, Beautiful modern clean The check in with the code functions perfectly The personnel is very kind Next time we are in Bamberg we will certainly stay there 
289280,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The very noisy rooms even though we were to that we received a better upgraded room The windows were not phonic isolated The bathroom was very small and different from the pictures on the site In reality is not a 4 star hotel rather a 3 star hotel Very expensive for the services offered The wifi connection in the room did not work The parking is very expensive 20 euro and is far away from the hotel 500 meters The rooms were old and with dirty floor carpet , The hotel is located near to Mariahilferstrasse 
289281,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The WiFi reception was off and on especially in the dining room, Friendly staff nice rooms Instead of coffee and tea in our rooms they had a coffee tea and juice bar every afternoon and evening downstairs I really liked that idea 
289282,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Cons not a 4 star hotel standard mor likely 3 5 stars small room, Pros great position from 12 AM free tea coffee chocolate co for free
289283,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Nothing , Excellent location close to all points of interest walking distance very friendly and helpful staff great breakfast buffet with possibility to make your own vegetable fresh with was fantastic free drinks tea coffee hot chocolate etc in the lobby from 12pm till 12am We will definitely back again 
289284,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier,No Negative, I surely will check availability of this particular hotel the first if travel again to Vienna Very kind and professional staff good location and reasonable rate 
289285,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier,No Negative, The staff and location of Hotel ViennArt were great We enjoyed our time at this hotel and would stay here again if we returned to Vienna The comfort of the room was great It had everything we wanted WiFi free a lovely Tub Soundproof room comfortable bed and a friendly staff I would recommend this location 
289286,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Expensive breakfast but you can have cheaper breakfast right next in Kantine or other place , Location and free tea coffee after breakfast time 
289287,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier,No Negative, This is our 10th stay in hotel Viennart we stay here every time we re in Vienna Great location great breakfast friendly and helpful staff rooms comfortable and spacious We love this hotel 
289288,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Pillows were very uncomfortable and we had a bit of road noise with the windows closed , Close to metro and still easy walk to city centre Overall reasonable value for money 
289289,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Feels a little like an upmarket hostel which is fine but not quite what we d expected Beds were very uncomfortable worst night s sleep I ve had in a hotel , Location is great 
289290,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The best hotel ever , EVERYTHING I had no problems and the exceeded all my expectations Great location stay accommodation close to everything awesome room great internet perfect 
289291,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The fact there were stairs and we had luggage we had to haul around Also the washrooms were not in the lobby but downstairs , The free drinks in the lobby and the ability to hang out in the breakfast area in the evenings The shower was amazing 
289292,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, The facilities in the room were basic and did not match the modern sleek impression given of the room on the website There were not tea and coffee facilities in the room and as we did not have breakfast included in our package we were told that we couldn t get a tea or coffee before 12pm without purchasing breakfast Also we had 2 single duvets on a double bed which was a small thing but frustrating nonetheless , The location of this hotel is absolutely perfect and enabled us to walk comfortably to every point of interest in the city There are some great restaurants and cafes right on the doorstep do not miss Glacis Beisl opposite delicious food as well as the 2 Christmas markets within 5 mins walk 
289293,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Corridors and stairways very old and outdated and rooms themselves very dark and not very attractive or well furnished Get the impression that this was once a hostel and is in the process of being refurbished The corridors and rooms themselves could do with some work to bring them up to standard and match the lobby and reception which look great , Great location in a nice part of town and 2 minutes walk from a well connected metro station Well presented reception and lobby free soft and hot drinks for all guests is a nice touch Friendly and helpful staff and a clean hotel 
289294,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, THE NOISE I really wanted to give the hotel a great score as so much is good about it but that s difficult to do when out of a 4 night stay you don t get a single good night s sleep The road noise is fine and the beds comfortable but the walls are paper thin so you can hear EVERYTHING your fellow guests are doing saying Each night we were woken up either by doors banging tv s on coughing and spluttering talking or even other guests banging walls at their noisy neighbours You might think its not the hotel s fault if our neighbours were noisy but they weren t really You should be able to have your tv on or even cough without the worry of disturbing the guests next door The double room cost under 45 per night which is brilliant for the location and everything else but take your ear plugs and probably avoid if you re a light sleeper , Lots of things to like the location is spot on right by the Volkstheater subway and the Museums Quartier and a short walk from the centre and Naschmarkt Staff were polite room and bathroom pleasant enough nice complimentary toiletries and the included hot drinks in the lobby is a nice touch The price was great for the location 
289295,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, We spent one night in an old room an executive studio presented to us as a free up grade shortly ugly thing For the upcoming nights we were moved to a renovated room after complaining We asked for an extra day and expected to have the same rate but they increased the price we took the offer just to avoid all time lost to move to another place but the level of customer service is poor Although we booked a room for 2 adults and one child breakfast included they charged us an extra amount for the kid s breakfast about 3 euros No big deal although a child s breakfast is mostly milk and cereals but they told us about this only at the check out which again is not professional , Feeling good in your room depends on how lucky you are Some are renovated and very nice some are just awfull having nothing to do with what you see in the lobby and breakfast area Nice breakfast area good breakfast Appreciate the free refreshments available for free all day long in the lobby Extremely good location just behind Museum Quartier 3 minutes from Marihilferstrasse shopping street Free overnight parking on the street during day need to buy vouchers for parking Hotel has a deal with the Leiner parking 19 eur day they have something like buy one day and next day stay as long as you need but the reception lady was not able to explain very well nor inform us beforehand

289322,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, As far as I understand there sT are only six rooms in hotel have conditioner if you are going to visit Vienna in summer you should get the info about your room everything else is just fine There is no info about conditioner on booking com , Very good location not far from city center there is museum square with small bars where you can spend some time before going to bed 
289323,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, There is no air conditioning which turns this hotel into a hell during the hot summer days and nights The hotel does not have its own parking and it is almost impossible to find a free parking lot in the neighborhood There is only a shower in the and no bathtub in the bathroom which is quite unusual for a four star hotel The rooms towards the street are extremely noisy because of the trams and the traffic the does not stop the whole night ,No Positive

289327,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier,No Negative, We loved the location the room was great and while the bed was comfy it was not brilliant We loved the free non alcoholic drinks coming back after a long day to a cool drink or a cuppa before retiring was really terrific The breakfast was disappointing for the price cheaper and tastier to eat away from the hotel Overall it was a wonderful experience we would recommend the hotel and would definitely return 
289328,Hotel ViennArt am Museumsquartier, Not what we expected from a 4 star hotel Furniture looks old and the halls look unfinished kind of under construction The room didn t have air conditioning just a ventilator Even though we asked for a double bed in advance there were only two twin beds The rooms need a major renovation as it appears they ve done with the hotel lobby to look good on photos , Good location very close to a subway station and near a shopping street
