160073,Dukes Hotel, See above, The problem is the Staff they are NOT hiring Londoner s anymore not even Brits and they know NOTHING about the City cannot even tell you where the Bus Stops are without looking at the computer Oddly enough the non European staff was better than the Eastern Europeans who absolutely didn t care about service 
160074,Dukes Hotel, Slow lift Body wash is very masculine , Quiet clean away from madding crowd but in the middle of it all Great location Fantastic speakeasy bar All staff fabulous polite and efficient 
160075,Dukes Hotel, Morning Coffee or tea in the lobby would be great , Small personal in every way Staff are polite attentive to every detail and catered to our wishes So elegant yet down to earth A C worked like a charm during the hottest temps in 40 years Super close to all the royal and governmental attractions and close to river great parks Tube lines The small discreet lobby bar is the BEST 
160076,Dukes Hotel, The price quoted by hotel over the phone was 150 pounds more than it cost me by using bookings com , Staff were exceptional Bed was amazing View of trees yet location was within walking distance of everything 
160077,Dukes Hotel, It s a little old It adds to the charm but it needs a little bit of TLC The rooms are not sound proof at all and the floors are super creaky , The bed was comfy and the staff was great It was a fairly nice room 
160078,Dukes Hotel, Nothing , The bed was super comfy and the pillows were dreamy We had clean bed linen both nights along with very soft fluffy towels and bath robes The staff are very attentive and the ambience of the hotel is traditional deferential and very comfortable I had a delicious hot chocolate as a nightcap and if money were no object would stay here every time we visit London 
160079,Dukes Hotel, A view from our room could have been better , Warmly welcoming and professional staff attractive interior and a true British atmosphere you are expecting in London 
160080,Dukes Hotel, Room size was small not a modern hotel and only one elevator which was used for both guests and staff which means you could smell food all the time , I liked the location most 
160081,Dukes Hotel, Breakfast good be improved Service a bit slow and porridge appalling, Superb lounge with wonderful martinis Hotel was very comfortable and location was superb
160082,Dukes Hotel, The entrance to the hotel is a little tight , The decor was beautiful staff were extremely helpful and friendly Beds comfy breakfast was beautiful and had gluten free bread which was superb for me overall an excellent experience we re thinking of going back later in the year 
160083,Dukes Hotel, we thought the bed rooms a bit sparse and lacking pictures Room 5 where we were did not have a particularly good out look onto a broken down wood decking next time we shall be asking for a room on the first floor maybe witha better view ,No Positive
160084,Dukes Hotel,No Negative, An excellent hotel In particular all staff including those on reception and the doormen and porters in the restaurant room service and housekeeping were very friendly helpful and efficient 
160085,Dukes Hotel, The decor in the rooms needed a refresh bathroom especially Room was too hot and it was really noisy during the night noise from the street and the lobby so we had a poor nights sleep The rest was a little disappointing The receptionist was new and failed to book a table in the bar as I requested so we had to wait , Loved the martinis as always 
160086,Dukes Hotel, Nowhere enough space for breakfast and not at all well organised or efficient Had to wait over 15 mins for a table other guests were told it would be a 20 minute wait and they went away However when we did sit down there were then 7 empty tables It was ridiculous and other guests could have been accommodated and not turned away , Very comfortable and quiet extremely well located right in the centre of London Very well appointed room and bathroom Comfortable bed and pillows 
160087,Dukes Hotel,No Negative, You feel at home with a most beautiful house in the hart of London Very elegant and totally relaxed This Hotel is now my favorit it s a pitty that I did not find it earlier 
160088,Dukes Hotel, Nothing to not like Martini s were magnificent , Everything was just as expected no surprises no negative just a traditional hotel doing what it does 
160089,Dukes Hotel, For a boutique hotel it fails the basic test it doesnt personalise the stay of each guest I have stayed at the hotel for years and still get greeted with have you stayed with us before doormen etc are excellent because they recognise you but front desk and management missing in action, Great location nice bar if you can get a table
160090,Dukes Hotel, The pulled pork sandwich was not pleasant , The staff were outstanding the room was spotless and the bed very comfortable Warm atmosphere throughout the hotel 
160091,Dukes Hotel,No Negative, Very helpful friendly staff Lucica Marian and Cristina really made our stay extra special The room was spotlessly clean and the bed very comfortable The arrangements of fresh flowers throughout the hotel was a lovely touch 
160092,Dukes Hotel, mini bar prices excessive, quiet efficient professional old fashioned service wonderful bed soft towels crisp linen Best vodka martini s in the world
160093,Dukes Hotel, It would of been courteous and far less embarrassing if the reception staff who directed me to the cocktail bar had informed me that I needed to wear a shirt this I respect but to be told in front of other guests once inside the door was embarrassing I had only just arrived and had not had time to consider the dress code The air conditioning could of been better as I could not get the room temp low enough and the Windows did not stay open, Bed was comfy
160094,Dukes Hotel, Staff run my room upon leaving as they wanted to reassure that nothing had been taken from the mini bar Sorry but I cant say that their attitude when approaching guests has much in common with a five star hotel Gladly all where intact , Very close at all shopping in Mayfair
160095,Dukes Hotel, The telephone Internet and lights did not work correctly when we arrived They were rectified rapidly but it made for a somewhat bumpy start From then on all was excellent ,No Positive
160096,Dukes Hotel, Beds were not good Staff is inconsistent Very expensive and therefore staff should be top notch , Location size of hotel Lovely small boutique property 
160097,Dukes Hotel, The bedrooms bathrooms feel a little dull and tired and in need of re decoration Our bath drained away slowly and maintenance had to be called to reset the aircon in our son s room the gentleman arrived very promptly , The hotel is beautifully located the welcome is always warm and the bar lounge areas always a joy to visit 
160098,Dukes Hotel, Room not ready at check in time even though I had called the day before to ensure it would be I had to change for a customer meeting They mixed up on the morning room service requirements and newspaper What I booked as a double was more like a small single , Stylish and very clean lovely staff and very good restaurant and food Great location 
160099,Dukes Hotel, It is always difficult finding a table in the bar and the lounge does not have such a convivial atmosphere for having a drink , The quiet location within a cul de sac
160100,Dukes Hotel, The gym was very small was underground and smelt of cigarette smoke therefore I did not use it even though I intended to use the gym during my stay , Very convenient location Very good breakfast Very nice bathroom 
160101,Dukes Hotel, Room description included a kettle and air con Temperature in the room was 26 7 deg and couldn t get AC working No kettle or T C making kit Eventually moved me to a room with working AC and supplied a kettle I had a cup and T C in my bag so all okay Couldn t get TV to work in room 2 but by that time too tired with jet lag to bother This was an expensive treat for me after 21 days travelling all over the world I was disappointed at that price it was not perfect , Room service produced an excellent simple supper and the price was fairly reasonable Good recovery from problems described here 
160102,Dukes Hotel, The wifi system never did work well for us as it requires a new login everytime its used and half the time we couldn t log in Also we received an emergency call in the middle of the night and the room phones weren t functioning so we didn t get a notice until morning via a note from the front desk Also the bathroom cold water faucet leaked every time it was used and created a bit of a mess in the bathroom We notified the front desk twice but they never addressed the issue while we were there during our five day stay so we just dealt with it , Great location central to most sightseeing options restaurant was excellent along with the bar Exactly what we were looking for 
160103,Dukes Hotel, 1 Very small rooms but adequate 2 WiFi is inconsistent 3 Bar is overpriced, 1 Location location location 2 Charm of the building and decor 3 Good bathroom and shower 4 Comfortable bed 5 Very helpful staff
160104,Dukes Hotel, The redone rooms are soulless no character at all The hotel had the type of room I liked and it was empty for my stay but would not upgrade without charging me I saw one of the rooms terrible location where the people smoke and drink outside your window the other perfect The room I was given faced a brick wall This is how they treat someone who has been staying there for 25 years They did even know I had stayed there before till they looked it up After I asked to cancel my reservation to shorten my state I was given the better room You have to book a table in the bar even if you are guest The martinis are famous now I understand but shouldn t a guest be able to enjoy a glass a wine in the bar area I walked over to the Stafford hotel at breakfast time It was full of guests full of life and delightfully tasteful Breakfast is included Not at Dukes Frankly I walk to The Wolsey restaurant and have a live y breakfast at half the price better toast and an atmosphere that is lovely Dukes breakfast room is so dead you feel you must whisper The same when you order tea in the lounge The staff is nice and helpful but it has lost its charm , I like the location stayed here for over 25 years 
160105,Dukes Hotel, Not as good as it should be given the price For a boutique hotel staff should be more switched on and attentive to guests, Location is great Rooms comfortable but small bar has a great reputation but gets very crowded and even if you are a guest there is no guarantee you will get a table
