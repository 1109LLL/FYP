203844,Le Pradey, The staff were lukewarm They didn t want to be there Horribly understaffed I think they only had 5 people working there at one shift One staffer forgot to load a luggage in the shuttle and we had to go back for it nearly missing our flight out This was really unforgivable We were lucky the driver of the taxi shuttle was so nice and accommodating It felt horribly over priced for what you get You are essentially paying for location That s it You can get more from other properties in the city , Location is amazing especially for Paris first timers shoppers and museum lovers It s very central and you can walk all over Paris from this location and I mean everywhere The toiletries from Juliette has a gun is all sorts of amazing Buy it if you can at the main store in Malsherbes sorry if I misspelled Tea from Kusmi and nespresso were great but it s not in your room You have to go to the lounge Design is great Sheets are good and comfortable It was clean and cozy 
203845,Le Pradey, The breakfast was very poor value for money located in a small cramped room However this did not spoil our experience and would definitely return but eat breakfast else where , The Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly The room was clean modern and the bedding and bed were super comfortable with white crip bedding 
203846,Le Pradey,No Negative, We loved the location of Le Pradey It was so easy to walk everywhere we never took public transportation The staff was exceptional and very friendly The roads were blocked for a marathon and one of the staff was so nice to help roll our luggage to the nearest cross street to meet our taxi to the train station We will definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again on our next visit to Paris 
203847,Le Pradey, The hotel pictures wasnt that clear I booked the Cabaret room accroding to the very nice pictures posted on the website but the bathroom has no door Its next to the bed Every time i showered i need to opened the windows which across the room next to the bed It would be better if i traveled with my husband with this room Unfortunately i traveled with my 2 little kids Also the suite room doesnt provide a water kettle , Excellent location if you are tourists and want to shop There is a grocery near by and surrounded by many restaurants The bed is comfortable The front desk is helpful have very friendly customer service unlike other french hotels that i had stayed before 
203848,Le Pradey,No Negative, The staff couldn t have been friendlier or more accommodating they were perfect The location was excellent being a few minutes walking distance to the Louve and easy access to two metro stations to navigate the city I will definitely return to this hotel whenever I visit again 
203849,Le Pradey, Extremely expensive for what was offered Room had a theme which was nice but was quite old and looked a tad shabby 470 per night and breakfast NOT included but they don t tell you this till you leave At which point they charge you another 75 per night for city tax and breakfast No tea or coffee making facilities in room Room service is lazy as they could not be bothered to replace our dirty wine glasses with clean ones nor to replace the mini complimentary water bottles that we used on first evening there Breakfast was quite nice but not worth the money they charged Even an expensive restaurant would of been cheaper An extremely disappointing experience , The location was great 
203850,Le Pradey, No other room to place things smaller bed Queen would accommodate some space in the room itself maybe some shelves in the bathroom to accommodate toiletries , King Size Bed good sized bathroom 
203851,Le Pradey, If I stayed at Le Pradey again I d put out the extra money for a larger room , The hotel is charming and the staff very nice The location is convenient especially for those who ve never been to Paris and want to see major tourist attractions 
203852,Le Pradey,No Negative, Excellent location close to the louvre and Tuileries Garden Great places to eat around the area Comfortable room clean bed Great service reception very friendly and helpful 
203853,Le Pradey, Bed was hard and room was small which seems to be very typical for France and even Europe So these are very minor complaints , Wonderful and helpful staff Very nice hotel in a great location near the metro and Paris sights 
203854,Le Pradey,No Negative, Really loved the place Staff is incredibely friendly and helpfull bathroom was brandnew and room very cute and clean Finally found a new home in Paris 
203855,Le Pradey, Not one single complaint It was great price great location great staff We had a wonderful experience , Perfect location Staff was wonderful friendly and very helpful Jardin de Tuileries was at the end of the street We had a sunset picnic there brought food from shop around the corner watching the sun set behind the Eiffel Tower It was our favorite stay on our European vacation 
203856,Le Pradey,No Negative, Wonderful boutique hotel that was centrally located A short walk to everything we wanted to see and also close to the station so we could pop to Versailles for a day trip Helpful and friendly staff Excellent restaurant recommendations provided Cute and well appointed rooms that made for a very comfortable stay Would definitely return 
203857,Le Pradey, We were given the number to the wrong room so when a cleaner opened it for us and we went in there was another couple there No one came up to rectify and we found our room by ourselves The cleaner blocked the lift with a laundry bag so guests had to wait 10 minutes downstairs for the lift No tea and coffee in the rooms, Quirky hotel and arty decor close to the Louvre and lots of great restaurants within a 10 20minute walk Helpful staff Lovely mezzanine area with tea and coffee
203858,Le Pradey, Little slowly internet but it s not important for us, Perfect location good room in 6 th floor has 2 floors in first bathroom down stairs bedroom Very delicious breakfast was included Free tea and coffee any time
203859,Le Pradey, nothing really the room was a bit small but that is usual for paris i imagine as my wife and i are not the tallest the low ceilings did not bother us if you are taller than 1 75m then the shower will be claustrophobic , I really liked the attitude of all the staff Very nice and very pleasant Love the cleanliness of the room and especially the bathroom 
203860,Le Pradey,No Negative, Staff were exceptionally friendly Lovely little hotel in a good location very good value for money in comparison with other hotels in Paris Would definitely visit again 
203861,Le Pradey,No Negative, They are so friendly and I fell like a home When they know we are here to celebrate our 10th anniversary they gave us a surprise for a warmly handwriting card and a bottle of champagne Such a great place 
203862,Le Pradey, there is nothing that l did not like, the location is great Staff is very helpful The reception wrote a personalised christmas card with handwriting amazing wi fi is working perfect
203863,Le Pradey, Breakfast variety varied according to which staff memebr that was present that day which was a pitty , Great value for money and location and great that coffee and tea were offered free of charge at all times 
203864,Le Pradey, the room space is small also the breakfast room the internet was very slow when uploading images and videos , The staff is friendly and helpful the location is great and close to many attractions the breakfast is simple and delicious 
203865,Le Pradey, The room was very small We could not find space for our luggage Bathroom too No breakfast for this price Come on Many hidden charges especially if you have kids I ended up paying almost double of what I expected I think you would find other less expensive and higher quality hotels in the same area , Location
203866,Le Pradey, Our room was quirky but a little small in the sleeping area but very comfortable, The staff were very pleasant and helpful The hotel is in an excellent location for visiting all the main tourist sites and close to Tuileries gardens This was our second stay 
203867,Le Pradey, Very small room breakfast small restaurant tiny room with lots off tables when we arrived on the tables were rest of breakfast of the guests before us there were no bread and coffee machine didnt have water so we couldnt prepare coffe only one member of the staff were there and poor woman couldnt do all that alone at least 2 3 people should work there, Bed was very comfortable hotel is 5 10 minutes walking to Louvre Nice and polite stuff
203868,Le Pradey,No Negative, Great location Cute boutique hotel We booked the Caberet suite for extra space which helped Funky decor but not necessarily the most functional room which could be frustrating Can be rather noisy with windows open for fresh air Good overall stay though 
203869,Le Pradey, Shower small but that was my only complaint Not a big deal I know it s not the same as North American standards, Amazing location in the heart of The Louvre and close to so many restaurants including all the high end shopping We actually got an amazing price during the time we visited Usually the price comes out to 400 night Canadian on other times bit we were able to get a standard bedroom for less then 400 night Canadian not included taxes and vat fees yet Our hotel was super clean only downside is that it was small for 2 people and I had no where to place my luggage as we had 2 medium sized luggage The shower was a bit small as well when I turn my butt can touch the wall and the rain shower head was going everywhere and made the floors wet Therefore I had to use the hand held shower instead to wash myself But then again this is still pretty good for Europe size I come from Canada where space in hotels are rather large and spacious and I understand Europe size standards are different Overall My experience in this hotel was excellent and the staff was so helpful Especially one name Dogan who helped me over email before my trip and even when I arrived Oh and don t forget hot tea and coffee is free on the mezzanine level Breakfast is extra charge but we never ate at the hotel restaurant since there were so many great places to eat surrounding our hotel
