22525,Bradford Elys es Astotel,No Negative, Staff and accomodations were great Precious boutique hotel in a charming area lots of cafes and shops in walking distance Will definitely book again 
22526,Bradford Elys es Astotel, Garret room was hot when A C had pro blems temp got into upper 80 s even after midnight but no price rebate given Room bed not made well no turn down chocolates etc because we were above the top floor of elevator and maid couldn t bother climbing from floor 5 to floor 6 bathroom had two steps up right next to sink and toilet crying out for a misstep at night And this for 300 night at a supposed 4 star hotel We won t come back , Location cleanliness spacious room 
22527,Bradford Elys es Astotel,No Negative, Fabulous centrally located hotel The rooms were large and luxurious as were the bathrooms Breakfast was great and we were pleased to have access to a free mini bar and free drinks and nibbles in the dining room The staff were very pleasent and helpful
22528,Bradford Elys es Astotel, Not their fault but the bar was closed due to a burst pipe lifting the wood floor Nothing else you could fault them for , Great hotel in a fantastic location just 7 minute walk to the Champs Elysee Very helpful staff and very clean hotel Great choice for breakfast Some really great bistro s just outside the hotel 
22529,Bradford Elys es Astotel, Nothing to suggest , The breakfast was the best I have had in France and it was nice to be served tea and coffee at our table The room was a good size clean and nicely furnished We could even see the Tours Eiffel from our bedroom window if we poked our heads out 
22530,Bradford Elys es Astotel,No Negative, Spacy rooms as for Paris small balcony very good noise cancellation due to double windows wooden and plastic free minibar and free snackbar in all of the Astotel hotels network make it a perfect place to relax and have a nice stay in Paris 
22531,Bradford Elys es Astotel, A bit pricy , Slept like a log due to a very comfy bed firm mattress two single duvets not one large double Good size room and bathroom Nice breakfast Nice staff speaks English We thought it a very good concept that there is a free soft drink minibar in the room a free variety of snacks fruit and non alcoholic beverages near the reception area and that the quest are welcome to visit the other Astotels 6 7 ish of them in Paris I think to use lavatories and have some water coffee tea and a snack 
22532,Bradford Elys es Astotel, The location just off Champs d Elysees is great for visiting the famous street and surrounding monuments l Arc de Triomphe etc However it s an extremely busy area of Paris with heavy traffic It s a must see but for my next trip I would rather stay near Montmartre or somewhere less congested , The hotel is beautiful Rooms are huge by Paris standards with modern decor The common areas are also beautifully decorated and facilities are great free coffee tea snacks all day in the team room Staff were exceptional 
22533,Bradford Elys es Astotel, There was no air conditioning in the bedrooms as the system was still on the winter setting which meant we were too warm at night during the spell of warm weather , We loved the stylsh decor and old lift We enjoyed the complimentary drinks and snacks throughout the day the great breakfast spread and evening honesty bar The staff were friendly and helpful 
22534,Bradford Elys es Astotel, Local Traffic noise at times was a little excessive With car horns sounding late at night particularly on Friday and Saturday , The breakfast was sensational made from local produce and beautifully presented

22547,Bradford Elys es Astotel, The street is quiet which is a good thing as it is not noisy at night however it can be unsafe for women alone to be outside late at night or very early in the morning Overall nothing negative to say at all , The bed was extra comfy and the staff did everything possible to assist us The rooms are a great size and we had a balcony The hotel offers free mini bar which is great and also free snacks after 12pm in the restaurant croissants cheese biscuits whatever you like this was a great service to have after a long day out We would stay again in a heart beat 
22548,Bradford Elys es Astotel,No Negative, This is my second stay here The rooms are big with an old world field but with all the mod cons Lots of little extras make it a great place to stay

22555,Bradford Elys es Astotel, The staff were haughty and rude which when one is paying 400 a night is really uncalled for Please avoid this hotel if you have a choice it is really not worth the money and as Stephanie who can look down her nose at you from about 100 feet was quick to inform me you pay extra for breakfast Bend over , It is located near to many major attractions in Paris 
22556,Bradford Elys es Astotel, Breakfast wasn t included in the room rate, The rooms were big and well appointed Staff went out of their way for us Added bonuses a help yourself bar where you record your drinks and give the record to reception Also a salon to help yourself to tea coffee juice and snacks free of charge 
22557,Bradford Elys es Astotel, The room service dinner was very poor Tough chicken chicken vegetables and salad swimming in oil We were told breakfast was free by a clerk Upon checking out we were told it was not My friend didn t like her room she described it as small with an attic All 3 of us tripped at different times after the last step exiting the elevator , The general area and 1 very nice upgraded room 
22558,Bradford Elys es Astotel, If I must complain then it s the Breakfast not included I suppose , I booked this hotel from reading the reviews and I can honestly say thank you to those of you who left reviews as they were honestly honest I was a little concerned as it was a weekend with my 23 year old son It is a lovely little hotel perfectly situated with great staff free internet and complimentary tea and coffee with light snacks all afternoon Walking out the door there are lots of nice bistros and it s within walking distance to almost everything I most certainly will return A big thank you to all the staff for making our 5 day stay just perfect

22564,Bradford Elys es Astotel, Bathroom very small for standing of hotel probably due to limitations of a period building but new cute and efficient Lack of storage space for a couple staying a few nights especially missing a chest of drawers but room spacious size somewhat compensated, Very tasteful decoration in this newly refurbished hotel in lobby and bar as well as the room in a charming 20th century building Adrien at r ception was extremely nice helpful and professional We were upgraded for free without asking upon arrival Very quiet and very central location close to shopping sightseeing and metro Spacious room Comfortable beds Free soft drinks in room Minibar and complimentary snacks tea coffee in breakfeast room all day
