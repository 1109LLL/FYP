384802,ARCOTEL Wimberger,No Negative, Very gooood breakfast Quite nice room with 21 TV EN GER channels Additionally sauna and Jacuzzi on 7th floor Very professional personnel Hotel very good located close to metro station and Billa shop 
384803,ARCOTEL Wimberger, The hotel is located at one of the busiest roads in town To have a room located at the street side is a night mare in case you want to sleep with the window open , The breakfast was extra extraordinary good A large buffet with everything on it For somebody who gets sick and tired of eating a schnitzel should try the fine food in the hotels restaurant 
384804,ARCOTEL Wimberger, The hairdryer was a little bit broken Hair dryer got overheated easily generally speaking within three seconds and the hairdryer will shut down due to overheated , Breakfast The breakfast was amazing High quality buffet good location very near to the Vienna West train station and there is also a nearby metro and tram station within 100 m You can go to every popular tourist attraction in Vienna within half an hour High quality room The guest room was spacious and there was a bathtub in the restroom By the way room guest can also use the fitness machine for free friendly staffs The reception steps were always very kind and the patient

384807,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Annoying sideways shower, A really good breakfast Friendly service from Dulip Quiet room Option not to have room serviced Location brilliant for our hockey tournament but in poor area
384808,ARCOTEL Wimberger, BIG minus Noise in the room the whole time we had a noise above or room like a train was driving over our heads This absolutely not what you want in a room where you need to sleep I believe there was a storage or something above us Our complain was not picked up by the staff I assume they did not take action because the hotel was fully booked But There was NO communication at all regarding our remark complain towards us in the 3 days we stayed there Therefor a lower score on comfort and staff please bring the style of the hotel to this century Many times we had the feeling we where on the set of the TV show Derrick , the service at the breakfast in amazing great and friendly service and the kitchen staff has a good eye on keeping the buffet freshly filled Amazing how much energy these people have in the early morning at arrival your suitcases are brought to your room parking direct under the hotel They offer this in a great priced package Room breakfast and parking We ate at the restaurant full house Nice local food fair portions but on the expensive side 
384809,ARCOTEL Wimberger, The beds weren t particularly comfortable and only one pillow each The spa facilities were really poor with no changing facilities and the hot tub was cold , The staff were really friendly and helpful There was a huge selection for breakfast
384810,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Wifi doesn t work inside the rooms that is something I haven t seen in a while , It was the best choice for a hotel in Vienna for New Year in terms of prices as close to the center as possible It is opposite a metro station so it s quick for getting into the city center app 10 min ride 
384811,ARCOTEL Wimberger, The double bed was to small we had only one bedside table because one side of the bed was pressed against the wall which is not very nice considering the cleanliness of the wall All in all the comport of the stay depends on the type of the room you will get , The staff was very nice and helpful Excellent breakfast and overall service Clean bathroom Very good metro connection 
384812,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Cleanliness could have been lot better The basic utilities were also not replaced and replenished everyday Attention to detail was completely missing, The location was not great Not close to any attraction or tourist spot Just accessible to the tram and underground station
384813,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Two single beds stuck together instead of a double which is more common than I would like it to be Must have been on a route to a hospital due to the frequent 3 4 times a day passing of sirens Could have been a bit more quiet , Convenient location for public transport Soft bed Nice bathroom Clean 
384814,ARCOTEL Wimberger, There was no complimentary soap shampoo and other toiletries in the bathroom and coffe tea facilities in the room on the second floor, the room and breakfast parlour were excellent
384815,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Nothing , got upgraded to junior suite absolutely great Spacious comfortable sitting area separate bedroom area excellent bathroom Couldn t have asked for more 
384816,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Quality of the general condition The cost of parking , Perfect location if you go to the concert of Wiener Stadthalle Amazing breakfast offer 
384817,ARCOTEL Wimberger, The rooms a very worn including the bath They took out the mini bars from the rooms so no fridge and no drinks in the room The windows are locked so you can not properly open them , Good breakfast and very Close to the public Transport and the Train Station Plenty of Restaurants around nice hotel bar 
384818,ARCOTEL Wimberger, no tea and coffee facilities in the room, all very nice comfy rooms nice and well equipped bathrooms good working WIFI just a few meters away from the U Bahn station safe underground parking
384819,ARCOTEL Wimberger, I confirmed the arrival at 2am via Booking com e mail as this hotel has a 24 hour reception Upon arrival I was informed that my reservation was cancelled due to their policy of cancelling if a guest doesn t show up until 6pm That wasn t mentioned anywhere and is directly opposite of what was agreed with the staff So I had to pay directly to the hotel and not via booking com whatsoever which costed me 50 EUR more than what it should have costed 200 vs 150 EUR As a sign of their hospitality they upgraded the room to a better one Comfort Deluxe Room What can you do at 2am but accept the terms of the hotel which purposely avoided Booking com rules with a made up story , Location heating cleanliness
384820,ARCOTEL Wimberger, The room was very noisy A lot of activity outside the hotel, Staff is excellent Very helpful specially the manager Thank you for everything The breakfast is very good The restaurant is excellent 
384821,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Location is far away from city center for a walk But metro is 2 minutes , Hotel was clean and and staff was friendly Liked the fitness room do not expect too much but it was enough for me Breakfast was wonderful Metro is very closed There are also local restaurants cafes around the hotel 
384822,ARCOTEL Wimberger, The hotel was a bit tired and didn t feel like a four star property Although very handy for the Westbahnhof the area is not Vienna s most salubrious , Breakfast was excellent and the staff in the restaurant very friendly and helpful Most of the staff on reception were also friendly and very accommodating 
384823,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Too small restaurant for breakfast We had to wait for table to eat breakfast what is really uncomfortable Wi fi in room had a very poor range Parking EXTREMELY overpriced , Good variety of food on breakfast Cardio equipment on gym was good quality and crew took care to deliver towels and water to the gym 
384824,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Our stay was short We wanted to stay longer , The staff is so friendly and accommodating Always bright and cheerful At first they said they overbooked and our room wasn t available then they bumped up our reservation and upgraded us to a bigger deluxe Wow The room is spacious bed is plush and overall so comfortable I don t know why they say that the rooms facing the main street are noisy because we didn t experience any noise like that The location is perfect as well There s a BILLA supermarket beside it it s right in front of a major public tram terminal Urban Loritz Platz and we had our first schnitzel that was so amazing just nearby One of the best joys we always look forward to in every trip breakfast buffets I m so glad this place offers their guests with such a high level of service that we have our own pitchers of strong coffee and hot chocolate to ourselves on our table When you start your day so happy and satisfied it makes everything feel so perfect 
384825,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Wifi in my room was always unconnectable this sucks We asked hotel to solve this but it didn t improve at all, great location not far from schloss schonbrunn and easy acess to inner city great staff really friendly 
384826,ARCOTEL Wimberger, the Wifi was very bad in one of our rooms we booked two double rooms except in the bathroom while in the other room was fine The location itself is not a just walking distance to action places but you need to ride once or even more It can t be really negative if you enjoy riding trams and like to have a look on city streets it s a nice experience in Vienna anyway the normal double room not the special room came with no shampoo there s the shower gel of course that is shampoo as well but not all things granted in the special room no fridge and weak WiFi but no really difference in size or any other thing We booked both that s why it was easy to compare, Wonderful breakfast with lots of varieties It s kind of a hotel where you feel delighted you stay in Clean one respectful staff location can be both good or bad There s a tram station infront of the hotel It s one tram station from westbahnhof where Mariahilfer street starts and you can take tram from there to the nearest point in center Volkstheater and Dr Karl Renner The Spa was also free It s recommended place and was a very nice experience 
384827,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Check in procedure is unnecessarily complicated They would want to know exactly who stays in which room and accordingly note down the details of the individuals They would also reserve certain amount on the card in case of exigencies something which could be avoided Bed was a little too soft for my liking bathroom glass partition seemed to be weakly held by its holders , Staff was very friendly and helpful Hotel located right next to Billa supermarket tram station and metro station 
384828,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Overall appearance hotel needs refurbishment and most staff need better training in order make customers welcome , Location good and staff helpful though some were somewhat gruff
384829,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Problem with safe in the room , Spacious room comfortable beds fast reliable wi fi excellent breakfast and convenient parking garage Perfect location of the hotel close to Mariahilferstra e 
384830,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Slow connection 4th floor A sofa was nice in the room but I would really need a desk and one chair for it , Excellent beds 4th floor quiet despite street nice bathroom Brilliant location for us coming from Hauptbahnhof a direct tram no 18 Tram 49 straight to center Walking distance to main shopping 
384831,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Wifi connection was dropping off too often The strenght of the signal wasnot good enough to cover all rooms and each time you need to put your username and password to connect , Value for money Clean rooms nice staff horrible internet 
384832,ARCOTEL Wimberger, I liked the hotel in general but I would like to see more friendly behavior from some of the staff on the reception , My room was noticeably large and clean the toilet was clean and the water was hot and the pressure was high The location is excellent for middle eastern food lovers like Turkish and Persian Very near to tram station Subway Bila supermarket and the hotel car park was superb Breakfast was also very good 
384833,ARCOTEL Wimberger, The area outside the hotel was not too clean and shops close quite early , The hotel was great especially the staff and breakfast was generous Around the hotel are trams that take you to Schonbrunn Westbahnhof and also Museum Quarter Connections are frequent and very efficient 
384834,ARCOTEL Wimberger,No Negative, A great hotel with nice and friendly staff Very clean The room has airco heater built in It is 10 minutes walking from Webstbannhoff metro train station which has a huge shopping mall with all the stuff you would need Just upon arrival remember to tell the reception you would like to opt out from 2 things 1 Hotel breakfast it costs 22 euro and is absolutely unnecessary There is a Subway Sandwich in front of the hotel and a nice cheap super market Billa at the corner of the street where you can buy anything you need for a full breakfast much much cheaper Tell the reception you will not need breakfast from the hotel 2 Mini bar in the room Mini bar in the room is a small fridge and the reception asks for a 40 euro deposit in case you consume anything from mini bar during your stay But a bottle of water in the mini bar costs around 4 euro It s pretty expensive and unnecessary Tell the reception you will not consume anything from mini bar and keep it so Buy your own drinks from the supermarket at the corner Billa and keep them cold inside the mini bar You won t need to pay anything for using the mini bar 
384835,ARCOTEL Wimberger, I was badly injured when a heavy shower screen came off the bathroom wall hitting me on the head cutting and bruising me and rendering me unconscious Before the hotel staff would call a doctor they wanted to see my passport which they had already seen at check in and told me that each visit by the doctor would cost me 200 The accident and the concussion that followed totally spoilt our break The hotel refunded 50 of my room costs but not those of my friend who stayed in the hotel to care for me and arranged a taxi for me to see some of the sights of Vienna before it was time to go home but our stay was ruined, The restaurant staff were very friendly and helpful in spite of massive overcrowding in the breakfast room
384836,ARCOTEL Wimberger, The staff were quite busy because it was fully booked , I like the room Adequate space and the free wifi Location is ok near the train stations Liitle walk to the shooping district 
384837,ARCOTEL Wimberger, There was no iron in the room and it was not possible to get one even by request which is starnge for me , Hotel is nice and clean stuff was friendly and helpfull Location is good 5 minutes to get to the underground station Westbahnhof 10 15 minutes trip to city center Plus there is a airport shuttle near the train station Westbahnhof which goes every 30 minutes and takes about 45 minutes and 8 euro to get to the airport I was surprized that schedule of the buses is really being followed I was upgraded for better room for free Good value for money for your trip to Vienna 
384838,ARCOTEL Wimberger, The bed was a disaster way too soft matrasses to even think about sleeping properly parking costs horrendous room with poor features noise from the main road very disturbing, Location is good
384839,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Nothing to complaint about , This is at a very convenient location Front office staff was very helpful and go out of the way to assist you Most of all accidentally I left a ring in my room when i checkout and later was handed over to the front office by the room service Closer to Westbahnhof where the airport bus taxis train and trams can be taken to any location Closer to branded shopping in Mariahilfer Strabe 
384840,ARCOTEL Wimberger, More English channel on TV , Room bright and reception was really sweet and cute Bathroom was clean Theres free apples Friendly staff Walking distance to Westbanhnof Really convenient WIFI excellent

384844,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Terrible staff Very rude No wifi connection in the rooms even though it states they have wifi We had to use the lobby When we complained they did nothing not even change our room Extremely poor customer service The business center computers were old slow and poor internet connection When I asked a question at the front desk they were very short and abrupt When I checked out the clerk rolled her eyes and looked at her coworker as if she was annoyed with me I will say the restaurant service was very good and excellent breakfast buffet but very rude front desk concierge , Rooms were clean Breakfast buffet very good value and selection Outside the city center but across from bus and train
384845,ARCOTEL Wimberger, The staff was unfriendly and not helpful Booking com didn t offer the best price compared to the hotel The room which they said was an upgrade wasn t anything special If the room was accordingly an upgrade they have some work to do ,No Positive

384847,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Kamers 215 outdated No internet available at all or very very limited Difficult if you have to work Complaint but appaerently I was the only Bed was old could feel the feathers No power plugs Not even at the buro they were all occupied by lamp and tel No computer lan cable Batroom disaster by shower Was leakage so every shower ended in a water basin on the floor no minibar or anything, Breakfast was very good
384848,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Elevators are old and sometimes give horrible sounds The interior of elevators need refurbishing The attitude of some staff No kettle for coffee or tea making in the room If you ask about hot water then you have to go down yourself to the restaurant to get it with a long face of the waiter The carpet of some areas in the corridors of to the room are dirty stained and need to be replaced , Location very close to the Underground Westbhanhof UBhan and lots of trams The cleanliness breakfast and attitude of most of the staff are amazing The hotel continues the same standard of very good services as of my previous stay in the year 2002 and the year 2007 
384849,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Pillows are too thin I needed to put two on top of each other and still it was somewhat uncomfortable , Comfort deluxe room is a perfect choice for a solo business traveler Although the room was overlooking a main road there was no big noise coming from outside 
384850,ARCOTEL Wimberger,No Negative, Very good breakfast with variety of products incl soya lactosfree and glutenfree rice cake It s good to know for those who are intolerant to milk and gluten like me Clean room Close to the shopping street and just a few meters from the metro between 2 metro stops Reasonable price Nice spa area with tea available at the entrance Fresh apples are at the reception Not far from the hotel is Iranian restaurant Pars with a very good food One more Hatam a few metro stops from the hotel and much less people but very good food for those who like Persian cuisine

384861,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Location from the hotel to the subway station or to the tram station you have to go past a park didn t look safe, Wellness was really good as well as the small cardio room
384862,ARCOTEL Wimberger, Would have liked if they reminded me about 15 euro charge for breakfast at check in Could use more towels in bathroom Also the pillows on the bed were very small and flat Also the staff could be more knowledgeable about public transport I was asking about whether Ubahn was a good way to get somewhere and they said that I should just walk because ubahn was not close to location However I found out later that the 49 tram went right from hotel to my location and would have saved me the long walk had they told me , I liked the location near the ubahn and trams The location was pretty clean and the rooms were nice size
