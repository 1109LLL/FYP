283649,Vienna Sporthotel, Everything was perfect, Subway and tram stations are just 5 min away and it takes just 15 minutes to city center from this quiet neighborhood Breakfast was perfect rooms are large and comfortable personnel is kind hotel has its own garage 20 minutes walking distance to Ernst Happel Stadium 
283650,Vienna Sporthotel, Nothing , I wanted somewhere that s close to the airport but still not so far from the main attractions and this was a good option for that It had a lot of facilities but unfortunately I didn t have time to use them The room was very spacious 
283651,Vienna Sporthotel, WIFI sucks at this place Definitely not suitable for business use I mean to work on your notebook , Breakfast was nice although the coffee cups are smaller than the latte that comes out of the coffee machine Metro is walking distance We attended a conference which was just round the corner so for us the location was perfect Since the underground operates fairly long it s all right if you d go sight seeing 
283652,Vienna Sporthotel, The wifi was too slow and most times did not work unless you are in the Lobby or breakfast area , Excellent staff lovely breakfast comfy bed very very neat rooms especially the bathrooms close to both bus and underground train stations Would highly recommend it 
283653,Vienna Sporthotel, 1 On the second morning after my stay 7 00 or 9 00 There are employees who knock on my door to clean the room it s OK I know but I mean it s 7 00 7 00 7 00 7 00 Who will get up at seven o clock during the holiday after 7 00 was awakened I decided try to sleep again and then 9 00 someone to knock on the door again again again It made me headache for all the day If you decide to stay here be sure to hanging the brand do not disturb 2 Wi fi in here is really poor The first night I stay here I have no connection success for wifi while I think maybe the password they give me is not right so I give up Second day I ask the staff for a new password actually it is the same one for yesterday it is not work again so I go to the front desk meet two girls have the same connection problem but the staff in reception insist that our phone is set incorrectly however what I use is Iphone 6s maybe it s old yes it s old Ok , The overall environment of the hotel is good for me a single traveler everything is ok Maybe the location is a little bit far away from the center of Wien but the subway is very convenient so it s not a big deal 
283654,Vienna Sporthotel,No Negative, Clean and comfortable Helpful staff Good WiFi Good proximity to the International Bus Station and the U3 city transport line usage of fitness room and Sauna included in the price great amenities 
283655,Vienna Sporthotel, Nothing really It has been great Location is not the greatest but it s still great In all honesty the price is more than fair and I m sure to come here again I d love to use the facilities , I liked the room very much I was actually surprised D Unfortunately me my girlfriend were in Vienna Sporthotel for a single night so I didn t really get to take any pictures as we were in a rush The bed was great and you have 3 small dressers closets for your stuff which is an important thing for me Even though I didn t get to utilize that Breakfast is great as well Everything is clean and nicely presented 
283656,Vienna Sporthotel, The swimming pool was closed which was a shame The air con was stuck on warm it was already very hot in Vienna The sauna is mixed is also nude only so be prepared if you re from the UK , The hotel is a little out of the city but very close to the metro so getting in out is very easy The hotel although sports orientated is in need of some updating The room was very spacious but very basic 
283657,Vienna Sporthotel, Empty soft soup bottle was not replaced during two days Laundry room from time to time was not clean enough , Metro is very close to the hotel It just about 3 4 metro station to the center Good room WiFi laundry room 
283658,Vienna Sporthotel, The quality of this hotel was completely changed in last few years I was in this hotel many times But now it is really not good one I will never come to this hotel in future I think 4 hotel must manage availability of soap in room somehow Shower head shouldn t be broken And vegetables from rubber are absolutely not eatable I also think that it is impossible that in 4 some dishes are finished and nobody manage to change them , There is sauna swimming pool golf tennis and a lot of more offers for sport and health
283659,Vienna Sporthotel, smoking smell all over main part of reception that was totally surprising while hotel name is Soprthotel Another thing was breakfast Organization of all breakfast would need to overlook by management Today it is outdated and can not serve people even not at high season , Very helpful people in reception U bahn station at 500 m Our room was suited very well non smokers part 
283660,Vienna Sporthotel, The building and interior is old Yet everyhing is clean , Location is close to downtown central vienna Stuff is very kind and friendly Priceworth 
283661,Vienna Sporthotel, Could do with better spread for breakfast Could also do with an electric kettle within the room for complimentary tea and coffee especially during winter , Good value for money for an expensive city like Vienna Much appreciated late checkout without extra charge until 3pm as our flight out of Vienna was 6 30pm 
283662,Vienna Sporthotel, Receptionists mistook our reservation with someone else s It took quite long to solve this problem I booked two different rooms and the names were mixed up too So my friends had to pay my room which is more expensive I handed the difference to him though , Parking garage next to the hotel But very tight Pets are free Close to motorway

283667,Vienna Sporthotel, No bathtub shower only There were a few steps from the bathroom to the bed although the room had a very fresh modern feel and the steps looked good we had to be very careful not to fall down them in the dark , Gym facilities and helpful staff 
283668,Vienna Sporthotel, Very poor breakfast Beeing a Sporthotel the breakfast did not correspond to the image Sweetbread and m sli with chocolate Nontasty cheese and can pinaple Smell of smoke all over the hotel Smoking should be banned in a Sporthotel , Big room Pool 
283669,Vienna Sporthotel, Near to a noisy street so one cannot sleep with an open window , The main attraction of the hotel is the swimming pool During the summer time and if the Sun shines it is very pleasant The children had fun the water is deep for small children so take care

283672,Vienna Sporthotel, My luggage did not arrive and so I needed toothbrush and toothpaste as minimum I arrived to the hotel very late so finding a store at this hour was not an option Unfortunately the hotel could not offer me these basics I think a 4star hotel should be prepared for these things Very disappointing , Good location nice staff and helpful Good price and good standard
