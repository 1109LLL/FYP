385420,De L Europe Amsterdam, The lighting controls in the room were a puzzlement , 1 The staff was unfailingly professional and pleasant 2 L Europe s location at the tip of a point around which Amsterdam s many wonderful canals circle is wonderful for walking our way to see any city cycling almost all of Amerstam seems to cycle and canal boating 
385421,De L Europe Amsterdam, Nothing our stay was perfect, Fantastic big room with balcony overlooking the canals The location of this hotel is fantastic right in the centre of Amsterdam the staff were SO polite and helpful and happy which we loved smiling and acknowledging us We had two meals in the hotel restaurant and the food was delicious will most definitely use this hotel again
385422,De L Europe Amsterdam, requested bath and room with canal view Got neither The superior room was cramped compared with other comparable grades of rooms I have booked throughout the world Not value for money, Staff enthusiastic and helpful
385423,De L Europe Amsterdam, The view from room is non existent The room was not ready until 3 35pm The main restaurant was not open on Sundays The only other booking we could get at the bistro was either really early or far too late The bar does not open until 6 00pm The only other bar area is not a pleasant place to sit , Rooms are luxurious bathrooms excellent 
385424,De L Europe Amsterdam, Having clearly requested an outward looking room I was checked into a small claustrophobic internal room less than half size 25 m squared that was advertised looking onto a wall For almost gbp500 quite incredible When I requested change I was told I wasn t paying enough and if I wanted better room I should have paid for a junior suite Although I was finally moved for second night it was most appalling experience I have had at any hotel , Location 
385425,De L Europe Amsterdam, nothing, fantastic hotel staff lovely pool room out of this world very clean tidy nothing was too much trouble for the staff would recommend food great quality choice and tasted devine will visit amsterdam again local people very friendly and helpful thanks you
385426,De L Europe Amsterdam, Breakfast at 42 Euros a person You have to be kidding but two steaks and two deserts for 140 Euros in the bistro Vastly over priced for an ordinary steak and an average desert , Location
385427,De L Europe Amsterdam, The Spa is very very bad my wife just had a treatment during our stay and they actually scared temporarily her face during a face scrub And never even apologized for it This spa degrades the hotel and should not be in the same building Totally unacceptable and terrible standards , The location is perfect right in the heart of the city Everything about the place is perfect 
385428,De L Europe Amsterdam, Had problem with the room window was upset from the receptionist at night she asked me to wait and when the Msintenance came he discovered that the window was broken I think from the cleaning stuff Mohammed was honestly helpful he provided us with portable heater Thanks Mohammed, Location is excellent and quality of towels and bedding is amazing
385429,De L Europe Amsterdam, Not applicable see above, Absolutely everything you need for a memorable experience The staff are friendly and helpful the service outstanding from doorman to concierge front desk to housekeeping Breakfast was a feast rooms beautifully furnished Excellant location 
385430,De L Europe Amsterdam, There was some confusion about the following items but we didn t want to make a big deal out of it since we just wanted to enjoy our special day and night 1 There was confusion during breakfast The lady told us that it is included in our price and that we can have a buffet or something from the menu We chose something from the menu got charged for it and then were told that only buffet is for free That was not clear to us when given the available options 2 We asked for a late checkout but it wasn t clear that if we stay until 5 we will still have to pay extra In my experience late checkouts are free First of all we spoke about that to the gentleman by the reception in the morning and he was clear that if we come even 1 minute after 6 he ll have to charge us for the next day There was nothing being said about getting charged for the extension of the first day in the first place Then when we came back at 6 to check out the lady behind the counter didn t really have any information about the discourse from the morning and we just didn t want to make too big of a deal so we just paid for it So it would be nice if these things were clear from the start that is all otherwise you are left in a weird situation where you don t really know what to do since you don t have any written proof of the conversation that took place , Amazing spa facilities free upgrade of our room we spent our wedding night there very helpful and friendly reception staff individually speaking 
385431,De L Europe Amsterdam, My husband had his birthday during our stay at this hotel Usually in a places like that they try to congratulate guests somehow at least a congratulation card But it is not about Hotel De L Europe , We had a super comfortable stay at this hotel Ething was a high end
385432,De L Europe Amsterdam, Staff switched off the cards to access the room while we were at SPA despite that it was agreed about late check in Breakfast was included into price but the screenshot from booking com was not sufficient to prove that so the hotel charged additional 62EUR for breakfast Also this Greedy hotel reserved the deposit which will be one day returned to the card fingers crossed They promised that the cigar smoking room will be opened 24 hours but at 02 00 it was closed and no one could help to open it , Location SPA area
385433,De L Europe Amsterdam, Nothing, The staff was tremendous The beds were so comfortable The shower was fantastic along with the heated bathroom floors The Nespresso coffee maker The food champagne There is nothing not to love 
385434,De L Europe Amsterdam, Breakfast is extremely expensive so we chose to eat somewhere else , We loved the view from our room and the location was fantastic The room was a good size and very comfortable 
385435,De L Europe Amsterdam,No Negative, Excellent service all employees are polite and welcoming Especially enjoyed the gym and spa Especially enjoyed sitting on the porch of the restroom after being two saunas Great place in the center of Amsterdam Thanks for everything 
385436,De L Europe Amsterdam, Possibly a wider selection of food on room service menu maybe vegetarian Pasta soups etc Maybe more chocolate choice in the mini bar, Superb friendly service great pool and spa Great concierge
385437,De L Europe Amsterdam, Speedier service in the bars and restaurants, The concierge was particularly useful helpful and friendly We were there on a very busy weekend and the restaurant staff couldn t cope well but the sommelier made up for it 
385438,De L Europe Amsterdam, Minor observation light s in the rooms not bright enough rooms a bit dark, Almost everything staff friendly and efficient service excellent cleanliness etc
385439,De L Europe Amsterdam, All was wonderful, Terrific location took advantage of the canal boat ride offered by the hotel The staff was professional courteous and went out of there way to assist Can t wait to go back as well as tell my clients to stay there Thank you
385440,De L Europe Amsterdam, Black curtain in the room is a bit giving bad mood however understand it s a kind of design but just not my taste , Special appreciation to the staff at the concierge who are very helpful and giving great suggestion to dining spots 
385441,De L Europe Amsterdam, It ain t the cheapest place to stay but then Amsterdam generally is a bit pricey at least here you get what you pay for , Excellent wi fi Luxurious place to stay 
385442,De L Europe Amsterdam, Unfortunately there was some confusion with Booking com re the days of my stay I feel the hotel was quite rigid not flexible accommodating or willing to negotiate with them in this circumstance and I found this to be a disappointing juxtaposition contrast to the great service experience I encountered with the staff during my stay They said there was no availability on the day I ended up extending my stay to glad I did not let this pre stay experience tarnish my impression of the hotel The windows are small in 402 and 432 wish they provided a bit more light Not all rooms have bathtubs , The staff was exceptionally helpful with customer service on the decline and not the norm nowadays it is wonderful to see it in action and thriving in such a high touch way No matter what my request was I was always met with a can do attitude and a sincere willingness to help or find resolutions options The location exceeded expectations so central to everything almost all key spots and landmarks are within walking distance a dream spot Liked the hotel location and service so much I extended my stay by a day 
385443,De L Europe Amsterdam,No Negative, In the heart of Amsterdam this hotel offers fantastic services and facilities Staff is very kind and always available Perfect for a weekend to fully enjoy 
385444,De L Europe Amsterdam, The terrace bar by the canal is a great place to hang out for a drink or snacks and to eat On occasions it took a long time to get served and seemed a little disorganised , Great location top notch rooms and facilities excellent staff who went out of their way to help Superb Bord eau restaurant for a special lunch or dinner We will be back 
385445,De L Europe Amsterdam, We booked a private tour of the canals on the day we left We thought our flight was leaving at 10pm but it was 3pm and the people next room to us were very noisy all night so sleep wasnt great It s fine these things happen in life but when we were told that we had to pay over 400 euro s for a cancelled boat ride well that just ruined the holiday and as 7 of my greatest friends recommended your hotel that is where stayed for our first trip to Amsterdam I am a very loyal customer when it comes to hotels but we ll all be trying the Intercontinental and other options from here on out , Staff were fantastic The restaurant on the canal had the worst service on the day of our arrival The multiple male concierge staff were fantastic 
385446,De L Europe Amsterdam, We ate in the hotel s Brasserie and didn t think the food was up to much There are better places to eat , I ve visited Amsterdam many times and the De L Europe most certainly has the best location Nothing is far away whether you want to visit Waterlooplein the Jordaan Dam square the museums Plantage and so on The staff were friendly and helpful For example we asked the concierge about tickets to the Van Gogh museum to avoid the queues and in under two minutes he printed us tickets for the next day The terrace is a nice place to have a drink and the spa was very lovely clean smart and not at all busy While this is a modern well equipped five star hotel I also like its nod to tradition The carved stone Hotel De L Europe above the front door reminds you this building has a long history of welcoming visitors 
385447,De L Europe Amsterdam, used to more selection for breakfast in such magnificent hotels, Very beautiful hotel great location incredible views Service and Staff were impeccable
385448,De L Europe Amsterdam, Need to have ice machines , The entire stay and facility were excellent Roland the Concierge was spectacular with his assistance and reservations for land and canal private tours Dinner at the Restaurant was fabulous the view from our suite was simply the best 
385449,De L Europe Amsterdam, I stayed in the hotel on 07 10 May 2016 First I stayed in the room 222 then removed to room 518 because in 222 windows could not be opened In the room 222 I left my shoes When I mentioned it I told about it to the reception But the man on the reception refused to help me to find my shoes He said that some people are already live in room 222 so that is why he can not do anything Is it the usual attitude to the guests of the hotel ,No Positive
385450,De L Europe Amsterdam, No bacon at breakfast , Quiet calm efficient service by helpful staff who look after you without seeming that it s their job The concierge in particular was magnificent 
385451,De L Europe Amsterdam, Loved everything, The bathroom was amazing so beautiful with a rain shower that you didn t want to leave The bed Linins were gorgeous and the view of the canel breathtaking The staff made great restaurant suggestions Best location 
385452,De L Europe Amsterdam, Initially the hotel gave me a completely inacceptable room with windows towards an inner small courtyard Directly outside was apparently the way to some hotel installations pool which meant to have curtains constantly closed or people directly looking into the room Only after protesting i got a more acceptable albeit then also smaller room On the 2nd day the cleaning of the room was interrupted for about 1 5 hours and again i had to protest to get it finally done Definitely not the level of customer treat one can expect from a 5 star hotel Much too overpriced for what it provides in terms of quality and service , Location is good and central Bed was comfortable and room OK
385453,De L Europe Amsterdam, the hotel is not short of anything the rooms are just too good and especially the Marbled Bathroom and the concept bedroom , The Hotel is very well situated near the river the Staff is immaculate and very courteous infact I have not such a kind of hospitality anywhere around the world fabulous fabulous is the only thing I can say and will return back to this hotel in Sept during IBC 
385454,De L Europe Amsterdam, The Michelin Star Restaurant was over rated and over priced In fairness we find this is often the case within hotels rather than restaurants , Hotel bar had brilliant atmosphere and the room d cor was excellent 
385455,De L Europe Amsterdam, Breakfast was good but expensive I ve had much better at other 5 star hotels, Perfect location professional staff beautifully decorated large comfortable room huge bathroom with heated floor wonderful large thick towels and robe 
385456,De L Europe Amsterdam, No variety on breakfast Same food every day and it s only few choices , The hotel on the hart of the downtown Every thing you need near by you Rooms are excellent and friendly stuff Next trip sure will be the same hotel
385457,De L Europe Amsterdam,No Negative, The whole hotel was amazing The staff were polite and friendly They took on board my claustrophobia so made sure our room was catered for and even got me a card and bottle of wine for my birthday
385458,De L Europe Amsterdam, Food and drinks expensive But most hotels are the same , Great location lovely and clean staff helpful and friendly It is on the pricey side but worth treating yourself to 
385459,De L Europe Amsterdam, Superior room was tiny I wonder what the deluxe room was like Would not book this room again , Excellent location clean hotel room good quality throughout and very helpful staff 
385460,De L Europe Amsterdam, Service was about as bad as I have seen To me a luxury hotel is about both the facilities and the service Without the service can t really be called a luxury hotel , Location is great Updated rooms were wonderful 
385461,De L Europe Amsterdam,No Negative, We have returned to this hotel many times First class service by friendly staff All enquiries handled with efficiency Rooms well appointed some with canal views
385462,De L Europe Amsterdam,No Negative, The view from our balcony was excellent The staff were courteous and friendly and couldn t do enough for us The location was superb and it is without a doubt the best hotel i have stayed in in Amsterdam Not cheap though 
385463,De L Europe Amsterdam, preferred the brasserie with the old style menu and so did most of the staff , Great staff very helpful and always pleasant and professional An absolute must for a visit to Amsterdam well done all for making us feel very welcome Top drawer hotel Rooms fantastic 
385464,De L Europe Amsterdam, Dinner was not exceptional for the price paid at room service Would recommend eating out of the hotel or in the actual restaurant , Bathroom was lovely
385465,De L Europe Amsterdam, Their breakfast is expensive 36 euros , The hotel is beautiful My room is lovely with a view of the Amstel river The bathroom is marble and clean with an inviting bath tub Above all the service is excellent and the location is within the city which is walking distance to all major sites museums canals shops and the flower market 
385466,De L Europe Amsterdam, Much smaller room than in my first stay No longer any movies available and also no radio for any music, Location is great and concierge at this hotel is always so helpful
385467,De L Europe Amsterdam, Entertainment system inside the suite TV Radio Ipad Bose complicated to use tv switching off constantly very poor channels selections , Location Staff Food Cleanliness Attitude of the staff the best we have seen so far in our lives Top notch staff 
385468,De L Europe Amsterdam, Whether this was a fluke and despite the fact that they gave me some credit This experience should not be generalized due to some exceptional people like the manager I dealt with Jonathan from front and Dionne from room service The credit is justified and I have to write the review and share my experience The credit is not meant to keep the story untold Except for the flooding which was caused by another guest that left their shower on then created the leak to my room there are other aspects that are very poor The leak was excusable it was not caused by the hotels condition The leak happened on our last day That disaster was the icing on the cake Still the leak on my shoes and fox fur jacket wet I never got to wear it The manager offered to help but after repeated issues I couldn t trust the service My problem with this hotel is its poor service by the select few lack of attention to details and subpar in room food dining My first day Front desk offered to place dinner reservations at a restaurant that I had looked forward to going I wish I never had accepted their assistance It was meant to be for a date 2 days from my arrival The same night I received a letter confirming the dinner was made on a different day hence I lost my place and had to go somewhere else It was a good place but was not my choice Also on the same night of arrival I set up a cake to be delivered on a certain day This cake was delivered on the wrong day which ruined my surprise I also asked for an I room massage which at first was confirmed on a different day and had I not caught on I wouldn t have been able to correct it So the massage appt was done right but only because I caught the mistake beforehand On top of this the front kept calling my room to inform us of the cake and dinner reservations concierge knew it was a surprise so basically they blew the surprise by talking to the birthday celebrant , The response of the manager towards the issues that arose was good The room was beautiful 
385469,De L Europe Amsterdam,No Negative, The restaurant was phenomenal and the concierge service excellent Rooms very comfortable though small Lots of interesting gadgets Wonderful under floor heated bathroom 
385470,De L Europe Amsterdam, It was a bit dark in decor Dated but that is what Paris is , Lovely older hotel with lots of charm and attentive staff on side streets of Paris Met our needs 
385471,De L Europe Amsterdam, Precious few Rooms were not ready even though we arrived around 3 00 pm One room was rushed and the other took until 4 40 to be ready , Location service rooms dining are all above ny expectations I really relaxed and enjoyed my visit 
385472,De L Europe Amsterdam, The ladies at the reception Tuesday night Spt 22nd One of them realized that I did not want to stay in the attic but still installed me in 520 so I had to change room the next day which is a nuicance when you have two days only , That I on the second day was treated by Alexander With friendliness and Hospitality He gave me the room I preferred 
385473,De L Europe Amsterdam, The room was quite small and dark although it was supposed to be a junior suite I think we need more honest room descriptions generally not just this hotel , The Public Areas and Bathroom
385474,De L Europe Amsterdam, I had an ordinary non suiite for the first time and it was terrible No view and tiny for 400 a night Hotel is only worth it if you have a junior suite ,No Positive
385475,De L Europe Amsterdam, Nothing serious but the steps to the Gym can be tricky , People were not only correct but really nice always ready to help or simply have a nice chat The Brasserie is a marvellous place and Room Service having forgotten a demand insisted in bringing me tea and cookies 
385476,De L Europe Amsterdam, Our only complaint would be the staff in the Bistro seemed very disorganized as you would not have the same server so no one seemed to know or ask about your needs We found it very annoying , The location was wonderful as we were able to walk to most museums etc The hotel was very beautiful rooms very large and bright The Concierge staff was excellent and very efficient 
385477,De L Europe Amsterdam, Nothing negative, Perfect location friendly helpful staff We had a romantic getaway and the guests relations manager went an extra mile to make our stay unforgettable We ve been assigned a suite and nice welcome amenities were sent in the room 
385478,De L Europe Amsterdam,No Negative, I reserved a room suite with a canal view and had a great experience The guy that received us at the door and took our car to the parking lot in the afternoon was the most helpful I met during our summer trip through Europe Overall great service 
385479,De L Europe Amsterdam, Verging on expensive compared to comparable hotels although meets all expectation for the level charged Be careful to note price of breakfast if not included in room rate , Excellent location with good facilities and friendly and helpful staff Concierge managed to get us timed essential tickets for Anne Frank House Lovely bar and restaurant on canal level 
385480,De L Europe Amsterdam, The buffet breakfast was good but wish to have more varieties, Great Location helpful kind and respectful staff The coceierge is well knowledged he suggested a trip to waterland with a couple which was unforgettable experience I suggest people to book a room with balcony to enjoy the breathtaking view of the river
