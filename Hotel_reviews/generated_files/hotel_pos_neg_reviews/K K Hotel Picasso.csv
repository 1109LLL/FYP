401184,K K Hotel Picasso, Smoking allowed on the roof top area, Central location walking distance to parks beach Arc de triumph Las ramblas Plenty of restaurants around the area good rooftop bar with entertainment some nights 
401185,K K Hotel Picasso, Breakfast buffet had a good assortment of foods but virtually the same assortment each day , Well appointed room Comfortable bed Quiet location near the old city An easy walk to many museums shops and restaurants Friendly staff A wonderful rooftop bar and pool 
401186,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, Fabulous hotel with great location facilities and staff Breakfast which was included was amazing selection and fabulous food Pool area on the roof was great to relax in the afternoon after exploring the wonderful sights of Barcelona 
401187,K K Hotel Picasso, 1 Cannot get a glass of water at pool deck or bring beverage there Diet Coke Need to have ice water there Should not always have to buy it 2 Laundry sheet said SAME DAY service if in by 9 AM Brought my laundry down before 9 AM and was told wouldn t be back until next morning Since we had an early flight this would not work They said could do express for additional 50 of cost Unbelievable Already VERY expensive to do laundry Should not state same day service if cannot deliver or eliminate express charges it can t deliver before midnight of same day 3 Only One Key per room very inconvenient if can t locate spouse after going out have to have desk staff let you into your room need to change this 4 Pool deck food service very slow took over 20 minutes to get order 5 Had early flight and needed to leave before breakfast started no arrangement for getting bag breakfast or even a cup of coffee We re told we could buy something from 24 hr snack shop This is unacceptable as breakfast was included in our price, Location cleanliness of room bath staff overall friendly Front desk staff assisted us in securing our airport shuttle which we had to change Day and time Breakfast was pretty good 
401188,K K Hotel Picasso, The pool area crowded no room to sit no ambience Happy hour advertised as 1 2 price means 2 drinks for regular price , It was quiet in the old town close to the railway a day trip to Sitges worth it 
401189,K K Hotel Picasso, My problem with the place is this a we only rented this for the pool So for three nights 1 night the pool was closed because of a very very loud DJ party It was techno music so was extremely loud shutting windows and doors doesn t work the heavy bass just beats through This went on until 11 I didn t care so much about the noise but I cared about not using the pool During the day we are out touring the city so coming back and night looking forward to a dip in the pool was denied Not happy at all particularly for how much we paid and that we had several children that were disappointed Also a few of the bartenders were really absent minded like severely A few times we were the only ones ordering Like 3 drinks and 2 were forgotten Or the one time I ordered a glass of wine while waiting 15 minutes Then I just give up and leave And I was the only one at the bar It was all done with a smile of course Other simply strange stuff was the fact our room was never cleaned until like 5 pm on the 3rd and last day of our stay Or after we checked in a worker came in to check the mini bar She didn t ask she just came right in I was half dressed My wife was in the bathroom and she went in there too She was very nice attractive young lady who was in no way disrespectful but she was just doing her job They didn t clean the rooms but made sure to check the mini bar religiously every day Also we got in early and asked ahead of time for early check in I was told that the cleaner singular not plural does not arrive until noon therefore they will check us in after she cleans each room so of our 3 rooms we had staggered check ins Kind of strange and not very easy If you are a hotel that has guests coming in from overnight flights perhaps you should have your cleaner s come in earlier , I liked the quirkiness of a small boutique hotel Every single one of staff is very very friendly and several that are very very hard working Some worked harder than others of course One guy was the doorman the luggage guy the pool guy and when he wasn t busy doing that he was polishing windows sweeping etc All with a smile on his face In a black tie no less in the hot sun The rooftop bar pool was great Rooms were clean upon arrival and the hotel was very well located central to everything 
401190,K K Hotel Picasso, We didn t use the swimming pool it looked quite small but located on the roof so may be ok We went to the sea anyway , The hotel is well located 15 mins walk to the beach and very close to the old city The terrace is a nice place to take a drink 
401191,K K Hotel Picasso, Wifi was a bit flakey Room was a bit small and overpriced for its position at the back of the hotel with no view, Staff were very good Air con in room was very good Shower was very good Roof terrace was nice Beds were comfortable
401192,K K Hotel Picasso, Breakfast was poor in comparison to what is available locally and very expensive for what it is , The location was very good central but quiet whereas many central hotels are noisy traffic and the tube can both be issues the tube seems to be at a very shallow depth 
401193,K K Hotel Picasso, As in other big cities lots of homeless people sleeping close to the hotel , It is perfect for tourism Clean tidy organized well use of space Good breakfast Small rooms but good for the cost Everything you need to see is very close Public transportation excelent Helpful staff The pool at theroof top is tiny but cocktails are great Overall very good experience 
401194,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, The property was quite clean modern and had excellent amenities The breakfast had nice variety and excellent quality The staff were superb knowledgeable and courteous Would definitely stay here again 
401195,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, My daughter 18 and I stayed here for 4 nights and though the room was smaller than anticipated despite being an Executive room and them not fulfilling our wish for a corner room it was at the end of the hallway room 402 and therefore very quiet Floor carpeting though somewhat old fashioned certainly helps keep the noise level down The AC is very efficient and runs very quietly so our nightly sleep was wonderful The beds are on the softer side which is to our liking so that was good We checked in and our room fridge was not working after 2 different attempts over 1 5 days the fridge was replaced We asked for an iron and board and this was delivered immediately and left with us for the whole trip which was great The breakfast room while small is good and the breakfast very extensive especially for Spanish standards Our bathroom was renovated and modern but not 100 clean hair in the tub on the first day afterwards not a problem anymore though and everything was replaced daily as needed towels paper etc Rooftop terrace is lovely but as it s small and narrow it gets very crowded very quickly and unfortunately non hotel guests are allowed there too so there isn t room for paying guests pity The staff everywhere is very helpful and friendly The location is perfect for walking to the Gothic Quarter El Born La Rambla etc where there are tons of bars restaurants and eclectic shops and beaches harbor but a bit of a schlepp to the Metro The bus stop and the hop on hop off bus is right outside the door if you choose that traveling method All in all a clean modern hotel on the inside in a beautiful old style Spanish building with friendly staff and good breakfast Would definitely come back 
401196,K K Hotel Picasso, Nothing , Terrific location facing park which was 1880s Worlds Fair site Neat port to walk to waterfront restaurants Neat Picasso museum walk to gothic district Fantastic rooftop bar happy hour next to pool Loved dining in hotel sidewalk veranda Such nice breakfast or lunch there The employees are amazing So friendly professional Top notch hotel 
401197,K K Hotel Picasso, The terrible hotel and terrible personal If you want make you rest terrible and nervous stay in this hotel And take big bag with money because they lie all about price and when you will check out you amount will bigger than you account on 150 ,No Positive
401198,K K Hotel Picasso, Booking Com was way more expensive than if I had done it thru the Hotel about 800 more which was really surprising For 6 nights with breakfast I paid 2 620 and most people paid under 300 per night I learned a lesson ,No Positive
401199,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, It is in a very good location It s next to old town and very beautiful big park However the room was small and the quality of the interior wasn t very good I don t think this hotel is worth its money Although many hotels with good location in Barcelona are unreasonably expensive 
401200,K K Hotel Picasso, I was happy to be upgraded to the suite but the room was ok the view a bit disappointing when the regular rooms seem to have more interesting view outdoors, Staff was attentive
401201,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, Loved the location The hotel is sleek and modern and comfortable The breakfast was fabulous and much more than we expected We loved the rooftop bar for our pre dinner cocktails We will recommend this hotel to all friends traveling to Barcelona 
401202,K K Hotel Picasso, Very little nothing to dislike The ground floor public rooms are a bit small And I could see the very small reception area being overwhelmed if you happen to arrive when it is busy I didn t so it wasn t an issue , Ideal location Perfect for exploring El Born and Barri Gotic With the right weather the small pool and sun deck on the top floor were very welcome late afternoon after each day exploring Comfortable rooms excellent double glazing Good air con Decent bathroom Good beds Decent breakfast albeit the same every day Friendly helpful staff 
401203,K K Hotel Picasso, There could have been a better selection at breakfast Pillows were soft , Good location on the edge of Born Easy walk to the beach Breakfast was OK Rooftop bar and pool were fabulous Great views 
401204,K K Hotel Picasso, The room was available at 12 but we were asked to pay extra because the checking time is 3pm I must clarify that I thought they say 50 euro extra at first but the next day I overheard the staff said 15 euro to a couple 15 Euro is much more reasonable and doable But if the room is available early they could have let people check in early as a courtesy after a long flight , Very modern and very clean hotel The room was quite spacious per European standard The staff is really friendly It is located in a quiet area but yet close to the city center Right behind the hotel we walked from El Born to Gotic Quarter and that was a great experience
401205,K K Hotel Picasso, booking informed me 24h before check in date that the hotel has cancelled my reservation for which I would need to pay 100 if I would have cancelled up to 48h before check in Unacceptable For sure just to try to charge much higher price as Barcelona was fully boooked Bad service from the hotel which in the end accepted my reservation after me telling them I would not accept it at all and bad service from booking for not guaranteeing the commitment they are co responsible for, hotel is very well located and confortable
401206,K K Hotel Picasso, Our room was ready however checking in at 13 00 was only possible by paying EUR 25 For two hours before regular check in time I have never been asked to pay When at the lobby I heard that another couple was asked to pay EUR 15 for early check in What Decided not to make any trouble with Javier from the reception but this is defnitately NOT customer friendly and not accetable don t do this anymore , Great location in Born many restaurants and places to drink on walking distant Within 20 minutes walk you are on the beach or at the Rambla Rooftopbar and pool are the best Room 102 is comfortable and clean with a good shower and soft matras fine for us Great place to stay highly recommend this and stay away from hotels near the ramblas 
401207,K K Hotel Picasso, The bed was too soft for me personally And instead of a credit card type room key they have a bulky plastic brick which is a bit annoying to carry around when you re on holiday , I received a free upgrade to a suite despite having already booked at a heavily reduced sale price online The room was very clean and spacious and the hotel was in a great location 
401208,K K Hotel Picasso, We booked executive double room but it appeared to be small and looked like ordinary 3 hotel room The most disappointing were mattress and pillows of very poor quality , Perfect location very nice and professional staff Breakfast was good but the same every day Great bonus a rooftop pool 
401209,K K Hotel Picasso, Bed was ample but just too soft for our own liking , All together a lovely and excellent place to stay First time in Barcelona and its hotel services did not know what to expect but this hotel did not disappoint Bed was too soft not a criticism for our liking but were provided with extra pillows 
401210,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, Quality of the hotel is great Staff is all very friendly and helpful The rooms are clean and the rooftop is a nice addition really clean as well We loved the location of this hotel It is right in the El Born area which we loved not as crowded as other tourist areas and really great restaurants and bars It s also across from Parc de la Cuitadella We would definitely come back to this hotel 
401211,K K Hotel Picasso, Mattress too soft Small rooms, The hotel is located about 20 min walking away from Pla a Catalunya where the aero bus stops You can get there by metro in 5 min but the closest metro station is Jerume or Arc de triumph which is almost 10 walking minute away The location of the hotel is awesome Surrounded by tapas bars and restaurants The best fish restaurant Pradetta is just behind the hotel La Rambla is 15 to 20 min by foot away The famous aquarium port the same Everything is in walking distance and you don t need taxi or bus The hotel itself has a skybar with a mini swimming pool and resting area I guess very helpful on warm summer days The rooms are small but very clean and mattress is too soft for me The room has a safe and boiler The bathroom was big compared to the room with a nice Italian shower A hair dryer is provided in the bathroom Breakfast for 12 was worth it but it s nothing overwhelming By the way a ride from airport by taxi costs 40 and can last from 20 to 40 minutes We had dinner at mini bar on 5th floor and the quality of the food was good The staff is multilingual and also very helpful If you don t mind the small rooms and the soft mattress then this hotel is probably the best value you can get in Barcelona 
401212,K K Hotel Picasso, Bed is really soft as mentioned from other persons beeing there already But we slept very well , The Hotel is situated directly at the Citadelle park Barcelona city tour com bus station is located directly in front of the Hotel Good windows no traffic noise if you sleep with closed windows Effective and silent aircondition Book an Executive room they are bigger and the view to to street park is more intresting 
401213,K K Hotel Picasso, staying eight nights a bit more closet space for two people would have been nice but we worked around it , Staff so very helpful we are not Spanish speakers and they were just so so helpful with directions and information Bruno the food and beverage director who was always there took time after running a busy breakfast buffet to make suggestions for our day and suggest places were we would find quality food on our travels He also made suggestions on dinner and all proved to be just great Cannot thank him enough Being a retired hotelier I appreciate the value of having such a special talent Great job K K we will return and recommend 
401214,K K Hotel Picasso, Long wait for hot water to come through to bathroom taps , Roof terrace a good place to relax with pool and views of the city s main park Hotel is in a quiet location yet only a short walk from restaurants and main attractions 
401215,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, Staff very nice and helpful Very clean Not big rooms but adequate Location is a 10 15 minute walking distance to many attractions Pool was nice Internet speed excellent 
401216,K K Hotel Picasso, The airconditioning was turned off at night probalby to save energy So between 1 2 am until 8 am So even if we went on March the room was very hot without airconditiong So we would wake up in the middle of the night with a very warm room with no air , The breakfast was really good The location superb 
401217,K K Hotel Picasso, Although the bathroom was of a top standard the entrance to the bathroom is a glass partition with a large gap rather than a door This meant the bathroom was basically in the same room as the bed giving you had no privacy when using the facilities everything can be heard clearly throughout the room The pool was excellent and would be great in summer but we were a bit disappointed it wasn t heated during the spring months We visited in April when the weather was warm enough to sunbathe but the pool was ice cold and put people off using it , The staff were really friendly and accommodating The rooms were clean beds were comfy and the hotel was very well located with many bars and restaurants next to the hotel and a beautiful park opposite It was easy to walk to most places but there was also a Metro a short walk away and it was very easy to catch a cab from right outside the hotel entrance The roof terrace bar was very impressive 
401218,K K Hotel Picasso, We asked for a double bed but it was set up as two singles put next to each other and to single duvet , We spent a weekend in Barcelona and was very happy with our stay here Location was great you are between the gothic quarters cathedral la rambla and the beach Bonus with a big beautiful park opposite we did a run there and to the arc de triomphe Room was comfortable and good size what you would expect for a 4 star hotel 
401219,K K Hotel Picasso, Nothing it was perfect , One of the happiest and friendliest places I ve ever stayed Staff were always helpful and charming helping is pre book tickets to the main attractions and offering advice on where to eat New roof top bar and pool are both wonderful and the happy hour cocktails are a super touch Staying here really made our holiday even better and we take away very happy memories of Barcelona and K K 
401220,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, Breakfast was very good the staff were brilliant x cleanliness first prize I loved the sun roof and pool I thought the receptionists were excellent Special mention of thanks to Mario sorry if I have spelt his name wrong He always had my room key ready and his welcome to the hotel was first class Muchos gracios
401221,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, Clean nice and super safe hotel with really professional and helpful staff in great location in Barcelona Within walking distance to the gothic old town and the beach but in a slightly quieter neighborhood I loved everything about this hotel My friend had her purse pick pocketed in a nightclub one of the nights and the hotel staff was really helpful in trying to help her contact the nightclub to see if they had found it My room was relatively small but had a nice comfy bed good standard and comfort in general and was very clean An oasis to come back to after a day or night out in Barcelona 
401222,K K Hotel Picasso, The WiFi was not strong in our room but the hotel provides a computer and printer downstairs which was very helpful , The El Born is the place to be for us anyway The staff were great and worked extremely hard 
401223,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, Breakfast was included in the room cost and was an excellent choice served buffet style The bed was very comfortable We had an executive room with a small balcony overlooking the park on the 3rd floor The location is great for exploring the Gothic area with lots of good restaurants and bars within easy walking distance Staff were friendly and very helpful at arranging everything from the bus tour to reserving a table at a local restaurant The 5th Floor there is an outdoor pool and rooftop patio area with comfortable seating Tour bus stops at the front door and the park across the road is lovely for a morning stroll 
401224,K K Hotel Picasso, Roof top bar could have been open later , Bed was very comfy Room was reasonable size Air conditioning worked well Good shower no bath in the standard rooms but we were not bothered by that Staff were very friendly spoke excellent English and were very helpful Excellent views from the roof top bar didn t use the restaurant but the bar were able to organise us a good pizza after we made a bad choice eating out 
401225,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, Good quiet location near excellent restaurants bars 15 min walk to centre 20 mins to beach Near a large park for picnics and 50m to the tour bus stop 
401226,K K Hotel Picasso, everything was perfect , everything the people to the front desk are amazingly friendly they upgraded us to a junior suite because all the rooms were full 
401227,K K Hotel Picasso, Complimentary gym pass would have been nice but at 8EUR it wasn t too bad , The facilities were very clean The roof terrace was nice to be able to relax and the staff were always very helpful and friendly In terms of location I don t think you can find a better hotel 
401228,K K Hotel Picasso, Unfortunately the beds were far too soft and very uncomfortable Also there were no top sheets Only down duvets which were far too warm , Excellent front desk service Enney and Pawel were extremely helpful and knowledgeable Many thanks Great breakfasts too 
401229,K K Hotel Picasso, on our 2nd morning the breakfast buffet ran out of eggs and it took 15 minutes for any more to be brought out very disappointing on checking into our room there was no tea coffee milk or sugar just a kettle , reception staff displayed excellent customer service at all times bed was wonderfully comfortable 
401230,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, Staff were very helpful and welcoming Rooms very clean and comfortable Also surprisingly quiet even though we were on a main road Location very good just a 10 minute walk to the Gothic district and city bus stopped right outside the hotel 
401231,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, This is in a great location which is away from the main tourist strip but close enough to still walk everywhere The staff are very friendly and helpful We were in a standard room which was nice although there wasn t much natural light The roof terrace is a fantastic addition and great for relaxing on 
401232,K K Hotel Picasso, I cannot think of anything that i would have liked to have been better , Everything about this hotel was excellent The staff were friendly and helpful The entire hotel was spotlessly clean and the terrace areas allowed us to make the most of the lovely weather when we needed a break from strolling around Barcelona The breakfasts were excellent plenty of choice and all well cooked The bed was really comfortable and the hotel environment was quiet and restful 
401233,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, The staff were brilliant They could not do enough to help us with all our queries and requests Hotel was located perfectly between all locations we wanted to get to Sagrada Familia Gaudi Museum Las Rambla the Boqueria and the beach 
401234,K K Hotel Picasso, Worst hotel pillows ever and bit mean on the sachets of coffee in the room but minor stuff really , Staff service location is great Room very clean and modern
401235,K K Hotel Picasso, The things I didn t like was but it was not a big issue and I suppose there was good reason for that is that almost every time when I want to enter to hotel I need to ring for door opening The other minus is lack of gym to be honest hotel offered me nearby gym for 8 per day Tip do not choose rooms at the end of corridors internet is very weak there Good hotel with nice position , Good hotel 10 minutes walk from old town and 15 minutes from the sea Beautiful park with the zoo is just across the street Rooms are comfortable not too spacious but they are not small either Bathroom is functional and well equipped maybe vanity kit dental kit and shaving kit can be added Personnel is polite and willing to help Breakfast is good with enough choices even in the beginning it may not look like that 
401236,K K Hotel Picasso, I honestly couldn t fault the hotel on staff service cleanliness and so on but I did have one issue with the room layout The hotel looks brand new but I suspect whoever was the architect of the refurbishment or build hadn t actually tried sharing a room with someone before submitting the final plans The bathroom door was in the wrong place for me Imagine looking from bottom of bed two feet to the right in the middle of the bed is the door to the bathroom Literally stand up and you are at bathroom door not an issue I hear those of frequent visits through the night The problem is the the light switch is on outside and the room is illuminated with reject floodlights from the Nou Camp There is not a chance of your partner sleeping through an early morning relief visit Other than that small criticism we loved our visit to The K K Picasso in Barcelona , The location is excellent for visiting the city On arrival Bruno went into great detail as to were we should visit and avoid he was very helpful and information helped us to make the most of out 2 day stay in Barcelona All the staff at the K K Picasso were superb from arrival to departure I d recommend this hotel to anyone on a short city trip to Barcelona The taxi to hotel was 20 inc tip 
401237,K K Hotel Picasso, I had a room affected by traffic and noisy revellers for first night but the staff moved me to a quieter room immediately , The staff were incredibly helpful and just a delight Location was perfect for the half marathon start and finish 
401238,K K Hotel Picasso, The pool and upstairs bar area were undergoing renovations therefore closed Not sure that we would have used them in February anyway , Staff all were extremely friendly and helpful A brilliant location overlooking the park quiet but convenient for all the different areas The room was modern and immaculate It had everything you could possibly need down to the magnifying mirror and slippers Luxury at an affordable price 
401239,K K Hotel Picasso, Two things that would need improvement are a Asked one of the front desk staff some time our 2nd or 3rd night about how much was the cab fare to the airport I found it strange that he said he did not know since it is a pretty standard question The next day the check out agent told us it was about EUR30 40 b For some reason the room attendant took one of the throw pillows on day 2 and did not put it back On day 3 our cups were taken and we had to ask room service to send to us because it was also not replaced as well , The hotel is in a great location being near to several metro stations Once you get your bearings sorted you will find that you can actually just walk to the different attractions We seldom used the train during our 4 days and even chose to walk back to the hotel from the city are at night The room was nice and quite It was facing the street but there was no noise I believe we were given an upgrade by the check in staff thank you He also briefed us on places in a local map and recommended some places to go He was very helpful Overall I would stay in the hotel again and I will recommend to friends 
401240,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, Friendliest staff and excellent location This hotel is safe and secure in heart of Barcelona It s easy access to all the sites and convenient to and from airport I d highly recommend this hotel It was quiet we had a room that faced back of property Staff was courteous and knowledgeable Location is a an A In the heart of it all 
401241,K K Hotel Picasso, No restaurant but so many near by and some recommendations it didnt really matter Would have been nice to have the view from the top terrace area but is was being refurbished, Great location Quiet area but very central and close to where we wanted to be to able to walk Staff very helpful easy check in check out Bus stop outside Lots of bars restaurants nearby
401242,K K Hotel Picasso, Wish I could have stayed a week we arrived at midnight and were on our way to a ship by 8am , Very welcoming staff with good English Location was great if you want to tour the city 
401243,K K Hotel Picasso, The pool and top bar were closed for refurb and this was not on the listing Swimming in Jan was not going to happen but a drink on the roof would have been nice , comfortable bed Room is small but nicely appointed Staff helpful and a good location 
401244,K K Hotel Picasso, The pillows Way too soft Useless really I understood from the website that hotel would give me a pass for nearby gym but when i went to collect i had to pay for this pass The wording on the website leads you to believe this pass is complimentary , Very well located Well appointed room geeat tv and multimedia points onthe desk Perfect for a city break Hotel gave complimentary bottle of cava as i had previously told them it was my husbands birthday We arrived late 10 30 but the receptionist was very helpful and arranged for restaurant around the corner to stay open serve us dinner Located in gothic quarter there are endless restaurants and quirky shops within 5mins walk 
401245,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, First things first The room was just amazing Not too small not huge but just the right size Well decorated practical and as clean as it gets Also it s been a while since I slept in such comfy bed It was like being hugged I had forgotten what it was like to have a perfect night s sleep The hotel is located in a very quiet albeit central area And we didn t hear any noise coming from other rooms Surprinsingly the internet conexion was great The bathroom was pretty awesome as well Let s just say that there was a tub and the floor was warm which I found was a nice touch like a cherry on the top of a sundae The friendliness of the staff is another point worth mentioning the airline company had lost our luggage and they went above and beyond what was required to try and help us To wrap it up we couldn t have asked for a better hotel at such a good price I d stay there again in a minute 
401246,K K Hotel Picasso, We stayed for 4 nights one morning we were woken by the binmen other quests who where talking laughing quite loud This was no fault of the hotel , Lovely bed the bathroom was great excellent hot water plenty of shampoos body wash The room was quite large so clean Staff were very pleasant helpful good humoured They greeted you with a smile 
401247,K K Hotel Picasso, WiFi rather slow Fuuny bathroom door that does not lock and no bidet , Great service with a smile especially from the reception staff Lovely modern decoration and great views of the park Very close to great restaurants 
401248,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, Location was excellent Knowledge the staff held of the area and places to was superb One of our party wished to visit FC Barcelona The staff offered a visit and ticket to a match The tickets were inexpensive and delivere to us in good time 
401249,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, Staff extremely helpful in printing out boarding passes and organising transport in the middle of a taxi strike we would have missed our flights without Jose thank you so much for taking the stress out of our stay
401250,K K Hotel Picasso, not having the menu in the room to ask for room service is very strange that everytime someone has to bring it to the room amenities should be improved and added according to the hotel category, nice breakfast good location
401251,K K Hotel Picasso, There was nothing we didn t like, The bed was very comfy and the staff were very friendly The hotel areas were relaxing and food available up to 22 30 Very good if you don t want to go out 
401252,K K Hotel Picasso, Pillows very flat The room too hot The breakfast wasn t great cafes nr bye , Reception helpful Wi fi good Plenty of nice cafes restaurants nr bye 
401253,K K Hotel Picasso, Shower didn t drain quickly enough and seal at bottom of shower was in poor condition so bathroom was always wet Had to request an iron rather than just have one in the room The happy hour is misleading it s not actually 2 for 1 , The proximity to the park and Gothic Quarter nice shops bars architecture etc 
401254,K K Hotel Picasso, Arriving too late to enjoy the bar and outdoor court , This is a small hotel well located in the center of Barcelona We made the reservation the day before did not get to the hotel until midnight only staying for the night Desk staff was bilingual considerate and welcoming Would book for an extended stay if we come back to the city 
401255,K K Hotel Picasso, Nothing everything was great , Location great near to shops bars restaurants beautiful park across the street Staff very courteous friendly helpful Delicious breakfast even provided us with breakfast pack to take away as we were leaving very early for airport 
401256,K K Hotel Picasso, a bathtub would be nice parking garage is hard to find far from the nearest metro station, Very nice view from the balcony extra large bed and TV very friendly staff good breakfast selection 
401257,K K Hotel Picasso, prefer to have my bed sheets changed everyday or at least to have the choice instead of every 2 3 days, staff friendliness location breakfast heating
401258,K K Hotel Picasso, Small size of room Set up of lighting in room reading in bed on one side of the bed was impossible Breakfast was adequate but not as nice as at other K K hotels at which we have stayed , Location Good bed 
401259,K K Hotel Picasso, I do like a top sheet instead of just a duvet , Breakfast was very good Coffee also especially the cafe con leche from the bar served Viennese style on the patio The room was terrific with two balconies 
401260,K K Hotel Picasso,No Negative, We absolutely loved the breakfasts Great value for money a delicious selection of food every morning The staff were extremely friendly and helpful 
401261,K K Hotel Picasso, Wouldn t everyone like bigger fluffier towels And some ad free TV channels and an explanation of what the format is for the dozen odd radio stations , The front desk staff added immeasurably to our stay Friendly and capable at all times 
401262,K K Hotel Picasso, Coffee maker would have been enjoyed , The bed was very comfortable We loved the pillows and the comforters The room was very clean We didn t use the fridge but we loved having it there in case we needed it It was also quiet 
401263,K K Hotel Picasso, Nothing Really nothing , Everything was perfect We have not enough words to describe the hospitality we felt from the first moment when we entered this cosy hotel Staff is so well trained and attentive Atmosphear is calm and relaxing Thank You We felt pampered 
401264,K K Hotel Picasso, The comfort of the bed This is the only point which pushed me to rate lower Too soft Everything in the bed was too soft Soft mattress very soft quite thin pillow bad sleep Another point you come to the doors but they don t open automatically The frontier has to push the button Sometimes they go away you stay and wait One day we were waiting some minutes looking through the windows inside and that was ab 10 p m , Great location in El Born we absolutely love this part of Barcelona Everything is different here nice bars restaurants mostly innovative cuisine nice shops spirit St Catherina market just 10 min walk away Nice part just across the street next to Zoo Good breakfast nothing special but fairly good everything fresh friendly stuff Good WiFi
401265,K K Hotel Picasso, The desk staff gave us the wrong room which caused us some embarrassment and failed to correct the information on their system despite many reminders so we were always called by the wrong name and given the wrong bill We had to sort out the room mistake ourselves , The bed was excellent
