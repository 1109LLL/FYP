215842,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, No bottled water supplied Bathroom small and didn t like the frosted glass window between bathroom and bedroom Not very private and inconvenient at night iwhen someone puts light in and it shines through into bedroom, Comfortable and reasonably well equipped rooms Rooms ar rear are quiet but outlook a bit grim
215843,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Breakfast is chaotic while the choice of food is excellent service is poor I don t see the point of they accompany guests to their breakfast table at any onetime they seem to temporarily run out of some foodstuffs croissant bread coffee etc and if they are not alerted by guests they don t seem to be aware of this ,No Positive
215844,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, On this occasion after coming back late from London my room card was not working and the night shift staff that was on the front desk Harry was very rude and unhelpful he did not attend to me and made me wait at the desk not acknowledging that I was standing there knowing I was there A very horrible arrogant young man that spoiled the end , Comfortable beds and shower
215845,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, The hotel may be a bit far from the city center but it is very near 2 subway stations different lines and there are bus stops right outside the hotel making it very easy to get around The hotel lobby is big and impressive the staff was friendly check in was fast and smooth Our room was nice and comfortable with a view of Shepherds Bush Park Although we were on a main street our room on the 5th floor was quiet by day and by night 
215846,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The basin is slightly high by normal standards still acceptable Breakfast lacks variety especially on weekend , The reception counter staff are freindly and helpful They offered us great help in changing rooms due to a broken mirror 
215847,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Breakfast was very busy so the food options were limited and took a while to be refilled, staff are excellent and made us feel very welcome we ve stayed here a number of times and it never disappoints 
215848,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, It was my 2nd stay at the hotel and once again I had a great time there Staff is very friendly the room very nicely equipped with modern appliances and devices I had a really nice and clean room with a plenty of light and a nice small bathroom just big enough and I m not a small person I like this hotel also for its location There are multiple tube and bus stations around and even if there s a problem on any of the lines you can get there Also there are so many places to shop and get some food around that there is absolutely nothing to worry about 
215849,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Sound insulation in the room was non existent Could not sleep almost at all during the first night All the sounds on the corridor could be heard in the room Quite crowded hotel, Place was clean Staff did their job 
215850,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The doors bang very loudly from 6am onwards It should really be fixed Never been to a hotel where this is such a problem , Nice location and some cute design features 
215851,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, They tried to charge me 300 pounds more than the actual price booked for a 5 night stay even after I noticed the mistake on the card machine the receptionist did not even apologise for the mistake Most rooms have horrible windows which are either facing indoors or blurred windows or windows covered with mostly bars Good rooms are only the suites as the rooms look much bigger in the picture than reality, Location and shower
215852,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The check in was the worst of all They didn t give us the rooms we booked almost 6 months ago we asked for connected rooms and after a discussion we had them but to my surprise one of them was disabled room I was very angry in my home it is a crime to take disabled park and they made me sleep in theirs The second day they moved us to the rooms we booked and they were perfect but not connected Every one day and another the cards blocked The Tv channels were very boring only British and Chinese there has been no varieties, The staff at the restaurant were perfect The rooms were nice There was a receptionist who looked like Will smith I would like the thank him
215853,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, About the valet parking you should be aware that your car is parked at the nearby mall if their parking is full so it takes 30min to get your car back , The rooms are big and modern the staff is very friendly and helpful they have 24h room service as well 
215854,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, We were upgraded to a suite as our room wasn t ready when we checked in It was pure luxury beautiful bed linen exceptional bed great bathroom with added lounge facilities including a Lavazza coffee machine
215855,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, They didn t have enough room for breakfast for all guests but were very pleasant about it The room was comfortable didn t always get cleaning service if we left the hotel late which I don t think is reasonable for this level of property , Front desk and concierge Staff were wonderful very helpful with tips on tours eats and directions Room was comfortable and well appointed Loved the shower tub combo 
215856,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The rooms where so small you could hardly move around the bed as was the bathroom The staff in the bar and restaurant breakfast where very slow and tea came out cold The hotel was quite a way from central London and it is a bit of a walk to the tube station too , Clean
215857,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Nothing to complain about , My husband and I had a lovely stay at the Dorsett Sheperds Bush The room had a comfy bed large windows and a nice view of the park The staff was very friendly and attentive The room was clean and spacious We ll definitely stay here again 
215858,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Breakfast area is not tidy tables were dirty and overall service is not up to standard Glass was dirty , Great value for money Clean spacious rooms and well maintained Front desk is helpful 10min walk from central line 
215859,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We had requested our room in a quite location in the hotel so we got an internal room but unfortunately there is no roof over the bar area the bar is located in the center of the hotel so the noise rises up past all of the rooms If you have an internal room you don t have an outside window to open The rooms can get very warm and the Air con is pretty noisy We requested that our room was made up each day The bed was made and the Towels changed etc but our Bed linen wasn t changed at all and we stayed a total of 3 nights which was a little disappointing to see , The location of the property was good easy access to means of Public Transport The Lobby Bar area was nice Restaurant was nice and the staff were friendly Bed was comfortable with a lovely shower facilitates and Toiletries provided Nice touch to have glasses provided and a fridge in the bed room Good breakfast each morning 
215860,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, There is a nice park in front of the hotel which make its perfect for families with kids Moreover Westfield mall is within 5 min walking and the nearest gate you can go to lego store This hotel is perfect for families 
215861,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, the room had high windows which made it impossible to look out and made the room dark so you needed the lights on , it was centrally located handy for the tube and shopping centre nearby 
215862,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, When we entered our room just by the lifts we noticed that there were scuff marks around chips out of furniture paint etc but nothing too bad We also noticed that the coffee was plain nescafe very cheap instant coffee and whilst I am a coffee snob would have thought that as a four star hotel they would be inclined to provide something of a bit higher quality We had asked for an outside room and were warned the window was obscured to protect residents in the street behinds privacy so although an outside window no actual view Nothing so far to really complain about We went out in the evening to a concert arriving back about 12 30 We both had a shower and pulled the bed sheets back to go to bed now about 1 am As we pulled the sheets back the top stuck to the bottom and there was chewing gum on the sheets We called reception and despite explaining the problem they sent a night worker up with a single sheet He went away and came back and changed the sheets Now about 1 30 we waited in our bathrobes for him to change the sheets a very uncomfortable embarrassing experience But it was done and now very tired we went to bed The room has an obscured window between the bathroom and the bedroom So this means in the daytime you can see each others outline in each room but in the night if you need to use the bathroom and turn the light on you wake the person sleeping We were also woken by people outside the room waiting for the lift When it came to checkout I was expecting some form of apology or compensation for the chewing gum on the bedsheets on the first night This was not offered and we had to explain what the problems had been We asked for a refund for the first night that we stayed and the receptionist said she was unable to offer this but would wipe the bar bill one cup of tea one cup of coffee and one croissant to compensate us This was completely unacceptable to use , We booked this hotel as we used to live in the area and were very interested to see what they had done with the building The location is excellent and we decided to pay a bit more money for a four star hotel to treat ourselves to a nice weekend in London It started off well reception staff were courteous and we were able to access our room earlier than official check in The communal areas of the building were attractive and nicely laid out 
215863,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The choice of beverage in the room was very limited and the mini bar was empty Climbing over the side of the bath was somewhat treacherous for a shortie especially as there were no hand rails Breakfast was satisfactory although the chairs were far too low for the tables the coffee tasted of the metal jug it was served from I asked for chamomile tea and received a four person pot with a single bag draped over the side The staff were well drilled on clearing the tables but attracting their attention for the missing teaspoons for example was impossible so one had to get up from the table and approach a member of staff who was then very happy to assist The surrounding area was not great and we were unfortunate to come into contact with one beggar who I offered 2 50 to but she replied No sweetheart I need paper money not coins , The bed and pillows were super comfy The room and public areas were all very clean and stylish The reception and cleaning staff were all super friendly helpful and polite Useful supplies in the batroom Location very close to Shepherds Bush and Shepherds Bush Market tube station many buses and a train station and about five minutes walk from Westfield shopping centre Our stay was to coincide with a concert at Wembley station and suited us well 
215864,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, the neighborhood is rather not British like traffic is busy the park opposite is a let down , Convenience as there are many shops nearby some open extremely early 
215865,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Quite a walk to the nearest Tube station Not enough restaurants in the area , Excellent breakfast Very modern and comfortable rooms Free phone for guests use Courteous and helpful front desk staff Quiet hotel 
215866,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The bathroom was ridiculously small could hardly close the door when you wee standing in there Sink in bathroom so big you couldn t really reach the water when washing your face and too big for that size of bathroom ,No Positive
215867,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I can t fault anything , The beds are super comfy the linen crisp and clean We were upgraded to a suite which was amazing and felt luxurious Great facilities and will only book this hotel in London from now on 
215868,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, N a, The staff are friendly and helpful the room was lovely and the bed very comfortable It is also very close to two underground stations and the Westfield Shopping Centre
215869,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The bar was sterile furnitures worn out dirty and very few visitors Not inviting Cleaningstaff non Englishspeaking all from Romania Difficult to communicate with The hotel seems slowly to degrade Need a lot more umpff Concierge was the best part of the hotel , Breakfast very expensive in regard to what was offered Poor choices apart from fat eggs bacon etc No cereals very little yoghurt fruit Skipped breakfast after trying once 
215870,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, i can t find any fault , Nice entrance and the feel Staff were pleasant and great Wide entrance into hotel lift area and room was nice Good tv and wifi Bed comfy and bathroom spacious 
215871,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We were on the upper levels of the hotel this time While there is a great view of the London sprawl the way that the window blinds work is not that great Granted we were on the west side of the hotel and the rising sun did not affect us The setting sun was especially bright If you are in need of absolute quiet during your stay this hotel may be a bit difficult for you For some reason sounds travel and echo in the hallway Slamming doors or chatting people can be heard rather easily This is from the hallway only as we did not hear through the walls For the scoring facilities was knocked as there were some renovations occurring at the time of the stay Comfort was reduced because the bathroom was quite small A very tall person might have problem using the toilet , Dorsett Shepherd Bush is not all that close to the city center However it has everything around it that you could need when you get back from the city center There are 2 pubs a shopping center multiple fast food normal restaurants and a small grocery store nearby The hotel itself is of the trendy variety The staff is quite helpful if you need directions to from a locale The breakfast has a tremendous selection even though it was quite a bit reduced from our first visit to the hotel As many sites say it is a 5 minute walk to the Shepherds Bush underground station This is true In front of the Shepherds Bush station there is a bus station that will take you to almost any part of London 
215872,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The cooked breakfast did not taste as good as expected , Shepherd s Bush is just a wonderful area Easy to reach and all kind of restaurants and shops around We ve booked a Dorsett Double Room but as birthday surprise were given a suite This suite was just gorgeous and superb clean A lot of space a huge double bed LG TV and Lavazza coffee machine The bathroom provided both shower and bath tub and two basins The hotel building itself is also very impressive and the lobby lifts hallways all very clean Very friendly and helpful staff The breakfast has a good selection 
215873,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, This time we found the service in the breakfast restaurant a bit chaotic On saterday everything was rearanged and the buffet was scattered all over the restaurant It was no longer possible to have an omelet made I hope this is only a temporary problem , Each time we go to London we choose this hotel The location with two underground stations nearby is just perfect The staff is very friendly The rooms are nice and the beds are very comfortable Also the free use of the smartphone with all the apps a tourist in London needs is just perfect 
215874,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I have nothing negative to say about the experience at this hotel on this occasion , The beds are probably the most comfortable amongst all the hotels I have stayed in worldwide 
215875,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The pictures restaurant was poor very cold and no account for dietary concerns whereby the very hard steamed veg was covered in melted butter without any indication this was to be so The room i had was like a prison cell no windows It was supposed to be a deluxe room would hate to see the standard room the toilet blocked up and the bathroom was tricky to get into because of the way the door opened The WiFi was very poor ,No Positive
215876,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The window can not be opened , The bed is very comfortable the room is very clean the location of this hotel is very good really convenient to do activities in London 
215877,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, Beautiful modern hotel very easy to get to in Zone 2 Extremely comfortable bed I could have stayed in it all day The bathroom was the biggest I ve ever seen in a hotel I would definitely stay here again 
215878,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Wifi seemed to need an extra facebook log in or something which seemed excessive , Beautiful lobby area Staff all professional informed helpful funny informative lovely responsive Lovely room for a good price even all the guests seemed lovely 
215879,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I needed to sleep during the day and this hotel is noisier internally than my main road house Doors constantly bang ALL DAY LONG , Very clean throughout helpful staff clean sheets food was ok classy decor 
215880,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, I booked this hotel for my sister and her new husband to spend the night after their wedding which was nearby The staff were so lovely and really went the extra mile providing them with a suite They had a wonderful stay 
215881,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Initially we were shown a room overlooking the atrium just above the bar Although the room was well fitted out with nice large bed its location was rather dreary felt claustrophobic Staff kindly changed it four us Breakfast was a bit of a scrum on Sunday morning coffee dire , Bed very comfy Excellent bedding We eventually got a room at the top which although small had a magnificent view 1 Charming barman who made me delicious cocktails 
215882,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Reception staff on check in were not friendly at all and were even worse on check out when I asked a question I was answered with a sigh Reception staff were not helpful at all , Our room was very comfortable and spacious Bar and restaurant staff were friendly Room service was quick and food was warm and tasty 
215883,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The shower was a disaster it was impossible to take a shower without flooding the bathroom due to a bad seal We mentionned this along with the broken coffee machine on 2 occasions but nothing was done about it, Very friendly personel
215884,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, It felt odd to have no view only the inside of the hotel This made the room dark I was surprised that the bed was a double although it didn t matter to me as I was alone I had left it late to book a room and needed to be in this area The cost was much more than I would usually pay but that was my fault , The hotel is in a good location It was only a couple of minutes to the Westfield Centre and a few more to the tube The room was a good size with a comfortable bed The receptionists were very polite and helpful I was on the sixth floor and the lift was really speedy I could not use my phone for some reason despite the free wifi but the guy on reception managed to get the internet for me 
215885,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I did not appreciate that an extra 50 deposit was not mentionned during check in while pre authorizing the credit card I just happened to see that the amount was different to the cost of the room Remembering some of the reviews on tripadvisor I asked to pay the 50 deposit in cash which was no problem and got it back when we checked out The bathroom was very small even when you were in it alone you could barely turn around comfortable Also the side of the bathroom facing the room bed has frosted glas which is not stated in the hotel s room description Whoever is in the room can see what you re doing inside the bathroom which might be okay when you are travelling with your partner but not so much when travelling with a coworker Not everybody wants to expose themselves when showering , The check in and check out were done in a timely manner the receptionnist was pleasant The room size was ok for a double room ac a bit too cold bed was comfortable enough Breakfast comes continental as well as full english breakfast the waitresses and waiters were very considerate and it was not too busy early morning I loved their hot chocolate We were in town for a show at the Empire the location of the hotel was perfect as it is literally next door to the venue 
215886,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, Beautiful hotel Great breakfast loved how we could order an omelette and it was made in the restaurant The room was Nice and clean beds were great for sleeping and relaxation My daughter and I enjoyed the stay 
215887,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The plates at breakfast are cold and according to one member of staff they have no way to warm the plates This means your eggs bacon and sausages etc are nearly cold before you get back to your table , Still an excellent hotel 
215888,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I have kindly asked for a fruit basket as my friend and her husband don t drink and that was their honeymoon but it seems the hotel forgot to deliver it So the couple had to find something to eat after a long and an emotional day,No Positive
215889,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I wish the bed was a little bigger and there was more funiture in the room especially since it was a room for 3 such as side tables bigger closet etc, Location was excellent a lot of restaurants and shops close by especially halal ones Westfield mall and train station was just 2 min walk which was great 
215890,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, My only real criticism is that the size capacity of the breakfast restaurant is too small at the busy times between 7 30 8 30am Except for that the rest was all of a good standard The Service was good and respectful They honestly listen carefully if you have any criticism and do their best to make the customer happy 
215891,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Minor point that the door key didn t work initially and we had to go back down to reception a couple of times to sort it before we could get into our room , All round a great hotel Nice room Friendly staff 
215892,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, There as a really good choice of breakfast food but the cooked breakfast was a little bit tired by the time we came to eat it , The bed was very comfortable 
215893,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, A bottle opener in the bedroom would have been handy , Great location for Westfield restaurants and various modes of transport Good breakfast fabulous room Great d cor inside hotel would recommend would stay again Valet parking was easy 
215894,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, There was nothing I didn t like about the place , Very comfortable bed room was excellent as was the room service Staff are very helpful Have stayed there several times and have booked again to stay at the end of this month 
215895,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, My room had one of those doors connecting to another room I could hear everything Sound insulation severely lacking and therefore privacy lacking , My 3rd time at this hotel Westfield just a one minute walk Very clean room Friendly and professional staff 
215896,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, After travelling around the UK and Europe for many weeks it was nice to have a very compfortable bed and pillow the room temperature could be set manually and the facilities were very clean 
215897,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I paid for my room when I arrived and again when I left Although they re pending transactions it still took the money out of my account and means I m awaiting a refund of the first payment , It was right next to the o2 venue where we went 
215898,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The card pre authorisation was not explained to us I had to ask why the amount on the machine was 50 pound more than the cost of the room , Great location brilliant breakfast helpful staff 
215899,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The staff were rude and incompetent on check in lied which made the whole experience unpleasant No parking on check in at around 3 so had to look elsewhere for parking Had to wait in huge que to check in Full balance of hotel and a 50 was taken as a holding deposit off my card however I wasn t told about this Checked into room was given a twin room however I had booked a large double bed room in December I was then told there was no other rooms however they had disabled rooms with access which were still not what we booked I was told by the staff I had booked a disable room however when I said so why was I given a twin room they had no answer I was told by a staff member to understand that is what I had booked to which I showed him my paperwork which said Large Double Bed Then after a long wait I was given the room I had booked and the staff member was hoping for some appraisal for getting me the room which I had already booked Then on check out my card was again taken and I was charged again for the room So currently my card is still on hold of 200 not including the room charge which I wasn t even told about I phoned the hotel to ask about the holding charge and why it was being held as I hadn t been told on check in and was told that there was no booking under my name I was then asked what room after telling the lady the room all of a sudden I had stayed at the hotel with no apology whatsoever So all in all if you want a great experience pay less and youll most likely get more of a pleasant service All in all worst hotel I have ever stayed in for service , The hotel was ok and clean
215900,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, The service was excellent and the fact we got an upgrade on our room for my Partners birthday was an extra special touch Thank you for making our stay perfect 
215901,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, 8 of us booked in and could not get in our rooms until 17 30 and then got woken up at 09 30 from staff trying to clean the rooms We was offered free drinks and then asked to pay for them so we did to save any embarrassment overall a poor turn out and waiting for rooms messed up some of our plans for the day and missed a dinner reservation due to this , Staff very friendly considering the pressure they had been put under with the hotel over booking rooms
215902,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, No car park have to park at Westfield 12 5 Service charge on everything from the bar bottle of wine that s already overpriced then to add another 12 5 is not great Good business for hotel group , Great location for O2 Shepherds Bush
215903,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Nothing , Incredibly helpful staff very professional The room was immaculate with all the facilities you would expect from a modern hotel The beds were very comfortable with lovely white cotton bedding 
215904,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Terribly disappointing when we were made to wait hours past guaranteed check in time of 2pm despite having made room reservation 4 months ago Request was made for double bed in booking and reception told us it was when we finally received our key however it was 2 single beds when we got to the room We had to return to lobby and wait again for the next available room with double bed I m pregnant and I definitely do not appreciate the hassle , Location of property was favourable 
215905,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The cocktail bar gets very busy particularly late in the evening and so the service declines accordingly which is a pity More bar staff would help obviously , very comfortable beds good check in friendly staff nice cocktails fast lifts free Smarties and right next door to the venue for the gig we went to which is why we chose this hotel 
215906,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, There was nothing that we didn t like , Everything about the Hotel was just right The bed was extremely comfortable the shower was a dream The TV actually worked and was both a good size and in a good position We didn t eat there so cannot comment on the food save to say that there were several people dining when we passed A superb hotel 
215907,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Fantastic hotel but quite expensive at 145 a night without breakfast , Beautiful room though very small smart bathroom Very comfortable bed with good pillows made for a good night s sleep Gorgeous decor and well planned reception 
215908,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Stayed here twice Both times there was something wrong with the room Not one to complain but for the price to put it politely not the best , Location ok
215909,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Only small grumble I have used the hotel quite regularly over the last 12 months but there is never any loyalty benefit of upgrades or otherwise which other hotels offer Example of a Hotel I stay in Cardiff know how often I stay and offer me additional benefits for loyalty , Great hotel all round 
215910,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Room was very small had to pay extra for a bigger room after wife protested the size of the room Walking from Westfield after parking as hotel will charge 24 to park for you in Westfield, Generally clean hotel and looks cozy and good parking 8 if you park at Westfield Great location for shopping at Westfield 
215911,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, Excellent all round The valet parking was helpful although it was luck we saw the sign as there isn t any car parking or ability to stop easily out the front The cost was the same as the nearby car park so certainly worth it The breakfast was excellent and so was the cocktail bar and the facilities Highly recommended 
215912,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, Breakfast is great My favourite part of the stay Only suggestion is to add black pudding to the choices And this time the Moscow State Circus was right outside 
215913,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, No hand bidet near the toilet Some reception staff needs to have better PR in dealing with guest they should be patient and friendly especially during check in , Bed and pillows were very comfy Room was tastefully decorated and clean Bathroom had both a bath and walk in shower Short walking distance to the Westfield shopping center Our rented car was parked at Westfield and the parking rates were much lower than the hotel rates This was our third time staying at the Dorset Hotel 
215914,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The room was very small much smaller than we expected looking the pictures from the hotel presentation on booking com Also the bathroom was tiny no space to put the towels or personal items we had to keep them in the room The window can not be opened it is just a glass not a real window which was very unpleasant especially in the afternoon when the atmosphere became suffocating There was a big space between the entrance door and the room floor around 2 cm so we could hear all the noise from the corridor and in the morning we were woken up by the people going to breakfast No fruits at breakfast just a fruit salad, The hotel has an interesting design and although it is not in the centre is very well connected with main attractions by bus the bus stop is just in front of the hotel bus 94 runs to Piccadilly in about 30 minutes or underground 2 lines It is just 5 minutes walk from Westfield shopping mall where you can find everything you need from food to clothes We had a deluxe DR facing the houses behind the hotel which was very quiet with comfortable bed and pillows The staff from the reception was very helpful we asked to change the room and they immediately provided another one 
215915,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Unfortunately the bathroom was tiny and difficult to move about in, The staff were really attentive and I liked the fact that the hotel was modern and comfortable 
215916,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Nothing Would recommend , Nice hotel staff welcoming close to the tube station and literally next door to Shepherds Bush Empire We had a large room nice comfortable bed and very quiet Would stay here again 
215917,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We were given a disabled access bedroom without being told so the bathroom was uncomfortable loo too high sink and mirror too low and a fold up chair in the shower got in the way and nowhere near as nice as we would have expected in a 4 star London hotel When we queried this we were told that the accessible rooms are classed as a standard room and so that was what we had booked I feel sorry for people with disabilities who have to put up with a lower standard of bathroom in hotels Very disappointing , Great location for the O2 Shepherd s Bush Empire and Westfield Shopping Bed was comfortable
215918,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Although the room has air conditioning the window doesn t open which in a small room was a disadvantage , Excellent location for Westfield Shopping and the tube station Very helpful staff and efficient left luggage service on day of departure 
215919,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The bathroom could be more spacious , Everything was great There are many options around such as shopping center pubs and restaurants There are two metro lines near 
215920,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I felt the breakfast service could have been a little more efficiently organised I had to more or less flag down a waitress to get coffee I like to have plentiful supplies of coffee in the morning and there was no one bustling about giving refills or making sure we were ok However the food selection was good and the quality was also fine, The hotel foyer and public areas are particularly impressive on arrival and the overall impression was further boosted by the gentleman at reception who gave us an unexpected upgrade to a suite As the next day was our Wedding Anniversary and also Mother s Day this was inspired timing The suite was commodious beautifully decorated and very well equipped I particularly enjoyed the Lavazzo coffee maker the tastefully appointed tea making facilities and the elegant bathroom with both shower and bath The toiletries were also of a very high standard I couldn t say enough good things about it The hotel is very well located about 5 minutes walk from the Westfield shopping centre with it marvellous selection of retail shopping and restaurants It is also convenient for both the Shepherd s Bush and the Shepherd Bush Market Tube station 
215921,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Sat on sofa in bar was wet when I sat on it in the morning whilst waiting for a colleague resulting in a wet trousers Not the best start to the day , Reception staff excellent and very welcoming
215922,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Could not reach see out of or open windows There were steep slopes that went up to the windows which were very narrow and long I stood on a chair and held my phone towards the window to take a photo so we could see what the view was like I have added pic s so you can see the tiny windows are to the top of the outside pic just above the white bar , Very comfy bed and pilllows friendly and happy staff Booked a standard double room was a pleasant surprise how big the room was and the bed was kingsize Very clean hotel 
215923,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The reception had a stinky smell for a couple of days Also no tissues and water in the room had to ask , Wonderful and helpful staff members Hotel is clean and well presented
215924,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, This hotel is really amazing Our room and bathroom were super clean quiet and comfortable The staff is always smiling being helpful and always checking if you re ok or if you need something else Wifi was always working and a plus for this Hotel is that they offer a phone with 4G connection so you can use while outside in the city yes you save money Our experience staying in Dorsett was the best it could possibly be and in the future if I return to London I would definitely stay there again It is interesting to highlight that the bedroom and bathroom are really equipped with solutions for disability and emergency 
215925,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Windows are locked so the only air which comes inside is via the air conditioning system , One of the best choices in London Close to the tube rail station The staff is great the breakfast is outstanding 
215926,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Front desk manager Juliana was amazing but other receptionist were so slow, Size and cleanless of the room and Front desk manager Juliana was great very helpful
215927,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, the breakfast is poor compared to any continental hotel but this is a common problem in all UK hotels i ever stayed The waiting staff is very confused and forgets orders for tea coffee be prepared for a long wait and if in a hurry make sure you order everything with the headwaiter as soon as you arrive speak in large LEGO letters, bed very comfortable I got upgraded to a junior suite and the size of the room was more than enough comfortable hotel quiet rooms staff making sure there is no noise pollution by the kids
215928,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I booked 4 double bed rooms for my guests but 3 of them got twin rooms even though the reception confirmed the double room with me in the check in The twin room has very small and short single beds and small blanket maybe just suitable for kids but definitely not good for my guests ,No Positive
215929,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The staff never let you feel welcomed On the day of departure we checked out and left luggages in the hotel When we came back to pick them up they couldn t find one of them It was half an hour later when they found it somewhere We were getting late for our flight but the front desk staff didn t seem concerned at all and not a single person apologized to us for this ,No Positive
215930,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I m very disappointed with the breakfast room The The plates were dirty as they were straight out of the storage box and none has clean them before putting on display Table tops needed cleaning as well Staff just chats about instead of looking after customers We had 2 people staying in room but shampoo and etc only for one , Next door to O2 empire
215931,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The food sent to my room on room service was poor The eggs were undercooked but the rest was over cooked like it had been sitting under a warmer for hours on end The late night meal was tasteless and won t worth the asking price I had a very disappointing stay ,No Positive
215932,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Menu choice limited very little hot food portions very very small obviously nothing was cooked for dinner Where was the Chef Restaurant almost empty what a shame It is a pleasant room , Bed was comfortable breakfast was good
215933,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Stayed for 5 nights and we had a room facing straight into room on the other side so couldnt open curtains on mornings Would be nice to have a room facing to park outside even that could be little bit noisier , Breakfast was good but on weekend mornings you need to wait quite a while before you can get a table Rooms are nice clean and bed really comfy 
215934,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, Lovely comfortable pillows and bed Great to have air con Breakfast excellent especially the scrambled eggs Car Valet parking service a plus Will return and would recommend 
215935,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Biscuits in room would have been nice , I needed a hotel local to the Westfield Shopping centre as i was having eye surgery at an opticians there Great location for what i needed 10 minute stroll to the shopping centre and train station friendly staff excellent customer Service throughout my stay Nice room classic design clean and comfortable 
215936,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Our room was near elevator and had a locked a joining door to next door Could hear everything from next door including hair dryer and and 7am alarm , Location is good room is nice and big
215937,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, All good, Did not eat there but had drinks in the bar which were reasonably priced Also very delighted when we were overheard in bar discussing how we were waiting for housekeeping to finish our room and were given complimentary drinks Thoughtful 
215938,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Can t fault our room on this visit Everything was fantastic , Lovely big well appointed room Very comfortable bed and pillows Great view Bathroom was really spacious lots of towels and robes 
215939,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Sadly hotel is losing its edge especially for 4 stars This is my 4th visit as it is near my office but 4 events needed dealing with a within about 30 minutes of checking in to my room a member of staff just came in using their pass card without knocking Luckily no real issue and they apologized but it happened b No hot water on the first morning and no shower water at all So a wash and shave in cold water No time to fix as I needed to go to work but I reported it to the front desk c I was in 615 a corner room near the staff access door This door clunks annoyingly every time it opens and closes along with seemingly easy sound transmission of staff conversations On weekday mornings probably not noticeable as I was going to work but not acceptable at 6 30am on a Saturday d Whilst fetching my eggs and sausages at breakfast my coffee and apple juice were cleaned up despite leaving my key on my table If one of these had happened on its own I would not have said much but taken as a whole this makes me reluctant to rebook next time Writing this before I check out so let s see what the desk staff say , Good location and very clean comfortable rooms 
215940,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Let down by poor attention to detail Smell of damp or drains in Reception and Coffee Shop Blocked shower drain flooded the bathroom Dinner order taken wrongly Salt cellars in Restaurant contain too fine salt so that it floods out onto food All minor points but they add up to poor management , Overall style is Grand Location is convenient for cheap parking at Westfield
215941,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Nothing in particular but some more information about the facilities at the hotel would be useful for those uncertain of availability and so on, The location meant there were a lot of options for meals and attractions The staff were wonderful and the room was excellent
215942,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We did expect to gain access to our car as and when we needed it however this was not the case The concierge parking actually parks your car at the Westfield Shopping Centre approximately 5 minutes away , Lovely clean room with very comfy beds Breakfast in bed was fantastic value Staff were more than helpful
215943,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Nothing, We checked in early at approx 10am where the receptionist was very helpful and offered us an available room immediately despite the fact that check in time wasn t until 2pm My sister had booked a deluxe room as she was travelling with her husband and child They were upgraded to an executive suite free of additional again without having looked for same Very helpful friendly and accommodating staff
215944,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Bedroom window could have been cleaner Though didn t dampen our experience , Couldn t believe that we were given a smart phone to carry around London Didn t use it but still an exellent touch 
215945,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, The staff were so helpful and polite nothing was too much trouble even when helping us to understand the underground We were made to feel special from the moment we arrived we received a complimentary upgrade and a nice welcome card with some chocolate brownies in the room There is also a complimentary phone to use that has 4g while travelling around London which is great as you then don t eat into your own data allowance There is also a handy underground guide on there which was helpful The cocktails were lovely from the bar make sure you take advantage of happy hour 
215946,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Overpriced hotel the bathroom was very small Windows could not be opened Also the wellness was not very impressive , The lobby service bed and hygiene are overall okay 
215947,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, 140 cm bed for two is a little too narrow Noisy room service showed up at 8 am on a saturday which wasn t even our checkout day , Modern and clean building and room decent breakfast buffet more fresh fruit would be even better 
215948,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I was asked for a 50 pounds deposit at check in This wasn t mentioned anywhere in the hotel s terms and conditions I find it absurd for a 4 stars hotel Haven t encountered this at any other hotel I ve been , Comfortable bed spacious walk in shower Breakfast offers a good selection of hot and cold food Large shopping centre Westfield very close Underground station 3 min from the hotel
215949,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We tried two times to change our room to a one with a view to outside we had window inside the hotel both times staff said they would look into it get back to me never did , Not bad 
215950,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Paid for valet parking but unfortunately when we picked up our keys to leave we found there were two other cars blocking us in and a truck The staff member immediately got the keys for the other cars after I told him about the problem but still he had to move each car out of the way and around the morning cleaning truck loading in sheets etc Then we had to reverse out by mounting a curb bit in their lane in order to leave Thankfully we had left extra time in our journey to get to our ferry home but please make sure you do so too as if you were running late this would be a problem Staff member did everything he could given the situation but clearly something had gone wrong given we were asked to write down what time we leaving at the day before , Lovely room and ideal location for the o2 shepards bush Literally one building between the hotel and the venue Would definitely stay again 
215951,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Breakfast felt like it was run on a budget took ages for fresh food to be replenished I also don t think they have the required space for the number of people in the hotel , everything apart from breakfast
215952,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, If I have to find a downside I d say breakfast though there s a lot of variety for salty and British food the sweet section is quite poor but it s fine anyway if we consider all the good sides of this hotel They are a bit slow in service during breakfast maybe there are a lot of trainees and this could be the reason It s true that breakfast room get busy during the weekend and sometimes you need to wait few minutes before get seated to your table I would recommend anyway , The hotel is very clean and rooms are very big if compared to London s standards I had a deluxe Spotless bathroom with very big shower and bathtub Well connected to central London Just few steps away from Sheperd s Bush Empire venue which is great if you have to see a concert there I did so convenient Wi Fi is working very good and it s free 
215953,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Reception area rather noisy and difficult to hear staff when checking in out, Luxury and comfort Beautiful building Good service 2 for 1 cocktails 6 8pm Wonderful shower Tastefully opulent design throughout Immaculate
215954,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Do not pay for breakfast very poor service not good at breakfast you will wait for coffee and tea tables are not cleared and cooked breakfast was cold and hot food not fresh, Rooms are great with great shower
215955,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Nothing , I think this is the best hotel I have stayed at in London at this price category so far The room was bright modern clean and big especially for London It had a small fridge coffee and tea to prepare if wanted a safe a proper work desk fast WiFi and a real very good hair dryer as well and the usual ironing equipment which I did not use The bed was big and very comfortable The staff was friendly and helped me out with documents I needed printed within a wink of an eye I booked it to attend an event at the next door Shepherd s Bush Empire and it was ideal for that The city center Oxford Circus is easy and quick to reach with the near by Central Line There are also bus stops all round the hotel but I did not use a bus I would book it again any time 
215956,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I liked everything but as a regular customer who has stayed at the hotel in almost all of my visits to London should have been given something extra by the hotel like for example an upgrade to a suite some free breakfasts or free late check outs or early check ins , I liked almost everything 
215957,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The range of food at breakfast is a bit restricted and includes none of the slow starch items a diabetic needs other than the sometimes available brown baguettes The restaurant staff seem to have a curious blind spot fried bread Most hotels will happily produce this on request if it s not on the buffet I had to explain to the staff what it was The first time I got it was excellent but afterwards the kitchen never seemed to get it right , My room was excellent with an accessible bathroom including a sit down shower This was far better designed than some I ve seen in other hotels 
215958,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Breakfast was awful cold food poor service orange juice not filled up and the worst tea I have had in years The rest of the hotel was so good it was just such a shame , Location staff and decor
215959,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Everything was good but at the check out time we locked ourselves out the room and forget my phone inside as the key doesn t work anymore I told the house keeping to open the door so i can take my phone AND VERY RUDELY SHE SAID NO NO NO go by your self to the reception and take another key I said can you call them for me and tell them to give me my phone back AGAIN VERY RUDELY SAID NO NO NO THREE TIMES On my way to the reception i found another house keeping and i told her the story and very nicely came to open the door BUT the other house keeping TOLD HER NOT TO OPEN FOR US I don t know why I spoke to the reception and nothing has been done, Everything was perfect EXCEPT HOUSE KEEPING 
215960,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Restaurant choice at inflated price without a discount voucher for that month created a lacklustre atmosphere and a poor possibly inexperienced dour server waiter, En suite shower room and bath and comfortable large bed
215961,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, Was given a disabled room which isn t ideal if not disabled Breakfast was chaos with no glasses and plates available You had to wait 10 minutes to be served coffee 
215962,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I made the mistake of valet parking 24 for 24 hours when in the past I have parked at Westfield a few hundred yards away at a fraction of the cost, Convenient location friendly staff clean and comfortable rooms
215963,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Very small moan really meagre amount of tea coffee supplied in rooms, Very helpful staff great location rooms and beds were very comfortable lovely cafe very near for an excellent snack Liz s cafe
215964,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Nothing about the hotel just the area is probably not the best to walk back to late at night if alone grab a cab , We have stayed at the Dorsett on many occasions and is always clean comfortable The breakfast is good and the Chinese restaurant next door is the best A great location to stay for shopping at Westfield and just on the Central Line for direct access to London 
215965,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Room had frosted glass rather than a window which I wasn t expecting Shepherd s Bush may not be especially photogenic but it would be nice to see outside Breakfast disappointing Was asked if I wanted tea or coffee placed an order which never turned up Nobody checked to see if I wanted anything to drink after the initial request No bacon at first Some did turn up eventually but it was rather leathery and didn t look freshly cooked Breakfast staff were arguing when I was there It looked as if a tour group had all gone to breakfast at the same time which caused the problems but if you re running a hotel you need to expect that Overall not worth the price I paid , Reasonable location fairly short walk to tube station Very convenient for Shepherd s Bush Empire 
215966,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The massage treatment wasn t available on the day of arrival which was a bit shame since my girlfriend had a really bad back and neck pain after long haul flight , Good location very easy to access the central line underground Near Westfield meaning there are lots of dinning options Clean and comfortable Enjoyed staying with my girlfriend 
215967,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Breakfast isn t the best It s OK but not memorable not great sausages or bacon and the general choice is fairly limited Service at the bar can also be quite slow, Very helpful staff lovely hotel and really comfy room This was my 5th or 6th stay and I am always happy with the Dorsett
215968,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The breakfast buffet breakfast was a bit of a hindrance and the food was not top quality , The cleanliness of the hotel helpful staff and location of hotel was superb 
215969,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Paid 152 for a room with no windows a bathroom door that didn t lock with sinks that didn t drain A TV with a remote that didn t work properly and constant banging from adjacent rooms all throughout the night, It looked nice that s about it
215970,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, It was always cold in the room Fan worked all the times I could not figure it out There was no hot water in wash hand stand The breakfast was monotonous hence it was very expensive , Location is close to 3 subway stations There is a huge Westfeld mall nearby hotel Extremely comfortable for intense shopping Beds was comfy 
215971,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, Wow what a beautiful stay I had at this hotel Recently I ve been traveling so much and stayed in different 4 5 star hotels And I can easily say that this hotel deserves more than 4 Starting from check in to the check out Very nice and clean room very comfortable bed Room service and breakfast good selection tasty food yummy breakfast great coffee Haven t tried the restaurant as its a lot of choice out of the hotel but I m sure it s good too In my opinion the gym could be slightly bigger but still better than nothing Shame I haven t had time to try their spa hopefully next time if I m staying with them I will definitely try it out I also liked the little decor on the door little birds it s really cool Makes the hotel design look special Nice and well trained staff Especially the management very friendly and professional Big thank you to Sabir Tahir he made my stay even better as he was able to sort out a little issue I had with room service delivery Great job guys keep doing what you doing the best 
215972,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, There should be a fridge with drinks and snacks where we ofcourse pay for when we check out As well I have never been to a hotel where they charge for tray service on top of a 12 service charge , The room was beautifully designed and cosy the hotel itself had its signature style with an oriental touch I have never seen in another before by the perfect location right next to westfield shopping centre 
215973,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, No hot water Next room having sex twice in one night Being asked for id on arrival why is this being used as a brothel The rooms look like something out of a bad arabian nights movie and the air conditioner is so loud you cant use it Do not stay here ,No Positive
215974,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I was allocated a disabled room and nowhere to leave things in bathroom Shower Gel and Shampoo not replaced after first day, Ambience good Staff friendly
215975,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, more shower pressure would have been appreciated but it was adequate drawer space would have helped if staying long enough to unpack , Stayed for 9 nights Initial 4 were in a standard room then upgraded to a deluxe Highly recommend deluxe if staying more than 1 or 2 nights as standard is quite small and confining loved the large bath towels and the bed
215976,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I was not to sure of the glass wall between room and shower toilet some things should remain private Went to bar where they automatically added 12 5 service charge to bill When I queried it I was told this was normal in England I did get a refund but maybe staff need retraining Breakfast was huge plenty of choice but as with all buffet breakfasts food must be kept hot and replenished , Lovely Hotel in the heart of The Bush not far from the tube and plenty of buses from o s of hotel within striking distance of the West End Staff v good Easy check in Three lifts that were quick I think it is worth the price 
215977,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We checked in two nights 1 on the first night there was machinery sounds next door so I complained to front desk which it stopped then I woke up 3 4am due to the sound again which I walked down to front desk to ask about this sound the staff said it was water pipe sounds due to heavy usage in the morning and couldn t be turned off As my daughter was sleeping in the room I requested to change room in the morning without interrupting my schedule of that day The staff promised they would move our bags to another room while we just need to leave the room key at front desk and go out for our planned activity the hotel should do the move by 12pm However we came back in the afternoon around 3pm there was nothing being done our packed bags were in the same room We reported and waited more than half an hour to switch to another room There were no body responsible and follow through my case which really upset me 2 there was fire alarm rang out loud on 6 1 around11am no explanation given If this was a testing the hotel should put up notice to inform guests If this was due to other problem the hotel should follow up with announcement to clarify the situation ,No Positive
215978,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The only thing was that the cleaner knocked on our door about 8 30am and it woke us with a fright , Beautiful clean modern hotel Lovely staff comfy bed We went to a gig at Sheoherds Bush Empire and the Hotel is right next door Excellent 
215979,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Executive lounge a little bit poor in decor and provisions Felt like a staff common room Not much choice of snacks and most of the day just has a range of candy There wasn t even any tea Was much nicer sitting out in the bar area , Good choice at breakfast Fabulous location and on site parking
215980,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The bedroom was a little on the cool side and it took a long while for it to warm up even with the heating on full blast , Very pleasant and welcoming staff after I d had a stressful day at work 
215981,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, At breakfast need to really attract attention of the staff to get your first coffee , Small bedrooms but well equiped quiet and very very good bed 
215982,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, the breakfast was quite poor accessibility to food was bad and pots with heavy lids were not easy to take off and put food on plate as there was no where to put the lids , Over all the hotel was perfect 
215983,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, There was dried blood on one of our pillows We ordered fresh orange juice for room service to our room and it was watery cheap orange squash We had to call down to reception to request dressing gowns and slippers and then when they came the material was cheap and scratchy and smelt like laundry bleach Also the valet car park is extortionate at 24 it s better to park at nearby Westfield for 9 However to the hotels credit it was a lovely staff member that told us that information, The hotel is beautifully appointed The decor and furnishings are beautiful The shower pressure is nice and firm and the enclosed wet room in the bathroom is a nice touch The staff were very friendly and they upgraded us for free 
215984,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, nothing comes to mind Perhaps translucent bathroom window looking into room not to everyone s taste , Room layout comfort of bed level of cleanliness courtesy of check instaff 
215985,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Bit pricey especially breakfast so ate at shopping centre which had Various eateries Car parking too dear , Location for concert venue and proximity of shopping centre Room and facilities were very good Lovely building
215986,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, My room didn t have a proper window just some sort of a blurred glass which felt a bit strange, The location of the hotel very central Close to the mall and the underground Affordable prices might ve been the deal I got book way ahead 
215987,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Thin room walls Sadly my neighbour decided they would use their hairdryer at 5 30am and they must have had long hair, Excellent location to Westfield shopping centre and wide choice for breakfast
215988,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Breakfast was very disorganised Food not very hot Tended to have run out of breakfast items not refilled but Staff helpful when asked for them Had to wait for tea coffee Don t know if I would book breakfast there again,No Positive
215989,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The rooms have no windows so couldn t get any fresh air but there is not much to be done about that Everything else was great , Good location near two underground stations Very new hotel so very comfy and tidy It was very busy over the xmas period but staff were very nice Good breakfast 
215990,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Room furniture was a little lacklustre Room was tiny for paying 135 this was a discount Breakfast was truly appalling obviously understaffed All drinks ran out no croissants huge queue for an omelette chef under pressure We waited a long time just for a coffee and tea and when i went to wait in the queue for food and returned the coffee and tea had been taken away despite my girlfriend leaving her purse and key on the table It really was a shambles and wish I had paid a little extra for the Hilton There is no excuse for running out of all juice water croissants and bread at the same time see photos I felt sorry for the F B manager but then again staff levels clearly were on the low side and inexperienced or incapable see photos not what you expect at Xmas , Location nice decor in main hotel Parked car at hotel which was very convenient and at 24 not the worst but not the best price 
215991,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Nothing, The staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel was in a good location A little bit out from the main attractions but these were easily accessible by public transport Plenty of nice local pubs and restaurants with good food and atmosphere I will be returning to this hotel in the future 
215992,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We arrived at 4pm New Year s Eve to be told our room was not ready for half an hour we were given a free drink in the bar area to the be told we had to wait another 40minutes and after a 5hour drive was not the news I wanted to hear Myself and my partner had no time to relax in the comfort of our room before we went out to a boat party that evening and had to rush to make sure we got ready on Time We was given an extended stay in the room the following morning which was a nice gesture but still very disappointed as I paid 280 for the night,No Positive
215993,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Bathroom slightly small having in mind that we stayed in a deluxe room Bath tub can be a tricky one if you have any physical difficulty I always prefer the wet rooms that unfortunately weren t the case here , Good location and valet parking available at reasonable cost Pleasant stay overall and happy with the service I wouldn t expect less or more for the price paid Good breakfast 
215994,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, room was dirty shower over flowed clearers woke us up everyday at 7am banging doors and talking the kitchen chef did not know what he was doing , reception and concierge were good
215995,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I was surprised by the facts the receptionist female rep I had over the phone prior to our arrival around 12ish was pretty blunt and unprofessional No name mentioned and no professional greeting less courteous We were calling in to know the possibility to check in early and even I asked for that politely given all the guests names and she was just shouting out loud When it comes to hospitality industry member of staff needs to be friendly as well as professional it was far cry from our ideal picture of the previous stays , Its been 3rd time staying at the premises The 1st and 2nd were superb The receptionists were always courteous and helpful 
215996,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The long wait for it to be available half four but it WAS an upgrade so I am not TOO bothered, Beautiful mini suite upgrade offered to me Was stunning Loved everything about it
215997,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, breakfast service is a bit slow waiting for tables and coffee cups could be improved on, comfy beds perfect location freindly staff If arriving by car park at Westfields Shopping Centre just 5 mins walk and only 8 for 24 hours secure parking We parked for 3 days no problems Perfect transport links 2 tube stations within 5 mins walk and bus stop to piccadilly circus outside hotel
215998,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We booked a standard double room and got a disabled room It was very cramped as it had a single and a double bed The shower room was really annoying as there was no shelf space to put toiletries and only one tiny towel rail I think the hotel should have taken the single bed out of the room and surely disabled people need shelf space and towel rails too We mentioned this to the reception staff member who was not at all interested , The proximity of the hotel to Westfield Centre The Hotel is comfortable and attractive 
215999,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Understaffed at breakfast bacon not renewed but it was boxing day , Spacious modern public areas Good sized room for London well designed shower room bed v comfortable Excellent lift system A class act for the price in London Handy for Westfield and close to tube and buses for central London 
216000,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Staff weren t very pleasant or welcoming Spa facilities closed over Christmas and this is part of the reason we booked this hotel No communication on this , Lovely room and decor Nice looking hotel Comfy beds and good bathroom
216001,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Worst smelling hotel I have ever been Something happened at night 20 21 December 2016 at third floor right side from elevator and this smelled I am sorry like pampers with diarrhea or worse and a lot stronger And hotel have no outer windows to open it and get some air And this smell was during all of my stay 20 23 December I asked cleaning staff what happened here but they were like what we smell nothing While I have seen that closest to elevator rooms has put a boot at their doorway to make some ventilate And hotel is not cheap I must say to have such experience , I liked bed and room and first of all location 
216002,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Not a single bad thing to say about the hotel While the location is good and convenient because it is walking distance to the train stations some of the surrounding areas seemed a bit rough, Beautiful interior fantastic facilities free WiFi in all parts of the hotel Wonderful friendly and helpful staff
216003,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, There really wasn t anything we didn t like The only thing we noticed whilst sitting in the bar was that no one could find the loo so perhaps some discreet signage , Very friendly helpful staff The bed was super comfortable and a proper King size great nights sleep Barman was hugely helpful and looked after us and our friends in the early hours so well Excellent breakfast lovely choice shame we were only staying 1 night Excellent location for Shepherds Bush Empire Will definitely come back 
216004,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Breakfast staff are a bit laid back keeping themselves busy doing nothing The guy who makes the omelettes eggs looks a very troubled man and speaks very poor English and if your there for a few days you give up trying to order Breakfast good but could be hotter , Good location rooms can vary depending on who checks you in it appears to give preferential treatment to Asian guests Complained about my deluxe room but was sorted out by a very polite and helpful coloured guy on the reception 
216005,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, There was no window in our room Staff did not inform us about the loyalty card untill after check out That wasted our 3 days stay to be added on the loyalty points, Location was great Gave us late check out
216006,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The bar prices are as usual for a hotel expensive but take advantage of their facebook check in offer , The hotel used to be a cinema and it has references to its past in the design of the building Excellent location nice rooms espresso and lovely breakfast The staff are very friendly and helpful
216007,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Bottled water was not available in the rooms , Staff was very helpful The breakfast was good The rooms was equipped with a good hair dryer and an ironing set The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was spacious and clean The location is very close to the tube and the Westfields shopping mall 
216008,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Tea and coffee not enough May be a biscuit cake on arrival after a long journey or a hot chocolate Would have been nice, The modern facilities lots of mirrors in the room comfy bed light and airy room walk in shower plenty of lighting
216009,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We stayed 8 nights Not enough drawer space in room or vanity shelf space drawer in bathroom Location was okay but too far from central London for walking sightseeing and the hop on off buses are not efficient due to traffic Had to use the tube Windows do not open for fresh air overlook the bar area Concierge gave incorrect bus info for our departure the cab driver called by hotel was terrible Door key constantly malfunctioned required numerous trips to the front desk , Very comfortable bed Enjoyed the sauna 
216010,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, This is 3rd time in a row I have been given a room adapted for wheelchair users Lowered bed is fine Lowered toilet with potty seat whb bath is not Last visit the shower was fixed to wall at the height to suit someone sitting rather than my husband of 6 4 Astonishing deflection from staff that this was to give us more room that this was a standard room and we should say if we don t want disabled facilities that when hotel full the cheaper rooms are allocated this way I left with no confidence at all that the hotel would overhaul its room allocation policy So much for encouraging loyal customers to return ,No Positive
216011,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The particular room we where given on this occasion was not the same as it has been on other occasions It had exposed metal rafters for floor to ceiling windows The view was interesting so this might be a great feature for some guests For me the sloping of the wall made it feel very cramped Would definitely stay at this hotel again however , the beds are very comfy the staff is always incredibly friendly 
216012,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We arrived 2 hours after check in time and our room was still not ready We d actually asked for an early check in before we were delayed The spa is advertised as having sauna steam room and a room to relax in free to all guests When we went up there we were sent back to our room to phone reception and order bathrobes to come back up to the spa in We were made to feel awkward that we didn t have any treatments booked and were just using the heat experience and also told there was no relaxation room for us to use after coming out the sauna We ordered cod cheeks tempura and got served fillets of battered cod when they took it back to replace it for the right meal they brought back smaller fillets of cod in batter with bones they should have just said there were no cod cheeks left Check out took about 15 minutes , Bed was really comfy and bedlinen lovely Liked the toiletries too 
216013,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, No bottles of water in the rooms which is unheard of nowadays What s the point of an empty fridge and no water Very slow service in the bar from an obviously overworked barman it was literally 40 minutes between us arriving in the bar and receiving our cocktails not good enough give the guy more help , Very good location we had originally planned a gig at the O2 and then some shopping but the gig was postponed Very helpful front of house staff comfortable rooms 
216014,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The hotel was full both nights we were there so very busy at breakfast The availability of fresh hot food was disappointing but OK when it came , From check in to check out and concierge the staff were friendly excellent and always willing to help even the valet parking was simple and prompt 
216015,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Menu in restaurant is exactly the same as it was last year not great for returning guests Also had the experience of my room not being cleaned and bed made Informed that rooms made up every other day I have stayed several times and first time I have been told this and it is not made clear on the website Think this should me made clear at check in Not what I expect from a 4 star hotel , Beds very comfortable and lovely bedding
216016,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Internal view of hotel bar from bedroom window like being on a ship Very noisy bedroom sound of ventilation system and mechanical noises made it difficult to sleep Hard bed not very comfortable Limited choice for breakfast no fresh fruit and so called hot food was almost cold when we had breakfast at 8am Will not be staying again , Helpful staff good elevators good bathroom
216017,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Nuthing and Sofasogood , Rooms were comfortable in an area with not so many tourists 10min walking distance to many Halal eateries 2 malls Tesco superoutlet and 2 tube stations 30 min bus ride to Bayswater Buckingham Palace Oxford street and Piccadilly areas SIA crew were staying there Can walk to Hilton Hotel to take bus to Bicester Premium Outlet 
216018,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, It s a good 25 30 ride in the underground to the hussle and buzzle of London Still a great value for the money , Service staff facilities comfy bed location close to big mall and two underground stations within walking distance 
216019,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, This is the second time I have been offered a room for the disabled On the first occasion we arrived early enough to change the room This time I arrived fairly late on my own and had to get up at 5 30 so did not want the hassle of changing rooms If my wife had been with me we would have not accepted the room as fit for purpose A number of features are too low for the able bodied and there was a smell coming from the drains After a shower this decreased and was fairly clear by morning Could management please review this strategy as there is a very acceptable alternative nearby Room 361,No Positive
216020,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Pillows in room were not thick enough but that s just personal opinion and if the air conditioning fan got too high there was an annoying clicking sound but we just turned it off for a peaceful nights sleep , The lobby and room had very classy d cor Bed was comfortable with nice bathroom and toiletries 
216021,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The chair in my room was rather tired looking which let it down otherwise the decor was fine , I was going to a gig at the O2 Empire so the location was perfect On arrival they didn t have the room I wanted so offered me free breakfast to make up for it It was a nice offer but the breakfast queue was out of the door so I didn t bother It was all comfortable enough and the staff were very friendly The toiletries were nice 
216022,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Que at Reception upon arrival lack of staff Rooms not ready even after 3pm said they had been busy 20 minute que to just get to Breakfast lack of staff cleaning tables etc left to the lady checking people in to Breakfast to do Hot Food was Cold No juice or glasses to put it in even if there were juice Coffee with no milk kept having to ask total lack of management or staff to run a hotel of this size, Nothing
216023,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, Fab hotel in great location Close to tubes Central line is v accessible Lobby is luxurious Our room was spacious and v comfortable Tripe glazed windows Staff lovely Would stay again
216024,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Poor water pressure from shower Poor selection of refreshments tea coffee milk and biscuits Seem to have downgraded on the extras that have made the Dorset so special in the past Hopefully we will have a better experience next time , I like the location Cleanliness One of our favourite Hotels when visiting London 
216025,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Staff seemed untrained and unorganised Lots of staff but it didn t feel like they knew what they were doing Breakfast time was particularly chaotic I have experienced far better interaction with staff from much cheaper hotels This really suprised me , Money has clearly been spent on the decor 
216026,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Breakfast was great but they ve run out of cooked breakfast juice and water and took a while before they stocked up again Perhaps because it was a Saturday morning and the restaurant was packed , Excellent hotel professional staff spacious rooms with big beds We had a lovely weekend 
216027,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, room was very warm even with air con at 16 o breakfast is slight chaos food was cold and ran out try some diff pots to serve food in as the ones u use get cold v quick lids are far to heavy if somebody dropped one it wont break either the floor or a foot just trying to help quality of BF is very very good food wise just needs to be hot and enough of it also ensure a Q ing system is introduced as it was a free for all, v comfy bed
216028,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The room cleaning was not done every day If you choose middle price room you will not have the view on the street just inside of the building , The bed was extra comfy really great 
216029,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Despite having a confirmed booking for a double room I was checked into a twin Then deposit had already been charged and It was early evening as I had indicated my arrival time so I wasn t a no show Yet when I went down to ask to change to the room type I had booked the front desk staff were reluctant to give it to me The sheepish response rather than an apology for a mistake suggested that this was deliberate strategy to re sell the double room Just because I booked at a discount through this website doesn t mean they can substitute an inferior room and not honour the advertised room and rate I did get the room type I wanted but beware if this happens to you and complain , Close and convenient to Westfield for restaurants and shops A fridge in the room and selection of glasses including wine glasses so also good for a quiet night relaxing 
216030,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Nothing, Amazing hotel super friendly staff quick and efficient check in lovely room with great shower and super comfy bed Great restaurant and bar This place has got it all and the price is spot on We ll definitely be back 
216031,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The room was plastic The fixtures and fittings gaudy and flimsy The lights didn t function correctly and the air conditioning wouldn t turn off No outside window , The location was perfect for my needs 
216032,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, It was a strange chemical cleanser s smell in our room And also it wasn t possible to open windows We also got a room for disabled people didn t expect it , Good lobby interior
216033,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Loud There is a jack of soundproofing The rooms are tiny The shower was clogged and I had to take the filters out and clean them to stop a flood Reception didn t even look us in the eye when we arrived or checked out , Position is good Near the tube 
216034,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, No dislikes at all but would love to have coffee bags and more peppermint tea in the room , Comfortable Hotel and friendly staff on reception and in the restaurant 
216035,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Rooms have no window to open so Be aware of the rooms which are facing to inside the building This might be depressive , Hotel was new and comfortable Location is very good and close to underground station and several pubs around the hotel Rooms are spacious which is unlike most of the hotels in London centre area 
216036,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Nothing , Very nice hotel Right next door to the o2 Shepherds Bush which was very handy for the concert we were attending Easy check in the bed was very comfortable and we liked the bar area too Large bathroom Very clean and tidy 
216037,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, No parking at the hotel Need to park in Westfield shopping centre It s about 10 mins walk back to the hotel but only 8 for 24 hrs paring so it s not bad , Central location easy access to public transport link Hotel is very clean and staff are friendly 
216038,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Cost was 50 cheaper on second night No water in mini bar Breakfast abandoned as it was too busy 50 security charge despite only usually required in hotels with minibars etc but this hotel charges it regardless , Rooms were spacious and comfortable
216039,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, Good breakfast comfortable room and location handy for public transport Shopping facilities very close by and a number of local pubs and restaurants too Bed very large and comfortable and adequate hot water in the shower 
216040,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Our room was too hot and the air conditioning noisy The duvet was too thick and the pillows were awful Other guests were inconsiderate allowing their doors to slam continuously as they came in late at night This seemed to reverberate along the corridor The bed side lamps are pretty but awkward But the biggest problem was the organised chaos of breakfast It was Sunday morning and the hotel seemed busy The staff in the restaurant did not seem to be able to cope with the demand for clearing tables serving tea and coffee or keeping the buffet food area well stocked There didn t appear to be anyone taking responsibility for a particular job in the restaurant It was a free for all staff wise and it showed , The hotel is very smart and oozes quality on first impressions The bed was sumptuous and the linen crisp and clean The reception and bar area are very attractive the staff on reception were reasonably courteous Complimentary coffee in the bar area was a nice touch surely a coffee dispenser in the restaurant would be better than every table having to ask for hot drinks at breakfast 
216041,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Really soft mattress so an uncomfortable nights sleep , Great location right next door to the Shepherds Bush Empire Very welcoming and friendly staff good food although limited room service options for a vegan after you come back from a gig 
216042,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The room was tiny with barely room to move around both sides of the double , Bed was very comfortable and the cocktails in the bar were excellent Room was clean and quiet despite being opposite the lift 
216043,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, The location is very good with easy connections to Gatwick Airport and the Central line and walking distance to the Westfield Shopping Centre The Doresett is modern and clean with very good Wifi The staff were very friendly A very good option for London
216044,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Breakfast wasn t the best my husband sent his sausages back twice and they were still cold No teaspoons on table had to ask and very slow service at breakfast, Location was good and hotel clean
216045,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The service at breakfast was poor we were escorted to our table seated and then left alone No one came to ask us whether we wanted tea or coffee how service worked disappointed , Bed was lovely and comfy receptionist made us feel really welcome I d jump at the chance to stay there again fantastic 
216046,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, The staff were very welcoming and the valet parking couldn t have been easier The rooms although small twin were spotless and beds comfortable Shower room furbished to a very high standard Within walking distance of various tube stations and 2 mins walk to Westfield 
216047,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Bar great cocktails and service but bar area has impersonal feel, Less than 5 minutes walk to shepherds bush tube overground rail stations and Westfiled shopping centre 
216048,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Room where TINY NO WATER in room Very very over priced Staff members where very very rude and one member didn t even know what BACON was so had to ask another staff member also didn t know where the toilets where We arrived at brekfast for there to be no bacon no cold meats and no juice we asked 3 times for a tea and still never received it staff where very rude and clueless and couldn t talk very good English I have never ever seen a room so tiny it was very claustaphobic not one window with natural light coming in just some weird sheet of plastic that over looked the bar No bath in room either All in all was a terrible experience and I would defo not recommend this to any 1 Should be a 1 star hotel for 20 quid a night and that s still at a push Just terrible I m so disappointed we wasted all that money Area very trampy the second we arrived where greeted by police and a drunk lady passed out outside our hotel and just police everywhere Awful stay ,No Positive
216049,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Nothing at all at this Price Very good hotel for London, Staff are very friendly and helpful the room was lovely and clean and the room was very quiet Considering it was on the main road location good sound proofing The room was a good size and well appointed Would recommend to stay here again 
216050,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Nothing, Excellent value good quality food 2 doors away from Shepherd s Bush empire O2 venue Easy walk across Shepherd s Bush green to the tube Will be returning before Christmas 
216051,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Housekeeping letting there self in to the rooms while we was there , The large double bed was so comfortable didn t want to get out in the mornings 
216052,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, had to wait 20 min to get a table for breakfast waiter messed up dinner two evenings in a row rooms with connecting doors are horrible as you can hear every single thing the neighbor is doing and I mean every single thing ,No Positive
216053,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, location is just outside the city center surrounding area is a little bit grim at night but it never felt uneasy, close connection with public transport clean rooms friendly staff
216054,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Pillows a bit too squidgy for me but my friend loved them Slept very well though, Lovely hotel all very clean staff very friendly Up to date facilities in the room Decorated beautifully
216055,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Basically nothing really , It was such an fabulous stay The rooms was super clean and comfy and the pillows are soft and the settings in the bedroom was nice and cozy and give you a warm feeling We have also used the facilities of the spa in the hotel it was nice but I would recommend to have your appointment in the afternoon as when you ve finished your session you could lay down and see over the view and relax whereas at night it was kind of dark out there nothing much The reception helped us a lot as we need to print out our flight schedules but the printer was not working properly at the business centre and therefore they are really kind to help us to print them out The lobby was nice with cozy chairs and it give you an artistic feeling The staff remembers who you are as we left some baggages and flew off to elsewhere for a short trip the staff are super nice 
216056,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We got to the hotel at around 6pm and the hotel front was not really align with the photo shown The hotel was near a neighbour which was right across the park but kind of not that glamorous at shown on photos , We have stayed in the hotel for 2 nights and was such amazing stay The location was near two of the tube station which was really convenient and the hotel room looks clean comfy and cozy with the lightings The staff at the travel arrangement section was friendly and help us a lot which the direction 
216057,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, See point b , Bed and pillows were very comfy decor was tasteful bathroom was a great if you like to see your partner in the shower through a frosted glass window from bedroom OR b not so great if you don t want your partner to see you in the shower or if you don t want to see him her Breakfast was very good buffet and hot food I had an omelette cooked to request by chef in restaurant Waitress was extremely attentive and went out of her way to be helpful Location was great for tube and Westfield Shopping Centre not to be confused with mini mall opposite Shepherds Bush Green Play park and Green out front of hotel so great for kids Staff were all very pleasant and I would definitely stay here again rather than in city centre 
216058,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, could smell their foodcourt in the bedroom i had when u staying there for more than 2 days they skip cleaning ur bedsheets NEVER been anywhere where they wouldn t maintain with the standard being offered , the bedroom gives a cozy feeling bc of their interior design made me think like its my own bed at home after few days from staying there 
216059,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Staff at check in here always seem less than friendly and not particularly keen on actually helping guests Sometimes borderline rude even , Good base if you need to be in West London or along the central line as long as you get a deal 
216060,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Restaurant seems to be a bit under sized for the hotel capacity so I had to wait in a queue to get seated Only very basic choice of cold meals choice of warm meals is sufficiently rich My room windows were oriented toward the seating area in the bar below so I had to keep the curtains closed at all times somehow claustrophobic , Very nice new hotel close to three tube stations The room was rather small but very clean and rather comfortable 
216061,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, They hold the amount of stay at checkin and if you pay with a different card at checkout you get the holded amount back really late This means as if I am charged for 2 times for now Still haven t got holded amount back and waiting , Nice and clean hotel very close to metro station They have a business centre you can use Breakfast is also good 
216062,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Lobby entrance a bit dated bathroom window provides no isolation as you can be seen showering through it in every detail not convenient if you dont want to be seen by your companion, Spacious room large bed very quiet very good soundproof
216063,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We were given room for persons with disability As a result bathroom was very uncomfortable no stand for toiletries shower was on the floor resulting in the bathroom flooding with water and very small low sink , Nice location near Westfield mall and polite staff
216064,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, noisy corridor 1 rude member of reception staff who did not apologise to me when my key card was not programmed correctly and I could not get into my room on my second nights stay , large open shower fabulous facilities 
216065,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, That I could hear conversations from the people next door and the fact they set an alarm on a Sunday morning and hit snooze 5 times , The location and the decor was beautiful
216066,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Spa was open only at times when you most probably are not in the hotel 10am 7pm and there was no area where you could rest afterwards only one small shower could not even sit down anywhere Room felt small air system was very loud even at lowest setting otherwise no air if you turn it off , Breakfast was good hotel was clean 
216067,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, No rooms in the room , The bed and the pillow were super comfortable The room was really nice The hotel is 2 min walking to the Westfield shopping center and 5 min to the tube station 
216068,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Strange food smell in the lobby maybe from the restaurant , Staff was incredible Location is perfect Room Size Availability of the housekeeping service
216069,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Breakfast was poor bad slow service n had to keep asking for everything No plates cutlery no bacon etc Also within an hour of leaving my bank informed me that not only had they taken the funds for the 2 night stay they had also taken an extra 202 00 as a pre authorisation Had to then contact the hotel who said it was their error n still waiting for money to be returned back into my account Furious hence would not stay in this hotel again , Great location to shopping centre
216070,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The breakfast was cold this time And no spa or pool , The decor of the hotel is lovely and staff very hellpful We have always enjoyed our stay here and we always rebook 
216071,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, The way the staff remember who you are and the excellent service in the restaurant from Alex he s a very well spoken courteous gentleman a true asset to the Dorsett 
216072,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We wish we could ve stayed here longer but unfortunately they ran out of rooms that were in our budget range and we had to move onto another accommodation , We absolutely loved staying at this place and actually cancelled another accommodation that we booked in London to come back to stay at Dorsett The beds are super comfortable the rooms are clean and nicely decorated the staff are professional and friendly and the TV has all the channels you need to stay entertained A giant shopping mall is literally around the corner from the hotel so it s heaven if you re into shopping I d highly x100 recommend this place and we wouldn t stay anywhere else next time we re in London 
216073,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The cleaners started to tidy rooms at the unholy hour of 6am which caused a lot of noise with the slamming of doors Would be nice if staff respected sleeping guests and didn t start working at least until 7am weekdays and 8am weekends , The bed was comfortable and the hotel was in very close proximity to Westfield Shopping Centre includes lots of restaurants and a cinema and several tube stations from which you could quickly get into central London Most restaurants in the area close at about 11pm but room service was very quick and great value for money 
216074,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I did not like how my dinner came up to me cold but aside from that nothing more to complain about , Room Great size and an enormous bathroom The television was well placed and my favourite part The blackout curtains Had I not set an alarm for check out I would have not woken up It was a lovely place to sleep Good Breakfast A variety of foods both hot and cold The continental breakfast looked nice I went for the English breakfast Good quality Other I ordered 3 meals for room service One in the afternoon and 2 late in the evening Whoever the chef was on Friday 21st between 4 7pm I LOVE YOU Seasoned fries amazing salmon sandwich Both times I ordered room service both meals came quickly although the last meal was kind of cold All in all you step into the hotel and you love it love it love it It s pretty clean and the staff are very professional and friendly Would most definitely recommend 
216075,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, For some reason we were given a disabled room the bed was of course slightly lower and there was no much room in the bathroom for our toiletries, It s really good value for money the photos do not make it justice The place is beautiful
216076,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Did not like the inside room with no view Room was very compact, The Staff was very friendly and accommodating Silvia and the guys at the concerige desk Great location to transportation shopping mall and resturants
216077,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Everything was great the coffee machine in our room didn t work but I wouldn t complain about that , When I booked I sent a msg to hotel saying we d be celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary When I checked in Sylvia said she had a lovely room for us We d been upgraded to a suite which was fabulous room service also brought us chocolate pistachio brownies courtesy of dorsett shepherds bush 
216078,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, When opening the curtains we were faced with a wall no windows no view Fortunately we only stayed for the night so it didn t affect us too much Otherwise it would have felt like a prison ,No Positive
216079,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Not all staff seem to want to be putting the customer first but management where interested about my stay, The location is brilliant for access to Westfield Shopping and a variety of Tube Stations 
216080,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We paid for an executive room and we found several issue with our room had to be moved when we returned from our evening out, The location to the concert we were attending
216081,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The reception staff at the desk were a bit cold and mixed up our booking from booking com When the booking didn t show up on the system the lady just looked at us and shrugged her shoulders , The manager was very good at addressing issues we had with our stay 
216082,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Breakfast limited in food selection location cramped and delays in seating Neighborhood unplesent particularly at night Booked executive room which was very small booking com quoted a 30 square meter room During arrival they forgot to mention that breakfast was included which was only discovered after my insistence Mediocre 3 star tourist hotel , Location near trains and busses 
216083,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, There was nothing to dislike about this hotel, We liked this hotel very much the staff were extremely helpful friendly and informative and the restaurant was excellent it was situated conveniently for the port for cruise ships and ferries and within walking distance to shops and other restaurants
216084,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, some of the staff seemed a little miserable and some of the service especially in the bar was extremely slow, The rooms are very clean and comfortable as is the dinning room It s a great location for shops and bars and is in easy access of the underground
216085,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, Booked a double room for 5 nights Asked for a twin room at check in and they obliged Yayy The location is near 2 different tube lines with many cafes restaurants and even grocery shops nearby The Westfield shopping mall will have everything that you would need The room is snug but large enough to lay out 2 suitcases Air conditioned kettle cups fridge hair dryer provided WiFi was good The bathroom was excellent One of my pet peeves are shower areas that do not contain water well with the floor ending up wet and slippery no matter how you contort in the shower The shower stall was well thought out and constructed and I absolutely loved not having the floor wet when my friend have used it The beds were ok but the pillows were a bit soft 
216086,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, the very tiny window in the room heater was weak spa was bad no relaxing room one sauna did nt work and the other sauna should be hot unfriendly staff , the room was quite clean after my complain they offered me a drink
216087,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, The breakfast had almost too many options You could easily eat so much that lunch was not a necessity Access from two tube stations are very close As well there are a multitude of dining the in house restaurant was pretty good although a bit fancy and shopping choices that you can choose from 
216088,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Would of preferred if it was a little cheaper but I would still try my best to stay here again Don t go out at night I left for a cigarette and decided to go to the casino across the road which is also a stone throw away and nearly got mugged by youngsters had to give them all my cigarettes as they were getting pretty rough and I wanted no trouble kind of shook me a little but nothing else other than that just be careful It s a beautiful place , Very good location a stone throw from Westfield Staff were very helpful and friendly 
216089,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Smelly shower don t know why poorly cleaned spa no window to open and dark room inner courtyard room very little storage space , Comfortable bed 24 h reception friendly and helpful staff nicely furnished professional facial and massage at the spa 
216090,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, the bathroom had nowhere to put our toiletries we had to leave them on the floor Sunday s pastries were certainly not from the same morning Room service did not get our orders right 3 times , very comfortable bed The suite 529 was large and elegantly decorated the manager Sunday s shift was particularly helpful 
216091,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Even though the room had all the needed facilities good cable TV wifi queen size bed the room was quite compact For example the desk chair had to be tucked into the desk in order to get past it and the bed No view to speak of , Perfect location close to central London Considering London is expensive anyway this hotel is very good value for money for something a bit more luxurious than average Good breakfast selection Very close to Westfield Mall 
216092,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Neighbouring rooms are separated by a thin door with an extremely bad soundproof You could hear almost every word of other people to say nothing of other noise if you are unlucky with neighboures Restaurant is not cosy You may need to stay in a queue waiting for a free table at breakfasts , Comfortable bad good wi fi near to a modern shopping mall 
216093,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The hotel has a contract with a single car service firm and staff are not allowed to make bookings with any of the several excellent minicab firms in the area There were few starchy foods available at breakfast and granola rather than muesli Not good for me as a diabetic The one time I ate in the restaurant in the evening service started good but there were often no visible staff as I ended my meal and I had to wait several minutes to get my bill , I was able to request a room with an accessible shower This was ideal for my specific needs with a firmly anchored seat that could be folded down when needed and did not get in the way when not The staff were always helpful when I had a problem or request I have had to make several stays in this area recently while my wife was in Hammersmith Hospital and this is the hotel I liked best among those I tried Pricier than some but I was able to get some good discounts by booking ahead 
216094,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Slightly small room not quite a problem with no view window doesn t open and looking at the inside of the hotel , Friendly staff cleanliness location and 12pm checkout
216095,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I had a superior double room and was surprised to be allocated one with no natural light and no easy sitting furniture there was one desk chair despite the room having acres of empty space BEWARE room allocation as it is the same price to have a room with outside light and sofa provided The bathroom was bizarre a huge shower wet room concept with a microscopic washbasin and really cheap poor tap and absolutely ZERO shelf space so nowhere to put your soap bar shampoo conditioner etc etc whilst in the shower other than on the floor There was so little no shelf space that even the flat space on the WC pan was used for the complementary toothbrush and toilet tissues So I ended up having to keep shaving kit and other stuff in the bedroom and sort of carry them in in stages when needed in the bathroom Its a shame because in many respects its a good quality room experience and very good value for money but it is POOR practice to show photos that bear no relation to the actual rooms Also if you have a mixture of rooms with external natural light and others opening only onto an artificially lit atrium then you should say so , The building conversion is good and the location on Shepherds Bush Green is good for central London albeit not the nicest area on London Very good value for money breakfast and staff were helpful Bed was comfortable 
216096,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I booked a car to the airport with the reception the night before travel but reception failed to confirm it and no car It was rectified by the morning reception staff but not the first time this has happened , I had a minor problem in my room and the staff and duty manager handled it in an elegant and discreet way immediately Very good service 
216097,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Although the room service was clean unfortunately some of our beuty products disappeared , We liked the atmosphere of the hotel in general In addition to its great location near westfield shopping center and the bus stop moreover its a few blocks away from the metro station 
216098,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Not very close from central London but underground station not very far Small bathroom, Nice design and clean hotel rooms Nice rooms good bed Good and variated breakfast Fast check in and out
216099,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Nothing , Am a regular Dorsett customer and repeat myself on its location and cleanliness For this one night stay I was given a suite which I found very very comfortable 
216100,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The parking was awkward as there was always a lorry parked by the parking bays, The room was spacious there are a range of places to eat and drink both within the hotel and outside Staff were friendly
216101,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Sharifa at front desk was rude, The hospitality was poor and staff at front desk were rude They checked us in an hour later Without any apology Hospitality ruined our stay at hotel Apart from tariq concierge who was fabulous
216102,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, the second room had a few challenges i could hear voices of hotel guest walking along the corridor breakfast should have a wider variety especially for guest who don t eat pork and pork products I ordered plates and cutlery Though i followed up three times and the staff on the phone promised to deliver to my room it never came That was very dishonest and poor customer service, the first room was clean spacious and comfortable
216103,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Breakfast was ok a good selection but didn t seem to be enough staff on to replenish empty trays bowls of food or to stick up on clean crockery when needed Had a drink in the bar one night and thought 18 for a gin and a brandy was extortionate and that was with the bank holiday 20 off , Location was good for where we wanted to be Close to tube station Decor in the hotel was different in a good way 
216104,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, There could have been some items stocked up in the minibar A part from that nothing , The bed the sports facilities the mini spa the room and most definitely the mattress 
216105,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Standard rooms face interior light well and windows don t open so a bit confining but not bad , Well run efficient clean comfortable Aircon hot water wifi etc all worked well Room OK size fine for one person Bus and tube stops fairly close Was only person in the restaurant but the salmon was excellent Asian restaurant more lively but pricey 
216106,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Just few minor negative points the pictures of the room and bathroom in website and booking com were misleading The actual Deluxe room size were smaller than it looks in web pictures The size of bathroom is very small and disappointing Disabled room is not very well designed for that purpose I wish they have harder bed mattress, Hotel Staff were all very friendly very helpful professional especially Breakfast staff who provide excellent service Excellent Location very close to Westfield Shopping centre and shepherds Bush local market Very good breakfast clean room Room price is a bit high but worthy I will definitely come back to this super nice hotel 
216107,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Only stayed one night so there wasn t anything negative we could pick out , The most comfy bed I ve had in a hotel Everything was spotless and the attention to detail was very good Just wish we were staying longer than one night

216161,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Our room wasn t ready when we arrived so we were given an alternative which had disabled facilities As a result the bathroom was poor a tiny sink low shower with poor pressure and it smelled damp The breakfast was chaotic nothing was available except in dribs and drabs so we ended up waiting for ages The staff were completely overwhelmed and the restaurant was a mess Very disappointing for such an elevated price , The bed was comfy and the room was nice and quiet

216203,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The staff was unhelpful and careless We arrived at the hotel just before midnight We booked the hotel because we went to a concert nearby and thought that it would be easier to stay close to work than drive back home We arrived hungry wet it was raining a lot and tired While my partner went to look for a car parking as the hotel didn t have any car parking space left I checked in and went to the room I arrived at the bedroom and realised that they gave us a disable room which wasn t so bad but not attractive Before I heading to a shower I ordered some food pizza and a salad which was around 12 05am and the person who took our order mentioned that the food would be with us in 25 35 minutes After ordering the dinner I went to have a shower and for my disappointment and frustration the water wasn t warm enough and the shower was weak and the thermostat was broken I finish my shower and was still feeling cold and annoyed as I expected to have a warm and relaxing shower before go to bed So I asked the reception if they could move us to another room where the shower worked so at least my partner could have a warm shower So after 5 8 minutes the manager arrived in the room to check if he could fix the shower as they didn t want to give us another room After 25min or so waiting they decided to move us as they couldn t fix the shower When we were moving to the new room we asked the manager if the kitchen was aware of the change of rooms and his answers was yes We waited and waited for the food and nothing I called the reception to complain and check where the food was a few times the food arrived 1 15am and cold By that time we received the food we were annoyed and tired so we called reception again and told them that the food was cold nothing was done by the hotel manager so we ended up not eating the cold pizza and the salad never arrived they said they didn t have any salad left , The hotel has a lot of potential but they need to train their people The location is great but bad very bad customer service 
216204,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Most rooms have a very small window with no view , Great location walking distance from Westfields Shopping centre and tube station a bus stop bang outside hotel door Great rooms very spacious and clean 
216205,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The Chinese restaurant is very expensive but the food served is below my expectation in relation to freshness and cooking expertise , Room comfortable staff friendly though a bit confused as to the use of the open space next to the restaurant could be used for drinks 
216206,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We could not open a window in our room and the glass was frosted up to a height of 7 feet Furthermore we were charged a 10 waiters fee for dinner which we were not notified about , The staff were friendly and accommodating The breakfast was delicious Our room felt homely the rain shower was refreshing and the bed was very comfortable The hotel was located just a few minutes from West field shopping centre and there were some lovely bars just around the corner 
216207,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Everything was fine , The reception staff were extremely helpful and well trained In particular Alina efficiently politely and quietly dealt with issues that arose during my stay She is a credit to the Dorsett 
216208,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Our only moan was the shower controls They are not marked for hot cold or direction, Every staff member had a smile and were very friendly and approachable Our room appeared a little small as we were on the 7th floor overlooking the green great view But this was due to the curved windows of the front which reduces head height In our opinion it improved an otherwise standard square box room and would request it again The breakfast was amazing as was the fast wifi and sky tv too 
216209,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Room rather smaller than I expected Breakfast was ok but not enough staff on duty they forgot to ask us if we wanted a hot drink and then when we asked it took ages to come , Location was good for our plans to explore Holland Park Reception area very smart and concierge very helpful with local information
216210,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Breakfast is nice but can get a bit repetitive after a few days , Excellent location and facilities Great for leisure and business travellers Walking distance to buses tube and plenty of uber drivers around Close to Westfield mall 
216211,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I wouldn t change anything , A lovely room with nice decor A good choice at breakfast Liked the freedom of accessibility with the room and the key card for lift access A great location for what I needed Very happy with the booking 
216212,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The main entrance is located immediately behind a bus stop so guests should be told in advance to drive past the main entrance and into the valet location to unload their bags or risk a hefty fine for being in an active bus lane , The bed is very comfy and the staff is super friendly 
216213,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Location in relative poor area but it s next to westfield which is ok, Clean stuff amazing size of the room was good and fear next to two stations and in front of bus stop

216216,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We booked two rooms but the receptionist couldn t find our booking which caused a bit of stress checking in She could have been more personable too as she came across a little abrupt clueless Windows wouldn t open when it was extremely hot room smelt of food when we arrived Also had to get the maintenance man out after having a shower as the drain was blocked flooded the bathroom floor To be fair though he arrived quickly and sorted it out Also would have liked to have seen the hotel bar open later , Valet parking location price
216217,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I was overall very happy with my stay Nothing negative although I could hear loud music around 11pm from my room Perhaps they could soundproof rooms that face onto the hotel lobby reception , Really friendly staff used the spa and it was excellent Rooms are stylish and very comfortable Great location for Westfield and the tube which is a short walk away 
216218,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Whilst super close to westfield the hotel was quite far from the tube station and whilst still in zone one it is not that central Although I understand that upon my arrival it was rainy season the windows in my room were very dirty and were overlooking the hotel itself which gave the room quite a gloomy lighting and one may find this bothersome otherwise the room itself was very clean , The staff were really nice the room was very comfortable clean and the facilities were good Plus the hotel is extremely close to westfields 
216219,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, concierge service very week It took them about 15 minutes till they took 2 small pieces from me as I wanted to keep in the hotel for few hours But mostly I was upset because they kept us in a back room for the breakfast with no body serving us at all even that they were not busy nor the front hall was busy but since we were 5 they did not want to join a table for us Also replacing empty dishes with new dishes is slow you have to wait till you ask and they go and fill back , RECEPTION WISE WERE WELCOMING

216225,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, No windows to the outside world The hotel room windows look out into an Atrium with only a view into the atrium This makes for a rather claustrophobic visit especially with the compact rooms Not fun , Great location right on Shepherds Bush Green small but comfortable rooms

216233,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The neighborhood used to have a bad reputation and it s been gentrified slowly but surely It s safe even late but be warned finding a place to eat after 10pm is not easy so eat before you go back to the hotel , The hotel is gorgeous and very quiet while in the heart of the city The room was comfortable and the bed was honestly the best bed in which I ve ever slept in a hotel The hotel restaurant is also well worth the visit Chinese gastronomy is rare in the city The hotel staff was very helpful and welcoming I would go again 
216234,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, When we arrived we were asked to pay up front but the price online had changed and I was asked to pay 331 Instead of 171 until I demanded to see the manager and all was sorted Disappointing start to a pleasant stay The location is great for Westfield not so for tourist sites 
216235,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Breakfast But it was mostly full and you had to wait until a table was empty Also I was booked into a Double Room Deluxe Double Room It would have been very uncomfortable for 2 Persons to share especially the bathroom toilet Not enough space to swing a cat Car parking It s impossible to Park your Car in this area So you are Forced to use the Hotels Parking Service which at 24 GBP per day I found very expensive Coming back to my Deluxe Room A room with a view If you like that looking out off your rooms window into someone s backyard and seeing them hanging out the washing Not Impressed , Breakfast But it was mostly full and you must wait for a empty table 
216236,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, A combination of poor service in more than one area made this a disappointing trip for us We are a busy working couple and had to leave the bar area without the cocktails we had ordered 20 minutes earlier to meet a dinner appointment When we arrived back at bedtime we were astonished to find we had been given a room fitted out with a disabled bathroom and even more astonished when the reception clerk tried to talk us out of a move because we had been given extra facilities Breakfast was overrun and no one seemed able to provide tea or coffee for anyone in our area of the dining room We had finished eating by the time it arrived , It is a very attractive hotel internally and in a good location 
216237,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Needs a business center that has computers with Microsoft Office I left my laptop behind and needed to do something urgently one evening The small business centre is adequate with new computers and a good printer but they don t have any office software only for surfing the internet The hotel is geared to tourists and groups not business guests this could so easily be rectified , Extremely clean and comfortable Rooms are lovely Staff are 5 stars excellent totally service orientated attentive friendly and helpful even with grumpy guests

216303,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Terrible reception staff who really do not seem to like reservations made through booking com presumably because of discount against their rack rate Unique experience of being moved out of adequate but not exceptional standard double room overlooking Shepherds Bush Green and circus to smaller but still apparently standard twin room at rear while out for the day Returned to find keycard blocked reception desk clueless reception manageress then had the gall to tell me that I had cancelled reservation by telephone why then did I leave all my stuff in my room and why am I still here now expecting to stay for two more nights Nonsense Not at all apologetic or helpful Still haven t found my bag No sign of anyone trying to either , Good for Westfield Shepherds Bush and West London
216304,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The reception staff could have been a little more welcoming they lacked the smile Our shower was clogged and it took the water 1 minute to overflow the showerspace and then it was all over the place which ment that it took a long time for 2 people to shower The towels looked like they were dirty grey ish in color and did not give you the feeling of being clean , The bed was comfortable surroundings in bedroom were very good and we were lucky in being on the 6th floor with a view over the park I liked very much how little we could hear of sounds from the road below 
216305,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Appalling soulless common parts show absolute lack of design or purposeful use Sadly even at managerial level staff simply useless computer says no absurdities, If you want West London and are happy with Shepherds Bush this is a reasonable location price trade off
216306,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The lady who checked us in was very unhelpful She did not tell us how to get to the lifts or that you needed a card to operate it She just moaned about people checking in from booking com During our stay the fire alarm went off and it was pure confusion The fire exit was blocked with a barrier and builders material Some men had to move it The staff were unhelpful They did not even know where the stairs were The only time they gave us any attention is when I started to film the incident Unfortunately this upset them causing one member to swear at me The positive was that it was a false alarm and no one was hurt We also ordered room service but only half the meal came The lady who took the order said she forgot I was not cross as this can happen We were only charged for what we had , The hotel is clean and in an excellent location for both London and Westfield shopping centre The rooms are nice The food was lovely I had some problems but would definitely stay here again Yes I recommend this hotel On arrival at the hotel a black gentleman came over and greeted us warmly I am so sorry I did not get his name He was lovely and directed us to the check in On leaving a man called Adam checked us out again he was warm and friendly Thank you to both these gentlemen They are a credit to the Hotel 
216307,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, Great location very close to Westfield shopping centre and the tube station Room was very clean and the bed was really comfortable Amenities in the room were good 
216308,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Area around hotel is not particularly appealing but we were very pleased once inside the hotel as that is very luxuriously fitted out, very good location for transport with car parking looks as though has been completely refurbished and rooms and main areas very bright and clean with good shower and toiletries Has on site bar and restaurant plus a corridor to an attached Chinese Has some rooms that face internally into a floor to ceiling atrium which means that no road noise at night Very good value overall and would definitely recommend 
216309,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, This hotel was so beautifully decorated The stylish yet minimal decor gave a clean and hygienic feel Rooms were brilliant A wonderful find I will definitely be returning 
216310,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Bigger room maybe, Rooms abit small but shower was awesome huge rainfall type one bed really comfortable and staff couldn t do more for me after I had some personal issues 
216311,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The corridors were a little dark but that s minor , The bed was fantastic I had the best sleep in weeks The staff were extremely helpful I d turned up and there has been a problem with my online booking my fault the member of staff on reception couldn t have been more helpful or smiley Very welcoming 
216312,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Could not fault a thing about this hotel, The location of this hotel is fantastic It is easily accessible for Central London The beds are extremely comfortable Would definitely stay at this hotel again Highly recommended 
216313,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Daily breakfast not much choices and over 4 nights stay with my family here having the same thing , Location is good convenient to commute via bus Tube Overall room cleanliness is satisfactory and comfortable 
216314,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, if I really want to be picky corridors are too dark, very clean near subway station many restaurants and supermarkets nearby one of the best hotels in London
216315,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Bed too soft breakfast could be cheaper, Free use of the sauna 2 for 1 on cocktails in the bar between 6 and 8pm every day if you ask Luis to make you a surprise cocktail he will do it close to Westfield Shopping Centre
216316,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, breakfast meat very dry not much help from restaurant manger on the choice of food felt abit neglected for 33 75 for 2 breakfasts not great value, friendly clean lovely hotel front of house set too far back not very welcoming
216317,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Exec room had adjoining door which meant we could hear the constant chatter from our neighbours , Fantastic and courteous staff Really lovely hotel and decor Breakfast was fantastic 
216318,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Coffee was spilt on our bag in the luggage room , It was my daughter s birthday and the staff arranged for a happy birthday treat and card to be in our room when we came back 
216319,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We had a little issue with the shower someone put the rubber stripping on the door the wrong way making it difficult to get into the shower until my husband figured the problem Otherwise a wonderful shower with choice of rain shower or regular shower , This was our 2nd or 3rd time staying here Great value for money We were exhausted after a long day evening taking in a show the bed was so comfortable All linens great quality Convenient location on bus routes which stop outside the hotel Great little cafe across the street for breakfast 
216320,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Checking in at 12 pm and being told no double rooms ready however a deluxe double was ready and did I want to pay 25 extra for this room I refused this offer and after a few moments a double room became available so we were able to drop our bags into our room before heading out This offer of an upgrade felt contrived and I was left feeling a little angry , Location and helpful staff
216321,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, When we arrived we were asked if we would like to upgrade our room to a larger room at a charge and we agreed However the room was small and freezing we complained numerous times and each time an engineer came to look but it was a waste of time in ten end they brought us a little oil heater that had the room too hot then when it was off it was too cold this not getting a good nights sleep The breakfast the next morning also was a let down the food was cold it s buffet style but there doesn t seem to be any way they keep the food hot , Location was good to tube stations and Westfield shopping centre
216322,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Ask for a room that does not look out on the lounge area of the hotel if you want to be able to separate noon from midnight, Comfortable and clean bedroom with good on site facilities in a covenient location very close to central London
216323,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Being put into a disabled access room Had booked a standard double but was informed they only had a disabled access room left at check in The bathroom was the main issue as it was set up specifically for disabled access and as such not practical for an able bodied person The TV reception was atrocious on SkySports also , Location is very convenient and pretty easy to get to Has the makings of a classy hotel just not quite there yet 
216324,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I have no adverse comments , lovely hotel in a great position Our room was excellant well appointed very clean and top quality The cocktails were good to 
216325,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, Excellent value for money Close to Tube and other local amenities Only downside was no actual daylight into the room although this is a minor problem Oh and super fast efficient lifts makes a nice change 
216326,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Constant hum from air conditioning all night maybe due to being on top floor of hotel and air con equipment on roof Maybe ask for room lower down in building Also extra loud fan in room bathroom but this can be turned off by pressing button on digital screen near front door Keep pressing button on left side until it says fan off a simple instruction on wall beside control would be helpful for non technically minded guests Cannot open windows air con is on all the time advice to everybody bring a few bottles of water from local shops to drink throughout your time in room as air con will dry out your mouth throat especially at night I noticed other guests with water bottles coming up in lift they realised same problem Bad smell from shower waste when first entering room but it goes away after using shower maybe run shower for few minutes and pour some shampoo in shower to cancel the smell Probably due to shower not been used for few days before I went into room Light under door from corridor at night but same in lots of hotels just put a towel on floor in front of door to block out light , Hotel seemed brand new one staff member told me hotel is 2 years old but it seemed like it was opened only yesterday Every part of hotel is classy very spacious in lobby with several armchairs scattered mostly at sides You can sit here and yet be in privacy due to such large lobby when everybody walks past they are far from you that you still have privacy Separate bar area and plush comfortable armchairs here which is in central atrium that opens up through central core of building Some room windows look directly out into this atrium Note when you get to your room look out window and see if you can see glass roof at top of building then you ll know where your room is and not looking out onto street The peoples voices murmer you hear at night is this bar area below and not street But Bar closes around midnight so this area is quiet during the night When your room heavy curtains are open you must realise that the others rooms opposite are looking directly at you too There are net curtains on window so you re not completely exposed 3 Very fast lifts take about 10 seconds to go from ground floor to 7th floor You hold room plastic key in front of sensor of lift controls and then press lift floor button to get lift moving instruction on stand in several languages outside lift doors on ground floor I have to mention that all the staff I met throughout hotel are very pleasant polite helpful and efficient Its does make the stay more comfortable Great selection of food at breakfast which was buffet When breakfast time was over waiting staff came around and suggested we take extra food as they were clearing away Dinner was presented as any 5 star restaurant Bed was very comfortable and very soft pillows too Radio with Ipod dock on bedside table Spotless and new bathroom 4 small bottle of toiletries shampoo etc 
216327,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The walk to Bush Hall was a bit dodgy no warning that the area behind the hotel was a bit rough , Lovely comfortable bed loved the shower very clean Room service was quick and super scrummy 
216328,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The room was tiny Room for one case but nowhere to put the other that it wasn t a trip hazard Disappointing based on the price we paid with breakfast not even included, Hotel itself is lovely with a luxury feel from the moment you step in the door
216329,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Automaton staff Billed me twice insisting one charge was only a pre authorisation it wasn t Housekeeping wandering down corridors at 9am knocking on all doors to make sure everyone s awake whether dnd or not Very annoying red bird motif on empty picture frames , Well refurbished building good rooms in reasonable location if you want West London or to visit Westfield in particular 
216330,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, View nothing to write home about but not high on my list of wants for a hotel , Very clean tidy modern with nice little extras in the room and free unlimited wifi essential when travelling with teenagers Good location for shopping Plenty of choice if you want to eat out locally Would definitely stay there again on my next visit to London 
216331,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Nothing of note I didn t really try the breakfast or order anything from room service so I can t comment Gym was not bad Good enough to maintain some cardio on vacation , Location is phenomenal 2 minute walk to the Hammersmith line and 5 minute walk to the Central line It is very easy to access the entire city There s also a small Sinasbury s nearby which is perfect to stock up the room Staff were very nice and courteous They helped me easily receive a package I ordered online to the hotel I also loved the bed Very very comfortable and the WiFi was super fast 
216332,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The Spa steam room was not working The lady in the spa reception showed me where to change and where the steam room was but didn t tell me it wasn t working When i mentioned it afterwards the sauna was working she said she knew , Comfortable rooms and excellent beds 
216333,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Air con could have been cooler Also windows look out onto the interior of the hotel not a problem for a few days break but it s nice to have a window looking out to the outside Not sure if the hotel has any could be the design , The rooms had a touch of luxury bed queen sized and rooms equipped with everything one needed for a relaxed break Also the rooms were very insulated and therefore totally quiet Westfield shopping and restaurants just up the road 
216334,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Horrible smell in all rooms we asked to change rooms but the smell remained the same No possibility to open the windows The rooms are tiny and the furnitures outdated , The bed and the tea
216335,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Service was incredibly slow On the first night we ate in the restaurant with family and the waiting staff contradicted each other with menu options To have a 12 5 service charge added to the bill seemed very steep but it is my own fault that I did not query this The second day we went to order cocktails at the bar and were told the waiter would come to us There was no one else waiting to be served but the waiter had not made it to us after 15 minutes so we left The heating system in the room rattled so loudly it had to be turned off at night , Super comfy bed good food in the restaurant Beautiful decor in the rooms 
216336,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The balance charged is mistaken No confirmation paid in full for 2 rooms US dollars and current exchange rate Out of respect to booking com awaiting with a despute Vs Credit card AA MC , The welcome at the front desk
216337,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, One or two guys at the breakfast were still quite new to the show I guess but they were friendly so not a really big negative , VERY clean rare in London I loved the are around the hotel BREWdog Everyone friendly Overall nice design 
216338,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, Perfect Location close to Central Line Underground station lots of small restaurants bars less than 5 minutes walk away Spotlessly clean Nice bar area within the hotel 
216339,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, You couldn t see outside on the window the view in inside the building so to say but it wasn t disturbing , Breakfast was great room was great Hotel is close to the subway station 
216340,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We had dinner in the hotel restaurant one evening and it was very average food small portions and over priced Wouldn t eat in there if we stayed with them again, Beautiful big room though we did pay extra for an upgrade Spotlessly clean 
216341,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Nothing bad I just wish that my allowed expense limit took in the breakfast which it doesn t , I really like the Dorsett and plan to stay there for all my regular trips to London especially as the office I attend is on the 94 bus route and the bus stops outside the door It is well designed comfortable clean and very pleasant 
216342,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, The location was extremely convenient The hotel and all its facilities were very clean and the staff were extremely polite and helpful It was a pleasant change to the big international chains 
216343,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, This was a great hotel and very reasonably priced rooms were great the building was great as well everything about the hotel was great my second stay there
216344,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, N A, My second stay here and always a pleasure here always I couldn t complain about any service but cheaper prices and value for money also key 
216345,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, window opaque could not see out No bath tub only a shower even though rooms were advertised as shower or bath we were advised we would have to upgrade to avail of a bath tub at the additional cost of 40 per night very limited storage facilities in room, Very good Wi Fi Nice toiletries provided
216346,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The hotel tried to add service charge of 12 5 to the breakfast despite the fact it was a buffet When pointed out that the service charge is voluntary it never showed up on the final bill Never even heard of a hotel adding service charge to cost of breakfast before , Great breakfast Chef was cocking eggs to your personal preferences Cost of breakfast was reasonable 7 50 pp as we upgraded to the deluxe room Room very spacious for a London hotel at this price level Bus stop 5m from hotel entrance 
216347,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The bar snacks were the only low point and probably not freshly prepared in the restaurant , The rooms were very clean and comfortable The entire hotel was clean and the staff were very helpful It was also perfect location and close to the Westfield shopping centre and underground station
216348,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Slippers in all rooms as whiritten in room facilities and there weren t Every day cleaning is not obligate you have to ask, A very comfortable stay a warm room a good lighting a good shower and bath facilities very comfortable bed and pillows Clean 
216349,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The Chinese restaurant next door Awful food , Excellent location Easy access to tubes and shops We ve stayed here several times Never fails to impress But don t use the Chinese next door a bit weird 
216350,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I didn t like how the duty manager lied to me and told me he d tried to call me previously regarding a mix up with my booking , Modern fancy lobby area and polite staff on the bar and restaurant
216351,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, No drinking water in the room or soap to wash hands Room is quite small Staff were very rude and unwelcoming There was no one to help me with my bags and I was rudely told to take them myself The window view is to the inside of the hotel so depressing as no sunlight gets in the room I certainly believe that 4 stars is a huge over rating for this hotel , Location
216352,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Would ve been nice to have a bath robe Alcohol was expensive, Everything The room with a good range of tv channels bed was amazingly comfortable use of a fridge and a safe included in the price large amount of complimentary bath items Design of the room was amazing including the low level light in the bathroom
216353,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I would have liked to have breakfast included, The fact that the central bus 94 was exactly infront of the hotel is perfect It also takes you to the underground station if you re not in the mood to walk Which is also close About 10 mins walk The smell of the hotel is just great Everyone who went there understands what i mean When you walk in you are amazed by the smell The staff where great even help you travel to you destination Just ask and they give you a printed paper with what buses you should use or trains The rooms were amazing as well Simply the best
216354,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Nothing realy, Nothing too much trouble for the staff Stayed here 4times over the Xmas new year period Reasonable price for London Even upgraded us on the last visit Close to transport and Westfield Shepherd s Bush Would stay again and have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone
216355,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Breakfast very expensive and not great Rooms quite small and no air hotel at around 30 40 minutes by bus from central London, Very Clean hotel Next to Bus and Metro Station
216356,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Disappointed that the brownies and birthday card promised for my son s room didn t materialise but did not spoil our stay , The staff were very pleasant and helpful We overslept after late return from NYE birthday party at Bush Hall They kept breakfast running for an extra hour until we had all eaten Also happily extended our checkout for an hour 
216357,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I have attached images and of room 667 which myself and my girlfriend stayed within on New Year s Eve I m not normally one to complain however I feel that this is not acceptable as a guess staying on a landmark occasion in a hotel for the first time What I found after waking up New Year s Day after my dinner reservations on New Year s Eve is the room had a consistent drip of water coming in from the ceiling which left the floor damp and also made the room smell This is no way acceptable considering the circumstances of the occasion was booked for , The overall hotel was good location etc
216358,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Nothing, Staff very helpful and accommodating Also changed my date after cancellation date which was appreciated by me and my wife Reasonably priced for the situation Close to Westfield Shepherd s Bush and Underground and Buses

216360,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, We arrived on Christmas Day for lunch and overnight stay The hotel was beautiful and the furnishings were stunning Staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming 
216361,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The Price was 40 sterling dearer for similiar room from last year Appreciate seasonal price change Location wrt London is good but having no dedicated parking is a major negative and with major work being carried out on the Westfield Shopping centre nearest overnight parking the traffic is a nightmare , 2nd stay at this hotel Lovely hotel and very comfortable and beautifully designed rooms Service is excellent with fast check in and check out 
216362,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Top floor room suffered from noise from air conditioning units Several niggles around service eg room service orders were incorrect, Location was good for our purpose and the staff were generally helpful although there were also some communication issues

216366,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Breakfast was a bit lack lustre The hot food was lukewarm and there was a 12 5 service charge it was a self service buffet , Friendly staff decent sized room and comfy bed The staff changed our room when the one originally allocated had no mobile phone reception We ended up with a larger room with a view so we were happy 
216367,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, When checking in the women was rude and disrespectful A smile wouldn t go far if I m honest She couldn t of made it more clear that she could not be bothered to deal with our request When we had booked we asked for rooms near each other When we noticed we weren t near each other we went back and asked for rooms near each other she then decided it was necessary to call us liars and to say there was nothing until check in which was at 2 we had checked in at 1pm Luckily enough her colleague beside her was more than helpful and asked if we wouldn t mind waiting until 1 30 which we were okay with because we both work in hospitality and understand how everything works , The hotel was clean and in an excellent location 
216368,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Room design was terrible Bathroom design was terrible Small wardrobe fridge and coffee in front of tv and small desk all cramped in one corner of the room even though there was a lot of space in the room Large bathroom with small sink No space to put things around the sink No toilet seat cover because there is a backrest in the way Very poor design , Location
216369,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, It is a little expensive but that reflects London Hotels There is effectively no limited parking at least not at sensible prices Shopping car park nearby can be used , Very close to Westfield at Shepherds Bush easy to find easy to use
216370,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Facility Sauna if was open after 2000 was much better temperature could be higher missing sand clock and thermometer , Staff Excellent helpful and Kind Room Very Clean quiet cozy Bed Very Comfortable Location Near by tube station restaurants coffee shops supermarket market and huge shopping mall tv Cable with movies Bathroom Clean Comfortable Facility Good Sauna Air Conditioning Quiet and pleasant Staff Perfect Need to emphasize a remarkable staff behavior Due to inaccurate information from help desk we had a transport situation When addressing that to the help desk they quickly took responsibility and solved the problem fast on hotel expense This is a hotel that value its reputation more than a few pounds It felt that guests satisfaction is an asset Wonderful HOTEL experience Wonderful Staff worth every penny 
216371,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Toilet in lobby not up to standard Fitness area could have been better equiped, Brand new hotel in a good location for an ok price given you are in central London

216375,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, some information about what was available in the hotel this was limited even in the room , Glamourous environment calm escape form bustle of London The most comfortable bed ever
216376,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Prices were extremely high for drinks and breakfast There is plenty of choice outside the hotel so wouldn t advise to eat or drink there but go out , The room was modern and a good size Lift access to the rooms was good and you don t have to wait long which is just as well as we couldn t find any stairs The location is fab the huge Westfield shopping centre is just round the corner with lots of places to eat and drink on the doorsetp It is also very close to the train station and the buses stop outside the front door of the hotel I would stay here again 
216377,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Initial room allocated was not what was requested only one chair in a room for two people sharing some staff not helpful Others were lovely , Location clean facilities good standard of fittings and a comfortable bed 
216378,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, Beautiful hotel in a great location 5 minute walk from Westfield Shopping and Shepherds Bush tube bus station You can easily get the tube into central London Oxford Circus etc in 20 minutes on 1 line and the bus around 30 minutes on 1 bus number 94 The bed was really comfy and lots of room The was shower powerful and the whole room really clean The decor in the room and the hotel is beautiful and elegant Overall had a lovely stay Thank you Dorsett hotel 
216379,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Staff were very pleasant but often inaccurate with requests Small things but there were many and distracted from the stay , Comfort cleanliness and quiet of hotel for such a central location Having a spa and gym was excellent 
216380,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, My room had two mattresses on the bed frame which meant there was an uncomfortable groove in the middle of the bed also it did have a window but a window that looked out onto the foyer of the hotel so there was no natural light at all in the room , The hotel is lovely and the room was very well decorated The staff were friendly and the lobby was lovely 
216381,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, Cleanliness of room and bathroom Also very close to tube 5 minute walk and bus 94 to central London right outside front door of hotel Westfield shopping centre only 5 minute walk and plenty of cafes and shops nearby 
216382,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, evetything was excellent if I was to be a bit picky the room was too warm at night but we found the fan and put that on which helped There was also a slight humming noise in the room but didn t know where it was coming from , The staff were very friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble The room was lovely and clean nicely decorated We used the soa facility which was excellent We would definitely return 
216383,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I had a dressing gown that was dirty Around the neck and also when arriving we had to pay for our stay as we thought it was already paid for This was poor And the girl dealing with it didn t understand and was very unfriendly and unhelpful ,No Positive
216384,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Allocated a disabled adapted room on check in without explanation Noisy at night as popular with youngsters celebrating in West London Fairly average breakfast , Great location for Westfield shopping and fairly convenient for the West End via the tube network Comfortable beds and some staff were excellent 
216385,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, the room is a little bit small no windows in the room it takes about 30 min to reach the center, new clean close to two tube stations close to very big shopping center westfield
216386,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, First they allocated us to a twin room When we asked for the double we had booked they said they could zip the beds together We didn t want this so the only actual double mattress they had was in an accessible room which was OK but the shower and toilet weren t ideal as a result As I was leaving in the morning my way out was blocked because they had rented out the lobby to film an advert They showed me an alternative way out but I was in a hurry and the delay was annoying , Design is great rooms are nice Not a lot of extra facilities as far as I could tell but we didn t need much 
216387,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, nothing whatsoever , Everything really Although a swimming pool would have made the hotel perfect but didn t miss it In addition the staff were excellent and looked after my kids when I had a little emergency with my infant not related to the stay and had to pop into the nearby hospital A E for a quick checkup for a about 2hrs 
216388,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Management at this hotel is arrogant There are lot of complaints but no action As the majority of guests are non British hotel turns deaf ear to complaints Hotel has a policy of not allowing children in standard rooms with parents so that they can force you to upgrade to higher priced executive rooms Breakfast is poor Room facing the main road are noisy , Close to Westfield and A40
216389,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Swimming apart from just a spa just for the kids maybe , Stayed overnight Place was an excellent area accessible to the shopping mall and just a few walks from the train station Receptionist was friendly and welcoming 
216390,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, For 136 I thought the room was a little small And the hotel has no parking so had to park in Westfield Shopping Centre which was a nightmare getting a space but only 9 50 for 24 hours , Lovely hotel and the staff were really helpful and polite 
216391,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, I didn t like my room not having an external window The breakfast was awful we queued for a long time the service was poor there was a lack of food and what was out was cold The 40 minutes we were in the restuarant there was no ham cheese fruit juice Orange juice filled once which went immediately Watched people queue for ages no tables were cleared no one to ask for more tea The list goes on , We loved the style of the hotel the rooms were decorated in a plush gold and despite the first impression of thinking it was small the room and bathroom felt luxurious and perfect 
216392,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, Loved the decor and the cleanliness of the hotel The hotel staff were very understanding especially as I checked out a bit later than 12 No extra charges 
216393,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Pictures restaurant needs some thought It s a little clinical and uninviting and seems to be under utilized as a result Shame because food and service are both good , All the staff we encountered were professional friendly and seemed eager to help The bar is a comfortable place to relax and or arrange to meet someone The hotel is well placed for connections to central London Heathrow airport and rail links to the north and south of the city The beds are seriously comfortable I love the frosted glass window between shower and bedroom perhaps not for the ultra prudish though 
216394,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The original room was designed to be handicapped accessible which we found awkward We were relocated to a new smaller room that had no natural light , Exploring the ethnic neighborhood a new part of London for me 
216395,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We were placed in a disabled persons room without any prior advice or explanation from the staff when we booked in When i complained the front desk staff simply said it was common to put people in disabled rooms if the hotel was full I am 6 4 and using the basin was amost impossible,No Positive
216396,Dorsett Shepherds Bush,No Negative, Our room was very comfortable and tastefully decorated with soft colours The bed was really good and enough large for two persons Dorsett hotel is situated at a large park and on the other side around a few corners there is a very interesting long Shepherd s Bush Market with lots of choice ordinary London souvenirs at cheaper price clothes fabrics household wares food Anything If you have 2 hours time go through it before other shopping Rest of shopping nearby at westfield luxury shopping centres 
216397,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The room service food was very poor although when we complained it wasn t charged to our bill, We got a free upgrade to an executive suite which was amazing The feel of the hotel is great and the staff were helpful
216398,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Haven t got a bad word to say against this hotel we thoroughly enjoyed our stay , I decided to stay at the Dorsett due to attending a concert in the O2 Shepherd s Bush and was absolutely amazed and so impressed at the hotel It is basically the building right next to the O2 Academy which was extremely handy for after the show when we were all tired and just wanted to relax took no longer than a minute to walk back Room service was amazing the quality of the food is spot on and the service staff are exceptional Beds were extremely comfy not a single complaint and will 100 be coming back Would definitely recommend staying here if visiting London especially attending a concert at the O2 Shepherd s Bush 
216399,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, We didn t have a window to open our room was looking into the bar So felt we had to close our curtains as we felt people were looking up wen the light was on definitely would of loved a room with a view and window for some fresh air , Hotel was lovely Although we just had booked room only which was very small

216402,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Might not be the safest location at night since it s right next to Shepherds Bush Greens , I chose the Dorsett because of its proximity to O2 Shepherds Bush Empire and was as such very happy with the location it didn t even take a minute to reach the venue very convenient for when the concert had ended The staff was very professional and welcoming although there was some confusion about the screening of my card at check in Facilities and rooms were impeccably clean and nicely furnished 
216403,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, The room was a bit cramped and the desk chair was the only place to sit It was an inside room with a view to the room across the atrium but no outside window It was hard to know what to expect from the day without being able to see the weather , Several tube stops were within reasonable walking distance 
216404,Dorsett Shepherds Bush, Rooms were a bit small but you can t beat the price vs other London hotels , Nice design great breakfast fantastic public transit connections 94 bus right outside the front door gets you to Central London quickly
