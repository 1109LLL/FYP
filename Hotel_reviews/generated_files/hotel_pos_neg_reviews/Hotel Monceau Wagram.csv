240391,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Our room was not ready until well after check in time The property smells horrible and has filthy carpets that need replacing No wash cloths available for showers , It was within walking distance of the Arc de Triomphe 
240392,Hotel Monceau Wagram, The room was a bit small but the bathroom was spacious enough , The location was absolutely excellent We also asked for a quiet room when booking one on booking com and got a very nice room with a balcony on the quiet side of the building Located in the very center of Paris we got above excellent night sleep Also worthy mentioning is that the room was very clean with a spacious bathroom and very soft towels 
240393,Hotel Monceau Wagram,No Negative, I loved the double door window in the room which was French style with flowers that opened overlooking the street Felt like you were in Paris 10 min walk to Arch de Triumph
240394,Hotel Monceau Wagram, We came a bit earlier and they said they would charge us 30 EUR extra for that We left and came back at the normal check in time only to find out that one of the rooms we booked two wasn t ready The rooms were pretty tight not like the ones in the photos Overall the hotel is good probably we expected a bit more from a 4 star hotel , The location is good you can take taxi to most of the sightseeing spots for around 8 10 EUR The beds were comfortable and everything was clean 
240395,Hotel Monceau Wagram, The hotel is fairly small and as such has few small facilities Limited breakfast and bar area Only one lift which can make for a long wait , The room was well fitted out and in very good condition Good size by Parisian standards 
240396,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Shower Hard to get into and out of Street changes names block from hotel which made it difficult for taxis to find The room tho clean and nice was small and tight Not soundproofed as advertised , The breakfast and manager 
240397,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Overall this is a good choice for business travellers but there seems to be a divergence in the room types On a previous visit I stayed in a room which was much smaller I was very happy with the room provided this time There is a limited number of rooms on the floors many rooms on the ground floor There is a small number of staff who is helpful This is a small hotel with the minimum amenities If you are considering a 4 hotel with lots of facilities you may be disappointed , Large comfortably furnished room facing the street on the first floor The bedroom and bathroom were very well furnished and large in contrast to a smaller room from a previous stay The bed was very comfortable and there was a good desk with plugs available It was a good stay at a very competitive price I was quite happy with my stay and will book again 
240398,Hotel Monceau Wagram, No way a four star hotel stuff messed up my reservation had to wait for an hour didn t even offer a compensation eg complimentary breakfast Very tight spaces , Polite stuff decent breakfast at additional price free wifi nice location clean renovated bathroom 
240399,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Parking was too far away from hotel Front desk staff wasn t friendly Breakfast was horrible however the young lady working in the kitchen was a sweetheart Some of the food was left out overnight for the next day The hotel breakfast area need updating , The location was good walking distance to shopping The hotel room was clean 
240400,Hotel Monceau Wagram, The receptionist was rude First they sended us a mail with the Adress of the parking lot Once arrived the parking wouldn t open I called the hotel and they told us that there was nothing they could do for us Thus i went to the hotel first to drop of our luggage The hotel is 500m from the parking lot But the problem was on booking com there is a wrong Adress The receptionist wouldn t believe me and wouldn t give me the right adress So i had to check it online After we checked in we drove back to the parking lot where apperently is a small button to call the night service but we had to find that ourself the receptionist said nothing Once back at the hotel i told him about the button and he said he knew about that he was just laughing with us I have travelled the whole world but this receptionist was the rudest ever The hotel should retrain their employees I m glad it was only for one night , The room was decent and new 
240401,Hotel Monceau Wagram, I know there are varying sizes in the rooms available but we were a little surprised to find our room smaller than expected Before disappointment could set in we acknowledged we had the space we needed the decor was nice and we found the room pleasant and quaint with its strategic use of space If we were planning to spend more time in the room we would have requested any possible upgrade We arrived a little earlier than check in and were accommodated quickly so service and the quality of the facilities made up for what it seemed to lack in size straight off and we were able to get into enjoying the city right away We had no complaints during our stay but bathrooms can always be a bit bigger when two are sharing , From check in to check out the staff were very pleasant and accommodating The madame that prepared our eggs and tended to us during breakfast has to be a proper Chef as our eggs were AMAZING Breakfast was very good and the hotel was clean comfortable and quite My husband and I were in Paris to attend a short course at Le Cordon Bleu and the location was perfect for easy access to the cooking school and all other popular sites while still allowing for a break from the hustle and bustle in a pretty quiet neighbourhood There was quite enough in walking distance and it was very easy to access public transport to venture further out I would definitely return to this hotel and this arrondissment I absolutely enjoyed my time there I thoroughly enjoyed taking a short stroll and finding myself just behind the Arc and in proximity to the high end shops I would recommend the nearby artisan burger eatery for something a bit different and a sit down at the nearby cafe on the corner for a little people watching and a light bite sorry I don t remember the name but you can t miss the cafe en route to from the closest metro stop Ternes There s much around the stop also and it s a short 5 7 min walk Overall it s a lovely area and great location for staying in the city 
240402,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Reception was not friendly but they do their job good Lobby and restaurant is little , Loacation was very good Cleaniless was very good Room was comfort and quiet 
240403,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Dirty toilet even if I called the housekeeper to clean it she just passed superficially the wiping cloth I saw later others stains Hair on the bedding The receptionist not nice Small rooms but in the area most of them at the same Not going back ,No Positive
240404,Hotel Monceau Wagram, We booked the romantic superior room based on the fact the pictures on booking com suggest that prosecco macaroons will be in the room on arrival Please be aware that you have to pre reserve this and pay an additional cost above the value of the room and so we felt the advertising on booking com was a little misleading , Nice cosy hotel in a good location only a 10min walk to Arc de Triomphe and close to a number of metro RER Bus stops for easy access to other major attractions Eiffel Tower 20 mins away for example Bed is very very comfortable all the staff were helpful and friendly and on hand for any questions we had 
240405,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Our free drink on arrival turned out to be a bottle of water The stairs were very narrow and twisty and the corridor was very narrow too Only room for one at a time in the lift We had to go further afield to find places to eat as there was no atmosphere locally , I don t use lifts and we were on 5th floor standard room so we were upgraded free of charge to 3rd floor Nice room on the front of the hotel de luxe room but quiet The staff were excellent We got free slippers Good location for our destination of an art exhibition at the Luis Vuitton Foundation 
240406,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Coffee machine was available and was used by the hotel staff The coffee for the guests came from a thermos jug and was luke warm disappointing , Breakfast had a great selection Hotel staff were very polite and helpful Good location to get around Paris by metro
240407,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Room could have been bigger and the fridge could have been colder, The room was very small but the bed and bathroom were bigger than most The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was clean and well equipped with a coffee machine The fridge could have been colder The hotel is in a convenient situation for exploring paris
240408,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Breakfast was late for an hour and very limited choice most food were cold the room was very small smaller than the photos it feels more like a 3 star rather than 4 star hotel , The hotel staffs were very helpful throughout my stay room is clean
240409,Hotel Monceau Wagram, heavy stains on the carpet room 404 shower door missing water all over bathroom very little choice on breakfast not really what we expected about 4star hotel in paris and instead of large double bed we had two single bed attached together what was not really comfortable for couple rooms are nor soundproofed so loud noise when somebody above us use toilet shower etc not really good value for money, pretty good location
240410,Hotel Monceau Wagram,No Negative, Close enough to metro I was with girlfriend and decided to pay a little more for that romantic room option which wasn t exactly explained on the booking page It just means a nicer room with flowers arranged as heart on bed It was a pleasant experience
240411,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Even though hotel parking was advertised the parking was a solid 15 minutes walk away a total palaver to park and to get out of the the car park and the car park had nothing to do with the hotel just discounted rates I had told the hotel I was going to be checking in late then I get a call from the night staff asking for my credit card details I was told the booking was not confirmed and had to pay over the phone to keep the room , Staff Very helpful and apologetic for the number of misunderstandings and misleading information created by booking com and hotel owners 
240412,Hotel Monceau Wagram, The rooms are very very small And they gave us the room beside the elavator First problem is when opening the door of the elevator and our room s door at the same time is very impossible second is everytime someone use the elevator we can here the noise inside our room Another thing we booked the standard room with free breakfast and they gave us a very very small room with a double bed in it it was quite uncomfortable to roam around the room because we dont know where to place the luggages good thing we brought smaller bags Honestly I would rate the hotel not more than 3stars for that On the other hand on the next day my husband complained and they were very kind to transfer us into a bigger room with two single mattresses joined together strangely comfortable tho but still beside the elevator We appreciated it tho , The location of the hotel is very good it s on Champs Elysees whisch is just a few minutes walk to the Arc de Triomphe There are also restaurants bar near to the hotel though we just spent our dinner at PIZZAHUT because that s the best pizza for me though we came from italy LOL there s an italian pizza resto in front of the hotel too Another thing the rooms are clean and I love how comfortable the bed is for those who will depart from the Beauvais Airport i recommend you to take the taxi from the hotel it will cost you 13 50 i think for two people and will take you for about 15 20mins ride 
240413,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Not of the standard of a 4 star Hotel But in a city like Paris worth for the money that you spend , The location of the hotel is excellent I Staff are very helpful
240414,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Room size is small The stairs are too compact so using them was tricky , Plenty of restaurants and boulangeries nearby Staff very helpful Two metro stations a few minutes away and 8 min walk from Etoile Excellent breakfast 
240415,Hotel Monceau Wagram, It was really cold in our rooms adjoining ground floor rooms and every morning we would be woken up by the smell of the kitchen coming through ventilation , Location hotel staff especially the gentleman at the restaurant 
240416,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Rooms were a bit small but then again you don t go to Paris to stay in the room , Such a convenient location to get around Paris as the hotel is within 10 mins walk of the Arc de Triomphe and a 5 minute walk to the metro Rooms in the hotel were quite small but they were clean and very comfortable 
240417,Hotel Monceau Wagram,No Negative, Everything Stayed with 9 month old baby and felt really comfortable breakfast in a high chair stroller kept on the 1 floor a lot of cafes and restaurants nearby no need to gat a taxi to get to the Champs Elysee or Eiffel Tower local market with fromageries Paul see food is 3 mins walk Monoprix is also near The stuff is polite and really friendly The room is cozy and quite This hotel became my 2nd chose before it I booked a room at Hotel Elys e Gare de Lyon but they required me to book another as a baby was not allowed to sleep with 2 adult That was non sense but I couldn t get a refund and no booking com help as well I was upset but Hotel Monceau was totally a much better choice and I m happy that the situation went like that 
240418,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Asked for a wake up call and received it one hour earlier The staff did not seem to find it a big issue , Rooms are cosy and the bed is very comfortable I also appreciated the almonds on the pilow when I first arrived 
240419,Hotel Monceau Wagram, It was a mezzanine so I did not have an elevator , It was a very nice hotel It was within walking distance to the nearest station and the Etoile Arc de Triomphe and there was supermarket near too Indoor facilities and water pressure of shower were perfect Staff s correspondence was also good I also want to stay again next time 
240420,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Room was very small even for Paris and we had upgraded The toilet cubicle was impossibly small you had to leave to get dressed again There was only one of everything despite it being a double room One pair of slippers one bottle of water one sachet of coffee one teabag Worst of all it isn t sound proofed as the advert states It was the loudest hotel I ve ever stayed in we were woken all night by people coming and going and doors slamming The air con is also centrally controlled in my view not air con We were there in October however it was still nearly 20 degrees Celsius We had no control over the air con so the room was almost unbearably warm at night Staff were also decidedly unhelpful and verging on impolite ,No Positive
240421,Hotel Monceau Wagram, All ok , Great location near metro and walking distance to Champs Elysees Hotel is cozy and clean room is fine size is ok for paris standard Wifi works ok Bfast was fine Welcome at reception was great 
240422,Hotel Monceau Wagram, The cleanliness of the rooms We had junior suite which is basically 2 connected standard rooms There was hair all over the carpet floor and in the bathrooms My son found pair of somebody s sox under the bad Also there was somebody s hairband in the other bathroom Towels in the bathroom were also dirty ,No Positive
240423,Hotel Monceau Wagram,No Negative, Location close to metro easy to reach La Defense air con worked well which is not always the case in Paris breakfast had a great cheese selection and it seems like the fruit salad used fresh fruits at least partially maybe fully Little snacks and candies at the front desk makes for a nice touch 
240424,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Some of the front desk staff had no information about the hotel rooms and facilities They were very unhelpful and it took about 45 minutes to find our booking when we had our booking confirmations printed out in front of them Not a good start when you ve just arrived at the hotel after hours of travelling with kids , Clean little hotel with a good breakfast The manager and the breakfast lady were fabulous It is about a fifteen minute walk from Arc de Triomphe and there are good restaurants along the walk 
240425,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Nothing else we were surprised it is 4 STAR room was smallest you can imagine breakfast was the poorest I have eaten in our life whatever you ask was over at 9AM Very very limited choices sitting arrangement also sucks , location
240426,Hotel Monceau Wagram, The open shower in the bathroom made the whole bathroom wet but it s very clean so we don t complain , Great Location very close to Arc de Triomphe Quiet neighborhood We parked outside the hotel in the street Nice room clean good bed Simple but good breakfast And Luca is the most helpful and friendly person I ever met at a hotel desk in Paris A true asset to the hotel 
240427,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Staff starting knock you door at 9 o clock to clean We are in holidays and we don t have time to wake up When you open the door and said that we sleep that face , Nothing
240428,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Tiny elevator Crazy spiral stairs Tiny room Slow check in, Location is relatively a walking distance from Arc of Triumph Price was good there was 71 off Bathroom was well prepared Towels shampoos shower gel etc Complementary water tea bags and instant coffee The window had flowers and it was refreshing to open
240429,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Quite small my partner is very tall But the facilities and experience made up for this , Comfy bed Fantastic staff very helpful Good breakfast and great location 
240430,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Very small lift but can accommodate a baby stroller room decoration, Bed modern bathroom friendly staff especially the receptionists parking rate EUR19 day on rue de l toile breakfast buffet quiet room despite the central location our room was right next to the lift but we were not bothered by any noise throughout the night 
240431,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Small room but only there for one night The shower made up for it , Proximity to metro Quiet area Breakfast The shower was amazing Comfortable bed Excellent staff friendly and helpful 
240432,Hotel Monceau Wagram, The person who managed my the check in the other people at the reception were nice, Location easy to reach and to from to from good wi fi apprecieted breakfast
240433,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Breakfast can be a little more colourful Maybe add vegetables or a salad The toilet is seperate from the showe which is great but had a funny smell placing some air refreshing device would be helpful , Good location Very romantic setting The room had a heart made of flower buds on the bed when we arrived Helpful and very kind staff Rooms are clean and cozy Perfect for young couples in Paris 
240434,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Dry breakfast food No gym Taxes not included in price only VAT, Great location Beautiful silent room with bathtub Friendly and accomodating staff Access to airbus shuttle transfer Close to washing facilities
240435,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Probably the usual price as I benefited from a special discount for this rent , Perfect location very kind and helpful staff Possibility to leave luggage Nicely furnished room great bathroom Invoicing already prepared at check out Candies all around Felt most welcomed and taken care of 
240436,Hotel Monceau Wagram, The common areas of the hotel are a bit cramped including the elevator The internet is a bit slow in the room I had Some areas could do with a renovation The room felt a little bit small but there are many Parisian hotels like this In this star category I would have expected a slightly larger room , Excellent location just off the Avenue Wagram about 10 minutes walk from the Etoile Comfortable but small rooms The staff was very friendly and helpful The price value ratio is excellent The bathroom was quite nice renovated clean relatively spacious The bed was very comfortable 
240437,Hotel Monceau Wagram, breakfast its not good Not much choice on hot food , I like the hotel so nice and cosy also staff were very polite and helpfull Also cleanless of the room was very good 
240438,Hotel Monceau Wagram, breakfast was not good no bar no restaurant elevator and the hallways were tight there was a rude member of the staff working night shifts who made the stay there really annoying When i asked him for help to order pizza when i was sick and my feet were hurting from walking to the eiffel tower earlyer in the day and i didnt feel like going out he didnt help me he just told me to go to the pizza place and order there The night before we left i asked him at 10pm if they had loundry service and he answered so rudely that we had to clean loundry during the day We were leaving the hotel at 5 am and we went down to check out and pay half past 4 and he was so mad because we woke him up early and he told us we couldnt leave the hotel because then we couldnt get back in because someone would have to let us in and he was not finnished resting Not what you expect in a 4 star hotel They are supppse to have someone awake in the lobby 24 7 someone who is ready to assist you , the bed was big and comfy deluxe room the shower was big wifi was good
240439,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Very small rooms Breakfast monotonous and very limited Expected far more from a 4 star hotel , Location of the hotel is great and staff very friendly Beds were comfortable

240441,Hotel Monceau Wagram, The room was very small I found hair in the bathroom and on towels the staff at the reception were not nice taking their time for everything minding their own business while clients wait no smile not the service you get in 4 star hotels normally , The location is quite central in beautiful area with lots of restaurants walking distance to Arc de triumph 3 minutes from the nearest metro 
240442,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Very small rooms The value you get for the money you pay is minimal The 4 stars are a trick no clue how could they keep the last star The old ironing machine they gave me burned my shirt , Being somehow close to the major attractions in Paris 
240443,Hotel Monceau Wagram, Room size is really an issue you can barely walk room service breakfast room and food beside it is very expensive compare to what is served Surely doesn t deserve 4 stars hotel I have travelled to 25 countries and this is the worst 4 stars hotel i have ever stayed Prehaps this is Paris standards , Location is the best self service lundry shop just next the hotel is helpful and opposite a small grocery shop
