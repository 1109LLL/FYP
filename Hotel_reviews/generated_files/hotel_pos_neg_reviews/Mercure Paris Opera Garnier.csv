177567,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, Room could have been larger but appreciate space is a premium in Paris , Location was superb hotel was simple but we just wanted a place as a base and to sleep so this was perfect Front desk staff were extremely helpful 
177568,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, Everything is fine except for the sound insulation of window We are arranged to stay in a room at street side The voice from street is really loud even in late night , All the staffs are very friendly and willing to solve problems for visitors The breakfast is fresh Hotel is placed in downtown Easy to reach the Lafayett supermarket restaurant The hair dryer in our room didn t work on the 2nd day of our stay and the reception provide a premium hair dryer and let us keep it until check out The day we left to airport the reception even arranged a taxi driver who speaks Chinese for us It s really considerate which impressed us much 
177569,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, No complaints I had a room overlooking the main street at the back of the hotel I had the glass doors open to look out over the Paris streets below which was nice although a bit noisy if that sort of thing annoys you For me it was great There is air conditioning if you d rather keep the doors windows closed , The location of this hotel is great The basic rooms are a comfortable size and well fitted out There s not a great deal of communal space on the ground floor but what there is is fine and in this position why would you want to stay in the hotel 
177570,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier,No Negative, The hotel is very centrally located with good transport connections Rooms are newly renovated and vert clean There are plenty of restaurants in close proximity Would definitely stay here again on my next trip 
177571,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, Nothing to say here all good , Perfectly located on a backstreet in the centre of the city with lots of shops and restaurants Nice size quality room Walkable to almost everywhere you re likely to want to go 
177572,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, Room shape meant that i had a small bedside table between the door the bed so quite awkward at times when opening the door Didn t go for breakfast as was 19Euros, Great location near the train station and 20 minutes walk to Arc de Triomphe Was very quiet and liked being able to open french doors Good having a kettle 
177573,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, no daily refill compliment drinking water TV zapping too slow to get to another channel, comfy of the room friendliness of the employees room temperature room service quality of the wifi location close to Gare Saint Lazare
177574,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, Problem during Check in Hotel restaurant for dinner was terrible , Very good location near Opera Garnie and Galeria lafaytte The roisy bus for airport just in 5 m walking The train and metro and bus station are very close within few minutes of walking Hotel was very clean Breakfast was very good Lady in reception who was Mojgan was very kind and helpful 
177575,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, A possibility to hang the shower head Discount in relation with repair works One day room not cleaned discovered on coming back in the evening but all other days cleaning perfect , Central position 
177576,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, There were a few renovations ongoing that we hadn t been made aware of before arrival Room size was a bit small but well appointed it is Paris after all and everywhere is similar , Very comfortable bed a good selection on the buffet breakfast that catered for our requirements and that of teenage sons who eat quite a lot Location was excellent with the ability to walk to attractions and first class transport links nearby 
177577,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, The bathroom is too small The glass to prevent water flushing outside bathtub or on the floor is too small that the floor always get wet after taking bath No drainage to release the water on the floor Not ideal The room is newly renovated which has bad smell ,No Positive
177578,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, It s a bit noisy but that s due to where it is close to bars late night shops etc Didn t bother me but it s something to be aware of , Great location for shopping centre and nighlife Room seemed a little bit bigger than most similar hotels in Paris Very pleasant 
177579,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, The room could be a little more silent , Everything was just perfect Across the street from Gare Saint Lazare wallking distance to Opera Garnier Galeries Lafayete and even the Louvre if you are willing to walk for 20 min 
177580,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, The choice for breakfast was very samey And we had a courtyard view from our room and it looked straight into someone s room , The bed was comfy I liked the fact you had the option of having breakfast in your room
177581,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, Rooms are absolutely too small I had an upgraded room which added a little bit of space but I wouldn t go back to the hotel since I felt cramped Paris has a lot of hotels I ve stayed at plenty of them and by far this had the smallest room , Staff very friendly and location was excellent Easy to reach metro station or walk to your destination The bed was comfortable and the soundproofing in the room was better than I expected 
177582,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, The rooms are little if they are bigger I think the experience could be more wonderful , The staffs are very kind They let us to deposit our luggage before we have checked in that s so convient for us to shopping easily 
177583,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, The single lift that was working was unreliable The second lift was out of action during our stay That is all I can think of as being negative , The location was excellent as was the standard of cleanliness and helpfulness of the staff Of course the size of the room was little compact but this is central Paris after all What else could be expected I would highly recommend this lovely small boutique type hotel Thank you to all the staff who made our stay so enjoyable 
177584,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, The standard room size was a bit small so we couldn t open 2 luggages widely in the room , The best point is location It s close to Saint Lazare station subway station and department stores Even famous attractive places are working distance either Bed seat has been cleaned up everyday and bathroom was also very clean And I could open windows in the room towards street so it was cool and the view outside was nice It makes me feel like I became a parisien 
177585,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, Nothing , Super friendly staff excellent free wifi very clean room walkable distance to most right bank attractions and really close to the stations for a few different metro RER lines and bus stops Breakfast was good too Reasonably priced Really can t fault it 
177586,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, On the first night the standard room was tiny we had to pay extra to get a room that was just about acceptable for two people We paid 750 for four nights in what I would consider to be a one or two star hotel at best Everything is old and tired and in poor repair Stained carpets and threadbare little towels instead of bath towels The shower barely worked and the free internet was useless they wanted 12 day for standard speed internet that you can get in McDonalds There were 39 French TV channels and one in English I don t think that they expect international guests The hotel is just dull dreary and pokey Even the AC didn t work properly when you set it to 23DegC it freezes the room when you turn it off you cant breath after half an hour Even though I didn t include breakfast when booking they give you vouchers at check in to trick you into having a very basic breakfast which they then charge 19 for Overall I felt ripped off and it spoiled the weekend for us Wouldn t go back there again , Bed was fine room was relatively clean location was excellent
177587,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, Nothing, Excellent location very friendly informative staff very clean with daily room towels cleaned very good breakfast with lots of choice small additional charge nice bar area comfortable outdoor patio area couldn t of asked for more for a weekend visit to Paris

177591,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, staff were very rude we arrived at 11 45 and were informed that checkin was not possible until 12 We waited 15 minutes and then asked to checkin and the staff proceeded to take more than 30 minutes to check us in we were the only ones there as they were trying to buy time for the rooms to finish being cleaned one of the elevators was not working the entire time we were there I did not see anywhere on booking com that they were going to block 25euro a day on my card on top of the room charge for the minibar , great location
177592,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, The room was so small for a double room for 2 with luggage Had to rearrange the furniture to be able to circulate Didn t help much , The breakfast buffet is a fantastic way to start the day 
177593,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, Service could have been more welcoming and helpful generally , cleanliness of room A guy who could speak English was most helpful at the front desk Polite cleaners Being accorded a privilege room during stay 
177594,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, the smell in the hallway For some reason that day there was kind of a funky smell around , The friendliness of the staff and the location of the hotel 
177595,Mercure Paris Opera Garnier, Bar prices in hotel very expensive also asked for twin room near lift for elderly relative with limited mobility which we didn t get albeit we just had to push them a bit further in the wheelchair and walk in shower would have been good, Location for shops sights and transport links
