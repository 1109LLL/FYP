34311,Le Marcel, No need for staff to walk me all the way into my room It is not a better service it is only uncomfortable, Spacious room comfortable bed nice view complimentary non alcoholic drinks very clean
34312,Le Marcel, Minute entranceway with a lift to the 1st floor reception Rather busy and downmarket surrounding , Handy for the Gare de l Est and Gare de Nord Comfortable quiet room overlooking the street and the Gare de l Est station 
34313,Le Marcel, There is a major security problem in this location Many pickpockets and homeless persons We did not feel safe walking in the streets to restaurants , Staff and location generally
34314,Le Marcel, The rooms were quite hot so we needed either the window open too noisy or to use the aircon, Good soundproofing and comfortable beds The bedrooms are well laid out and make a good use of space 
34315,Le Marcel, The metro did rattle the room a little but really couldn t be helped , Right across from a metro stop with excellent connections into central Paris and beyond Room was very comfortable 
34316,Le Marcel, There could have been a small kettle for people who wants to drink hot water especially in cold weather like it was , Bed was great Slept like a baby That small refrigerator is a plus A beer would have been great 
34317,Le Marcel, The mattresses on the beds collapsed causing the beds to slant in one direction Even after bringing it to the staff s attention nothing was done about it One spent the night sliding off one side of the bed Our water glasses weren t washed after being used the first night I was told I could leave a mug from the dining room in our room but it was never removed or washed and it remained there until we checked out Central heating was too hot Compared to the other hotels with the same rating we stayed at during this trip Le Marcel was not up to standard , Great location close to the train station 
34318,Le Marcel, It was tricky to find only a single door on a busy Paris street gave it away We could have walked right past it The room was small and the bathroom disproportionately large They could have used the space better , The bed was comfortable and the buffet breakfast was great The location was perfect for what we wanted 
34319,Le Marcel, No suggestions we were happy with everything and enjoyed our two nights there We wanted a place near the train station and it was perfect as far as we were concerned , We were delighted with Hotel Le Marcel The street entrance does not look like much but when you get up to the first floor reception and into the rooms it is very attractively and thoughtfully designed in modern style to maximize the space The room was small but attractive and had everything needed and the bed was good Very nice bathroom The breakfast buffet was terrific and we liked it that they had the NY Times International edition to read with breakfast Location is great across from the Gare de l Est but we did not hear street noise when we closed the window 
34320,Le Marcel,No Negative, Staff very friendly and accommodating Family atmosphere I was upgrated from standard room to suite so very comfortable and spacy room Perfectly located if you arrive depart from Gare de l Est as it is just opposite of the street As such also easy access to Paris metro lines 
34321,Le Marcel, The location is very convenient to get to the trains but not particularly close to major tourist sites , The staff were very nice and helpful I arrived before check in they held my bags for me and when I arrived back they had upgraded me to a beautiful room on the top floor and placed my luggage there already The room was very clean and spacious with several convenience amenities The bed was very comfortable and the hotel itself was nice and quiet 
34322,Le Marcel, The bathroom was not clean There was a hair on the bathroom floor The shower curtain was dirty too The room was very noisy The clacking noises of people walking on the above floor disturbed sleep , The location was great only a few minutes to walk from Gare de l Est The staff was kind and helpful The beverage in the mini bar was free 
34323,Le Marcel, The room is a bit small noisy as it closes to the main road with a lot of traffic The shower is small but the water pressure is very good , Lovely staff the location is super convenient next to the east train station and metro station There is a bakery opposite to the hotel called le moulin de pain their bread is very delicious 
34324,Le Marcel, Light sleepers might find this a difficult hotel as the sound of the underground trains were a constant background rumble This should be obvious due to the proximity to Gare du L Est but is something travellers need to be aware of , Staff were great especially at the door location was very central room was very clean and more than adequate for what we needed Plenty of great eating places around and getting places was easy with bus train and walking all valid options 
34325,Le Marcel, Nothing , We spent 3 nights here in this wonderful boutique hotel The staff were probably the most helpful I have come across The location is great as it is directly across the road from Gard D est where the metro is located Also close to the canal where there are great cafes and restaurants Rooms and bathroom were perfect 
34326,Le Marcel, The entrance is inconspicuous one could say hidden not so easy to spot but security is good Just do not expect a big reception it s on the first floor , Largest room we ever had in Paris Excellent breakfast Very convenient location for us in front of Gare de l Est and walking distance to Gare du Nord 
34327,Le Marcel, Rooms small for more than one person , Small hotel with reception on first floor and secure entrance on ground floor Rooms very nice but small including large tv with international channels Location good for stations and recommend for stade de France matches soundproofing from road good Wifi strong 10mb and reliable Free soft drinks in minibar and turndown service left sweets and beer with euro16 Le marcel bag 
34328,Le Marcel,No Negative, I travel a lot with business Le Marcel gave some the best customer service I ve ever seen Paris was chaotic but the staff helped us so much I can t commend them enough 
34329,Le Marcel, The shower was a nightmare the spray was uncontrollable and went everywhere and with no curtain or shower screen the whole bathroom got wet we were unable to adjust it and resorted to using the bathtub for our stay , The staff upgraded us to the 7th floor which was a bigger room and had a good view of Sacre Cour on one side and the Gare du L est on the other side The hotel was very modern and really convenient to both the Gare Du L est and Gare du Nord train stations We walked from the hotel to the Sacre Cour and the Lourve easily Breakfast was a small affair but ok 
34330,Le Marcel, Room just fits the bed and no more that is to say that it is a tight squeeze moving round And no chair Just a block of wood , Great toiletries comfy bed quiet room lovely staff 
34331,Le Marcel, Bed was very uncomfortable room not soundproof as advertised only an issue as we were traveling with a sleep averse toddler Also the shower had no shower curtain or anything to contain the water which was just weird , Location steps from Gare d le Est Great friendly staff Room was in good shape 
34332,Le Marcel, I have no complaints , The staff were all very friendly We felt safe had a staff representative at the entrance Convenient to restaurants one next door across the street throughout the block Metro was a 5 minute walk and the price was reasonable I also liked that there was an option to purchase breakfast 
34333,Le Marcel, Bathroom was not well planned it did not have towel rails and soap dispenser in shower and it had a cupboard that opened to the bathroom and also to room so someone could inadvertently look in and take away privacy to shower and toilet , Location and warm and friendly reception
34334,Le Marcel, Like most hotels in Paris the rooms are small and the internet wasn t very good , The room was very clean and the staff was helpful when needed they also had a mini bar in the rooms And ya they had a 50inch screen tv in my room with satellite channels
34335,Le Marcel, The rooms were small but we expected that its common in Paris , We choose this hotel due to its location price and recommendations and got exactly what we looked for located just on top of GARE DE L EST we were able to get anywhere fast Paris The rooms were new and pleasant to stay in The staff was remarkably nice and helpful Excellent value for money 
34336,Le Marcel,No Negative, Hotel conveniently located for rail metro and bus links Very comfortable and clean room and quiet due to double glazing I guess Bed and bed linen particularly comfortable and walking long distances sight seeing 
34337,Le Marcel, I can t figure out why it is four star rather than three One of the four smallest rooms I ve ever stayed in No obvious amenities Bathroom does not have a towel rack and is not separately ventilated , It is clean and secure and the bed was comfortable

34340,Le Marcel, Nothing, Great hotel newly renovated large room big bed big bathroom as with a lot of hotels in Paris there is not a lobby on the ground floor there is security and a small entrance and the entrance can be hard to find the room is air conditioned and worked well it is walking distance from the Gare D Nord train station and the underground train station Gare D lest is just over the road also many taxis in front of the station for your trip to the airport expect to pay about 35 to 40 euros if they are honest

34344,Le Marcel, The hotel is easy to miss as you walk on the street so keep eye out The rooms are very compact and there is not real privacy when you are in the bathroom as there is not a locking door between the room and bathroom We also noticed our carpets were not vacummed in the room , The staff were friendly and the hotel was opposite one of the main train stations It is quite easy to get metros and there are lots of bakeries and eateries nearby
