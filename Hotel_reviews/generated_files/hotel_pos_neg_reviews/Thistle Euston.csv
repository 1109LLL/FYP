295900,Thistle Euston, Would have preferred a free standing shower bath very deep for a wee person like me to get in and out of , Room we were initially given was tiny bed against the wall and we couldn t even pass each other i complained got a free upgrade but looking at the advertised standard double room pic it was by no means an upgrade after requesting change this was immediate effect only drawback was that the Windows were not double glazed and there must be been a staff entrance below us view was an alley as the beeping entry system and chatting was quite loud also sounded like a building site nearby however this did not spoil our stay and we would return to Thistle lovely staff fab location 
295901,Thistle Euston, Cleanliness of the bathroom This was a nightmare although the bathroom looked refreshed it was a bit dirty I think managers don t pay attention to detail and this is surprising At the end of the day this hotel have 4 and bathrooms should be clean Apart from that fire doors in the corridor on the 4th floor were noisy and it was hard to get some decent sleep as whenever people were walking in or out the doors were banging so loud that it was impossible to not get awaken , Location was good staff very friendly and very responsive Easy check in and check out Can t fault the service provided by reception staff as it was excellent Room was tidy not very good looking but for someone who needs to get some sleep should be enough If you re looking for some luxury or contemporary style then do not book standard double as you might be dissapointed 
295902,Thistle Euston, Some noise I think from air conditioning system above the room but it wasn t bad enough to complain about or spoil the stay , The bedroom was clean and comfortable The breakfast was good value scrambled eggs were delicious If staying in London I would definitely stay there again 
295903,Thistle Euston, Staff in the morning was alright staff at night for check in partially not so helpful Main issue bed was very uncomfortable and not good if you want to sleep in this hotel room 33 Rubbish bin was not emptied and contained still rubbish from previous guest Completely overpriced for the quality you get , The location is very good central close to train station 
295904,Thistle Euston, The room was worn and requires updating The cleanliness was poor dirty carpet and skirting boards The bathroom was very small and difficult to move around the shower sprayed everywhere with no heated towel rail or fan to get rid of the condensation, The reception staff were very friendly and helpful
295905,Thistle Euston, We struggled to regulate the room temperature and needed to open a window so that it was neither too cold nor too hot in the room Unfortunately the back side of the hotel is right across from the tracks and the station for the local trains and our window overlooked that it was noisy and nothing for a view The area itself is not the most attractive nor is it near places of interest It was disappointing that the small park adjacent to the hotel was permanently closed and under some sort of construction that green space would have added to and improved the location a little Owing to all of this I would consider the room a bit pricey , The hotel is well appointed and the staff exceedingly helpful The women at the front desk assisted us in booking the Hop on Hop off tour provided transit information and made great suggestions for activities that might interest us Our room was spacious for London and the breakfast buffet delicious The proximity to the underground and local trains was excellent 
295906,Thistle Euston, booked on line with credit card was asked to show it on arrival have NEVER been asked before l didn t have it worry about it being stolen have stayed here 6 times the manageress could not give me a reason just kept on and on no apology if we had cancelled or not arrived the fee would have been taken my sister had a card but not the point could we have been turned away spoilt the start of our stay and put me off staying again Nothing on the site mentions this , the room and the predone toast no silly machine to deal with and wait for
295907,Thistle Euston, Mostly good size of bathroom could have been larger, Room was small but adaquate the bathroom very small but an excellent shower over the bath Had a sandwich for lunch that was tasty and reasonable Breakfast was 12 per person but again excellent Location so close to Euston station Staff friendly and helpful would definitely stay there again
295908,Thistle Euston, Have nothing bad to say , Room was lovely and a good price Super clean Close to Camden Bed was very comfy Breakfast was good for the price If I m ever back in the area I d happily come back 
295909,Thistle Euston, The shower wasn t that clean and the bed was very hard , Good location good breakfast Staff are friendly and professional and the hotel has a good feel about it 
295910,Thistle Euston, Not having an accessible room to accommodate my disabilities, My requirement was an accessible room as I am disabled but the only one they had was occupied The alternative was totally unsuitable and the promise of a chair for the shower did not materialise My visits to London are for hospital appointments and I did not have time to try and find another hotel It would have cost another fortune with it being Wimbledon Tennis time I paid a lot for a substandard room that was not accessible The room given was immediately next door to the life there versions of an alternative accessible room I will never rely on this hotel again and feel totally disappointed that my needs were dismissed so lightly Even if a chair had been provided for in the shower I could not have a shower as there were no grab rails Appalled at the reaction on arrival as they tried to blame me dispicable 
295911,Thistle Euston, The receptionist When I checked in I told her I m on my business trip and need some printings and don t mind to pay But she keeps saying she is busy but actually nobody on the queue for checking in and keep mention about the cost Don t like her attitude , The bath
295912,Thistle Euston, The room was far too small Very poor value for money Wouldn t use this hotel again for that reason , The double bed was hard up against the wall The room could hardly be described as a double room 
295913,Thistle Euston, The queue for reception was long and slow moving on arrival with only two staff on the desk We had to ask for directions to our room time of breakfast etc as this information wasn t offered A fridge in the room would be a welcome addition It was a very warm July weekend and cold rather than lukewarm water would have been good , This hotel is conveniently located around the corner from Euston Station making it easy to get to and a great central location when traveling around London Hotel room was clean and a decent size with a good range of facilities and housekeeping responded promptly when we requested more coathangers 
295914,Thistle Euston, The wifi was poor A speedtest at 12am so few should have been using it showed 2 6mb down and 0 2mb up Had to give up and just use 4G tethered from my phone , Comfy beds pillows in a spacious clean room The shower was phenomenal like showing under a waterfall The best shower I ve had in 34 years We only stayed one night so can t comment on all aspects including the restaurant breakfast 
295915,Thistle Euston, That we didn t have enough time to stay longer , The staff and service crew were very accommodating and friendly They went the extra mile to make us feel comfortable and welcome Clean comfy and the food servings were large and very tasty Thank you for a wonderful stay 
295916,Thistle Euston, Rooms were student dorm like student dorm from 60 s that need a refresh Very basic service for the price prob a bad day for the staff or something, Convenient place to park and stay in London
295917,Thistle Euston, The size of the room was a bit small hard to get around the bed as you walked in and the bed was way too hard for me , Location is fantastic right by the trainstation and no matter where you want to go in London 
295918,Thistle Euston, Creaky floors long corridors and inefficient lifts, The room was clean and reasonable sized for this part of lounge the aspect was pleasant and quiet Bar staff were pleasant and obliging 
295919,Thistle Euston, The room was tiny and the bathroom was dirty I requested with plenty of notice a room with a view as it was a special trip for me and my wife I was on the first floor and when I finially managed to open the dilapadeted metal window I had a large tree in front of me and a active building site The toilet keep flushing on its own I reporteed this to the reception below and was told we will get someone to look at it on Monday I was checking out on the Sunday so this was not much use to me , It was close to the train station 
295920,Thistle Euston, Hotel was dated Our room door could of done with a new lick of paint and was narrow compared to other hotels we have stayed in I paid nearly the same price in Tokyo and the hotel rooms was far more nicer Rooms are fairly small for the price Bathrooms you couldn t swing a cat in Ordered a baby cot when on booking but when we turned their was no cot in room When we enquired they said you need to order on booking They said they would get one from another hotel but girl on reception seemed reluctant and she had a attitude the cot delivered wasn t a cot it was a play den Hotel lifts were VERY small and slow In general we will not be staying here again for 200 night Worst hotel ever A depressing return to the UK , Breakfast was very good and helpful staff Bed was comfy 
295921,Thistle Euston, The room was noisy I had asked for a quiet room The TV didn t work properly The toilet made a strang mois when flushed and the wardrobe door wouldn t shut so the light was on all night I had to wedge it with the ironing board When I told he staff next morning they said I should have asked to move rooms but all this only came to light Lat on hen I was going to bed , Location is good
295922,Thistle Euston, Room is pretty small Although the bathroom is quite spacious the shower door and shower nozzle are rather problematic thus not a good showing experience Bad wifi signal not sure if it s because our room is on the edge , Wonderful location Less than 5 minute walk to Euston station Also has a bus stop nearby 
295923,Thistle Euston, Total confusion with keys rooms check in on breakfast charges Staff were beautifully polite and friendly , Eggs were great Total confusion with keys rooms check in on breakfast charges Staff were beautifully polite and friendly but mostly seemed new and not trained and not really fluent in English Do you pay very low rates and attract young people from areas of high unemployment who don t realise how expensive london is 
295924,Thistle Euston, The road is currently under construction so it was rather difficult getting to them But this should be corrected when they finish the road work and if you haven t a car probably won t notice , Accommodated all my requests needed fridge easy access room Room very pleasant has air conditioner which was great since it was so hot and humid Comfy bed fluffy towels pleasant staff who speak many languages Btw there is a very pleasant park right next store Most importantly within close walking distance to train station
295925,Thistle Euston, The room itself looks nothing like advertised in the pictures the lobby looks amazing but the rooms look like they haven t been renovated since the early 20th century very professionally done photos on the booking com website It was very loud in the hotel by that I mean the rooms were not at all soundproof you can hear people talking in the room next door and you can also hear every time they would close the door as it would end with a loud bang probably because of the door hinges Believe me I can sleep through anything and am not a light sleeper but this was loud The bathroom was terrible as it was hard to get warm water it was either scalding hot or freezing cold and the bathtub itself was clogged so you would be showering with scalding hot water while standing in freezing cold water , The staff was pleasant and helpful and the room service was decent 
295926,Thistle Euston, Told us our room was far from the lift but did not tell us there was a flight of stairs to negotiate with heavy cases was hard to get extra milk and tea bags also was very hard to contact them on the phone we stayed here 3 years ago and had a far better room this visit was very disappointing, Great location
295927,Thistle Euston, Beds were pretty hard and not very comfortable Contruction works were ongoing besides the hotel Very busy breakfast area and breakfast was not always filled up once empty , Very helpful staff Location is close to Euston railway and subway station 10 15 min walk to Camden 
295928,Thistle Euston,No Negative, Lovely comfortable bed plenty of pillows great tea and coffee making facilities lovely small Nespresso machine Nice small bathroom and lovely toiletries Friendly welcoming staff and quick check in procedure Great service lovely small single room fantastic choice at breakfast including ample tea and delicious pastries perfect for a weekend stay in London 
295929,Thistle Euston, Bar was a little disappointing Mistake made with lunch order cracked glass companions meal not served at same time as mine no apology , Reception staff lovely helpful 
295930,Thistle Euston, Breakfast would stay again but would eat breakfast elsewhere in future Everything self service Coffee machine too complicated to work many people gave up and didn t bother When eventually i asked a waitress how to work it she took ages getting it to work and then the coffee tasted awful when i did get it Food was average As i said before i would definitely stay again as overall was a pleasant experience , Great location Fantastic night s sleep comfy bed no noise soundproofed walls air conditioning kept the room at a constant temperature rather than getting too cold too blowy 
295931,Thistle Euston, The room was dingy and did not smell very fresh The air conditioner was noisy The mattress was hard Although clean and reasonably well appointed the bathroom was tiny , The response staff made to some problems with the room safe locked shut door card did not activate light switches They sorted these out immediately and professionally The brasserie menu was quite varied and the lighter meal I chose was good value 
295932,Thistle Euston,No Negative, The location was very central great for the conference I was attending Reception staff extremely friendly on arrival and departure Very comfortable bed 
295933,Thistle Euston, The shower and bathroom were a little cramped and my wife would have preferred a flexible shower head not a fixed one as we had in our shower We found the restaurant a little noisy and looking a bit 60 s I think it could do with a revamp , The bed was extremely comfortable and the pillows were good too The breakfast was very good 
295934,Thistle Euston, Nothing, The beds and bedding were very comfortable I had a very good nights sleep Excellent facilities very clean modern hotel I shall most certainly stay at the Thistle Euston again 
295935,Thistle Euston, The staff at the breakfast can genuinely be a little more friendly , Liked everything about it But not the first time being at the hotel I ve been there previously And as always it was very much worth it 
295936,Thistle Euston, Breakfast room is very small and does not accomodate customers The restaurant is in the basement and food is regular and does not match their posters Room is small for the price, It is close the Euston station Next time I may consider going to IBIS 
295937,Thistle Euston, There was nothing we didn t like but one comment would be to place tea and coffee making tray on the table instead of in drawer it s not obvious where they are even though drawer front says it s there I read a review prior to booking so remembered to look , Very easy to get to from the tube lots or power points in convenient places around our spacious room Informative staff when enquiring how to get to places to visit My granddaughter and myself e njoyed the whole experience 
295938,Thistle Euston, My room overlooked a park where drunks gathered I was charged 176 just in case so I have been deducted 3 amounts for 2 rooms and I am still waiting for a refund No mention was made of tis on check in , The bed was comfortable 
295939,Thistle Euston, The breakfast was good but at 12 per head there could have been far more of a personal service The tables were small and we had to ask for the tea It was very busy but some of the staff could have been more attentive , The room was of good size for London though the bathroom was small The bed was very comfortable It was very handy for Euston Station so only a few stops from the centre of all we wanted to see and do 
295940,Thistle Euston,No Negative, Comfy beds lovely bathroom great location The staff where lovely in the restaurant and couldn t do enough to help same with reception staff Everyone we came across in London where so helpful it really made our stay
295941,Thistle Euston, check in was overlong as staff were pre occupied giving theatre and travel directions to other guests At the end of day 1 on a 2 night stay my key cards were cancelled and I had to queue again to check in all over again Not good front facing room on first floor suffered noise from traffic and roadworks outside , good size room and bathroom Natural light tea and coffee and ironing board supplied comfortable bed 
295942,Thistle Euston, Non existent room service reception and concierge Was ringing for hours with no reply had to go down 4 floors to find staff and even then I was looking everywhere Not good for health and safety at all,No Positive
295943,Thistle Euston, Mold on the bathtube dirty carpets cracks in the windows window view on the AC devices and dirty wall The pictures absolutely do not reflect the reality Such a hotel would have maximum 3 stars in Poland I m going back to London soon but will choose another hotel , Quiet room quite comfortable beds 
295944,Thistle Euston, Credit card pre charged so unable to change it on arrival Air con completely inadequate on what was the hottest night so far this year Room decor very tired , Pleasant welcome convenient location 
295945,Thistle Euston, Would have liked more milk in our room Never thought to request more at the time , Our room was quiet previously we were quite close to the back of the lifts so we re disturbed during the night Can t fault our stay this time
295946,Thistle Euston, bathroom tidy and clean but not as up to date as bedroom in terms of d cor, bed very comfy and huge we were upgraded for free room had a nespresso coffee machine nice touch
295947,Thistle Euston, Cleaning service is shocking Cleaners get rid of things from specific surfaces and that includes personal belongings you don t want chucked When I rang to find out what happened the housekeeping hung up , Comfy bed
295948,Thistle Euston, I booked on 2 individual bookings which reception converted into a 1 room booking for two nights Appreciated However on the second day returning at 7 pm tired my keys were cancelled and I had to queue again to have this fixed at reception That was poor Queuing times at reception on Friday afternoon were overlong as staff were spending too much time giving travel directions and theatre advice to customers leaving once lady to check the queue in A quick check in after a tiring day travel is appreciated Room 104 at the front was noisy with traffic after 7 a m Onwards including buses arriving to pick up tourists at hotel , Property is in very good location adjacent to Euston station It is also within walking distance of Camden market Good sized room and bathroom tea and coffee provided as is an iron ironing board and hair dryer and toiletries Comfortable King size bed for 2 night stay I booked on 2 individual bookings which reception converted into a 1 room booking for Two nights and that was appreciated Bar was ok for a late night drink 
295949,Thistle Euston, The room and bathroom were both a little cramped and there was some noise from construction work nearby , This was a nice hotel convenient for Euston underground station which was a few minutes away and had great links to eg Trafalgar and Leicester Squares Embankment London Eye Westminster etc
295950,Thistle Euston, Took 30 mins to check in the walls are paper thin and it was impossible to sleep raised both issues with staff and to be honest they were not bothered at all The bar was awful staff bickering started serving me and then got distracted 3x and did something else On another table someone called a waiter over so the waiter went to get the hotel manager it was all very embarrassing , Showers Breakfast were good
295951,Thistle Euston, Bathroom door s lock was not there Guess it was broken but they did not get it fixed and gave us the room without checking Service at the restaurant was super slow with hardly few guests around ,No Positive
295952,Thistle Euston, When I arrived it was simultaneously with a large group that arrived at the same time The line up was huge and the small reception area was like a zoo noisy and unorganized It took me a while to find the place so after a bunch of walking coming to a lineup and noisy reception area wasn t the greatest start to the stay I m not sure what other rates are for hotels in London but it seemed a bit expensive for what was provided , I enjoyed the expresso coffee maker in the room I found the room very clean and actually noted the bath towel was extra large and fluffy nice I liked the fact the room was energy efficient and the king size bed was ample I appreciated the friendliness of the cleaning staff as everyone of them said hello when passing by A small thing but added to the friendliness of the hotel I found the proximity to the underground Euston close enough to walk to making coming and going easy throughout the 3 days there 
295953,Thistle Euston, The room and the bathroom were quite small and we had to allow each other room to pass as if 2 people pass the bottom of the beds together it s quite a squeeze However I ve stayed in smaller rooms and so it wasn t an issue , Ease of check in and out and very importantly enough electrical sockets in the room Too many hotels don t have enough sockets and as my husband has to sleep with a machine to help him breath through the night as he has sleep apnoea we frequently have to use the one socket for that and also ask for an extension lead as no sockets near the bed Thank goodness Thistle have sockets in usable and practical places so I can charge my iPod and iphone and my husband can sleep with his machine plugged in Enough lamps too I hate having to use overhead lighting in bed but we had a bedside lamp so that was good too There were 2 decent armchairs too 
295954,Thistle Euston, Larger menu more variety , Amazing bread and croissants Not kidding but they were noticeably good The total food menu was very basic and not exciting but not bad rooms were comfortable and quiet Pretty good wifi easy to connect with no limitations
295955,Thistle Euston,No Negative, The customer service was outstanding Our room was upgraded when they realised we were staying to celebrate our wedding anniversary Also breakfast was delicious and so very organised considering how busy the team were 
295956,Thistle Euston, Basin in bathroom was cracked room 141 it s functional but looks bad Otherwise everything was perfect Nice and quiet too despite central location ,No Positive
295957,Thistle Euston, The room was not too inviting very small and stuffy Found it difficult to sleep , Excellent location near Euston station with great access to underground etc 
295958,Thistle Euston, The neighborhood was pretty far from major sights and there were not many eateries nearby , Nice young staff close to Euston Station clean room good lounge for light meals and drinks 
295959,Thistle Euston, Pillows were lumpy and the general hotel bedroom and corridor d cor looks old and tired Doesn t need updating style wise but needs a bit of TLC to bring up to expected quality for the price, Great location
295960,Thistle Euston, Bathroom needed updating, Friendly staff especially at breakfast Good value breakfasts tasty and well cooked Comfortable beds Quiet location though so convenient for Euston St Pancras and Kings Cross
295961,Thistle Euston, The window lock was a little flimsy and there was some chipped paint on the windowsill but other than that nothing , Great location for Euston train station and other transport links Lovely helpful staff Really nice breakfast with a great variety of tasty items 
295962,Thistle Euston, They had lost my booking and in finding my booking that I had made using booking com made me feel in no uncertain terms that it was likely my fault for this mess up In the end it turned out it was not my fault it was their booking systems but I didn t get an apology,No Positive
295963,Thistle Euston, My sons bed had marks all over its sheet and duvet cover After returning late he has to sleep on top of a towel When I pointed this out to staff I was given a business card for a possible upgrade if I visit again Disgusting , Location and shower 
295964,Thistle Euston, Breakfast Not worth 12 pound Hot food sitting too long Slow to re stock food Not inviting to eat Slow to clean up rubbish and bottles outside of entrance from overnight , Position to public transport
295965,Thistle Euston, Room service did take nearly an hour so order early Bedding and room was clean but there was some old napkins in the drawer , The hotel is an easy walk from London Euston station about 5 mins The staff were very welcoming and made check in quick and easy 
295966,Thistle Euston, Room plan is quite confusing and tight , Thistle Euston is nice and simple Its location was perfect for catching trains to the North and was not far for taking the taxi back to the hotel from the central of London 
295967,Thistle Euston, 4 star listed hotel but room really needed attention Dirty carpet with large stains window with chipped paint Room was cold and we had difficulty adjusting the thermostat Staff was helpful and brought extra blankets, Large rooms for A London hotel Bed was comfortable Good location just a block from Euston station 
295968,Thistle Euston, I had booked an executive King room and had paid On arrival I found that they sent me to a little box room in what felt like the basement I complained and it took about 40 mins in reception holding my ground before I was finally given a downgraded room and a partial refund They did not telll me what they had done with my booking and tried to get away with it hoping I woul just accept the room Very disappointed as previously have been very impressed , The location is excellent 
295969,Thistle Euston,No Negative, Breakfast self service good coffee and Nespresso also available Good choice of cooked continental and other things Also could have a newspaper if you wanted Location excellent if you are heading into out of Euston Rooms smallish but well equipped and reasonably quiet 
295970,Thistle Euston, The food was disgraceful Fatty burger cold chips really disappointing And no offer of giving me anything extra for the inconvenience of waiting 40 mins for the burger chips to have to send them both back and then wait another 20 mins for a sandwich I had arrived at 9pm which was already late so to then start eating at 10pm was not appreciated ,No Positive
295971,Thistle Euston, Shower an utter disaster Vertical so no flexibility as to where the water went I had to hold it by hand whilst trying to soap the areas of my body The alternative was to crouch down on a slippery floor No height control The temperature was lukewarm Bad design My room was facing Euston Station so very noisy should have triple glazing on the windows , Bed and room were comfortable and very clean Staff very courteous and helpful no complaints there 
295972,Thistle Euston, The breackfast NOT INCLUDED in to the room s price This is disappointing for loyal customers , Very good personal staf services Good confort in to the room 
295973,Thistle Euston, No mini fridge with children it s a must as they are very fussy eaters and sometimes all you can give them is stuff you buy from a grocery store like yogurt and milk etc, The close proximity to Euston underground station
295974,Thistle Euston, Worse room ever on 1st floor Stayed here 4 times previously will not stay again Room was very small more like a single Small Double bed pushed up against a cold wall had to climb over partner to get out of bed 8 months pregnant No bedside tables either side very cramped room Noise from traffic all night long draft from window Scruffy decor dirty taps in bathroom , nothing
295975,Thistle Euston, The bathroom shower was not adjustable they didn t have any shower caps I struggled to have a shower without getting my hair wet , The staff were extremely helpful professional and kind
295976,Thistle Euston, The food via room service was really not great I ordered a warm goats cheese and beetroot salad it was mediocre at best and my husband ordered a chicken and Stuffing sandwich which was terrible I was shop bought thin brown bread with green gooey Stuffing and disappointing to say the least We wouldn t have paid that much had we known that was the result , Bed was really big and comfy The staff were great and accommodating considering my husband was on crutches They upgraded our room as a result to allow us to have more space 
295977,Thistle Euston, There was only a wooden door between another room That was unbelievablely bad I could hear ppl really clear and loud Nice location but poor room for real , Close to rail station
295978,Thistle Euston, Nothing, Location was very convieniant especially liked the left luggage facility The hotel was clean and comfortable The real stars of the hotel are the staff everyone we met from reception to check out were pleasant and efficient The bar tender on Saturday night was amazing and made the best Irish coffees It was my friends birthday and she found a hand written note wishing her happy birthday and a box of chocolates in the room 
295979,Thistle Euston, Room was not too good very dark and next to a service door elevator noisy in the morning Shower was bonkers powerful with the widest ever spray water everywhere , Ideal location
295980,Thistle Euston, The bed was very uncomfortable making it difficult to sleep The mattress was very bouncy and hard with springs digging in Each time either of us moved in bed we woke the other up as it was so bouncy , Great location Surprisingly quiet
295981,Thistle Euston, Breakfast wasn t the best and I think we may have been charged more than agreed price however waiting on bank transfer to confirm , Fantastic location for our purpose
295982,Thistle Euston, Poor TV reception if that is important to you and either the air conditioning or plumbing or heating system was very noisy with sporadic episodes of loud humming clanking during the night , The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was excellent 
295983,Thistle Euston, The bathroom in our room had mould on tiles looked pretty worn only negative really , The room was fab and the breakfast area relaxing and plentiful 
295984,Thistle Euston, Only negative was the size of our room but we didn t spend much time on it , Very good breakfast plenty of choice prepared well Very friendly helpful staff 
295985,Thistle Euston, Breakfast was a little expensive so we didn t add it to our stay but I can t speak to it s quality We had lunch in the restaurant and that was lovely , Everything was great The staff were friendly the place was clean and it was located very closely to Euston Station It was great 
295986,Thistle Euston, A little bit noise environment from outside and neighborhood room Housekeeping service too early and always came back and knock the door again if you refuse the service once ,No Positive
295987,Thistle Euston,No Negative, Travelled down on Wednesday 22nd March Was my daughters 18th birthday She s a bit of a trainspotter we got the room we requested which I can t thank the thistle Euston enough for this The beds are so comfy The hotel is located right next to train station so was ideal Look forward to coming back 
295988,Thistle Euston, Fairly noisy from people coming and going in hallways so disturbed sleep somewhat Hazard of lots of hotels I suppose Didn t find tea coffee until just about to checkout it was in a drawer with dark label on it Maybe clearer signage Had assumed there was none , Fabulous location for Euston Station only 2 minute walk Very comfy bed Excellent if slightly overpriced breakfast lots of choice and well stocked 
295989,Thistle Euston, Wafer thin walls Room near the stairs heard noises and people talking every time they walked past our door until gone 2am Did raise with reception, Location
295990,Thistle Euston, There was an office for staff on first floor located just across from our room There was 2 female staff members there from 7 30am on Sunday morning laughing and talking very loudly which woke both myself and husband Our room must have been above the staff entrance or smoke area because we could also hear staff going in and out loudly also Not what you want at 7 30am on a Sunday morning Rooms are a bit tired looking have not been brought up to date but clean and tidy, The size of bed was great Kingside and comfy The hotel was bright and very inviting 
295991,Thistle Euston, Rates are high but this is the case for most London hotels , Comfortable clean room Later than usual check out midday Quiet bedroom despite being within short walking distance of Euston Station Small nearby park with play areas 
295992,Thistle Euston, Coffee express machine but no sachets to use when I woke up Glasses where stained at the base inside The room I had was so loud for outside noise and the bed was really uncomfortable , Reception lady was polite and patient
295993,Thistle Euston, Bathroom especially toilet and sink and bath quite dirty Lots of dirty hairs and black stuff floor very sticky with bits all over it , Staff very friendly and location excellent
295994,Thistle Euston, Nothing really Perhaps a toaster at breakfast would ensure fresh toast instead of pre made on the buffet , Friendly helpful staff in particular Neeraj who looked after us in the bar and restaurant Consideration given to my sister who is disabled 
295995,Thistle Euston, There was a self serve costa coffee down at reception but when we went to get one it said for functions events etc If you wanted one ask for help but cost 4 a coffee No, 4 min walk from Euston station Bed comfy Great shower Good clean hotel Nice staff and we left our luggage till we had to go home Which was a bonus 
295996,Thistle Euston, The room was comfy but very basic communal areas restaurant bar lobby and stairs all looked very tired and shabby Was not a cheap option and can find far better places for the same or less money, Location great if arriving on train to Euston if not then there are far better locations
295997,Thistle Euston, I didn t like the fact I was mislead about breakfast and charged 24 extra when I didn t eat breakfast and then when I questioned this I was spoken to like an idiot by the staff The bathroom needs to have a vent as it got uncomfortably hot very quickly when showering The television didn t work in the room and there was a doer leading to the next room which made the noise from next door very loud I have already complained to thistle directly and I want my money back absolutely disgraceful , The location is ideal as it s so close to the train station
295998,Thistle Euston, Not much really although it would be good if you installed a cashpoint the Ibis up the road has one I went to the lounge bar for dinner although the staff were very friendly I sat there for an unacceptably long time with no one taking any notice of me until I finally attracted their attention Not a good impression , The friendliness and efficiency of the staff Tea coffee etc in room very generous Air conditioning easy to manage

296050,Thistle Euston, It s an impersonal corporate pile that s been cobbled together from more than one building and in the older wing beware of the split floors where luggage has to be carried either up or down a flight of stairs , A great location for the traveller arriving at Euston the Thistle Euston is less than two minutes easy stroll from the Melton Street exit go out the side next to the police post to avoid the front exit steps if you have luggage and an excellent base for central London with buses running past the back of the hotel 5 minutes north to Camden and 5 minutes south to Bloomsbury and the underground Northern line at Euston Rooms are an adequate size for a London hotel clean and well equipped but look rather tired and well used The extra cost full English buffet breakfast buffet is good value and offers a good selection of cooked and cold items very busy and the staff are clearly working at full stretch all the time leave your table for more than two minutes and your seat will have gone

296055,Thistle Euston, Like all London Hotels the cost for staying is high and it was just a standard room I was in a basement room next to a park so although it wasn t noisy at night the thought of someone being outside the window was unnerving If I had been on my own I would have asked to be moved to a higher floor,No Positive
296056,Thistle Euston, THere was an ever rotating group at th efront desk interns trainees and one senior staffer This reduced potential for friendliness and led to long lines at check in Fairly isolated , Although next to the railway line it is well insulated from noise There is a pretty small park adjacent Some of the staff went way beyond duty to help us Breakfast was good and WIFI worked well Close to Euston station
296057,Thistle Euston, Was very quiet in the hotel itself but unfortunately we were kept awake by loud dance music from a nearby night club or somewhere downstairs in the hotel , Surprisingly spacious room for London Lovely comfy bed fluffy towels
296058,Thistle Euston, Room 306 was tiny the toilet didnt flush correctly you couldnt have the bathroom door ajar because the steam could set the fire alarm off and with it shut there was no ventilation so everything gets soaked There was a joining door to another room which you could hear people through The tv remote hadnt been cleaned for years and was disgusting also the tv freeview had no menu option and didnt have half the channels The chef was the most cheerful person in the hotel , Breakfast was good
296059,Thistle Euston, Access to Room 497 unexpected flight of stairs after exiting lift to 4th floor Check in staff didn t indicate that we had to take the stairs to the room particularly when we had 2 large suitcases plus hand luggages No luggage rack in the room and bathroom was too small Had stay in room much larger compared to similar rate within London , Close proximity to San Pancras Station if applicable 
296060,Thistle Euston, the check in out que could be improved , as I was alone travller for one night the toiletries list was welome and tea coffee was more than adequate I would recommend this hotel for business or pleasure 
296061,Thistle Euston, The room was a bit small but its London there was no shower gel in the bathroom only one sliver of soap for 2 people so we used the shampoo The breakfast was a bit mass catering but the manager was very kind let me take a tray for my daughter , The staff were all very friendly and really helpful and made us feel very welcome The location is excellent a couple of mins walk from the station entrance but right next to a park on a no entry road so very quiet for London Very comfortable nights sleep 
296062,Thistle Euston, A staff worker walked in whilst I was sleeping room service were not answering to the point I had to go downstairs myself I feel like I could ve had better service for my money, The room was clean
296063,Thistle Euston, Breakfast would like to see more healthy options such as smoked salmon on the breakfast menu But what was available was excellent and plentiful , Convenient for London Euston and excellent transport hub for getting around London Level of comfort Bed extra comfortable Stylish d cor Staff outstanding customer service Room service provided the same menu as offered in the restaurant and therefore for a solo traveller eating in the room made a good alternative without having to compromise on the choices available excellently timed too in delivery Food in general very good

296065,Thistle Euston,No Negative, Staff smiled and were very obliging especially in the bar and particularly in the breakfast restaurant Thanks to the housekeeping staff who made up the bed while were were at breakfast for three mornings running
296066,Thistle Euston, Honestly cannot think of anything , Dale was particularly friendly however all the staff were fantastic Helped with directions arranged transport etc I had a single room which was spacious and comfortable I am from South Africa so the exchange rate always hits us so the price is a little bit more than I pay in SA 150 pounds per night
296067,Thistle Euston, This is not a 4 star hotel The room is small in the bathroom of our double room you can not stand together to brush the teeth Or you have to crawl into the shower I let myself be guided by the fancy photos and high discount but I have since found out that the rooms always are sold off For this price you can find much better hotels in London , Location
296068,Thistle Euston, Room far too small Room was adjoining a second room walls paper thin Room far too compact for comfort This was my 3rd visit to the Hotel but by far the most disappointing , Convenient location
296069,Thistle Euston, Front desk too many interns and trainees although one of them Una went the extra mile and is destined for a great career , excellent breakfast buffet

296074,Thistle Euston, The WiFi was horrible the TV volume was too quiet even on full blast the air conditioning vents were filthy no refrigerator no fan in the bathroom so everything got all wet from the steam, The room was spacious
296075,Thistle Euston, Minor complaint about 2 90 for a lime and soda in the restaurant but trivial compared with everything else , Good location and very pleasant staff Everything you would expect from a Thistle hotel by way of facilities and cleanliness 
296076,Thistle Euston, Why oh why do hotels think that having Sky News on the telly at 12 o clock at night is a good idea I go away for a break and it s bad enough at breakfast time but at the end of the day the last thing I want when winding down is murder mayhem and politics Stick on a music channel or turn it off , Clean Good breakfast Staff helpful 
296077,Thistle Euston, Single room far too small house keeping walking straight into room at 0830 on a Saturday morning without knocking or at anytime not acceptable otherwise good hotel , all ok see below
296078,Thistle Euston, Ok if I had to say what would I like better it would be eating in the hotel could be better food was reasonable my grand child loved the burger over all no complaints, The room was good bed comfortable bathroom clean good facilities
296079,Thistle Euston, I had to book an extra night through the hotel and they told me they had taken payment when I checked out I was told the room HADN T been paid for despite giving all card info to hotel staff directly during the booking phone call I therefore had an unexpected extra payment of a room that I was told had been paid for , The bed was amazingly comfy staff very friendly and the food breakfast was lovely The location is absolutely brilliant a 5 min walk from Euston Station

296088,Thistle Euston, Good hotel for business travel If I had been on holiday I probably would have been willing to sacrifice convenience for a little more charm , If you need convenient access to Euston station London Underground Heathrow which I did this can t be beat 
296089,Thistle Euston, The room we were given not the room itself being a problem but where it was situated drafts from other door being opened and closed caused our room door to bang continuously very stressful and young child unable to sleep properly , Staff were so friendly and hotel breakfast was brilliant

296094,Thistle Euston, The room wasn t that special it was basic which is OK but it really doesn t give a good impression when there is a coffee ring on one of the sides They could have re varnished it or replaced it It was a longer walk from the station than I expected ,No Positive
296095,Thistle Euston, There was nothing we didn t enjoy about our stay at this hotel , Lovely comfortable big beds in a quiet location very close to Euston station The staff were very helpful and approachable our room was even decorated as my husband and I were celebrating big birthdays and chocolates were left in our room a lovely touch thankyou

296099,Thistle Euston, The lifts are quite small and as the hotel is quite busy you can end up mega cramped in or having to wait longer than I m used to from other hotels , Comfortable room clean conveniently located for station and other attractions Nespresso machine was fun Even though room had view onto Euston train tracks it was still quiet Best blackout curtains yet 
296100,Thistle Euston, The shower door didn t close well the bathroom sink seemed a little blocked as Water took long time to run away But overall beautiful bathroom Not the hotel fault but guests were noisy at 1 30am slamming doors etc , Very soft bed sheets nice size room which provides all those little added touches you need the air con control on wall was good

296105,Thistle Euston, Rooms were quite small mainly because of the big bed which wasn t as comfortable as it looked , Great location with euston station a short walk up the road

296111,Thistle Euston, We spent the first night in a room which was facing an inner courtyard at the back of the hotel At 6 30am some of the hotel staff were starting their shifts and coming in via their entrance this was not a public path They were really shouting outside so much so we were woken up and this went on for around 20 mins The first room we were in was dark and had what looked like some damp in the corner This room needs refurbishing I also found some pubic hair in the shower when we arrived And there was gunk dust under the beds The TV was old small and several of the channels didn t work properly , Fantastic location right by Euston station but no noise from trains Only half an hour walk to Tottenham Court Road etc The staff were absolutely lovely really made the stay When we had an issue with noise on the first night they offered to change our room straight away And gave us two free drinks from the bar we chose coffee which was a nice touch The room from the first night was not great but the second night was much better looked out over a lovely quiet garden Comfy beds and decent working shower The tea making amenities were appreciated too Check in and out process were easy 
296112,Thistle Euston, A shower with more than one option for position and temperature , Staff are smart well informed and helpful but unobtrusive Despite being next to a main rail terminus no disturbance from outside noise 
296113,Thistle Euston, Perfect exceeded expectations, Excellent service in the brassiere at breakfast time The manger Shihab and manageress Agnes were both quite exceptional especially under extreme pressures the service we received from these 2 made us feel so very special so a big thank you from the Sheffield Wednesday supporters
296114,Thistle Euston, The room was very cramped and there was little space for cases It s very much a hotel for the business traveler with single occupancy , The hotel s proximity to the Eurostar Terminal 
296115,Thistle Euston, We booked 2 rooms for the same price and one was considerably bigger than the other It was a little pricey as breakfast was extra , Location was excellent The beds were very comfortable Breakfast was amazing Staff were extremely helpful 
296116,Thistle Euston, Bigger lounge area away from the entrance The bathroom was very small and soon became very overheated and full of condensation after showering , Location was very handy for the station and staff allowed us to leave our suitcases at the hotel after booking out our train was not until 8pm 
296117,Thistle Euston, The extractor fan in the bathroom wasn t working so it got a bit steamy , Pleasant and helpful staff clean comfortable room Nice breakfast 
296118,Thistle Euston, Squeaky floor boards small room no view no breakfast included 12 hard to flush toilet this is what we paid for 184 for 1 night Overall I think you could do better if you book early enough we couldn t , The bed was moderately confy there were tee and coffee making facilities the location is relatively good not the surroundings the lift was working fine 
296119,Thistle Euston, Executive room was tired and small not worth extra money Bar food was poor quality breakfast no communication from staff Hard to find hotel, Cleanliness of room Quality of breakfast Comfortable bed Lovely reception
296120,Thistle Euston, As it was labeled a business hotel I expected to be able to print documents etc But no the ladies at reception insisted I had to email them the documents as there was no other computer I was flabbergasted and asked if there was any other way she said Well you don t see a printer in your room do you How is that a response to a guest Finally over the phone she said I could print without sending an email So I brought my USB drive and then the other ladies there were 4 in total at reception said no I couldn t I must email them the documents They were also not able to tell me if there was somewhere else I could go to to get my documents printed via a USB drive After much hassling I was finally told I could log into my own email and print it off the reception computer I compromised as there was no other way All of this meant I had multiple trips to the reception and irked some other guests who thought I was cutting the que at reception One guest told me off and I was not in the mood to explain This experience on the first morning of a week s stay really left a bitter taste in my mouth Also on the same day while dining with a guest in the restaurant the waiter mixed the orders of myself and my colleague up we both ordered steak rare versus medium As we were having a business meeting we did not want to make a fuss and it was particularly frustrating to eat food that is not to one s taste Lastly this happened on just one of the days but the housekeeping did not top up the toiletries I didn t raise this point however as I did not want to call up reception again The only reason I didn t move to a different hotel was because of the location and because I was with colleagues who were staying at the same hotel , The reception let me check in very early as they had a room available 
296121,Thistle Euston, I would have liked a fitness room However there is a university a few blocks away where you can use their exercise facility for 5 pounds I used that facility and it was very good , Comfortable bed 
296122,Thistle Euston, Breakfast staff weren t overly attentive , The staff very kindly tried to facilitate us with a room to our liking when we checked in earlier than expected 
296123,Thistle Euston, The room was small double bed but pushed against the wall so had to climb over the bed to get in or out which is not ideal if your partner is sleeping, Hotel was in a good location with a nice choice for breakfast
296124,Thistle Euston, The original room was not up to standard several of the amenities were not working and the facilities were not as advertised on the website , Received a room upgrade following a complaint to the Duty Manager We also received chocolates and drink vouchers The justified complaint was handled in a professional manner and with good grace 
296125,Thistle Euston, The bed was extremely hard it was 2 beds pushed together and when sleeping with my girlfriend was very uncomfortable there was air conditioning but no heating so the room was freezing at times and the room looked nothing like it did on the website I felt very angry with the way the room looked and over all had a bad experience due to the room not being the same as described I booked the deluxe double bedroom there was nothing deluxe about it Also our view was other people s room windows have been considering calling trading standards to get my money back as I payed almost 300 for this crap room for 2 nights breakfast not included , I liked the free ice cream 
296126,Thistle Euston, not a particularly pleasant building or area Breakfast too expensive Not just this hotel but all hotels 20 for breakfast is silly 10 max is sensible , Conveniant for mainline stations Staff always polite 
296127,Thistle Euston, The rooms are old and the bathroom were moldy and doors wasn t easy to close and open The rooms are tiny and not much space to move around The hotel needs a major update I won t categorized as 4 stars hotel due to the cleanliness moldy bathroom of the room broken items in the room cost of the hotel is very expensive , The staff were friendly and helpful The location of the hotel was very convenient to the Euston Underground Station which was great Really like the fact luggage storage max for 5 days at no cost I did stayed at the hotel 3 times flying back to London to the convenience of the location and luggage storage 
296128,Thistle Euston, The only disappointment in the Executive room I didn t expect the fairly large marks on the walls in the room the room looked like it required a little touching up , The bed in the Executive room 2nd floor was super comfy and King size The room was spacious and light Fabulous coffee tea facilities The staff on reception were extra helpful and friendly 
296129,Thistle Euston, Only that the price was higher than previously, Location friendly staff park outside window Early check in we arrived at 2pm and could get in the room brilliant 
296130,Thistle Euston, No tea or coffee facilities Damaged tiles in bathroom TV signal not good Bath towels on request Credit application to purchase extras in room etc , Leaving
296131,Thistle Euston, Not the nicest of walks from the main road past the side of station ok by day but not great as a single woman after dark , Service with a smile Didn t feel disadvantaged booking a single room so often they put you in the broom cupboard but the room was good 
296132,Thistle Euston, Nothing , Every member of staff that we came in to contact with were so courteous and hekpful its been a long time since I could say that It created a wonderful atmosphere 
296133,Thistle Euston, The room was freezing cold but as I only arrived in it after midnight after a long and arduous check in process as our short notice bookings had not been efficiently transferred across by booking com I didn t have either the time or inclination to work out how to operate the heating Bed and pillows were remarkably uncomfortable but again too late to do anything about it Left before breakfast to get early train , nothing at all 
296134,Thistle Euston, We were asked if we wanted an upgraded for 30 I asked if that was for 2 people for 2 nights and the receptionist said yes What a surprise I got today when I saw that they had charged 60 Now that is waht you call being ripped off, Location
296135,Thistle Euston, Although we were in a non smoking hotel the corridors smelled quite smokey and this affected us Some residents must have been smoking , did not eat here
296136,Thistle Euston, Rooms cleaned mid afternoon rather than by midday which would have been preferable TV contains limited channels , Really comfy beds decent room size and superb location 
296137,Thistle Euston, rooms have carpet bleh thats is old fashioned and unhygienic its time for a bit of an upgrade The bar could become a little cosier , the sausages at breakfast were scrumlicious Staff really helpful and polite Nothing was to much 
296138,Thistle Euston, Nothing at all , Very convenient for station next door plenty of places to eat within walking distance room was comfortable and spotless not the biggest room but enough space for us as we were out most of the day Bed comfy fabulous shower Unobtrusive polite friendly and helpful staff when we needed them which wasn t often would definitely stay here again 
296139,Thistle Euston, nothing to dislike , Receptionist was friendly and efficient Bedroom was fairly large and beds were comfortable Good standard of cleanliness Excellent location and was quiet considering hotel was minutes from Euston Station 
296140,Thistle Euston, I was first booked into a room that overlooked the back of buildings and had no bath even though at booking it said there would be one which I needed to bathe an injury When I brought it up they were super helpful though The walls were a bit thin and could hear neighbours but usual hotel stuff , The location is really good The staff were really friendly and helpful Close to some nice food places 
296141,Thistle Euston, Hotel looks a little tired from the outside May be a wash or a lick of paint but the inside is fine and that s more important, The staff were very friendly and efficient Checking in and out was quick and simple Thank you
296142,Thistle Euston, At 5pm on first day bedroom had not been cleaned Asked reception for milk to be brought to room This never arrived Mattress was in a poor condition , Found this hotel via the secret escape application The price was good Hotel building is pleasant Breakfast has all that one can expect 
296143,Thistle Euston, No breakfast included in the price The plug on the kettle overheated and had to be replaced this was used on two occasions before we realised it was hazardous to us and the building , The layout and modern look of the hotel The adequate space in the double room and the number of plug sockets 
296144,Thistle Euston, I ve been in few lower stars rate places and this 4 star was the worst one ever hair in the sink no fridge in room Old TV with no web browser and option to connect Laptop to TV Super loud air conditioning Duvet super heavy Check out at 12 and room service trying to get in at 9 30 There is nothing positive from that place other than location,No Positive
296145,Thistle Euston, Room was incredibly small Would say its a 3 hotel rather than a 4 Room was basic but clean and has everything you need for a comfortable stay , The staff were fantastic especially the lady in charge of Brassiere 43 on Saturday morning 2 4 16 She went above and beyond to help my daughter who has Coeliac Disease Would highly recommend this hotel Excellent location 3 minute walk from Euston Station Lots of places to eat close by and a Sainsburys Boots and the usual station shops across in Euston 
296146,Thistle Euston, I can t believe breakfast can t be room service I ve had room service in Brighton thistle so I don t get it why we couldn t have it even had a problem with the side of the room as its been great in the past but this time our room was so small plus was only other half birthday we felt we ve been put in a room nobody wanted the kettle wasn t working but could say reception change it straight away, Well staff is great and helpful
296147,Thistle Euston, I was expecting more the bathroom was tiny and for a dulux room I didn t feel like I should of payed extra it wS a present for my boyfriend so I felt disappointed also I asked for a park view We got a view of the train station , The location was good
296148,Thistle Euston, The only reason this hotel is not getting a 10 is because at the moment i arrived i stopped by the lounge to have dinner I was told to have a sit but they never came to the table to offer anything not even water nor to take my order The staff at the lounge was very inattentive I finally left and had dinner somewhere else , Everything was great I definitely recommend this hotel The hotel staff at the reception was very helpful and polite Very well located 
296149,Thistle Euston,No Negative, Was a lovely clean hotel and the staff were very friendly and helpfull Was a lovely touch to leave my daughter a birthday card and chocolates in the room 
296150,Thistle Euston, Check in took wayyy longer than it should have because they put a newbie behind the counter When someone who knew what they were doing stepped in it was a breeze , I love the room and the bed It was so comfy I was tempted to stay in all day 
296151,Thistle Euston, I did not stay long enough to dislike anything It was very expensive for what I got but that is always the case in London , I was only there for one night en route to Euro star so I only got a brief impression but my room was fine and the staff seemed nice
296152,Thistle Euston,No Negative, Loved the extra attention It was our anniversary and with two young kids at home it s a very rare night away and we had drink vouchers and chocolates thank you
296153,Thistle Euston, Thought the room was looking a little tired Wall paint was chipped and scuffed water marks on furniture chipped tile in bathroom and the TV was not working properly , This hotel had everything you need for a comfortable night stay It was clean nice towels in the shower room a hairdryer a tea kettle and coffee maker with a variety of tea and coffee flavours I liked the location and the staff was polite The best part was the free fast Wifi 
296154,Thistle Euston, There was nothing I didn t like, On arrival the staff were really helpful and friendly and they continued to be throughout the stay The room was very comfortable and we slept really well As it was close to Euston it was really convenient 
296155,Thistle Euston, There is nothing that could be bettered , The hotel has a superb location the room was clean and very comfortable Near the station but could hear no noise The staff could ask for no more from them and the food was wonderful Nothing was to much trouble 
296156,Thistle Euston, The breakfast delivered to the room could be better The tea was quite cold and the breakfast was not hot enough As the rest of the stay was enjoyable and the staff were really good I let it slide , The room was spacious the bed was comfy staff were very helpful and friendly and the room had excellent facilities provided 
296157,Thistle Euston, A minor issue but sound isolation from rooms is not that great could often hear people chatting in the corridor , Very large bed and spacious room early check in varied breakfast free upgrade Location is close to well connected station 
296158,Thistle Euston,No Negative, Excellent customer service had a call week prior of stopping asking if there was anything I required needed during my stay and a service call a few days after my stay asking if everything was OK would definitely recommend
296159,Thistle Euston,No Negative, Great hotel excellent location near to main station The bed was super comfy breakfast buffet delicious and room service too Relaxed environment very friendly staff Highly recommend 
296160,Thistle Euston, Not much space round bed Noisy in room we stayed Could hear all conversation of business man next door , Convenience near Euston for onward travel Good breakfast 
296161,Thistle Euston, I can t think of anything we were unhappy with , Staff were so nice and accommodating You can not beat this location especially for transport links The bed was comfy and there was an amazing shower Finally love the free wifi without having the hassle of setting up an account like other hotels Definitely recommend the Euston Thistle and will come back 
296162,Thistle Euston, The bed sheet was a little too rough on my skin The walls were too thin I could hear everything that was going on in the room next to mine , The staff were very friendly and helpful The room was nice and pleasant Did not sample the meals but have been informed that it s good Got my room on a bargain with booking com and will use this in the future 
296163,Thistle Euston, The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night and disturbed my stay hiwever this was just an unfortunate one off event , Good location and extremely friendly staff 
296164,Thistle Euston, Breakfast was very busy and I was unable to get a second cup of coffee , Really handy location Outside of hotel doesn t look particularly good and I was concerned but internally the hotel is great 
296165,Thistle Euston, Overpriced I booked an executive king and ended up with what should have been a standard room there was nothing executive about it Also there was horrible black mould in the corner of the shower , Staff were very friendly
296166,Thistle Euston, Only that I asked for a wake up call was promised this would happen but it did not Otherwise everything was great , Quiet comfortable spacious room and very convenient location 
296167,Thistle Euston, There was a big queue for breakfast but they did their best to seat people as quickly as possible, The staff were very attentive called before the stay and made some changes to our booking without fuss The checkout was well organised too Restaurant staff at breakfast were very helpful when things had run out 
296168,Thistle Euston, Bar food Haddock chips served was pretty tasteless Fish batter was soggy not crispy However spaghetti carbonara with mushrooms was delicious We were not charged for fish chips , Very welcoming staff nothing too much trouble on reception in bar and restaurant Rooms very comfortable everything you needed Good beds even a Nespresso coffee machine sadly no George Clooney Would certainly return also recommend 
296169,Thistle Euston, Staff had hard to understand accents admittedly more my fault than theirs founds pubic hair in draws bed was a bit hard view from Windows not very exciting was still a good hotel experience over all just having to nit pick , Included buffet breakfast was lovely room was huge hotel was well designed in general 
296170,Thistle Euston, The carpet is pretty old and a bit dirty The toilets are made with poor quality material and there is corrosion in some spots , Mainly the location and the staff
296171,Thistle Euston, Noise that appeared to travel easily through the hotel walls , Manner that staff dealt with issues that arose during our visit Short walk from the Euston station and the underground 
296172,Thistle Euston, Some of the fixtures are showing their age the bathrooms have some cracks in tiles and sanitary ware and the metal framed windows are past their best , The staff are excellent and the hotel is in a surprisingly quiet location We had a deluxe King room it wasn t massive but it had everything we needed for a good price 
296173,Thistle Euston,No Negative, Breakfast on Sunday morning was very busy queuing to get in but the staff handled it really well good quick turnaround of tables and got people seated fairly quickly with a mimosa to compensate for the wait classy touch 
296174,Thistle Euston, Long walk to the room and down steps with heavy bags was annoying Very very noisy air con unit which constantly clicked on and off waking me up Traffic noise noisy neighbours and a house brick for a pillow , Easy check in clean comfortable room 
296175,Thistle Euston, TV reception was poor and the lifts were extremely slow and seemed to have a mind of their own, Breakfast was very good room was spacious and the beds were comfortable
296176,Thistle Euston, TV picture was rather unclear Only watched for few mins so didn t mention it sure it would have been sorted if i had , Staff couldn t do enough for my 8 year old girl all very friendly and helpful Room was a good sized twin and very comfortable 
296177,Thistle Euston, When first arriving the view of the front of the hotel looked a little dated and didn t replicate what the interior was like from the moment you walked through the the door , Our stay here was brilliant We were looked after straight away The staff were friendly and helpful The breakfast was amazing and the room was very modern and clean with an excellent bed and shower Definitely be staying here again and highly recommend it 
296178,Thistle Euston, The restaurant was closed in the evening so we had to eat our meals in the bar area I believe it had been closed for several eveings due to staff shortages At breakfast there was a long queue of people waiting to be seated Some offers on the menu not available , The bed was very comfortable also a nice quiet room with view over the park 
296179,Thistle Euston, You could not move in the bedrooms let alone put your makeup on or do your hair You could not lie down in the bath cracked tiles in the bathroom card for lights fell off the wall You could not move in the breakfast room , The food was very good
296180,Thistle Euston, Expensive but same as other hotels in the same area , The croissants were good Having shortbreads with the tea and kettle is a very good idea After an wine incident at the restaurant everything was taken care of 
296181,Thistle Euston, The only thing we didnt like was going home , Was impressed mostly by the staff who were helpful smart and polite Comfortable room and v clean was travelling with my 20 year old daughter and never once felt intimidated or unwelcome Excellent breakfast choice and lovely evening meal Loved the location and will be using this again 
296182,Thistle Euston, Noisy early in the morning time from house keeping Restaurant staff comprehension of English was limited at times, Staff were really helpful at reception Good location rooms were comfortable
296183,Thistle Euston, Reception bar and breakfast not aware I mobilised with a crutch and I never had an offer to carry my drink to the table breakfast buffet or bag to my room very poor, Comfy bed
296184,Thistle Euston, The wifi didn t work anywhere in the hotel As a business hotel that s a huge problem and the staff didn t understand what was wrong or how to fix it , The location was perfect within walking distance from Heuston 
296185,Thistle Euston, The food was very good at dinner and breakfast No drinks making facilities in the room , It was clean and friendly Nice sized room Drinking water in the room 
296186,Thistle Euston, Maybe a bigger variety of cheese for breakfast would be nice, Bed very comfy Staff were very nice and the room was nice and warm Fire alarm went off at 1 30 am but the manager of the hotel left an apology letter which I thought was very nice 
296187,Thistle Euston, Only one shower cap for two women , The twin bedded room worked well for two women friends There was space for us to have personal privacy when required and a good space to relax 
296188,Thistle Euston,No Negative, Staff very friendly and helpful nothing too much trouble I ve stayed several times now and it would be my first choice if travelling to Euston 
296189,Thistle Euston, Queue at breakfast but it was a Sunday morning and there was an offer of free breakfast with the room No fan in the bathroom so took a long time to clear , Comfortable beds Efficient check in and out Good heating air conditioning in the room The heating was turned on before we arrived which meant that the room was warm on arrival Excellent value Right next to Euston and easy access to the University and St Pancras if necessary 
296190,Thistle Euston, The queue for breakfast we waited for30 minutes in a queue that went up the stairs , The closeness to the railway station friendly staff comfortable room 
296191,Thistle Euston, Restaurant closed in the evenings and very busy due to understaffing Had to queue for breakfast no seats no glasses no cereal bowls etc Menu advertising steaks at 17 95 outside hotel were not available on the menu and when we asked staff said only available between 5 7 but no mention of this on menu and not listed outisde There were no time constraints on the advertisement outside so this should clearly have been available Also fish on menu should have been available on Fry day at 13 95 including drink but this was not available either Also several dishes not available from the menu no lamb tagine no chicken no risotto Poor heating control in bedroom kept reverting back to cooling despite help from reception staff , Comfortable bed and quiet room Staff helpful 
296192,Thistle Euston, the only downside is there is no gym at the hotel but very friendly staff member explained there is one nearby should I need to use it , Extremely friendly staff very convenient location clean rooms and nice breakfast 
296193,Thistle Euston, Got service email before I arrived asking if I need anything I am perfectly capable of asking for anything I need and I don t want to be bothered with useless email Had to endure a long tedious set spiel from the woman checking me in trying to sell me a more expensive room I hate having to listen to a sales pitch to check in , Extremely comfortable room Excellent temperature controls that responded quickly Very good bed Shower had good water pressure which is not a given in London Quiet even though it was near a big rail station The restaurant was closed but the food at the lounge was very good even working around my food sensitivity 
296194,Thistle Euston, Nothing to report, I found no faults at all The staff were great the facilities were far far better than many hotels I ve stopped at in the uk and Europe a complimentary drink I had a G T in the bar was a lovely gesture 
296195,Thistle Euston, Breakfast area was really busy , Good location for central London quiet Rooms really good probably better value at the price we paid than its neighbour the Ibis
296196,Thistle Euston, The beds were quite hard and rolled around Obvious water damage from leaking shower The restaurant was closed and although the bar served food it was too busy to get a table No taxis available next morning , The welcome from reception was great Very friendly greeting It was nice that we were given a higher floor overlooking a park The room was bigger than I had expected the bathroom itself compact but functional The shower was lovely and large although it has had obvious leaking problems Easy walk to a wide variety of ethnic style restaurants The breakfast was great This was perfect for the one night as we had an early start on the Eurostar next morning 
296197,Thistle Euston, Only downside was the room we stayed in had the double bed pushed against the wall so if person next to wall got up they had to climb over other , Staff facilities and location are all spot on 
296198,Thistle Euston, Restaurant closed except for breakfast during our stay Food was available in the lobby , Location good for travel around London Small rooms but very clean 
296199,Thistle Euston, There were a few little missed spots of dust and such in the bathroom but nothing I would be alarmed about , Fabulous location right near Euston central to several business locations and Euston station obviously Very easy to get to any Tube line Room was bright and comfortable staff very friendly and free wifi was actually fast 
296200,Thistle Euston, The morning coffee however was way too strong and not very nice But the breakfast was perfect , All the staff were very friendly During a fire alarm evacuation they were calm and helpful directing the everybody where to go The room was very neat and clean It was also very quiet in the room 
296201,Thistle Euston, See above , I was in a disabled room which I wasn t told about It was noisy as you could hear people talking in reception and in the bar It did quieten down at midnight but I dread to think what it would be like over the weekend I paid a discounted rate which was still expensive You get much better hotels at better prices in the North Of England 
296202,Thistle Euston, Room was shabby and bathroom needs redecorating Heating system didn t work Heaters were in the room but it made air very dry and uncomfortable to sleep in, location
296203,Thistle Euston,No Negative, The staff were fantastic and welcoming and always willing to help the hotel is very clean and very comfortable with all essentials The breakfast was lovely and the dining area was very clean the evening meals were also very lovely and there wasn t a wait overall very clean quick tasty and polite staff The hotel itself is situated right by euston train and underground stations which was fantastic as me and my partner could take a 2 minuet walk to the station and was able to get anywhere in London in minutes via the tube remember to get a oyster card tho would recommend this hotel to anyone 
296204,Thistle Euston, Only downfall was that the room was quite cold, Staff where very welcoming and helpful when we were unsure of how to get around My boyfriend even commented on how friendly and welcoming the staff where 
296205,Thistle Euston, Poor view overlooking railway track but wasn t too worried as we just stayed here for our night out which was just round the corner from the jazz cafe perfect for us , Lovely friendly staff great location lovely breakfast great secure parking just down the road 2 minute walk from euston station
296206,Thistle Euston, Bar closed early and turned away 8 customers in 3 separate parties customers sitting along from us had to move due to flies it was nice to see in the bathroom the saver cream and toothbrush and vanity set but because they weren t used on the first day they were taken out the room We have stayed in better 3 stars rooms very small and no mini fridge Definitely not worth the money , Can t think of anything positive
296207,Thistle Euston,No Negative, The hotel being so close to a tube station the friendly helpful staff and everywhere really clean The room had all the extra little touches including free wifi
296208,Thistle Euston,No Negative, Location really good 10 15 minutes walk to St Pancras and just down the road to the Euston underground Nice and clean and breakfast was really nice 
296209,Thistle Euston, NOTHING D, I stayed just a night but the quality of the hotel really shone through My friend and I were so impressed with the friendliness of all of the staff members the receptionist was welcoming the bar staff gave us complimentary prosecco with our pizza and the breakfast staff were efficient yet personal with their service The hotel room was lovely clean and well furnished with modern decoration Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Thistle Euston and we will definitely be staying again the next time we are in London 
296210,Thistle Euston, Noisy Stayed on 2nd floor was woken by what sounded like people dragging chairs this was very early in the morning so could ve been the cleaners also can hear other rooms wardrobe doors slamming did not hear much noise from outside, Location was great Comfy beds
296211,Thistle Euston, The BraissIre 43 restaurant was closed and we had to eat upstairs in the reception area which was really noisy The staff however were friendly and attentitive , The room was small but in a very quite location which was appreciated The room service was really nice and the chap who brought it to us was really nice and helpful 
296212,Thistle Euston, There was a constant wet patch on the carpet just outside the bathroom I suspect a leaking pipe from the shower under the floor as the bathroom floor was not wet and the shower tray drained very slowly Room 419 , Great convenient location comfortable bed quiet room 
296213,Thistle Euston, We had a bit of a problem that took too long for the hotel to solve but when they did it was with much sincerity and apologies , The location is good with easy access to main transport hubs all within walking distance The staff at reception is really friendly and helpful 
296214,Thistle Euston,No Negative, Clean comfortable friendly helpful staff Excellent position for arriving by train as can leave bags on arrival and after check out No need to carry across London 
296215,Thistle Euston, Situated close to Euston station but local area was scruffy and not good at night Room was supposed to be superior but room decor was old and tired The windows were not double glazed and let in both a draught and noise from the rear of the property , Reception staff were very helpful Bathroom had been updated and very good 
296216,Thistle Euston,No Negative, Booked the hotel as a last minute change of accommodation so glad we did The hotel is situated in a great location right next to Euston station a great base for getting around London on the tube The staff were very welcoming allowing us an early check in which was really convenient for us The room was clean and the facilities were really nice great value for money Will definitely be back again 
296217,Thistle Euston, It would be nice to have double glazed windows , Very warm welcome Alexandra was a trainee and was excellent A member of staff also helped us with our bags which was very kind 
296218,Thistle Euston, I did not like the breakfast area as it was located in the basement with no windows It was very crowded and busy , The staff were helpful It was a decent standard of hotel staying for one night
296219,Thistle Euston, The walls were paper thin and we could clearly hear our neighbours talking Also lots of strange noises coming from the heating system The shower had black mould despite the fact the bathroom itself looked quite new No fridge or mini bar in the room The hotel has only 2 small lifts which is not enough for a 360 room hotel , Staff were very friendly Bed was huge 
296220,Thistle Euston, BIG queue for breakfast After a wrangle they refunded our 12x3 breakfast vouchers which were better spent at Garden Caf Regent s Park , Room 438 quiet and overlooked a park Staff left a card and drinks voucher for Wife s birthday a nice touch Great location to our daughter s train stations as well as Zoo shopping zones
296221,Thistle Euston, The breakfast on Sunday morning was very over crowed it took 1 hour to get table and 20 more minutes to get served Staff help full to many people for amount of seats Needs staggered sittings , friendly staff good base to see London
296222,Thistle Euston, Only two lifts in the main entrance which are very small so with cases and large parties it creates a big backlog, Good customer relations contacted by customer relations for any special requests in advance early check in accommodated at 9 15am Great location and no need to take your bag with you on day of departure
