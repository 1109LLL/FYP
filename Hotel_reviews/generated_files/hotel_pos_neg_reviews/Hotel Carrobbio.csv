482594,Hotel Carrobbio, There was nothing that we did not like , When we arrived by car we were exhausted The receptionists at the front desk saw our exhaustion and gave us an upgraded room with a king sized bed and a patio and beautiful bath parked our car for us and prepared us sandwiches in the breakfast area 11 00 p m We have never been in a hotel in the U S in which the staff was so kind and comforting for my husband and me 
482595,Hotel Carrobbio, Away from the nearest metro station Noisy hostel bar next door heard partying to our room each night past midnight, Good location between city center and Porta Ticinese Clean rooms
482596,Hotel Carrobbio, This was rated as a 4 star hotel but was 3 star at best The rooms were small and cramped the bathroom shower was minuscule and leaked water The air conditioner was not programmable and the room was incredibly hot overnight The window had a blackout cover that could not be fully opened so the windows couldn t be opened to provide a breeze or full sunlight The location and price were good so balanced these negative factors somewhat , Location and price
482597,Hotel Carrobbio, In our particular room the shower wasn t high on the wall rather it was best to sit in the bath to use the shower nozzle , Lovely big bed though rather firm Good pillows Very quiet and nice and dark when sleeping Plenty of toiletries 24 hour reception with nice helpful staff with good english Close to plenty of shops and restaurants and a short walk to the main duomo 
482598,Hotel Carrobbio, Internet was accessible only in ground floor Breakfast was in top of the already expensive price , Accommodation was comfortable I didnt have the breakfast The location was good but Milan is a expensive place to cab it from the airport so bus and underground a e good option although time consuming Room was expensive for the quality 
482599,Hotel Carrobbio,No Negative, We booked last minute and received therefore a good price Parking was still possible in their own garage Note that driving out may take some time because cars may have to be moved several times Location is great within 10 mins you arrive at the piazza in front of the Duomo Staff was very pleasant and suggested restaurants and map without our asking 
482600,Hotel Carrobbio, A lot of things didn t work My room smelled like cigarettes some power outlets didn t work the safe didn t work the hairdryer It was uncomfortable that many things were wrong , The location is super convinient Very close to the nice attractions the city has to offer 
482601,Hotel Carrobbio, My room number was 403 till 00 30 the train made a lot of noise after that from 5am the machine of cleaning the street made a lot of noises we didn t sleep there , The location was really perfect
482602,Hotel Carrobbio, Parts of the hotel is cramped as was the room but to be expected as it is in the old center , Loved having a courtyard off the room we stayed at made the room bigger plus the hotel is very charming 
482603,Hotel Carrobbio, Wifi is only available in the lobby There is zero noise insulation especially for bathroom facilities it felt like all the neighbours were taking shower in our room and the tubes made noises as well Somebody s sneezing down the hall was heard crystal clear Person speaking in regular tone of voice on the phone next door every word is heard Breakfast is too expensive There are no spare sockets for charging the gadgets we had to uinplug the TV each time , Very convenient location 10 minutes walk to Duomo Firendly staff 
482604,Hotel Carrobbio, Everything was fine, The hotel is very central and would recommend it to anybody going shopping to Milan Walking distance to Duomo and all shops Also hotel staff were nice and hotel room was clean 
482605,Hotel Carrobbio, Although clean enough rooms are very old toilet seat was chipped a mirror was broken in a corner in the bedroom The internet in the rooms does not exist breakfast unexciting for 10 considering that you are in Italy where food is excellent , The location is very central staff is very kind and professional
482606,Hotel Carrobbio, Saturday evening was a Bar in front of the hotel functioning till late morning hours the people were very loud that I couldn t sleep so well till the Bar closed , The Hotel is really a nice place to stay it is comfortable well equipped and clean The staff are really friendly and the location is perfect 
482607,Hotel Carrobbio, The room was too small and dark No hot water in the early morning Definitely not 4 star material , Very close to shops 10 minutes away from the d uomo on foot 
482608,Hotel Carrobbio, The hotel room was ok clean but wifi didnt work in a room only in lobby no international tv chanels only italian ones tv was too small and set too high very uncomfortable to watch and shower was just too small to fit in , Location was excellent 
482609,Hotel Carrobbio, They did not have WiFi in the room The bedroom had no socket to charge fones They also did not mention on the booking page that there is no breakfast included , The hotel had a nice old medieval type feel 
482610,Hotel Carrobbio, Room was airless Air conditioner was not working properly and too noisy use A lot of mosquitos when you open the window Room window was looking for the aparment shaft since they told its their one of the best room , Location of the hotel is perfect 
482611,Hotel Carrobbio, This place is wonderful However if you don t like a hard bed beware Both the pillows and the mattress are very hard Definitely quite a change for those of us acquainted with a soft mattress and comfy pillows ,No Positive
482612,Hotel Carrobbio,No Negative, Hotel central to the Dom de Milan approx 10min walk in the near the hotel many restaurants Have WiFI in the rooms breakfast was included and good good price performance ratio
482613,Hotel Carrobbio, Food like lunch or evening meal breakfast was far too early for some one who likes to rise after 10am on hols, Our room was very spacious and the jacuzzi bath shower was definitely an added bonus
482614,Hotel Carrobbio, There were mousquitos and nobody could help me I went to get help and I have been told that it was not their business In the morning I explained the situation the only answer was to make me pay for the breakfast and not to write anything about it I absolutely do not recommend this hotel ,No Positive
482615,Hotel Carrobbio, very noisy hostel nearby its like trying to fall asleep while your neighour is having a party The noise continues till 1 2 am rooms are quite small and look rather old fashioned and would benefit from renovation All in all Carrobio looks like a fair 3 star definetly not the 4 star hotel which explains the price that is quite low for such a central location , great location 10 min walk from Duomo a few nice restaurants nearby 5 min walk to an underground parking at Borromeo piazza helpful and polite personnel tidy rooms complimentary drinking water in the rooms
482616,Hotel Carrobbio, Opposite a hostel that was noisy late into the evening Wifi reception poor room was clean but dated toilet flush fell off wall , Good location close to centre
482617,Hotel Carrobbio, The building is old so there is a very slow lift some tortuous halls and small bathrooms Safe too small for a computer , Friendly and very helpful staff Nice charming patio Very good Continental Breakfast with EXCELLENT pastries and cakes Free newspapers available Less than 10 minutes away from Duomo Large balcony with a small table and 2 chairs to enjoy a glass of red wine 
482618,Hotel Carrobbio, The parking was a little confusing and quite small I had to handover my car keys which I was not comfortable with , Staff were friendly and the cleanliness was of high standard 
482619,Hotel Carrobbio, Room is very small also the tv channels are all Italian For the breakfast I prefer to have it outdoor on the garden but that option wasn t available , I like the location as well as the spirit of he hotel I felt that I m in Italy 100 years ago which made me externally happy as I liked boutique hotels price vs the room I got is a bit high 
482620,Hotel Carrobbio,No Negative, The upgrade to the balcony room The plush robe The lovely tub Staff was always pleasant We parked at their garage for a fee and it gave us peace of mind You can walk to Duomo from here 
482621,Hotel Carrobbio, The street is kinda noisy There s a bar near from the hotel It can be a little problem to the first floor , Very nice location near from Duomo and other city points You can walk through all city with no worries Beautiful room big windows and very efficient team 
482622,Hotel Carrobbio, Broken shower Staff offered to change room immediately , The hotel is located very close to Piazza Duomo and very close to shops and restaurants It needs some TLC it s quite old but the staff is very efficient and friendly For a short stay it s ok 
482623,Hotel Carrobbio, Nothing I don t like, Hotel staff are all friendly and nice great help Esp one of the receptionist Fabio he is such a lovely person Location is the best walking distance to duomo Room is clean and cosy bed is comfortable Price was really good Loved my stay and definitely go back to the hotel if staying in Milan 
482624,Hotel Carrobbio, The internet in the rooms unfortunately is not reaching , Very nice hotel in terms of money quality Almost in the middle of Milano Great location only 7 min working distance to Duomo Friendly staff and helpful There is underground parking paid 
482625,Hotel Carrobbio, Get the Jacuzzi running, The staff was extremely friendly When we come back for our second time our bag was already in our room The valet and the breakfast lady were outstanding The reception staff was also extremely polite
482626,Hotel Carrobbio, No wifi reception in the room When we entered the room it smelled very strongly from cigarette smoke When we complained to the front desk he replied that there is nothing he can do about it , Good firm bed nice bathroom 
482627,Hotel Carrobbio, Though there are no scenic city views to be had the hotel is tucked away into one of the best spots in the Old City where Via Torino and Via Porto Ticenese converge in between the Duomo and the great churches of the city If wi fi in your room is important to you specify so in your reservation Otherwise Internet works throughout the public spaces of the hotel , The staff is very friendly and helpful in English and Italian Paola the owner is often on site to complete the picture The rooms are charming and stylishly modern at the same time Marble floors and bathrooms finish the Italian experience and look A wonderfully elegant breakfast buffet kickstarts the morning At the center of classic sites and shopping 
482628,Hotel Carrobbio, Wifi was a little spotty The shower was amazing but lacked a wall support So had to hold it in the hand , Staff were absolutely amazing Went out of their way to help us recommend places to eat and visit Location was right in the middle of Milan 10 minute walk from every major most of them attraction Room that we were assigned was quite large Had a shared terrace as a bonus Toilets were amazing and clean too 
482629,Hotel Carrobbio, There are things I did not like 1 The internet was very slow 2 Nobody told us that at a 4 stars hotel the tourist tax is euro 5 per day and per person adding euro 10 per day to the room rate 3 The receptionist tried to push us to order an unreasonably expensive limousine service at a rate more than double that of Milan public cabs 4 There was only one night stand with one night light for two beds and the second bed was arranged with the pillow on the opposite side of the night stand which was was bit weird 5 There was only a heavy comforter and no light sheet to use even if it is Summer , On an August day when offices shut down for vacation we were able to have a very good rate at this four stars hotel The room had a nice and large balcony 
482630,Hotel Carrobbio, Hotel is very old Had problems with opening the safe Wasn t inform upon check in of breakfast is included or not neither was told I will have to pay extra amount for taxes, Location is good and receptionist who worked in the evenings was very nice and helpful He recommended a wonderful place for dinner not far from the hotel 
482631,Hotel Carrobbio, Breakfast was too expensive , Super clean and big room Lots of perks in wc Has tv Bed is nice I had booked single standard room but I was upgraded for free to a Individual Superior one 
482632,Hotel Carrobbio, Having to hand our room key in each time we left the hotel to go out wasn t ideal Never had that before Rushed to check out before 12 midday by a phone call to our room at 11 30am even though we had double checked the confirmation email info the night before that it was indeed a 12 midday checkout The power shower didn t work properly Sounded like someone was coming in our room all the time due to the thin walls and constant cleaning carts etc outside our corridor room , Good location with a comfy bed all we needed for an unexpected extra nights stay in Milan 
482633,Hotel Carrobbio, Hotel is very old with little or no facilities those that are basic dont even work like shower To add insult one night before going out I fotgot my credit card in the room for which the day later someone made on line purchase using my card , Friendly staff
482634,Hotel Carrobbio, Car park is extremely high parking fee is 30 euro per day which is more expensive than our car rental cost , Location is perfect friendly staff clean rooms 
482635,Hotel Carrobbio, I make mistake by reserved single room and I email ask the hotel to chage to double room She said it is going to be a change in price for the suppliment of 30 Euros night in case you would like to have the double rooom On the other hand they charged me 60 Euros per night which i think it does not make sense So i would like to tell everyone who wanna stay in this hotel beware the hidden pricing , Service is good location is good but if u wanna come this hotel i recommend take exit Doumo better 
482636,Hotel Carrobbio, The room walls were not very soundproof , The location is great Close to all main tourist attractions and the Metro The hotel staff was very friendly and the rooms very tidy and clean 
482637,Hotel Carrobbio, The noise from the nearby hostel , I liked the overall reception from the staff along with the books in the rooms It was a very nice touch The bellboy there should be a manager He was by far the most professional and welcoming person among all there 
482638,Hotel Carrobbio, We have complained about the noise that started at 5 Am the person in the reception simply did not care The suggested breakfast is way too expensive for 13 euros , Things to know about this hotel Very good location to access the Chruch the shopping center etc The hotel is located in front of a Bar at 5am Garbage collector started to collect the bottles which made it impossible to sleep
482639,Hotel Carrobbio,No Negative, Welcome from the staff and Management was great Beautifully located in a quiet but well located alleyway of Milano Lovely breakfast with fresh pastries 
482640,Hotel Carrobbio, Staff were not very Freindly Couldn t sleep on Sunday night so much noise on the street until 3 am And I live in the city so am used to a noisy environment There is a hostel across the alley Request a room that doesn t look out over the front street We was charged for drinks that we didn t drink as the order was wrong Over EU30, Comfortable room cute hotel Good location
482641,Hotel Carrobbio, Attention at front desk was a bad experience The staff when we arrived at 2pm was ok But the night staff OMG We asked for a market he answered in a bad way we called the day after to ask something Same thing , Location was great 
482642,Hotel Carrobbio, Very noisy no noise isolation at all Room design with bare wall drawn in green , Location was great stuff nice design in lobby interesting and very charming
482643,Hotel Carrobbio, I was on a business trip and there was no wi fi in the rooms that s a big problem today also the flush wasn t working correctly in the bathroom, nice location close to Duomo
482644,Hotel Carrobbio, The bath being a spa bath was a little difficult to get in out of , Loved the balcony and the really helpful barman and manageress and the garage guy porter Location great 10 mins walk or 3 in tram just 50 metres away to Duomo Piazza Great deal for the room that had huge balcony Thank you Hotel Carrobbio for the deal and for looking after us 
482645,Hotel Carrobbio, Staff was very rude the room was dirty small and smelled very bad I was literally in shock when I entered considering that s a 4 star hotel Also the TV didn t work and nobody bothered to repair , Location
482646,Hotel Carrobbio, The place itself is not kept up well my room was small and cramped little things like it was difficult to turn on the shower without getting wet with cold water because of the location and direction of the shower nozzle and the type of shower door I had two very awkward and inappropriate exchanges with staff A cleaning person opened my door while I was in the room without knocking and heeding my requests to not come in Why she was trying to enter was completely unclear Another staff member at the lobby desk tried to convince me to let him take me to the airport in his private car NOT official hotel car vehicle instead of taking a licensed taxi As a young woman I felt very suspect of his motivations I would never stay in this place again , The location was just about the best quality decent walking distance to Duomo shopping 
482647,Hotel Carrobbio, The bed was rather hard and the air conditioning cold not adjustable and seemed to affect our sinuses rather damp , Staff were helpful and courteous Location was excellent for walking to all attractions and venuesof interest to us 
482648,Hotel Carrobbio, Service was not good few times rang to fix the light etc had to wait and ring again normally someone would show up after 20 min and they dont respond the phone for ages , Nice interior breakfast ok
482649,Hotel Carrobbio, TV didn t work 160 euro for one night then you have to pay extra for the breakfast Airco outside makes noise, people who work there are very nice 
482650,Hotel Carrobbio, room walls are thin due to the door between rooms you can hear everything happening around hard to sleep well long service 20 min wait for check in 15 for check out 15 to get a car etc does not really correspond to 4 for the price 130 e night , location center nice look in general there is a parking 30 euro day 
482651,Hotel Carrobbio, lack of breakfest, Car park is very good but the best things there are 2 man in reception one of them Bulgarian the other one I think between 40 50 years old I dont know what was their name they are very helpfull wifi wasnt bad dont look the people s idea it was good in room
482652,Hotel Carrobbio, The lack of internet made this hotel a deal breaker There is no internet in the rooms The internet in the common areas is poor to the point of non existence , It was in a great location 
482653,Hotel Carrobbio, Nothing really absolutely nothing Loved it , Perfect location Simple and beautiful Fed up with glossy 4 5 star hotels that are all the same and boring This is a real delightful Italian family hotel The most perfect position I have ever witnessed right beside Lake Como and lovely food too Bin those boring identikit hotel chains with their tedious little turn down service and pretensions and stay in a 3 star 
482654,Hotel Carrobbio, Nothing at all not to like it was great , Great location between Duomo and Naviglia easy to walk everywhere or tram just across the road Staff were really friendly and welcoming The room was nice and clean and the AC worked really well 
482655,Hotel Carrobbio, Bathrooms are not as in the photo they are from 80s never refurbished shower is half broken pouring water like from the tap Air con so noisy you cannot sleep with it on Hotel in general very noise thin walls therefore tv voice set to minimum and you cannot hear anything Location away from city centre It s for sure nothing close to 4 stars not even 2 stars , Nothing
