40535,H tel San R gis, Breakfast a little pricey for what it was but only had it once , Great location and a beautiful tasteful hotel My room looked over the courtyard which was picturesque Paris It felt more like an apartment than a hotel Lovely staff and all very helpful 
40536,H tel San R gis, Nothing to add My new favorite spot for Paris visits , Extremely stylish and well run traditional Parisian style booutique hotel in excellent location preper top 5 start standard and much cheaper than other large international chain hotel in the vicinity
40537,H tel San R gis, Bed is too short breakfast is not very variable front desk at night forgot to pass my order of the breakfast to the room service and it was late for 40 minutes on my girlfriend s birthday , Location is great rooms a very nice room is spacious bed is comfortable interiors are good Hotel is comfy and cozy Very good impression and service I am not disappointed 
40538,H tel San R gis, The bath in the room was broken The staff gave us the option to stay or move rooms When we chose Tom move we found the room was smaller and a bit of a downgrade overlooking the air conditioning We didn t say anything more as the move had taken an hour and we were already late for dinner but it seemed like the hotel was unwilling to provide any further compromise Additionally it doesn t have the facilities or service you would expect of a 5 hotel and we were assured that there is only a view if you book a suit otherwise if you book a standard room you overlook the back of the hotel , The room was cozy but very small and the hotel was very quiet whilst still being centrally located 
40539,H tel San R gis, I specifically paid more to get a room with a terrace and a view which was great when we arrived to the hotel However the rooms with view are in the in the attic and it was extremely warm in the room At night we could not sleep and called the front desk since clearly the AC was not working A first gentlman came up and I showed him the thermostat in the room showing 26 degrees 79 frt and he said just close windows and wait it out a couple hours and it will be cool 2 hours later I called somebody again since thermostats had not moved He came up and said that room does NOT have AC yet and it only kicks in later in the year as it was unusual to have these temps in Paris He called down and told them we can not leave them here and we were moved to a room without a terrace but WITH AC So the first person lied and did not try to move us My daughter who is 5 could not sleep and they saw how sweaty she was A couple of days later it was raining I grabbed a hotel umbrella sitting next to the door and the concierge came out running as he was mumbling to his collegue in french apperantly unhappy and grabbed it out of my hand saying I could not use that umbrella Little that he knew we are French native speakers I expkained to him and manager that was unacceptable and he could have used his words and not his hands He sent us an apilogy letter and Macaroons to the room later but I will NEVER go back to this hotel We are frequent travelers to France all to 5 star hotels and this is the first time at this one terrible experience and nobody suggested not charging us for the view we paid for but never got because of AC issues I never write a bad review and have always been pleased with my hotels but the staff here is terrible and the service and lies are unacceptable for a 5 star hotel , The location was great Near Champ Elysee but on a quite street
40540,H tel San R gis, Everything was great just felt like something was missing can t say what , Beautiful breakfast space Total tranquility and great vibes Received an upgrade for that i am thankful Great staff nobody was full of themselves something I see often Glad I stayed at this property I would come back but I would choose a bigger room with a better viewer i e some sort of suite 
40541,H tel San R gis, Was the worst visit to Paris ever I had an issue about the Air Conditioning which was turned to Heater in the property and there was no notice about this thing and complain this issue to the staff and they easily told me you can open the window if you want could wether Which is not far I booked the room without this facility and know one aware me about this when I did the booking , Location
40542,H tel San R gis,No Negative, Very nice relatively small hotel with an individual flair The extremely friendly staff is taking care for your wishes Photo taken from our balcony You have a lot of monuments shopping sites and restaurants in walking distance We will definitely return 
40543,H tel San R gis, Breakfast could be improved , The location was perfect If you want to make your stay restfull and silent also not far away from the centre this is the location you could ever had in your voyage Staff were extremely friendly helpfull kind and experienced We had an omlette in breakfast delicious Comfotable clean tidy and proffessional hotel They are doing the tidying two times in a day 
40544,H tel San R gis, Location and breakfast was limited in variety but beautifully arranged and set, Staff were friendly and helpful and we re always ready to help and advice
40545,H tel San R gis, We had the room with a view of the tower We where on the 4th floor and could only see the top 3rd of the tower which was nice but a little underwhelming The toilet was separate to the bathroom and was really really small , Location is excellent so close to the Tower 
40546,H tel San R gis, we paid the room for view but the view is only partial Plus the room is by where the elevator is so everytime it is in used there is noise right to the room The room is not worth the money , The location and staff and breakfast is superb 
40547,H tel San R gis, For the price the staff could have been a bit more proactive attentive Not the best value but certainly a nice hotel overall , Beautiful hotel Good location on a quiet street but very close to major points of interest Walkable to Grand and Petit Palais Eiffel Tower Gardens Arc Champs Ely 
40548,H tel San R gis, although with this price but not a tower view breakfast so expensive , really perfect location 3mins to river 15 mintues to ef tower by foot 6mins to champs elysees nice lobby comfortable bed cute elevator 
40549,H tel San R gis, The stairs next to our rooms offered a safety hazard , The bed was super comfortable Staff was very helpful and friendly The room was very clean and cozy Big enough for 2 people we had to book 2 rooms for 3 people 
40550,H tel San R gis, Nothing, A la carte breakfast much better value than 35 buffet Rooms extra comfortable Location excellent if you want to be close to everything but also in a quiet street 
40551,H tel San R gis, The rooms at the back of the hotel did not seem to have elevator, Central and quiet location comfortable rooms bed good but expensive breakfast
40552,H tel San R gis, Nothing, The location the reception is the best they are so helpful i recommend this hotel the wifi is very high speed incredible restaurant thanks for all the people there merciiiiii
40553,H tel San R gis, That we had to leave , What wasn t there to like We loved the decor the period charm and the sense of being swept in the Parisian lifestyle Beautiful luxurious boutique Hotel generous and friendly staff who catered for all our needs superbly and with a smile If we are in Paris again on our next travels we would be booking this Hotel for our stay as it was wonderful 
40554,H tel San R gis,No Negative, We have been staying at the San Regis for over 30 years We love the quiet comfort and perfect location of this intimate beautiful and charming hotel We have been guests at a few of the great hotel Palaces of Paris but much prefer the San Regis The hotel will fulfill any of the requests you might think only a large five star hotel could accommodate but the difference being that it is all done on a very personal level I guess we enjoy the familiarity of going to a place in a foreign country where everybody knows your name We truly love this hotel and the Parisian memories they have helped us create 
40555,H tel San R gis, The baths could do with remodeling in the near future But one can tell that when the baths were fitted they were of the highest quality , Super Location for Paris Photo in the Grand Palais Classic old style Parisian Hotel Outstanding staff friendly and not remotely stuffy 
40556,H tel San R gis,No Negative, This place is not a hotel it is more like staying in a wealthy friends house parisien rooms are notoriously small but our room was spacious and gorgeous i usually dont like wallpaper but my God in our room 21 it was a work of art and incredibly expensive i would imagine the staff are lovely i especially liked Nicholas the concierge downstairs is just one room really but it is beautiful a great place to stay
40557,H tel San R gis,No Negative, The staff was professional and they went out of their way at every possible opportunity During the attacks on Paris they reopened the restaurant to serve us tea the managers bell staff offered absolutely anything I needed for my comfort and Stephan at the desk was always smiling Mary Katherine was gentle and kind and Nicolas and Jerome helped pack a box and shopped a flower market for me They were perfect examples of Solidarity and Bonamie 
40558,H tel San R gis, There was not a good WIFI and reception was poor except in certain locations , Staff food ambience very comfortable bed and lovely furnishings Loved it 
40559,H tel San R gis, Nothing not to dislike , The staff were excellent very helpful and attentive and the location of the Hotel is perfect Must admit to being a tad concerned that my positive feedback could result in this gem of a Hotel will be difficult to book next year 
40560,H tel San R gis, The breakfast should have more selection of hot food The shower towels need to be make sure it s proper cleaned bacause sometimes after the room is cleaned next day the towels are not clean there are some steins on the towels , The location of the hotel is very quite mainly because it s not on the main street 
40561,H tel San R gis,No Negative, A beautiful hotel and central to all the sights we wanted to see The staff were extrememly friendly and helpful We would most definitely stay here again and highly recommend to anyone wanting a boutique stay in Paris 
40562,H tel San R gis, I reserved a deluxe room 34 m2 and they cheated me because they gave us a small room because the hotel was full This is not my fault , The thing that i liked is the location 
40563,H tel San R gis, I had a burger Sunday evening Not very tasty My friend found her room a little noisy as there seemed to be deliveries being made early Saturday morning The staff moved her to another room , Friendly and helpful staff Very comfortable bed and linen Beautiful interiors 
40564,H tel San R gis, First of all this is our honeymoon trip they had promised to gave us a bottle of champagne and free upgrade to a bigger room subject to availability but yet when we arrived the staff doesn t know about the champagne n yet no free upgrade After we used to bath robe the next day even they came and turn down they din even change the bath robe and somemore leave it in toilet It was wet and we can t use again Pillow too soft neck stiff No tooth brush Breakfast not much choice ,No Positive
