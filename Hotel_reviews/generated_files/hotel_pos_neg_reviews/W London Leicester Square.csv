22607,W London Leicester Square, Would have preferred to have been told there was renovation being done in the bar lounge area, location excellent staff superb felt so welcome the manager Billy listened to a problem I had and came up with an excellent solution instantly Thanks 
22608,W London Leicester Square, Unfortunately the bar area was closed for refurbishment but as soho is next to you there was plenty to choose from , The bed was very comfy and met a famous actor in the lift 
22609,W London Leicester Square, The size of the room was a little small and it s very expensive not for those who have a budget , Perfect location middle of everything So many options to go and see The staff were so friendly and welcoming and provided everything asked for promtptly The staff also very helpful with luggage and accommodating all our needs Very modern design so nice for young couples and great faculties 
22610,W London Leicester Square, When I did my booking I have selected 1 large double bed as I was travelling alone Hotel gave me a room with 2 single beds and I explained them that I chose 1 large double bed They advised me that I made my reservation thru booking com and the bed selection is not a choice but a preference which they only check and give if there is availability The reservation is made thru their own system or booking com does not matter I made a choice and I was not informed that I was not going to have the double bed , I generally like this hotel This is not my 1st time 
22611,W London Leicester Square, Beds were very low and rooms were small there was not enough space to even fully open a medium suitcase , Fantastic location near theatres restaurants and tube station 
22612,W London Leicester Square, Staff generally very rude Was thrown off an empty table a table with a finished glass and a load of discarded olive stone in the bar because I was told one of our regular clients wants that table Unbelievable When I asked well the table was and is empty and I m now sitting here so are you seriously ejecting me I was told yes you have to leave our client is coming back and he wants this table by some 20 odd year old female waitress Have never known anything like it in my life When informed hotel some days after by email was told sorry come back and we ll buy you a drink great thats just what I want, Gym was empty which was good Nice sauna and steam room 
22613,W London Leicester Square, Not being able to sleep through the in house night club DREADFUL noise till just before 4am the staff just don t care and wokenus to deliver luggage that wasn t even ours at 730am and again at 1130 having had NO SLEEP wouldn t stay here again for FREE they just don t give a damn, The design of the room
22614,W London Leicester Square, Room is great upon entry but with shower and bath behind mirror doors and wash basin in middle of the room so very messy and inconvenient and not enough power points, Great location and really great staff and great amenities
22615,W London Leicester Square, Absolutely nothing I will never return to this hotel in my lifetime and will strongly suggest guests who are looking for a 5 star experience do not waste their money, This in my opinion is the worst example of a 5 star hotel in London It s room design resembles low cost budget pod hotels and the design has been totally focused upon cramming a room in the smallest space possible and adding no luxury whatsoever At 400 per night it is probably worst value for money hotel in the Uk
22616,W London Leicester Square, There was nothing that i didn t like but a few tweaks that could improve the experience The towels were quite hard for the price i would expect softer towels The staff are really helpful but they are not too sure of their surroundings when asking for places to visit close by , The design of the room location is excellent in the centre of all you need and a great spa on the 6th floor 
22617,W London Leicester Square, Bathroom is poorly designed and was difficult to use, Bed very comfy Staff very friendly especially receptionist Dorothy who was happy and helpful and made our weekend very enjoyable
22618,W London Leicester Square, At the entrance of the hotel there is a que for the night club and bar you also use the same lifts into hotel making you feel uncomfortable and intimidated The reception area for check in was so loud with the music coming from the bar it felt like we were in the nightclub itself When you get out of the lift to the welcome area there arent actually any staff there to greet you as a 5 hotel guest In the evening we had nowhere to go for a quiet drink and relax it seemed the facilities are more for the clubbers than for the guests that are paying a premium It felt like a night club with bedrooms actually quite seedy and in public spaces made us feel uncomfortable Not what you expect from a 5 hotel more from a budget hotel at a weekend We are both seasoned travelers and have stayed in all standards of accomodation over the years but as a 5 hotel we were very disappointed especially when you pay so much , Bed was very comfortable and having dressing gown and slippers nice toiletries although there weren t many Liked the lighting settings in the room 
22619,W London Leicester Square, It took over an hour for the room to be ready I had early dinner reservations and was told I could use the gym facilities This is not a cheap hotel and for the money I am paying for the room it is unacceptable to get ready in the gym Our room was next to an event being hosted at the hotel and so was rather noisy at times Breakfast not included in original package only offered after I suggested some kind of gesture as the room was not ready , Music in the lounge area was good Very clean Nice style and decor 
22620,W London Leicester Square, Breakfast was slow Asked for missing cups in the room and was given paper cups The concierge said he d have to go all the way downstairs for proper cups but never did Room seemed a little tired fraed lining on lights blind tatty Was led to believe the in room films were included but were 15 each , Comfy bed cool modern design
22621,W London Leicester Square, The price of drinks in the bar 60 for four cocktails is ridiculous The shower was pretty terrible in the room hidden behind a mirrored door cool but under powered and leaked Also be prepared to have a pretty large deposit taken off you on check in I think ours came to 160 on top of the 312 for the room , The room was very modern with a fantastic mini bar selection and room service menu Hotel location very handy for Leicester Square access and tube 
22622,W London Leicester Square, The floor of the room was not particularly clean I would expect a high end hotel to be perfect and spotless The operating hours of the spa were also quite short Opens at 10 30am and closes at 8 00pm so there is no opportunity for early morning or late evening massage Closed on Monday , The spa is amazing The location is absolutely perfect if you want to go shopping and to a show which is what we did 
22623,W London Leicester Square, Breakfast Room service was not great toast was not toasted sausages are cheap and forgot my fruit and beans , Wonderful Hotel gorgeous rooms and the bar Nightclub is great Location is fabulous you cant get any more central walking distance to everything 
22624,W London Leicester Square, If you want a little less noise when you go to bed request a room on a higher floor than the second one as whilst we enjoyed it when spending time in the bar the music could still be heard when laying in bed and didn t go off until 4am although it was a Saturday night when the clocks went forward so maybe it usually goes off at 3am , Location quality of hotel and lively bar Even a chauffeur driven ride to the train station at the end of the stay there was a slightly higher charge for this versus a taxi but no waiting required 
22625,W London Leicester Square, The price we have eaten in hotels of high standard but pay one set price for either continental breakfast or cooked breakfast 20 for only an omelette is far too expensive we were also charged for continental only had fruit juice cup of tea there was no semi skimmed milk they try to be different but miss the most obvious choices there were few cereals but no healthy raisins dates figs etc to put with the cereals you get it in other hotel restaurants not as expensive do not like service charge added to bill automatically especially when it s self serve buffet, Food was fresh good variety
22626,W London Leicester Square, Very very noisy We were there for two nights the first night the room was so noisy on the 3rd floor because of the bar at the 1st floor which we were told only stops the music at 3 30 am We requested a change of the room and we re moved to the 5th floor which was quieter However we got a wake up call by mistake at 4 30 am The second night the fire alarm went off at 7 00 am So we didn t get much sleep either night we were offered a 20 discount on one night for compensation but at GBP 400 per night s stay that was not much Too noisy to be able to enjoy the facilities or the location so won t be staying there again , Excellent location easy to get there from the tube station plenty of restaurants shopping center and restaurants around 
22627,W London Leicester Square, The transparent curtain in the room make we think that people can see us from outside when the lights are on , I this is the best location um London The hotel is a 5 minute walk to a metro station We have a lot of good restaurants near steaks pizza hamburguers italian Indian chinese japanese food We have a lot of theaters near The staff is very good The style helps to amplify London s experience 
22628,W London Leicester Square, Everything was excellent Easy access to checking in early would be beneficial , Excellent service Stunning d cor Amazing location extremely clean and tidy Excellent services available 
22629,W London Leicester Square, I stayed on level 4 416 and could hear the thumping base music from the nightclub for most of the evening until I eventually fell asleep it s on until 3am on a Friday Saturday wish I d know before I went The room was very modern with a sink in the middle of the room so you can brush your teeth together the bathroom door offers little or no real privacy for ladies defo not for new couples Sadly no bath crazy soft pillows small double bed maybe as king but not high end very cheap well used small towels Sadly I really don t have much to say that s good so I won t say anything more staff where friendly overall super disappointing for 300 a night room only Maybe if you stay higher up and in a better room the experience would be improved Shame was looking forward to trying this one out , Location
22630,W London Leicester Square, The room service was not avaible as the phone in the room didn t work The shower was broken On check out explained this and the staff checking me out didn t not care at all terrible service i will never be staying here again Did not get given the wifi password ,No Positive
22631,W London Leicester Square, Being kept awake until 3 30 in the morning with music banging out from the hotel lounge Manager Drew thought it was funny and didn t want to help in anyway , Location
22632,W London Leicester Square, Breakfast at Red Lobster was not that great expected much more from W Staff at Brekfast was mediocre Like he was having a bad day , Reception staff very friendly and profesional Great position in Soho If you are young and want to have fun it s the perfect place Also very close to a lot of turistic atractions 
22633,W London Leicester Square, We had a disabled bathroom as that was the only room ready at the time we checked in The shower itself was a little disappointing Other than that we enjoyed our stay ,No Positive
22634,W London Leicester Square, I stayed 3 nights but would like to live there There is nothing not to like about this hotel if you found something I am confident the staff would fix it , Everything The reception and door staff are just amazing made me and my 17 year old son feel like superstars Step outside you re in Leicester square The room was super clean and the beds were sooooo comfortable Full black out blinds and temperature control A real cool vibe hotel and I cannot wait to stay there again 
22635,W London Leicester Square, A poor take on what the potential futuristic minimalist hotel might look like The rooms were not good Tucking all the expected niceties of a room isn t clever Only 1 available plug socket for charging electronic goods No tea coffee facilities unless you ask including a kettle Found the box of tissues an hour before I actually left ,No Positive
22636,W London Leicester Square, Restaurant staff weren t very attentive and although quirky afternoon tea was expensive at 37 each , It s extremely trendy and very stylish but the price reflects this It s in a fab location and the rooms are funky We staying in a fabulous room but we were luckily upgraded from spectacular room due to it being a birthday celebration and we also got a cake delivered Very lovely touches indeed and the concierge was helpful too We had afternoon tea which was quirky and unusual Love this hotel abdcwoukd love to stay in others all over the world 
22637,W London Leicester Square, My room was not cleaned properly it smelled bad throughout my stay Room was noisy and I was told I wasn t able to switch rooms even after one of the staff said that they had another one available ,No Positive
22638,W London Leicester Square, As this was a surprise for my wife for our 25th wedding anniversary I checked in myself while my wife was at the shops I asked if I could have a nice bottle of wine waiting on her arrival when she would be checking in which would be in a few hours still waiting for the wine and put a bit of a spoiler on things very disappointed Perhaps it was because I was a bit of an ordinary Joe and didn t arrive with an expensive suit or designer suitcases when I was leaving all the other guests were asked if they required a hand or a taxi I can only presume the didn t see me after all I am only 6ft 3 and 18 stone,No Positive
22639,W London Leicester Square, We were in room 216 and could hear some noise from the club in the hotel However i had had a few drinks so was out like a light haha , The staff were great we arrived about 6 30pm the room wasn t quite ready so they gave us a complimentary drink in the bar Location was great great for shopping bars and resturants A little pricey but hey it s London and for a young couple this was fine very clean We will be coming back in February to stay again 
22640,W London Leicester Square, In the weekends the toilets near the lounge are not clean because there are a lot of people The bin for the tissues in far and therefore a lot of people throw the tissues on the ground , The lounge and the club that are at the W hotel are wonderful and the staff is very friendly The room is big and clean The afternoon high tea looked very nice and the restaurant that belongs to the W hotel was a good restaurant with a big assortment 
22641,W London Leicester Square, The breakfast is an extortionate price Also the staff are a little cold Some are really nice but lots are more interested in looking cool than actually providing good service for guests, The location was fantastic The room was really nice and very clean
22642,W London Leicester Square, 1 The design of toilet and shower room is terribly unacceptable in standard room we add 100 pounds upgraded to a studio suite because of these reasons In my own opinion the studio suite just like a standard room of normal hotels It doesn t worth such price and can t be named SUITE 2 Cleaning Staff knocked our room everyday at 9 00 It woke us up everyday It s really annoying 3 Write off the bill automatically through my credit card without getting my permit , Location is good
22643,W London Leicester Square, The bed had not been changed from previous guest It actually had human excrement on the pillow and sheets When we spoke to manager he said sorry let me give you breakfast I don t think they acknowledged the severity of this You would not expect this from a B B let alone a top rated hotel The bar area felt like a meat market First hotel I ve ever been in that you don t get tea and coffee making facilities in room Never again , Location right on Leicester square
22644,W London Leicester Square, Shower light would not turn off at night so had to unplug keycard but didn t asked to be fixed as only there one night Bar area not really for those with young families but great if group of friends or couple Bit noisy at night but was expecting that and still managed to sleep most of night , Comfy bed nice style of bedroom Very helpful friendly staff 
22645,W London Leicester Square, Loud music from club on level 1 Evan thou staying on level 5 Have to pay for tv Evan free channels like BBC 1 Don t touch mini bar as pad sencative and get charged to room if drinks touched , Brilliant location comfy bed nice modern but strange room lay out Very friendly staff everyone we met My wife s birthday they brought up a free cake for her Thank you Would stay again 
22646,W London Leicester Square, Ansolutely nothing , I ordered room service very early in the morning and the food was amazing The location is everything but also the friendliness of the staff is really nice The style of the hotel is very modern but at the same time you instantly feel at home due to the cosy interior and the way the rooms were designed is just great Best hotel in London 
22647,W London Leicester Square, The lifts took a bit long around check out time otherwise everything was perfect , Everything was great I m a big W hotel fan and this one in London is one I will definitely return too Great location as well For sure a must stay whenever you travel to London 
22648,W London Leicester Square, the sheets and doona wouldn t pull up far enough too short , Great location Modern clean design Staff super helpful Rooms very quiet considering what is going on outside the hotel on friday and saturday nights
22649,W London Leicester Square, Was shocked to have to pay a 150 security deposit with no warning upon arrival , The staff were ind enough to leave a surprise cupcake as a birthday treat which I thought was extremely thoughtful
22650,W London Leicester Square, The room was inconvenient toilets and showers are located in small cabinets inside the room in a way there is no privacy at all , Good location nice stuff Very good gym
22651,W London Leicester Square, Nothing at all , The location is amazing You are literally in the city center with hyde park right behind you and regent street only a 5 mins walk away the bed is super cosy and comfy And the rooms are so nice 
22652,W London Leicester Square, Do not go to this hotel had a dreadful stay staff very unhelpful rude as to top it off my girlfriend was spiked didn t even get to stay in the hotel for that reason was at the hospital hotel does not want to do anything about it vial vermin ,No Positive
22653,W London Leicester Square, The room design not a big fan of the open bathroom style the sink is outside while the toilet and the shower are separated wasn t very convenient, The location friendly staff comfy bed
22654,W London Leicester Square, Cons The Shower and Toilet are totaly separated which is inefficient in order to go from the toilet to Shower you need to Pass the bedroom first it might be not suitable for big families couples with more than 1 child as the Hotel policy is recomended because the room is designed for young Couples no more than one extra bed , Pros Perfect Location I mean PERFECT Great Staff and Services very cooperative Very Clean Very Comfortable Extra baby Cot was good Very useful Large table that includes water sink for washing your hands I recommend it especially for Young Couples 
22655,W London Leicester Square, Shower head and drain did not work properly and our room flooded as a result Apparently rooms are checked regularly which obviously isnt true , Staff maintenance sorted our issue 
22656,W London Leicester Square,No Negative, Like the attentive staff and the welcome for my birthday Very cool hotel and excellent location Well done and thanks to all staff at W hotel L Square London And a big thanks for slice of cake in room mmmm Will be coming back soon Cheers Sunil and Shireen Sharda 
22657,W London Leicester Square, No swimming pool and the steam room opens late after 11am Not enough drinking water in the room , Centrally located with a lot of restaurants and night life around Everything is walking distance and 2 subway stations less than 5 mins away to connect you to the rest of London 
22658,W London Leicester Square, Service at breakfast not good Had preordered breakfast but was told I hadn t and had to pay more than was quoted in my confirmation email , Bed comfy Room large Good lighting
22659,W London Leicester Square, There were no facilities to make a cup of tea which was ludicrous when there were all sorts of things to plug your technology into A cuppa from room service was 4 50 which I wasn t prepared to pay , Location was very central and just down the road from the theatre we went to The staff were lovely and helpful 
22660,W London Leicester Square, The toilet shower pods are inconvenient and leak water Acoustics are not great could hear the drain from the shower above, Awesome location great design and funky rooms 
22661,W London Leicester Square, Sadly when trying to order room service the phone was broken therefore I had go to reception which wasn t great at that time of night , I rather like the feel of the room the open plan is a great idea for a hotel 
22662,W London Leicester Square, The smell in the bathroom was a little bit damp due to poor ventilation and towels could do a little bit with updating but none of these thing would put us off from staying here again x, Absolutely stunning hotel in great location of London Loved our room it was beautifully designed The staff of the hotel was amazing especially a guy really sorry but I have no clue how his name is spelled but smth like Dwuart from Portugal was exceptionally helpful and welcoming each time he saw us we also received a beautiful dessert and a card from the hotel due to our anniversary melted my heart 
22663,W London Leicester Square, If I were to be really picky the fact that there were no curtains blackout blinds meant that we couldnt have a lay in We did wake up really early on both nights because of this there was simply just white blinds which didnt block any of the daylight but just provided privacy , The bed was super comfy And the pillows were extra soft We had breakfast at the Burger and Lobster which is located inside the hotel on one occassion and it was fabulous although slightly on the pricer side 
22664,W London Leicester Square, Expensive in the hotel itself especial when you could go to some where less than 30seconds away and get the same thing for two thirds the price Overall though and very nice high quality hotel , Very welcoming and friendly staff Ultra modern interior with vibrant colours and clean lines made for an extremely comfortable stay and the bed was so comfy in didn t want to wake up Shower was lovely one of the best I ve had in a hotel They had all the facilities you could wish for and more a very enjoyable experience 
22665,W London Leicester Square, Do not recommend this place for families specially with young children It s too loud on the weekends the lobby turns to a lounge during weekends which you can hear the loud music from your room and other than that you can even hear people in the street Did not felt comfortable at this hotel at all,No Positive
22666,W London Leicester Square, The facilities in the room itself were poor in that there weren t the usual toiletries provided such as a shower cap cotton wool nor a nail file Neither was there a kettle nor cups but hot water was provided on request , Best thing is the location A very modern feel I liked the light and airiness of the room and face wash and the body butter The bar area is fab and there is reserved seating for hotel guests The staff were friendly and very accommodating from the doormen to the engineers 
22667,W London Leicester Square, Paid in advance for breakfast for two 50 00 but informed by the waiter that we were not allowed the full English breakfast even though it was actually included on the menu Was informed we could pay extra for each one off individual sausage bacon mushrooms etc Had no option but to make do to with continental breakfast which we very rarely eat Very disappointed and consider we were ripped off , everything except breakfast see attached
22668,W London Leicester Square, They charged us a 450 preauthorisation meant to be 150 and even that they didn t tell us about staff were stuck up and not very helpful took us 45 minutes to check in , The location was brilliant and had a nightclub inside
22669,W London Leicester Square, Very dark colour schemes throughout We were on the 3rd floor and could hear what sounded like excercise balls being used just before 7am, Staff very pleasant and helpful
22670,W London Leicester Square, Well there wasn t anything that would stop us staying there again Some of the soft furnishings are starting to show their age The hotel food and beverage prices were above the odds But with so many options just outside the door I m not complaining , Best detailed room I ve ever stayed in Also incredibly quiet Amazing Location couldn t be better either The porter Conscierge front door staff were a delight Friendly funny and really helpful in a way that made us feel really at home and welcome 
22671,W London Leicester Square, We arrived to hotel in 7am One of frd can t check in for the booking due to personal matters so we didn t check in the room for him on that morning Becox we are looking for the certificate from him to prove that he got matters in macau so can t check in here As he books 6 nites becox of the special rate hotel said they can t refund the charge to us unless any certificate However hotel did cancel our rooms at 13 00 without any notice We had prepay 6 nites room charge but they said Bcox I didn t check in this morning so automatically cancel the room But actually morning shift manager knows what happened this morning and why we didn t check in the room Due to prepay room charge so they only can refund vat to me it s around 210pounds only But my 6 nites room charge is around 1440 pounds Finally they said its misunderstanding this morning so wrongly check out my room It s very ridiculous mistake for this international hotel The shower room water flow into the bedroom They don t have make up room signage or lights need to call front desk to make up room in every morning We stay 6 nites so we call for it for 5 times Even remind them twice still no one take the signage to the room If u enjoy nite party here will be the good choice to u as there is party inside hotel every weekend Otherwise you can t sleep at night , Location is the best burger and lobster just in the ground floor 
22672,W London Leicester Square, I don t like the current trend of placing bathroom sinks to the room side Designers please keep the bath and rest rooms totally separate from the rooms, The location was very central Nice decor Friendly staff Good and affordable breakfast selection in the restaurant Air conditioning and wifi were working well 
22673,W London Leicester Square, I booked a upper level floor room but they give me a first floor disable room very bad hotel expensive but not comfortable and very noisy, only the location
22674,W London Leicester Square, The cleaning of the room was done so late One day our room was fixed after 5 pm and they destroy the curtain and they didn t fix it They should be more careful , The location is perfect The design of the rooms and the lighting was fantastic Also the security in the entrance of the hotel make me feel very safe 
22675,W London Leicester Square, When I was there I notice some construction work going on outside the building I was a little uneasy saw people working outside the window , Breakfast was good the fruits were fresh The bed was comfy and the room was clean The bathroom was clean and I like the shampoo and the body lotion 
22676,W London Leicester Square,No Negative, What a lovely welcome with very friendly and helpful staff We got upgraded and a beautiful red velvet cake in our room The bar was very nice great location and got recommended lots of places to drink and eat by lovely hotel staff Thank you for a wonderful stay
22677,W London Leicester Square, Too close to pub and club around Soho This makes it a little bit noise around 2 4 in the morning , Close to SOHO and china town easy to find something to eat The staff is good Not far from underground 
22678,W London Leicester Square, Stinky Bath Towels Really Stinky Concierge Seriously it s okay to smile sincerely and be friendly Put Slippers in room you are after all a 5 star hotel You concierge could use some a lot of help with there approach and robotic service No personality very fake and whatever type of response I switched from a Belgravia hotel thinking I would get the same service as both are supposedly 5 stars I should have stayed in Belgravia This W isn t a 5 star hotel bath towels stunk all of them everyday so showered and had to air dry as I didn t wish to smell like a stinky towel I was completely taken aback by this location As I stayed in the W NYC and it was quite nice I was unaware of the Pride festival going on the day I checked and your concierge was NO help at all with helping me get to the hotel That was a turn off right away I could go on but why bother You have lost me as a customer It s like an updated modern motel for the Selfy Generation P S All around your staff are snobs and only cater to the wanna be party Hollywood type crowd Pity is what it is , Your food delivery people and doorman very friendly Food was good 
22679,W London Leicester Square, Shower room toilet and the shock tub wash in the middle of the room , Size rooms the bed was comfortebl Room was clean friendly Staff Location and security at the hotel 
22680,W London Leicester Square, The staff are fairly up themselves I didn t feel particularly welcome My room was substandard Yes it looks very trendy and I can t fault that you do get an iron decent hair dryer iPhone dock as standard However The sink in the middle of the room is a novelty to be cool but is fairly annoying and inconvenient The showerhead sprayed in all directions clearly needing a decent de scaling The automatic light also didn t go out in the shower room neither did the fan It wasn t the best night sleep I ve had in a hotel The location is noisy Particularly on a Saturday night You are right next to china town and Leicester Square Expect lots of noise from outside Unfortunately it extends inside too as the bar is popular with the early 20 s crowd dressed up to the hills all thinking they are being exclusive and classy by paying over the odds for cocktails so it s busy and noisy in the communal areas Be warned if you want a late drink at the hotel bar you will be battling with the public to get served and the bar staff are quite slow Being all male behind the bar on the night I was there meant all the pretty young girls were getting served first and i stood there growing ever more annoyed at being ignored I did asked to switch rooms for my second night which was met with a look of inconvenience Almost as though they hadn t ever been asked this before They didn t particularly apologise for the genuine problems with my room It was a Sunday night and I know they had lots of empty rooms It was hardly a big request Any tourists staying here please take note NOT to use their car service It is outrageous what they charge I did a 7 min journey due to bad weather and was charged 18 Being from south London I know that should have cost around 5 8 max You will be much better off walking 30 secs to the main road and getting a black cab or downloading uber Don t let them rip you off , The location It s very modern and looks good You can easily get anywhere from this location The rooms are smart and overall it does feel impressive but beauty is only skin deep 
22681,W London Leicester Square, Too modern not comfortable shower closet and sink in middle of room and not easy to reach outlets , great location excellent and friendly staff 
22682,W London Leicester Square, Wi fi in our room was awful Some loud music outside the hotel Room design if you are 30 it can be little bit annoying for a long stay , Staff was perfect Location is super Room design If you are 25 this hotel is for you 
22683,W London Leicester Square, My son was slightly disappointed that he didn t get children size slippers We didn t call up to ask for them They might of had some but it was late so we didn t bother Other Hotels do ask for the child s age and slippers will be there on arrival , The screening suite was fabulous I booked the studio suite but they upgraded it It was spacious and very clean My 7 yrs old son loved the bath that was facing a tv and I loved the steam room I used it in the evening and in the morning Doormen were friendly too We would definitly stay again 
22684,W London Leicester Square,No Negative, I loved the interior design of the rooms and the comfort of the bed Front desk staff was vey welcoming and ready to solve any problem or need The Concierge staff was also very helpful and friendly I was staying with my sister and we both loved the location 
22685,W London Leicester Square, Seemed to cater more for non residents than for residents Maybe because it was a Saturday night but late afternoon all the seating and tables in the bar areas were reserved or taken by non residents and the evening wasn t even worth trying as lots of non residents were piling in to use the bar and club We felt like outsiders so went straight to bed All the staff looked like bouncers Restaurant was closed which we hadn t been aware of until we arrived Hallways so dimly lit it gave a bit of a seedy feel No coffee or tea in the room had to ask and only got 3 capsules so who gets the 2nd coffee Shame as we were really looking forward to it , The room was lovely and very modern and clean Staff were extremely friendly and efficient 
22686,W London Leicester Square, Woke up to contstuction Both Friday and Saturday morning at 7 45 Which suck when your on vacation Wasn t allow to move rooms Due to lack of space Was also told that construction wouldn t start in till 10 on Saturday But it started at 7 45am So I had to get up and complain to make it stop But at that point I was already up , The staff was amazing So helpful

22688,W London Leicester Square, The noise from the bar was loud and you could feel the Base reverberating through the room We were on the 3rd floor , The hotel was very nice and staff exceptional 
22689,W London Leicester Square, Had room problems to start with but was sorted out and thought room 913 nightclub was a let down, The location is great the staff are lovely the hotel is stylish
22690,W London Leicester Square, Slow internet TV was broken Staff were very defensive at check in desk , Interesting room design Bluetooth sound system in room Free drink as compensation for not getting preferred room Friendly and professional waitress at the bar 
22691,W London Leicester Square, The Driver who pICked us from the Airport He was GRUMPY RUDE N DID NOT HOLD UP A SIGN FOR US AND WE HAD TO WALK AROUND AROUND TO LOCATE HIM HARDLY SPOKE A WORD TO US Mayb cos We re Asian , Everything 
22692,W London Leicester Square, couldn t fault it , Great location lovely buzz and atmosphere on saturday evening Loved the club in the hotel and the spa as a relaxing day on the sunday Staff were really helpful and friendly
22693,W London Leicester Square,No Negative, Consistently the best room service menu and of particular the Spice market selections as well My favorite hotel for my travel to London for Theatre business I had an apartment there once for a full year and would do again in a heartbeat Coffee lattes are simply the best staff is highest level and best people Spa and Gym amazing amenities I always come to the W Hotel in London 
22694,W London Leicester Square, Service charge on drinks when they are already very pricy a 11 for a glass of wine then service charge on top, Good food and drinks Fries my staff Great location and very accommodating 
22695,W London Leicester Square, After a 40minute argument with the on duty desk manager at 12am Whilst our Children slept in reception we went to bed in a dirty room The room was not made up on either of the 2 days we stayed Bar lounge area is poor and staff were rude The look of the hotel and cost does not match the staff working there or the clientele it attracts Lots of drunk and disordly behavior , The location and luggage valet staff
22696,W London Leicester Square, The view wasn t the best , The staff were extremely helpful and friendly nothing was too much trouble The room was fabulous very comfy beds and the pillows were awesome Room service very quick 
22697,W London Leicester Square, The room smelled of fried food Odd because when I put bags in the room at 18 00 it was fine Thereafter it was quite bad , As usual we liked the property very much It is our favourite hotel in London 
22698,W London Leicester Square, Prices of snacks and drinks in the mini bar are outrageous even for a central London hotel Also had to ask for coffee and tea making facilities to be specially brought to the room just to be given cheap awful instant coffee powder sachets At the price you re paying you expect better than that , Very good central location
22699,W London Leicester Square, I tought I had purchased one night in a hotel room but it was actually one night in a club This hotel is a big mess in the weekend with people partying and walking around the hotel from the bars to their rooms with their drinks in their hands Extremely noisy At this price there are other hotels in London with similar services where you can actually sleep peacefully or other clubs with entrance fees cheaper than one night at the W ,No Positive
22700,W London Leicester Square, The rooms were not what we expected too small and a cramped layout The sink at the room walkway made it difficult to have more than one person doing anything in the room The toilet immediately behind it made moving around awkward The USB plug by the bed did not work the light in the facial mirror did not work and we were told they were put in but not hooked up yet and the TV only provided a few stations The front desk welcome area did not feel very inviting more like an afterthought And our room upgrade did nothing but move us up one floor level same floor plan same room It was not worth the extra money to move up one floor , The location was fantastic and the service from the staff was excellent The people at the W really go the extra mile to ensure you are enjoying your stay and the city itself 
22701,W London Leicester Square, The furniture has worn off especially in the lounge If you come during the day you will also spot stains on leather sofas Room was OK nothing special or luxurious WC and shower are separated very weird Really hard to open the doors The light turns on with sensor so during the night sometimes the light turns on without us moving at all we could also hear the pipes they were very loud so it bothered us while we tried to get a good sleep Overall I have stayed in W hotels all over the world but this one has nothing to do with rest I have stayed in better 4 stars hotels than this Not coming back for sure , LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION Only good thing about this hotel The bed was comfy too so plus for that 
22702,W London Leicester Square, Quirky room layout may not suit everyone sink in the middle of the room , Locatin sandwiched between China Town and Leicester Square No fuss checking in no porter and no hassle Modern bright room and very quiet
22703,W London Leicester Square, Rooms expensive shower room not great as the water ran into bedroom and the blinds didn t block out the light from the hotel I was told breakfast was not included even though my booking confirmed bed and breakfast , Great location and bar
22704,W London Leicester Square, The only thing I have to mention is air conditioning it was a cold in the hotel room but got colder the later it got This could be controlled from inside but didn t seem to make any affect I called down to front desk and this was adjusted externally by the hotel but it took a good 45 mins to get it optimal temperature I was asleep and by the time I woke up it was very hot i do think hotels located in the UK shouldn t bother with air conditioning it s cold enough , This hotel has a beautiful contemporary style very new and very stylish From the moment I walked up to the hotel it was a fabulous experience the door man was pleasant and very welcoming The greeter downstairs was very warm and asked to take my bags immediately I was shown up to the first floor reception area where I was checked in at the fastest pace The person checking me in was very nice and told me everything I needed to know When I got to the room within a couple of mins the door knocked and my bag was delivered The person talked me through all the hidden aspects of the room and said I could request any help I needed I felt very looked after I didn t want to leave and had the best sleep in a hotel in Central London in ages I could not hear anything from outside I will definitely be revisiting this hotel If I could give it 100 stars I would every bit of the experience was lovely 
22705,W London Leicester Square, No Free WiFi Shame on you W Admittedly they would have given this had I joined their reward program but I simply dont want yet another otel reward scheme ill never benefit from, Great Location Excellent Bar
22706,W London Leicester Square, Difficult to get to the bar for evening drinks but then it was a great location so inevitably busy , Amazing venue brilliant breakfast Made to feel very secure 
22707,W London Leicester Square,No Negative, We stayed at the W Hotel in Leicester Square for a period of 10 days in conjunction with the semi final and finals weekend of the Rugby World Cup and used booking com for 4 nights in addition to the 2 three day packages that came with All Blacks Tours group The W Hotel staff linked the various bookings together and also accommodated a reasonable upgrade to a studio room so that our son could join us for 3 days for the RWC Final All the staff from security on the front door to housekeeping were extremely friendly and helpful with any requests That plus a superb location adjacent to Chinatown and nearby Theatres and restaurants made for a perfect stay 
22708,W London Leicester Square, Room could have been more practical and wifi was for free but accessing it said something else it should have been clarified to hotel guests and explained on how to access it, Location and hotel vibe
22709,W London Leicester Square, Not so nice welcome as it is the same entrance as a nightclub meaning our arrival was shoulder to shoulder with drunken people in an environment that required shouting in order to be heard by the receptionist , Perfect location for downtown London shopping and nightlife Cool bar cool room
22710,W London Leicester Square, Screw on the floor in the bedroom Key didn t work 3 times Noisy but due to location , Very modern chic and stylish Rooms well laid out and facilities excellent Bar area is worth a visit in the evening is you like a club type feel when you are out 
22711,W London Leicester Square, Cleanliness of the rooms room size is small To get a drink in the bar takes ages and everything is reserved for outside hotel guests maybe good the hotel needs to rethink their priorities on who their customers are The locals getting a drink or two or the guest staying at the hotel and that pay 2000 pounds for their stay If you want to experience customer first check in the Shangri La hotel at the Shard , Dinner breakfast at the Spice market
22712,W London Leicester Square, Bathroom shower showed some dirt in the floor to ceiling light as the whole plastic light glass cover was bent open , Location really friendly staff and great service 
22713,W London Leicester Square, The guy who checked us in wasn t particular pleasant he seemed annoyed that I wouldn t accept 2 single beds Erm I paid 300 for a night in a hotel with my girlfriend I did not want single beds , The bed was amazing clean a little small but generally very nice
22714,W London Leicester Square, The sound on my tv had issue The phone didn t work had to have a technician up to the room twice Use my international phone plan to contact the hotel for room service and spa appt My room was on the third floor the bar was on the first floor and I could hear every note and felt every beat of music till 3 30 am on Sat , The location is Great The facilities were cute Staff were amazing Chris was exceptional 
22715,W London Leicester Square, Had to wait 2 and a half hours for the room to be ready when we arrived at 15 30 The excuse was that I had booked a king size bed and wanted 2 singles therefore they had to make another This was rubbish as they had called me 48 hours before to confirm type of room and requirements Nearly everybody who arrived near our time was directed to the bar to have a drink while they waited for their room Service charge added to all drinks food , Staff helpful and friendly room clean Check out midday
22716,W London Leicester Square, Not a bad experience but i was surprised of the paid wifi service most of the hotels now have free wifi didn t bother buying the service used my data plan , Great Location Absolutely clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful 
22717,W London Leicester Square, I didn t like about the wi if why have to pay for wi fi that s not fair and why it s too much it s 14 pound other hotels are free and it better then this hotel, I like the hotel and the location is in the center that s awesome
22718,W London Leicester Square, There are only two things that were to my displeasure and it honestly was not the hotel s fault First upon arrival I had taken a shower and the drain was plugged from other travelers hair which caused it to flood the floor This was quickly alleviated by staff The second would be the construction in front of the hotel which will be over very shortly I had drove in and couldn t use the proper route However it makes it a bit easier to cross the street when walking a silver lining so to speak , The entire staff was welcoming from day 1 until the last Even the doormen would remember us The room we stayed in was the Wonderful room and it was Unique in design the closet like toilet and shower were very beautiful The bed was very comfortable as well I did happen to stay on the second floor near entrance side and did not hear one bit Of noise as both the club and construction were literally at our doorstep Three cheers for soundproofing Overall a wonderful stay and would recommend to others looking to stay in downtown London as it is in the middle of all of it 
22719,W London Leicester Square, Room is very small Toilet is like a small box very samll Hand washing is out of toilet and no privacy in it like cleaning your nose or brushing your teeth The mirror in front of hand washing has light on top of it so it is annoying when you look to mirror, Location Security Staff Room Cleaning
22720,W London Leicester Square, Although I pre paid the hotel at the time of booking my credit card was mistakely charged again after check in The paymant was cancelled after my complaint at the reception but it blocked 2000 EUR on my card for 3 days Furtunatelly I got my money back but it caused me some issues due to the card limits The staff said I am sorry but I would expect some compensation for the troubles too , excellent location and value for money
22721,W London Leicester Square, We had booked 5 corner rooms non were ready when we came at 1800 staff said they were sorry did not offer any compensation upgrade or anything quite uninterested , Locaction right in the centre is fantastic Cool bar and restaurant 
22722,W London Leicester Square, The room was covered in dust The glasses mini bar visitors guides all really dusty The window blind was broken so we struggled to close it We asked for the bedding to be changed as my partner is allergic to feathers the receptionist we spoken to regarding this seemed like this was too much effort not what you would expect from a 5 hotel , Amazing looking hotel incredible attention paid to the overall design Location could not have been better 
22723,W London Leicester Square, The place is great with the one serious exception that there is no sink in the bathroom but in the middle of the room That is very inconvenient It is very difficult to groom yourself without making a mess on the center counter or on the floor Also many personal hygiene are preferred to be done in the bathroom especially if you have company in the room Another couple minor negative things are that the hall ways smell bad from time to time and the bouncers can be a bit intimidating , I love the music Its assume I love the design of the hotel and the rooms The mirrors give an amazing effect Also the location is simply unbeatable 
22724,W London Leicester Square, The phone never worked in the room to contact reception no kettle in the room for tea we had to ring off our mobiles to reception to ask where the kettle is even tho they said we have to collect it from reception , Good location nice rooms nice bar spa facilities are great and gym good staff too
