197916,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, I didn t have any issues, We liked the location of the hotel food was good and staff very helpful We went to a concert at the o2 which was very easy and quick to get to from the hotel
197917,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf,No Negative, Beautiful room looking directly over the Thames and o2 Big bed very modern throughout and a huge bath looking over the Thames too Great breakfast in very nice terrace room Very helpful friendly staff Valet parking excellent too 
197918,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, There was nothing we could fault during our short stay Would stay there again when in that area and happy to recommend it , The entrance and approach is very welcoming Spotless nice fresh airey feeling and nice smells Staff very pleasant on checking in and during our stay The room and bathroom were spotless and the facilities in the room more than adequate could not fault it The outside area is pleasant with views of the Thames
197919,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Breakfast dining room staff not at all attentive All the other staff more than compensated for this though, Lovely airy room extremely comfortable interesting views ideal for Canary Warf 
197920,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, See above, Fabulous hotel staff brilliant very pro active and would go the extra mile to make our experience a lovely weekend Richard was fantastic and very knowledgeable about the local area and the transport He even supported us with transportation from the hotel to Kings across to save us having to carry a case on the underground Only one minor issue the evening meal menu was limited only one vegetarian hot meal on offer which then meant having to find alternative restaurant for the second night 
197921,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The windows were filthy that looked out to an office block and not as portrayed on the website In addition the carpet was stained and had evidence of the previous guests as there were food crumbs by the side board on the carpet , A great nights sleep on a huge comfy bed 
197922,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Only one point to make and that was the free shuttle At certain times we were in the allocated slots but were told by the driver it would cost us 8 to get back to the hotel, Very friendly staff Bed very comfortable No noise Breakfast probably not worth 30 for 2 people but it is London I suppose when we needed to know something or needed help a text was all it took and a very quick reply too
197923,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The complimentary jiggers of milk tasted disgusting we couldn t have tea or coffee a matter of personal taste not something that can be deemed as wrong Whilst breakfast was really good value for money it wasn t very hot My pet hate is lukewarm food But that was the only issue I had that I felt could have been better , Our room was in Pristine condition as if we were the first occupants All the little frills were present and we couldn t have asked for a more comfortable bed The staff were extremely helpful professional smart and unobtrusive yet attentive 
197924,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, I can t fault it, We stay for one night for show at o2 and the whole weekend was very good staff and hotel was very helpful a great stay will stay agin for sure

197926,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Hotel is quite isolated from everywhere closest food other than the hotel restaurant was too far to walk Nearest train station is 18 minutes walk away Asked hotel to call a taxi and they called a chauffeur which was unnecessary and cost us 16 pound for a 5 minute journey We were also very disappointed to be woken up at around 7 30am the next day to construction work right outside our hotel door There was a lot of incredibly loud banging as well as drilling into the hotel wall I called reception to ask them what was going on but they had no knowledge About half an hour later we heard someone come up from reception to ask them to stop until our room had been vacated but by that time my three year old son had been woken up by the noise Not sure what happened there in terms of hotel organisation but it s not suitable for a hotel to conduct maintenance at 7 30 in the morning Hotel staff were apologetic and I think a little embarrassed that it had happened but no real compensation was offered It really affected the rest of our day as we were all tired and very grumpy especially the three year old Pretty disappointed , Hotel was very luxurious but what would expected for the room rate Restaurant and room service food was above average 
197927,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, No complaints, On arrival to the hotel the staff were so welcoming we we re offered refreshing water whilst we checked in and also there was a sweetie cart to help yourself The room was really nice an ice machine just along the corridor which was a very nice touch All facilities you needed were available in the room even an ice bucket The hotel offered a shuttle service to Canary Wharf Tube which we used very useful Breakfast was really lovely and available till 10 30am

197937,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The reception staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful to all 11 of my guests Having worked on behalf of Radisson in the past I found this quite embarrassing No one greeted us on arrival or helped us with bags and wedding bits The check in systems also took ages with all desk staff finding it confusing no smiles no customer charm and no offer to assist with anything other than complicated check in systems The facilities were fantastic but the staff made what was meant to be a very special time for me wedding time quite stressful and I dreaded having to deal with them , Facilities and room cleanliness

197945,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, I booked the room last October as a twin room but on arrival were given a king double bed which was unsuitable as I was sharing a room with my daughter We were offered an upgrade initially at 80 which we thought too much but the priced was reduced to 40 We accepted this but I would have appreciated not having to pay for an upgrade given that I had booked so far ahead , Fabulous pillows goose down like nothing I ve ever slept with before Spectacular bathroom with tv thats a first for me Great breakfast too in lovely dining room

197949,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Nothing negative about the hotel at all Just be aware it s not as close to the O2 as Google maps would have you believe It s an hour to walk or a 20 taxi ride , Lovely well appointed room Clean comfortable Excellent breakfast 
197950,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Could not get a special room without cost of a suite to get a river view for my wife s 60th as I has asked for if possible via Booking com Valet parking a tad expensive on top of a high ish room rate , Clean lines The receptionist who organised a little 60th token for my wife and tried her best to accommodate a river view room

197952,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The staff at reception was polite but very reserved An occasional smile would have been nice Apart from the view the area where the hotel us based has a bit of an industrial feel to it , Brilliant hotel Room facilities and dinner were great 
197953,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, I got into a bit of a muddle regarding a complementary 15 I could use with the room I didn t have the opportunity to redeem it until the next morning when I was checking out All I asked for were a couple of coffees I confirmed with the check out staff who said it was still OK to redeem but the bar staff making the coffee said it wasn t and wanted to charge me 8 40 for 2 coffees Conversations went back and forth between bar and check in staff and confusion reigned for 15 minutes I ended up signing a bar bill still not sure whether or not that will end up appearing on my credit card after all that crazy simplify please , The size and comfort of the room Had a great night s sleep quiet and cosy Didn t want to leave the room 
197954,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Not being able to make a payment for the room over the phone as I booked the room for my son to get him off the streets during the recent terror attacks but there was no way for me to pay for it remotely this is really poor , Rooms were clean and the staff friendly 
197955,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Bathroom amenities weren t working properly as the shower bath gel container next to the bath was not checked properly and was broken walking to the shower to use that bath gel every time we used the bath was a pain Also beware of the motorway as it so loud during the day and night so light sleepers might ask to move before you get the room , Wonderful staff very pleasant and welcoming Cute candy bar 
197956,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Not much to improve Children would have liked a pool though and hot chocolate in the bedroom , Really helpful staff at check in Amazing room booked a suite as stayed with family of four Plenty of room and comfy sofa bed Quiet too Delicious breakfast and they cooked veggie sausages for us especially Will book again next time we visit O2 Arena 
197957,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The robes were very hard and rough like it hadn t been washed in a good detergent The price of breakfast isn t realistic as it s 20 if you book online and if you want to pay when you get there it s 15 Overpriced for breakfast and not worth it , Very comfortable bed Lovely powerful shower
197958,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf,No Negative, The view on the terrace for breakfast was excellent also really good choice for everyone I m vegetarian and my partner is a carnivore there was also lots of choice for a vegan diet too Lovely The staff were very helpful and arranged a taxi to the O2 when we were rushed for time Perfect room just lovely

197960,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The only problem was that it was an extremely hot evening and there was an ice dispenser which did not dispense any ice This is more an observation than a didn t like as there are very few places that offer that facility , All the staff at the Radisson Blu are warm friendly We were upgraded which was wonderful The room had a view of the Thames and the bed was extremely comfortable We loved that there are voiles and curtains at the windows for privacy and to block out the light The room had a separate shower and a bath which you don t always get It is the perfect stay for visiting the O2 
197961,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf,No Negative, Good for concerts at the 02 Arena If like me you travel around London on foot the Hotel is only a ten minute walk from East India Dock DLR station Getting to the O2 Arena from there is easy

197963,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Location of hotel was hard to find from the station its a long walk could maybe help with signposts Little space for car parking near hotel very congestive would be nice to have some parking facilities also the shower in our room was very difficult to operate could improve on this , Excellant breakfast choice and staff customer service very good good size room and very comfy and quiet Excellent staff were very helpful friendly A very lovely hotel 
197964,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, There was no pool or was undergoing work my little girl was very upset Also was taking her to the sauna jacuzzi etc but my little girl wasn t allowed they said cause she s under 16 but I was with her I then asked if she could hv her nails painted cause of the let down with pool and sauna etc but they said again no as she was under 16 I was very annoyed as she wasn t allowed to get nothing I thought ouldnt say it was family friendly cause of this , The rooms were excellent and very clean Staff were lovely very friendly 
197965,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, At check in we were offered an upgrade and the member of staff made it sound like we were getting a lovely room as there had been a cancellation Eventually she told us it would be an extra 70 for the pleasure no thanks Along the way it seemed as though we constantly been asked for our card details or upsold something Being asked to spend extra money all the time really left a bad taste and ruined the experience for us At check out we were told we had taken 2 items from the mini bar and were charged for that I nearly lost it as that wasn t true After everything it was the icing on the cake They did realise it was a mistake and corrected it , Everything looked brand new and very clean Breakfast was lovely and a good selection Very nice coffee 
197966,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Greeting could be better and more welcoming Not really kid friendly and no kids drink choice in room Rooms were nothing special for the cost and score , The hotel looks stunning at the entrance but that s it every thing else is average Breakfast is lovely and view

197969,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Opportunity to choose seat at breakfast , Exceptional service from all members of staff in the team at this branch of Radisson Blu Hotels The meet and greet was exceptional all little additional requests completed brilliantly and made the stay that little bit more special 
197970,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The night manager said he couldn t find the booking and then took a payment of 120 which the receptionist kindly refunded the overpayment of the following day , The bed was extra comfy
197971,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, I was mis informed in regards to my breakfast I paid 40 extra for breakfast upon arriving and two mornings when I tried to order my breakfast I was told it wasn t paid for on my room The first morning I was sent complimentary champagne as an apology and the second morning they sent the breakfast and tried to charge upon checkout the issue was resolved but they need to make it clearer to guest what they are paying for to avoid confusion and irate customers other than that the hotel was perfect It s missing a sauna and or jacuzzi, The hotel was wonderful
197972,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Unfortunately the view from our window was of the office block opposite about 40ft away, Surperb breakfast and very comfy bed Staff very helpful and polite 
197973,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf,No Negative, Good spacious suite and bathroom facilities Scoff Banter bar restaurant had great views and provided a relaxed dining atmosphere Hotel staff were very courteous 
197974,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, We made our booking including breakfast and when we arrived they informed us breakfast wasn t included in our breakfast and they wern t willing to contact booking com to rectify my booking, The bed and pillows were so comfy
197975,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, We didn t have any issues, We were given a complimentary upgrade upon arrival As we were celebrating our anniversary the room was decorated and staff had also sent cake to the room The room was very big and spacious The bathroom was very modern with a large bath and shower Food from the hotels restaurant was very good Location is also perfect very helpful with the shuttle service where you can go to Canary Wharf full of shops and restaurants Hotel itself is very beautiful with great spa facilities we booked a couples massage which was very relaxing The view from the restaurant is lovely perfect for a relaxing evening with a bottle of wine Very good for it s price Definitely will return 
197976,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, I wasn t a massive fan of the bathroom layout as where one of the walls of the shower should have been the bath was there instead Also the wardrobe was located inside the bathroom which I found strange Also it s definitely not as close to the O2 as the pictures suggest A 10 taxi ride or a 70 minute walk , The design of the hotel itself was great The TV facilities were good too with catch up TV apps provided The shower itself was amazing with nice toiletries provided 
197977,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf,No Negative, Able to check in online and the room was ready when we arrived at 10am We were greeted with towels on the bed in the shape of swans and rose petals and a dessert with Happy Birthday written in chocolate and a birthday card personalised to me Lovely surprise 
197978,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The attitude of the women from behind the bar was the ONLY bad thing about my stay at this hotel , I felt like royalty with the standard that this hotel holds itself at Everything about this hotel screams class even the lift to my room was the fanciest elevator I ve ever been in The best thing about the hotel outside of my room was the view from the bar 
197979,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Distance to any tube requires a taxi, The river views are great especially out of the bathroom whilst you bathe also seeing the o2 arena and Emirates sky ride lite up at night is amazing 
197980,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Nothing everything was perfect , The hotel managed the impossible brilliantly friendly staff whilst still being incredibly efficient I have stayed in many great hotels throughout the world but this is without doubt in my top three 
197981,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Unfortunately the shower would not work on my final morning The lever which turns on the water would not move I couldn t understand the TV control what the guide said was on was not what was actually showing , The pillows were great The quilt was heavy and I would wake up overheated Otherwise the room was very well equipped and comfortable Wonderful view of the O2 across the river especially at night 
197982,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf,No Negative, I always enjoy my stay at this hotel the staff are friendly and professional they are also very welcoming and cater to all needs The hotel is in a private and quiet location making my stay very peaceful it is easy to get to on both public transport or taxi The rooms are very spacious and comfortable with both a bath and standing shower in the bathroom It is the perfect hotel for both business and leisure trips 
197983,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Restaurant services We went to Scoff Banter at 10 10pm to see if we could get anything to eat but sadly they didn t accommodate us as the kitchen was closed and I didn t quite understand why they were shut 20 minutes before the usual closing time 10 30pm , We stayed in a river view room It was very spacious and the view was stunning All staff were very friendly and helpful One thing I found very useful was the virtual assistant contact Edward The Chatbot for any kind of service you need Just send a text and it will all be taken care for you 
197984,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The virtual concierge Edward is a good feature but didn t deliver the extra milk we requested we received a reply to our message immediately but the milk never arrived The excellent real staff far outperformed the virtual , Without exception every member of staff offered outstanding service with a friendly courteous and efficient manner genuinely excellent customer care An immaculate modern hotel with large comfortable rooms and good bathrooms 
197985,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The hotel damaged my personal property and is taking a very slow and convoluted process to fix it I expect a better service from a Radisson Blu hotel ,No Positive
197986,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, I don t really have any negatives apart from the fact I was surprised you didn t provide toothpaste , The hotel lobby was very swanky and the bed in our room was luxurious and a great size I liked that you had iplayer and youtube so we could watch episodes etc on there The bathroom was immaculate in terms of cleanliness great sized bath and I like the open shower vibe 
197987,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf,No Negative, Loved my stay here Was running the London Marathon and its such a central location Booked here for next years marathon too and recommended and booked for a friend too Outstanding 
197988,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The taxi company who you called said they would collect us from the O2 and when we called them they said they were too busy so two ladies on their own had to find out how to get back to the Hotel , The comfortable feeling of the facilities
197989,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, I feel misled about the price that booking com advertised I believed that breakfast was included when it was not I had had the opportunity to book the hotel at a lower rate had it have been clearer I am unlikely to use booking com again ,No Positive
197990,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf,No Negative, I booked it due to the advertised proximity to the 02 except we didn t have a boat Great view of the O2 from across the water however in a cab across land it is quite a difference Staff were friendly but we tried to use the app to book a cab Total fail 
197991,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The meals we had were very good but the food was not as hot as it should have been in fact it soon went cold The tea was not to hot either, The bed was very comfortable and the room was very well cleaned The staff were all very friendly and nothing was to much trouble 
197992,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Arrival wasn t a good start We couldn t park parking is a massive issue around this hotel and needs addressing its not something you should have to tackle as soon as you entre the hotels grounds we were at check in when the lady serving us basically called us liars when we said that we had already paid for our breakfasts when booking our room that was rude enough but when she noticed that my surname was completely random on your data base and didn t change it I found that real poor customer service 3 times during our that half an hour of trying to sort out the breakfast mishap still my name is Mrs Amp I then receive a letter in our room with Mrs Amp written on the envelope seriously the letter saying that they looked at their records and we hadn t paid for breakfast and as a good will they will include our breakfast for the duration of the weekend did they not think it may of been a Booking com error again making it out as we were liars This stay was part of mine and my Husband s 1st wedding anniversary this was not going well where our room was concerned RANDOM why would you have a open wardrobe in the bathroom my husband was in using the toilet facilities while I was waiting to get my clothes strange setting the bed was comfortable but the pillow was a waste of time nice a fluffy until you put your head on it then it disappeared spent the next day with a bad back no coffee machine its 2017 who and where doesn t have a coffee machine anyway didn t spend anytime in then hotel other then breakfast and sleeping on departure we weren t even asked how our stay was the guy said very little and just took our receipt for our car key and that was that didn t enjoy our stay in your hotel and wouldn t recommend Before I post this on trip advisor ill give them a chance to redeem themselves should they see fit , The bed was comfortable decorated lovely for our anniversary with complementary cupcakes thank you 
197993,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Very busy at breakfast queue at breakfast and tables not cleared fast enough, The croissants and breakfast selection The bathroom in our room cleanliness of the hotel
197994,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Room too hot Very expensive As it is a business hotel and we were there for the London Marathon at a time when it would have otherwise been empty that is the weekend they might have tried harder to make a menu that was more suitable for runners and changed their pricing although its only 3 miles from the start it s not the easiest of routes , very modern very comfy bed very smart and stylish decor wi fi smart tv didn t eat at the hotel so can t comment on food
197995,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Rooms a little bit hot no info on how to control the heating Had to change from room 527 bad drain smell in the bathroom staff helpfull with the move, Everything food was good staff were Excellant Special shout out to Richard Robson Head of Concierge heck of a nice guy and very very helpfull
197996,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Mini bar was not checked properly so there were 2 opened cans of drink from previous residents Was resolved , Clean good location nice staff good breakfast 
197997,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, I don t really eat cured meats or cereal so all I could eat was a roll with cheese Maybe some fresh pastries from local bakery would be better, The breakfast is ok but not much choice Some poached eggs would be nice 
197998,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Decor dated and to dark , The room was fairly nice The only thing that let it down what the decor Found it to be dated in colour hard looking and dark My partner upgraded our room to a suite as our room we were allocated didn t have a nice view and very small for the price we paid and that s was a cheap rate 
197999,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, n a, We stayed to visit the O2 and it was our wedding anniversary We had lovely cakes left in our room with Happy Anniversary card from the hotel which was a lovely touch THANK YOU We had breakfast in the conservatory overlooking the Thames which was lovely in the sun shine 
198000,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Dissappointed with check in I was charged the full room rate 199 as the male receptionist did not notice any different from my booking booking com price was 169 I was given no details about the time of breakfast or where it was and he gave us no directions of where to find the lifts or that we needed to use the room key to operate them We had parked our car almost right outside as we managed to get a space and we were quite happy to leave it there so I asked him if it was ok to park outside and he said parking is 18 even thoughBooking com says 14 and so I paid and he gave me an envelope and a receipt so the car could have valet parking which I was not interested in especially after having to pay 30 extra on the price of the room I half listened into the conversation of the people checking into next to me and they were dealt with much differently with more information Maybe the gentlemen that served me was new I mentioned it when I checked out the next day and the lady refunded the 30 for me Still a little annoyed about the unnecessary valet parking another unnecessary expense but hey ho , Hotel was modern and quite nice Staff were professional and polite Doorman was fab Breakfast was delicious They organised some toothpaste for our room and arranged a cab for us to the O2 
198001,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Room view was of a multistorey carpark office building opposite lacking a swimming pool which you would expect of a hotel of this type we knew beforehand of course but its just surprising especially where there is a spa Staff seemed a bit non plussed just got handed an envelope with key card in it no mention of where or when breakfast was or any other ancilliary info Location is bit off the beaten track it seems be located in a semi gated community where cars are given prio over pedestrians for pavement space , Comfortable rooms and spacious suite Tasty breakfast a little limited in choice in some areas but no real complaints Nice view overlooking O2 from the restaurant Quiet no noise disruptions Fresh fruit and water on arrival 
198002,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Room view however I m looking forward to returning to get a better room , Layla in charge of guest relations made my stay worthwhile I came to relax an evening prior to starting work and was disappointed when I didn t get a room with the view I expected for a deluxe river view room and she made things better by promising my next stay would be better and giving complimentary breakfast 
198003,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The restaurant menu does not reflect the ambience the menu is poor and not enough variety and expensive for the quality of food served Bar area though was very good , Lovely hotel well placed away from central London but close enough to activities and transport 
198004,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The staff were awful in checking us out and getting our car to us We were told to wait 15 minutes even though out car was parked where we left it the prior night The staff member made us wait at our car a further 20minutes even though he had our car keys in his hand Really ruined he whole experience, The gentleman who checked us in was lovely and welcoming 
198005,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Nothing really except my car looked scruffy alongside the Ferrari s and RR s , Huge bed I needed a search dog to find my wife Really comfy Very quiet in our room a very large bathroom with shower and bath bidet Fridge even an ice bucket and ice machine in the corridor All of the staff were happy friendly and helpful Well done to the management for motivating training them so well

198007,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf,No Negative, Clean efficient hotel close to the O2 was the reason we picked the hotel Only criticism I can give would be the chauffeur service would of been great if it actually took you to the o2 rather than the tube station the bathroom was clean shower was excellent Hotel receptionist was great with advice on the area and was welcoming on check out all in all good hotel clean and comfortable bed

198023,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The reason for our 3 night stay was to attend the Country 2 Country festival at the 02 It wasn t clear when we booked that the 02 was a cab ride away However the hotel staff kindly helped us rectify this , We cannot fault the kindness and obliging manner of the staff The breakfast was amazing Probably the best omelette I ve ever had The beds were comfy The shower was good 
198024,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Nothing to fault at all but it s further from the tube station than it looks on the map , Staff were excellent even before arrival they helped with how to check in They were all friendly and helpful Great location for the O2 and probably for other things in the area too

198027,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, More sugar and milk supplies needed in room Didn t like having to pay extra for parking on top of hotel cost , Location was good for me but wouldn t be convenient for anyone with walking problems as a fair walk to the station

198029,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The fact we had to complain waited for half hour to sort it to get the rooms we asked for and paid for originally as put on different floor to our daughters The price of the breakfast 20 4 for both days we didn t have in the end although did hear other guests offered it for 15 each the cost of parking but then it is London We were offered a room upgrade due to cost of breakfast but would have had to pay 40 per room per night so that worked out the same as the breakfast what was the point there Don t think we will be staying there again will go to Premier Inn or Travellodge where we can get breakfast included and free parking , The music in the lift the tv Reception staff were friendly even after a few problems we had The parking was weird as we just abandoned the car and then next day it was parked elsewhere or at the front door

198036,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The sink in the bathroom was not draining properly I asked someone to come and look and nobody came besides being promised it will be looked at , The room was spacious though the outside scenery was not great Loved having the Spa at the hotel

198040,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Only one place to have coffee Despite being a Monday and almost empty was told the sunlounge empty but for one other was for the more formal tea and I only wanted a cup, The Staff esp the girl who went up and down 4xs in lift with me till was sure I could cope unfortunately couldn t give full marks as leaving check out disappointing Comfortable room and bed Breakfast gets 5 stars
198041,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Although breakfast was great and you could eat yourself silly it was very costly at 20 a head , Loved the huge bed and the great bathroom with walkin shower Location was spot on for our needs 
198042,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, When we were checking out it took the car park staff an hour to get our car There was only one person retrieving cars until the concierge called in some extra staff to assist , Bed was very comfortable Room was also quiet other hotels are often not so good Reception staff were very helpful and friendly Liked the availability of car parking at the hotel but valet parking wasn t so efficient when we were heading home See what could have been better We stayed at the hotel because we were going to The O2 hotel is very convenient for O2 quick transport link to O2 via DLR and Jubilee Line 
198043,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Hanging area for clothes in bathroom would get damp when using bathroom No extractor fan in bathroom Some maps of how to get to Canary Wharf station and 02 would have been helpful Longer hours for Shuttle bus , Excellent breakfast with wide choice of things to eat Shuttle bus to Canary Wharf
198044,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The fact that the website was misleading and lead us to believe that the hotel was 5 mins away from the 02 well it was but on the other side of the Thames river we later read from previous guests comments that the hotel provided a free shuttle to the tube station but we weren t informed about this We booked a taxi to and from the 02 which cost us 18 each way breakfast 15 per person plus 18 for valet car parking it became an expensive one night stay disappointing , The room was comfortable quiet and staff attentive Breakfast was fantastic
198045,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, It as slightly pricey for my likely Nevertheless it was a good stay with good service , The bed was very big and comfortable The breakfast was exquisite To die for one might say 
198046,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Staff service in bar and restaurant was appalling Orders for food and drink were always wrong Staff didn t clear tables plates or glasses when the place was obviously quiet I have never stayed in a hotel that left tables full of glasses and crockery for so long , Clean rooms and ease of pre arrival check in
198047,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, view of skips and rubbish from bedroom window car parking gone up since booking and despite me having a printout I was charged the new rate Delay 15 20 mins waiting for car on collection , staff friendly and helpful cleanliness and room quality

198050,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf,No Negative, Attentive staff and the breakfast service was excellent considering how many people they were catering for Always someone looking out for your needs Great outlook from the dining area Hotel was in close public transport proximity for our visit to ExCel with plenty of bars and restaurants in nearby Canada Wharf for an evening out 
198051,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Nothing to say , I like to fact that everything you need is available in the room Coffee machine kettle ironing board hair dryer creams cotton buds nail file vs 
198052,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Paid 18 for car park yet my car was parked just outside entrance to hotel reception once checked out was made to wait 20 minutes for my car and was told it would be brought to us although it was parked just outside still no car after half an hour so my partner then went to ask for our keys and we moved it ourselves Not happy about that at all, Staff were all very friendly upon check in
198053,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The spa Not really a spa as such few hot beds a sauna Steam was broken wouldn t bother using it again, Decor of the hotel was lovely rooms great it was a nice touch to have swan towels birthday cake

198055,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Being called down to reception at midnight to pay our bill due to no one on check in taking our details Having housekeeping walk in a number of times before 11am and after 7 30pm Going for breakfast and having the plates cleared before we had finished there were no trays so if you wanted more then two items you had to go back Which we did we wanted fruit too Room service wasn t all that great kitchen apparently closes half an hour before it mentions and then the sandwiches offered on the late night menu are not worth the amount they charge you Charges added to our bill a day before we even checked in so they weren t us at all Minimal tea making facilities Only thing offered back after all the inconvenience was the two lots of the free 15 credit included in our room and a free upgrade if we ever wished to return which they managed to take from my account instead of put back , Stayed here as part of our anniversary getaway I had emailed someone a few days before we arrived to arrange something for our room Everything went to plan but quickly went wrong when we got there Overall lovely hotel with a great view from the bedroom and bathroom Great location East India is less than a 5 minute walk away and one stop from Canning Town where you can get the jubilee line Breakfast was fine as it was included wouldn t pay for it otherwise Staff were very unorganised and no one seemed to know what was going on Easy to get to Great location for O2 View from our room was as described Hotel was lovely
198056,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The spa You can use the sauna showers and steam room complimentory of your stay When we stayed the steam room was out of order the sauna and shower area wasn t particularly well maintained and the staff were not very helpful , Every thing about the hotel except for the spa

198059,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Lunch service was atrocious The was poor and cold Breakfast did not cater for Gluten free diet Was tepid at best Did not know what marmalade was , Not Much
198060,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Food could be better The staff could take responsibility of complaints instead of declaring directly to our neighbors our complaints about loud music we felt a bit uncomfortable when we came back to the room It s better avoid asking people what they re going to do next it s none of your business in some case , Everything comfy and amazing place We loved the technology the bed and the bathroom shower The restaurant has a really nice view and the staff there was very caring We loved the fact reception is always available at any time for any needs and they were helpful and kind Overall it was a great stay with high standards and all the small things were highly appreciated

198064,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, There wasn t anything that we didn t like if I was to be really fussy I would criticise the cost of the items in the mini fridge but that s to be expected in nice hotels really , I was just very impressed with the hotel overall we paid a good price and it really was worth it lovely staff there was a complimentary spa included with our stay which we didn t know about until we got there unfortunately The concierge was more than happy to give us advice about the best ways to get about And considering we went the night of a busy concert in the O2 I thought the price was very good 
198065,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, We were going to a concert at the 02 staff got us a taxi on the way and the hotel taxi driver said too call 20 mins before the end which we done to be told we would have too wait 3 hours for a taxi ,No Positive
198066,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Location was bad nothing to do around it everything was very far from this hotel not ideal if your goin site seeing, Hotel was great very clean and comfortable staff were very helpful and friendly
198067,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Cleanliness in room was not 100per cent black trays for glasses etc not clean Bed opened up my side had different kind of hair there Couldnt open curtains at all for 3 night stay as totally overlooked and horrible view anyway 410 room bathroom lovely brilliant to have ironing board there thou sorry but we didnt pay that cheap and just felt it could of been better, Very good time for breakfast on the late time as we are always tired but love breakfast great choice too
198068,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Thought the hotel was a bit nearer the 02 but they did have a courtesy bus to take us to the nearest tube which was good, So clean and quiet with a lovely breakfast

198071,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, N A, Everything was perfect I especially liked that they had warm milk as a choice for my breakfast cereal The television even said my name they also have an easy online checkout The staff was pleasant and so helpful valleting my car and calling a taxi for us for when me and my husband went out 
198072,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf,No Negative, The room and hotel facilities were fantastic I was there for work and found the shuttle offering free transfers to canary wharf was extremely useful The location at the new providence wharf is exceptional and offers amazing views to the Thames and the O2 arena The trolley with sweets in the reception is a very nice touch 
198073,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, A shame that we were told that we couldn t sit and have a drink looking out over the water this was apparently the restaurant area but it was so quiet that it would have been nice to have used one of the tables there , Excellent view across to the O2 Very good quality hotel 
198074,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Reception staff at the spar were appalling they were disorganised unprofessional and behaved in a couldn t care a less attitude They were rude unhelpful and totally tarnish the quality brand of the Radison I m assuming they are a seperate organisation to the hotel , Customer service was fantastic hotel staff always showed a high level of professionalism and went out of their way to help you 
198075,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Room service in evening did not arrive at all Concierge unhelpful as they were very busy Breakfast buffet not topped up Understaffed at reception Did not provide blanket for baby cot unless requested, Beautiful design of hotel Room new and clean Staff are polite and pleasant when they have time for you
198076,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Parking was an issue I had to pay for valet parking as I didn t get space The breakfast was a little disappointing but overall the hotel is beautiful, Loved how the staff listened and co operated and also handled our complaints promptly
198077,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Not a massive point but there wasn t a great variety of juice at breakfast I had water instead , We ve stayed here a few times and I know others who have stayed here and never have a bad word to say about it The staff were very helpful and the texting service was great The breakfast was lovely 
198078,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The shower didnt drain away as fast as it came out had to use towels to dry up the extra water , Loved the friendly and helpful staff the shuttle was very handy Decor was amazing Wifi and TV channels where sufficent seperate bath and showers are always a winner
198079,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Everything was fantastic, Great location comfy beds friendly staff Rainforest shower was wonderful and all toiletries were provided Staff offered to help with everything we needed Hotel is on a Pok stop 
198080,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Only bad point off the stay was I had to ring down to reception just after midnight to complain about the music that was coming from the bar but the staff where very good and the duty manager phoned back to say it has now finished so not really a complaint as such , The staff where very welcoming on arrival and during our stay ordered room service just after 11pm and it arrived very fast and my wife really enjoyed it our river view room was amazing overlooking the Thames and the o2 bed was really comfy and the breakfast was amazing me my wife would definitely stay again 
198081,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The Spa wasn t exactly looked after the relaxation room had no hot water and the steam room wouldn t even work which was a shame Heard a few things that that the staff were new and weren t too sure what to do , The bed s were comfy and the room was lovely We didn t eat or drink there but the location is very close to the Canary Wharf centre so it is perfect location wise The spa was ok 
198082,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Nothing to improve, Bed was super super super comfy curtains blocked out all sunlight in the morning and the freshly squeezed juices for breakfast were the best I ve tasted Asked for some swans and petals to be made up to surprise my Girlfriend on arrival to the room We loved every minute and will be back again should we visit the O2 again The O2 is about 20 minutes of public transport from the O2 which is made up of a 9min walk to the DLR and then a 5 minute journey and you re at the O2 Very very easy Top tip If using the Tubes DLR use a contactless debit credit card as it ll cap the cost at about 6 60 if traveling in Zones 1 2 per day and works exactly the same as an oyster card 
198083,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf,No Negative, I loved everything about this hotel staff were friendly the breakfast was amazing with a view while you eat I could not fault the room at all the view was amazing and the bed was extra comfortable 
198084,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf,No Negative, The hotel is beautiful clean and comfortable the reception bar and restaurant staff were very welcoming and intentive as they were able to help us out with everything we needed from a shuttle into town to how to get to kings cross when there is a tube strike 
198085,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Perhaps it would be an idea to sort out the temperature of the water in the shower it was slightly too cool for my preferences so I used the bath instead , The selection of freshly prepared juices for breakfast was amazing And also there was a delicious carrot cake waiting for us in the hotel room upon our arrival for my birthday it was a very lovely gesture 
198086,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The location We found it so hard to find even after getting off the DRL we could see the hotel but couldn t go round the front because it was gated up with padlocks so we had to walk all the way round the back where we just guessed our way Understandably there were roadworks going on but they need to place signs for the hotel around the area We got into the new providence wharf and it still took us 15 mins to find the hotel because there were no signs around just guessing again The scenery views were incredible though , The rooms were really clean and spacious and the beds were really comfy The staff helped us a lot with any queries we had 
198087,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf,No Negative, Had a lovely night here the beds are to die for literally sank into them and didnt want to go home Everything there you need clean welcoming relaxing etc Lovely views No complaints Definitely coming back
198088,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, We had a lovely meal in the restaurant however I was still in the middle of eating when the serving waitress asked us to give her a personal good review She did the same spiel at the end of the meal also , From the moment we arrived to when we left the staff were so courteous and very professional Nothing was too much trouble for them and after enquiring to the purpose of our visit ensured we knew which transport links we would need Top notch Couldn t fault the stay 
198089,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Booked to attend the O2 bit frustrating seeing it across the river with no very near crossing Taxi was the easiest option 18 each way, We upgraded our room very nice room over looking river Large bed with lots of room
198090,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The draft lager in the bar was not the best , The rooms were excellent beds and pillows really comfy Staff were very helpful the valet parking was really handy Close to travel links Overall an excellent stay and when visiting London again will be my preferred choice 
198091,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Mini bar was charged automatically so be careful We experienced a problem with it it was wrongly charging us for items we didn t really use However the beautiful lady in the reception can t remember her name unfortunately helped us to sort out this little problem Many thanks, The hotel is fantastic Very close to the train station and O2 The entrance of the hotel is fabulous with the amazing BFG sculpture The checking in was very smooth The suite we booked was very spacious clean with a modern bathroom The staff were very friendly and outstanding They were very child friendly They were always available to serve and help us They were even coming every night to check that everything is good in the room For an example if you need extra water or toiletries Breakfast was delicious with hot baked peaks scrambled eggs mashroom breads fruits and other dishes The breakfast dishes were all the same every day but still delicious My advice to you is don t miss this hotel I will definitely stay in this hotel when I come to London 
198092,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Foreign staff difficult to understand basic breakfast and location is not great for public transport, Excellent value for money but nothing extraordinary

198120,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Wardrobe in bathroom clothes become damp with steam Difficult for a fairly small person to use soap and shampoo from fixed container when sitting in bath Hair Conditioner only in shower not in bath Location a disappointment booked it because website claims easy access to O2 We wanted to walk there and back Very disappointed at need for public transport or taxi It is a cruel and unfair claim even taxi driver asked if we had fallen for the hoax that the hotel is near O2 his very words Also directions from east India tube station needs to state which exit and which direction to take once you re going the right way they are accurate , Comfy bed Spacious reception area Restaurant good value for two course meal Helpful reception staff 
198121,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The fire alarm going off at 2am It was a computer glitch so not much they could do about that The food at dinner time was expensive and small portions and that s without any veg on the side Both times we tried room service nothing happened , The breakfast The massive need The hospitality of the staff at reception

198126,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The cushions on the bed smelt heavily of BO Due to it being noticed later at night as we didn t arrive until late it was an inappropriate time to sort When told to reception in the morning all they said is that we can have a feee upgrade next time I explained we may not be coming back so that s not a suitable outcome for us, The location

198144,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The bed was like sleeping on the floor It was far too hard we didn t sleep well at all No check back on food from staff plates weren t hot hence resulted in food going cold quickly Couldn t quite understand why Chips Peppercorn sauce came with Steak yet all additional side orders had to be ordered separately for the Corn Fed Chicken making it an expensive meal A porter to greet us at the door with our luggage would ve been a nice touch Never stayed at a hotel where there is a lovers kit in the fridge door lol , The Room had an exceptional view over to the O2 over the Thames All hotel areas were clean presentable the room 628 was spacious again clean Terrace looked inviting too Room was quiet too

198176,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, awkward design of bathroom which included a wardrobe had to take my clothes out each time I used the bathroom a regular shower head would be beneficial too instead of a cleaning jet, silent rooms with little noise from above or next to neighbours ice facility in the hall
198177,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Only small points Details in bathroom might be better cleaned or serviced The drawer fronts were in need of cleaning and there was limescale deposits at the foot area of the shower door which should be regularly removed I think Small detail the soap dispenser near the sink was very stiff and using it caused the dispenser to come apart we had to put it back together , Efficient quiet friendly staff good room very useful indeed to be able to take the bike up to the room

198189,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Ventilation and heating and cooling in the room was not set up correctly you could not turn down the air con enough and the room was too hot due to the solar gain in the room early in the morning But that was the only issue , Rooms were of a good size and the bed was wonderfully comfortable
198190,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Walk from East India Station late at night Access on foot could be better Maybe when building works are finished, View overlooking the river from the restaurant breakfast are 
198191,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Shuttle service was limited getting to the hotel via public service isn t straightforward so I think accessibility needs to be addressed Bigger cups for tea or coffee in the bedroom would be good And teeny little pats of butter for large slices of toast with morning breakfast isn t a good idea either, The hotel looked quite smart clean modern with good views of the O2 the Thames Our bedroom was reasonably roomy came supplied with hairdryer iron ironing board trouser press smart tv free wi fi Pillows were lovely comfy

198198,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The location involves a short stroll to East India or Blackwall DLR stations which for some may feel a little off the beaten track however the hotel provide free car shuttles to Canana Water station which is much more useful of a stop , On discovering the trip was over my husband s 40th birthday we arrived at the hotel to receive a complimentary room upgrade Not only that but the room had been decorated with towe swans and rose petals and there was a birthday cake and hand signed card on the desk Fantastic personal touches from the loveliest friendliest staff and use of the spa steam room and sauna at our disposal Fantastic

198295,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Whilst the hotel is quite close to the O2 the taxi was a bit of a nightmare getting back to the hotel, Staff were extremely helpful and room extremely comfortable
198296,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Parking charges, Excellent staff could teach the west end hotels a few things about service Outstanding staff who went above and beyond Will be back

198298,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The bar shut earlier than I expected and the room wasn t ready on arrival and we weren t given a time as to when it would be, Reception staff very friendly
198299,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Cost When we returned at night really wanted a coffee but non available as machine not working was very frustrating, Very costly realise in central London the hotel was exceptional but just not value for money I expect was hugely inflated due to the Brits on at 02
198300,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Unclean failure to inform of charge for valet parking there was also an event on and the music was that loud in the hotel our room was vibrating , Shower was lovely and room was modern

198307,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, View from room was not great it over looked some sort of large concrete chimney structure but as we were only there one night it didn t matter to us The towels were a bit hard and rough I was expecting nice soft ones as the room was quite luxurious in every other detail In September they are having a boat to take you to the O2 which was where we were going its a shame it wasn t already running , Nice clean large room Bed was comfortable no traffic noise Food in the restaurant was lovely and we were seated in the conservatory area which looked across the water to the O2 arena The non alcoholic cocktails are delicious 
198308,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Stayed here due to going to the 02 and although they are not far away from each other they are on opposite sides of the Thames Was helpful to take the free hotel shuffle to Canary Wharf and then just one stop on the tube , Lovely room and facilities
198309,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Cleaning could pay just a little closer attention to detail but overall it is an excellent property The most irritating factor is probably the Guest Services Agent who answers each time you phone for anything within the hotel and then redirects your call or takes a message I far prefer to contact a Department directly rather than having to relay to Guest Services that i would like Reception to contact me about my stay for example Why go through all that when i can simply call Reception myself , This Radisson property is now much improved There were some issues on previous visits with incompetent staff however the guest experience is a wonderful quick and smooth one these days Really enjoyed my brief stay 
198310,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, On arrival and being booked in receptionist was a bit too scripted relax and smile a little please it is not a sprint Other wise a job well done Thank you, Enjoyed my breakfast and the varied selection of options available Well presented and hot cooked breakfast Bella

198341,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, Whilst we didn t have a problem personally you could see that as breakfast was getting busier the staff were struggling to cope you needed to have a dedicated person signing everyone in and others to escort guests to a table , Fantastic river view room overlooking the O2 Arena Surprise treat of strawberries dipped in chocolate left in our room with a card to celebrate our wedding anniversary what a lovely personal touch to add Had a wonderful break and breakfast was vast varied and delicious Thank you

198378,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The chairs in the dining area are ridiculously low for the tables It s very difficult to eat properly The idea that making tea coffee in bulk leaving them to stew get cold on a large table in order to be picked up served immediately at breakfast is very very lazy I ve traveled extensively have NEVER come across this idle practice , The helpfulness of the staff was brilliant 
198379,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, It says on the web site it is 0 5 miles from the o2 It is But only if you swim To walk would be just under 5 miles You have to get 2 tube trains to get there , Staff were lovely They were all very friendly and helpful The room was a good size and very comfortable with a great view of the o2 and river

198381,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf, The view looking at the 02 arena is amazing but to get there and cross over the other side is a expensive taxi ride there and back if your attending the 02 but maybe down to first time and not knowing any cheaper faster ways there , Great view from the room looking out over the river and 02 arena excellent fast room service amazing comfy bed and bath shower facilities were great very helpful staff and would certainly stay again
