398492,AC Hotel Barcelona Forum a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, for a 4 star hotel the front desk staffs are not trained well didn t feel welcome when I do the check in and didn t explain how they are going to work with my credit card for the payment Then the room service phone number is not working front desk agents didn t answer the phone call and hang out the phone for no reason 4 times , The bed is pretty good and bathtub is so nice 
398493,AC Hotel Barcelona Forum a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Room facilities barely adequate no tea or coffee no bath robe or slippers to use for swimming etc choice of English tv stations very limited and no shelf space for clothing The menu displayed outside was not available in the hotel and the only food available at night was in the pool caf which was extremely basic The cooked breakfast was also limited with only ever scrambled egg rather than fried poached etc , Good view nice pool area friendly staff reasonably close to the beach and quite easy to get to the city centre

398498,AC Hotel Barcelona Forum a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, not enough space around pool to sit caf staff at night not too pleasant seemed in a hurry to close at 10pm when they were to be open till 11pm would like to have more options other than buffet for breakfast did not always get all the towels for our room or wash cloths concierge often too busy at desk or not there at all on some occasions, check in and desk staff very helpful and pleasant location excellent
398499,AC Hotel Barcelona Forum a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, We felt certain staff at reception were a bit rude The pool and deck area on 13th floor is quite small and you need to get there very early to secure a sun lounger , The location is ideal for the beach The barcelona tour bus and the metro to city is nearby There is a large shopping centre across the road which has some excellent restaurants

398504,AC Hotel Barcelona Forum a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Even though there was signed saying that reservations of sunbeds were now allowed and towels would be removed no one did this and the sunny beach type guests staying at this hotel completely occupied the pool area and went to lunch leaving their towels on the sunbeds for hours No one did anything about it Do something about this to give service to your guests Cleaning was something that one had to wait on for 8 hours At 4 pm if we left at 9 in the morning the cleaning still hadn t been done and we had to call to get our room cleaned , L kkert og p nt God beliggenhed n r strand

398513,AC Hotel Barcelona Forum a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, I did not like that free WiFi access was only available in the lobby I have traveled across the USA and Europe and free WiFi connection throughout a hotel lobby and bedroom is no longer a luxury it s standard This is especially true for 4 star hotels This is the first hotel that did not offer free WiFi in the bedroom I also did not like that I was deceived from the hotel webpage that read free WiFi It did not specify that free connection was only in the lobby I also noticed that the air conditioning was not the same in all rooms My bedroom in particular had a very weak fan Others were much cooler , I thought the hotel was very clean and beautiful The lobby is outstanding and has a great aroma I considered asking what scent was used A few of the staff working the check in counter were very friendly and always had a smile Others were not as friendly I was assigned to the wrong bedroom but when I notified the staff I was upgraded to an ocean view free of charge That is excellent customer service
