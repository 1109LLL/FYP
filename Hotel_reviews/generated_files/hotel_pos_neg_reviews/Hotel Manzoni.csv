487846,Hotel Manzoni, That I couldn t stay longer , The hotel was small boutique perfect location breakfast excellent staff wonderful cheerful and helpful Everything was perfect We had tickets for LaScala and we walked there It was everything we hoped for and more 
487847,Hotel Manzoni, Expensive valet parking 50euros for one night , Quiet room air conditioned so important in July Bonus bottled water Really comfortable beds Soft Egyptian linen sheets Amazing shopping fun fun fun 
487848,Hotel Manzoni, Nothing , Very helpful staff Amazing facilities and walking distance to great shopping and the Doumo This place was so CLEAN with marble floors and wood trim The 23 breakfast was also amazing with a continental AND and made to order hot items such as omelettes and other hot foods not your run of the mill items sitting around like other hotels We had an outdoor terrace off of our room Fitness center was not very large only hand weights and 3 cardio pieces but a very upscale and modern This hotel was much nicer than some of the higher rated hotels that we stayed in other cities in Italy 
487849,Hotel Manzoni,No Negative, Our Third time returning to this Hotel Its in a great location Rooms are perfect size for this boutique hotel Highly recommend if you are visiting Milano 
487850,Hotel Manzoni, Staff is ambivalent at best and rude at times Dining room very attractive but service not good Coffee weak and luke warm , Good location Attractive rooms and lobbies Location is good right in the heart of the fashion district 
487851,Hotel Manzoni, While the staff were very friendly and helpful they were unable to provide information re day trips local tours or assistance with local bookings No fliers or brochures were available either and we were referred to a local travel agent who looked at us aghast , We really enjoyed our stay Breakfasts were delicious and the buffet plentiful 
487852,Hotel Manzoni,No Negative, Location cleanliness welcoming atmosphere Good amenities We visit to Milano many times but no hotel made us so happy and practically convenient Surely we will stay this hotel again 
487853,Hotel Manzoni, Unfortunately the room is very small for the price paid Room facilities could also be better However the Hotel overall experience is very good I would stary there again , Property is in an excellent location Very conveniently located among the the shops staff is very polite and friendly 
487854,Hotel Manzoni, Main disappointment was that the restaurant was really not very good Breakfasts fine but dinners overcooked , it s a beautiful hotel in the heart of both the fashion district and very near the historic district with La Scala and the Duoma very close by Staff was superb 
487855,Hotel Manzoni, There was nothing wrong , The building the decor the services all absolutely outstanding Very helpful front office staff and friendly professional Bar personal The location right in the middle of Milan s famous fashion district but still on a very quiet street is perfect for shoping And just a few minutes walk to La Scala and the Duomo Also a very short walk to the pinacoteca Di Brera and a few of Milan s beatiful less famous churches are just a few minutes away 
487856,Hotel Manzoni, Everything was perfect still there is space to improve in all aspects , We loved the ambience of the hotel and the hospitality extended to us during our stay 
487857,Hotel Manzoni, I had to put comfort at very good instead of excellent for two reasons a very small room for two which may be due to the building and b the absence of room service for hot dishes we have an early supper and had to search for the salad elsewhere Also the cost of parking at the garage away from the hotel euro 50 per day seems a bit high compared to the room rates euro 220 260 But these are really minor compared to overall experience , The location is excellent very close to city center but in the quiet one way street with nice boutiques and restaurants Very clean exceptionally professional staff very quick and professional service in general Showers fans etc are new and efficient Great breakfasts too 
487858,Hotel Manzoni, The hotel is not cheap but you get what you pay for , The hotel is beautiful and very classy in a quiet street but very well located The staff was extremely helpful I made a booking mistake which they kindly helped me solve The room was gorgeous and breakfast was fantastic with a great buffet and la carte options 
487859,Hotel Manzoni, At 6 in the morning they are carrying trolleys with dirty things in local patio making incredible noise but it s true next day after my complaints they stopped it,No Positive
487860,Hotel Manzoni, Valet scratched my Ferrari Unfortunately I didn t inspect the car fully enough on my departure to bring it to their attention , Room and bed was very comfortable Great bathroom Concierge suggested a very nice pizzeria Great location Didn t use the rest of the facilities 
487861,Hotel Manzoni,No Negative, I reserved the room after getting a very warm recommendation from a friend who uses to stay in this hotel every time he visits Milano and now I understand why It s a great hotel amazing location in a quiet beautiful street excellent staff room was very nice and comfortable so in one word perfect 
487862,Hotel Manzoni, The kitchen staff talking in the courtyard it echoes significantly and woke me up continued despite complaining to reception, Love the hotel stayed there before great location staff very friendly very comfortable albeit single rooms are small
487863,Hotel Manzoni, Good but a bit overpriced breakfast Tiny rooms Incredibly unconvenient shampoo bottles , Location if you are in Milan for shopping Overall quality 
487864,Hotel Manzoni, ir conditioning heating works noisy and disturbs sleep We heated our room in advance , Very nice hotel Great location Friendly staff Room is clean The atmosphere in the room is excellent Accessories in the bathroom quality I liked the breakfast at the hotel You can order various omelettes crepes and pancakes It s all included in the cost of breakfast We definitely want to come back here 
487865,Hotel Manzoni, nothing really, Lovely hotel in an excellent location within walking distance of the Duomo and in the heart of the Fashion district Very friendly and helpful staff one of the most comfortable beds we ever slept in excellent food We are certainly coming back 
487866,Hotel Manzoni, i didn t like how the hotel has no room service at night and the bar closes at 11, i loved the location and the staff very nice people the standard room was small so we moved to a deluxe room and it was better
487867,Hotel Manzoni, Room was a bit too small for the price though it was very comfortable Impossibility to have breakfast la carte it was either everything or nothing For a fruit a yogurt and a coffee this is what I have normally 23 euro look a bit too expensive , The position and the cleanliness of the hotel room 
487868,Hotel Manzoni, only thing that could improve is breakfast and friendliness of breakfast Team And beware when ordering a taxi you will get a Limousine which is great however extra expensive, great Hotel perfect Location room beds bath all first class
487869,Hotel Manzoni, Our room had been given to someone else upon arrival There was much consternation but all was solved with rather abrupt apologies The same staff was very helpful on finding a list back left on a taxi however So a wash , Terrific location in Milan s retail fashion district There was much to see and do and the staff helpful The room was efficient and well laid out for comfort 
487870,Hotel Manzoni, Only some minor points No complementary water in rooms and very small bottles available in fridge Kettle only available on demand Rooms a little small and pillows a bit too soft , Excellent breakfast Very friendly and helpful staff Very good service We arrived late after the Scala performance the restaurant had just closed but we were served salads and sandwiches We felt at home Fantastic location Will return for sure on our next trip 
487871,Hotel Manzoni, The standard room is supersmall , Fantastic location in the downtown absolutely beyond compare in a silent elegant Santo Spirito Close to everything yet without the crowds Warm friendly atmosphere great breakfasts 
487872,Hotel Manzoni, A bit expensive but it s not a big deal , Located in the heart of the City Center Very luxurious furniture and very kind staff Recommend to the people who wish to have a high class journey to Milan 
487873,Hotel Manzoni, The headwaitress in the breakfast room on Sunday was extremely sour A stark contrast to the cheerful staff on all the other days The rooms were a shade small , The hotel is in a perfekt location within walking distance to La Scala the duomo and the luxury shopping district and the Metro The staff most helpful and the breakfast really great We will be back 
487874,Hotel Manzoni, The room was minuscolo really no place for more than an overnight bag , Servizio splendido splendid service and lovely sense of humor Good value for being in the center of Milan 
487875,Hotel Manzoni,No Negative, The Hotel staff knew us and were very helpful I loved the intimacy of the small hotel yet minutes from the major shopping areas We enjoyed sitting outside when there were no smokers I will refer our friends 
487876,Hotel Manzoni, The shower door didn t fit well and water leaked onto the bathroom floor , The hotel is very well kept and clean We loved our room and the staff was very accommodating The location for our needs wants was superb 
487877,Hotel Manzoni,No Negative, The hotel is very well refurbished and room is super extra clean It s in a very quiet location but close to everything it s great The valet parking is really great and practical 
487878,Hotel Manzoni, Nothing to dislike , Stayed here many times it our favorite hotel in Milan The location is the best for shopping and every site to see in the center of Milan The staff at the hotel are the best so friendly and so focused on the clients 
487879,Hotel Manzoni, As in most European large cities the room was small a second case became an obstacle Prices in the dining room a bit steep , Excellent staff assistance when unexpectedly needed I was ill and the desk manager called a doctor then went to a pharmacy for my script Best breakfast we ve seen in Europe but a little espensive 
487880,Hotel Manzoni, We d all like to pay less for everything but it was worth the expense and was way less than some hotels in the area , The hotel is just the ideal package location quality comfort service and a luxurious feel without being over the top A modern hotel but with a classical feel ideally situated for shops restaurants and theatres 
487881,Hotel Manzoni, 1 The light switches were a puzzle We finally figured them out 2 You need a bar to hang two wet bath towels perhaps over the bidet 3 You need a few more drawers for clothes perhaps at the bottom of the coat closet, Most everything 
487882,Hotel Manzoni, They could have had a kettle in the room Breakfast didnt look too exciting either , Loved the warm welcome Also loved how this hotel actually felt like a hotel unlike many hotels in Europe Good location 
487883,Hotel Manzoni,No Negative, We had two rooms one classic double and one junior suite We loved the classy soft furnishing of the room The marble bathroom was spacious and clean The air conditioning worked really well for the hot and humid weather in July The classic double is a bit small in size Nonetheless it has a big and really comfortable bed a well sized wardrobe armchairs coffee table etc Our three adult children had the junior suite It was roomy for three persons The bedroom was very spacious and one felt really comfortable to be in They had no problems to spread out their suitcases and shopping The bathroom was big with marble all round like the one in the double room but bigger in size The hotel is located in a quieter street There are many high end shops in the area The metro station is approx five minute walk from the hotel and there s a taxi stand nearby Taxi fare is quite reasonable in Milan It is a good option to have when you want to go to the other side of the town to join a tour Brera is a trendy and vibrant area nearby about ten minute walk away There are lots of restaurants to choose from the Pinacoteco di Brera an excellent art gallery not to be missed to visit and lovely little shops to browse into We arrived at the hotel from Milano Centrale railway station by taxi On departure the hotel reception has arranged a Mercedes van to drop us back to the station Both fares were reasonably charged compared to those of Rome where we last stayed 
487884,Hotel Manzoni,No Negative, Appreciated kettle in the room and water bottles Breakfast very good crepes eggs Very quiet room Excellent location for shopping district Good restaurant recommendations given by front desk 
487885,Hotel Manzoni, The room was rather small , Very comfortable hotel and room Wonderful bathroom The area was full of high end men s and women s fashion emporia 
487886,Hotel Manzoni, The r ception Stuff wasn t helpful enough whenever I asked help for reservation scala of Milano going to lake como ext the answer was go to the agency which is near the Duomo Not helpful at all, Geographic situation cleanliness marble everywhere silent
487887,Hotel Manzoni, Car park services are expensive overall hotel is a little bit pricey, Clean hotel excellent location 5 10 min walking distance to everywhere you need piazza duomo shops caf s Good wifi nice interior room design
487888,Hotel Manzoni, The attitude of the staff at reception , The first stay was very good The second ont as good And the last was very bad In a room so small that we couldn t open our luggage And they didn t find anything better I wouldn t go again 
487889,Hotel Manzoni,No Negative, Very warm welcome Helpful parking the car and drawing our attention to and assisting with the city centre driving permit Terrific location and very comfortable 
487890,Hotel Manzoni,No Negative, Hotel Manzoni is classy and elegant with lovely hardwood floors in the rooms We were delighted that our room was ready at 11 00 am when we arrived and our deluxe room with a balcony at the front of the hotel was splendid It is within walking distance of the Duomo and the Vittorio Emanuele Galleria as well as the Metro stop Montenapoleone The restaurant is excellent and the staff were very helpful in giving directions to a grocery market and in confirming our early morning transportation to Milan Linate airport We highly recommend Hotel Manzoni 
487891,Hotel Manzoni, My room was on the first floor equivalent to the ground floor from my window view It was always dark and didn t have sunlight when it was sunny , Excellent Location very centralized Good staff and very helpful 
487892,Hotel Manzoni, Not such a great location for restaurants Very quiet area after the shops close The restaurant Il Salumaio just one minute away was excellent , Excellent location for shopping 
487893,Hotel Manzoni, Expensive but this is Milan , Very comfortable stay with a quiet room Beautiful marble used extensively throughout Staff very friendly and helpful Location of hotel was ideal for access to major sights 
487894,Hotel Manzoni,No Negative, Everything about this my third stay at the Manzoni was perfect Our room had a lovely small terrace over looking the delightful neighbourhood and was very comfortable The catering morning tea in the room dinner in the cosy restaurant and lunches in the courtyard was all delicious Best of all were the staff who were extemely efficient polite and friendly without being obsequious and who make the hotel a lovely place to return to each time Am already looking forward to my next stay 
487895,Hotel Manzoni,No Negative, This was our fifth stay at Manzoni We like its location near Via Montenapoleone privacy traditional decor cleanliness and quiet surroundings Very good value for money The hotel is well maintained Some rooms have an unusual layout such as a long corridor but overall the rooms are sufficiently spacious and quite comfortable 
487896,Hotel Manzoni, Breakfast room is stuffy and breakfast itself poor Standard Room is not spacious enough no place to put luggage s , Location is perfect Hotel is clean Service is good
487897,Hotel Manzoni, No ironing machine the prices of clothes pressing were expensive No coffee maker No complementary water, The room is very nice quite The bathroom is comfy well equipped The location is perfect
487898,Hotel Manzoni, I ve stayed for only 1 night so not much to tell but the sound proofing is not so good You can basically hear another toilet being flushed , The room I ve stayed in was small but compact and had all the necessities If you are staying on the first floor the view from it is boring The location of the hotel is nice walking distance pretty much to everything 
487899,Hotel Manzoni, The doorman was incredibly rude because we didn t need him to take our luggage up it was only 1 small bag Also the morning of our departure no one at the hotel understood any English and could not understand that we needed our car from valet It was very frustrating and made it difficult when we needed to get to the airport , The location was amazing
487900,Hotel Manzoni, The noise from the upstairs bathroom of running water could be heard on a morning so disturbed us , Hotel location staff etc were fantastic We would definitely return and use hotel again 
487901,Hotel Manzoni, The room was small and had no where to put our bags so had to put the two big chairs for a sitting room type of little area in the bathroom and the doorway Beds were a little uncomfortable and small Every time we left the hotel we had to give back our key to our room which was a bit of a pain as when you came back you had to ask for it again Shower was ridiculously small but a dirty floor inside of it , Was very close to the main strip called Via Montelapeleone Close the Duomo Easy to get a cab Staff was very helpful Room service was nice and spoke really good English The shower has a lot of pressure and a big shower head rain shower 
487902,Hotel Manzoni, Expensive but i guess that s central Milan Room a bit small but agan that s probably Milan , great central location but very quiet and comfortable hotel High quality finishings bathrooms towels etc Excellen staff Room service very prompt and well presented Overall expensive but a lovely and comfortable quiet hotel

487904,Hotel Manzoni, Very minor on my return from sightseeing my room had not been made up When I called they promptly sent someone to clean , Great location the hotel is well appointed and even if they were clearly very busy and full the staff still managed to impart prompt and personalized service I had bought some souvenirs from Vencie prior to my trip to Milan and needed a box to allow me to check them in for my flight home The front desk found me a good sized box and I was able pack my purchases perfectly I also found out that they had some facilities for fitness really just a treadmill a bike and some free weights in the nicely paneled basement but it was enough to ensure that I was able to stick to my running routine Breakfast was very good too quite substantial The room was a good size the bathroom quite large both decorated and finished very elegantly
