499960,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, I d give this hotel 10 10 if it wasn t for the poor sound insulation in the rooms You could hear the people in the rooms each side as well as their TVs The first night we could hear the baby next door crying at 1am Luckily I always travel with ear plugs so it was ok but given this hotel was recently refurbished it s a big shame that no attention was paid to sound insulation If I wasn t a fan of earplugs I d have been more bothered about this , This hotel was great value for money 
499961,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, Just checked out of the Hotel THANK GOD Room was OK View was GREAT and Bathroom PASSABLE if this is what matters to you go ahead and book BUT Reception is not 24 hrs the Hotel starts from the third floor of a building with offices and apartments therefore you will not be entering a hotel but more like an un clean deserted building and you have an entire floor without lift so lift to third floor starts from floor one not from ground floor The entrance to the building is also a bit creepy at night Safe could not lock and they gave us a common key to be able to open the safe Bathroom a bit outdated and rusty Shower either Too Hot or Too Cold Breakfast was very poor I suggest not to take breakfast at the hotel as opposite the Hotel at another hotel called Hotel Regina you can take a much better breakfast with the same price ,No Positive

499979,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, There were 2 taps for the shower and the water pressure fluctuated on hot and cold so it took a lot of juggling to get a shower the right temperature and keep it there The toilet seat was broken and so would suddenly slide left or right when sat on , The room was nice with a very comfy bed Despite being on a busy road the windows kept the noise out and it was very quiet The location was great everything in easy walking distance

499988,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, Small room no noise proofing between rooms cigarette smoking filtering in from neighbouring room could hear the television and chatter from the room next door all night kept me awake crowded windowless breakfast room cleaners and staff helping themselves to coffee during busy breakfast queues and jostling at the breakfast buffet couldn t eat couldn t get coffee couldn t sleep noisy small smelly grumpy worst place I ve stayed in a long time , Great location next to University and Freud Museum But you d be better off staying at Hotel Regina across the road a real hotel and at similar prices 
499989,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, Could be difficult to find but see my review No hot drink facilities in the room and water was charged at 3 5 euros a bottle , Conveniently located just outside the central ring within five minutes walk to the Rathaus and 10 to 15 minutes walk to hofburg palce Spanish riding school Convenient for trams and subway with these within five minutes walk to main intersection or just take the tram outside the front door We didn t take breakfast but there are several cafes within 200 yards and towards the tram underground junction The room was compact but sufficient as you need to be out in Vienna not taking in the four walls of your room as it has endless sights to offer The staff were pleasant and helpful To locate the hotel entrance keep your eyes looking at the signs above door level height as you could easily walk past A good marker is it is directly opposite a pub called Charlie PS And just after the Regina hotel both on the oppposite side of the street The reception is at 1st floor which is actually two floor seats up as there s is a mezzanine flooor so take the lift if you have cases Good value for money for such a good location Relatively good wifi with only a few drops in service
499990,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, It more looks and feels like a highschool dorm than a hotel in downtown vienna The reception closes at 19 00 i had to unlock 2 doors to get in when i came from dinner one in front of the building and one at the reception It is not a hotel because it does not have a hotel entrance or a hotel lobby and the reception is merely a desk where the clerk a very bored clerk handed me the two sets of keys The bathroom did not have any bathroom products besides a soap and a shower gel no slippers too , Free wi fi
499991,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, The noise the lack of help with getting luggage in and out the mould round the bottom of the shower , The spacious room The proximity to the city centre 
499992,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, One particular member of staff was quite rude and abrupt in his manner something we found was quite usual in Vienna particularly when we were not at all rude in our interactions with him Some cobwebs in the bedroom and quite a bit of dust on bedside tables The safe did not work despite following the instructions and asking reception to help us we dare not lock our passports in there so we had to carry them around the city with us We requested a quiet room yet we got placed in the room right off the dining room this room is not at all quiet from 6 45am onwards you can hear the kitchen staff preparing breakfast and other guests getting their breakfast etc Room was extremely warm the central heating was on full blast No view at all from the window just the view of the wall opposite The above points are fairly minor for the price we would stay here again as it was good value for Vienna , Big room comfortable beds Clean bathroom Good location Some staff were helpful 
499993,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor,No Negative, The locality of the hotel is absolutely perfect for exploring Vienna Everything is within walking distance and there s some lovely cafes close by The hotel itself is exactly what you d expect for the money you pay The rooms are quite small however wonderfully decorated well equipped comfortable and very clean Just what you need for a few days away The walls are a little thin and you can hear conversations from those next to you but it was bearable Very reasonably priced in my opinion We asked for assistance from the hotel staff on two occasions and they were so helpful They really went above and beyond what I was expecting The receptionists helped us with booking an excursion to the Opera and with directing us to the airport bus stop Overall our stay was great and I d definitely recommend this hotel 
499994,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, No refrigerator no coffee in room Lift entrance up a flight of stairs , Warm clean shower hot 5 mins from my son s apartment safe provided Breakfast available but I did not try it 
499995,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, No tea coffee facility No elevator facility in premises Moving bags to upper level within hotel difficult Yes it s an old building remodelled into a hotel , Good location but very minimal basic amenities Breakfasts were good worth paying for Many nice eating facilities nearby
499996,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, The bathroom is extra tiny and the taps were not mixed The room was very clean and comfortable but the bathroom facilities clean but very basic , The hotel is situated 5mn walk from a big central underground station and 15 mn walk from the museums The walk from the underground to the hotel is an avenue of the city s best caf s and cakes shops Most attractions were extremely easy to get to Also the room was fabulously quiet 
499997,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, Central location , The hotel is located close to the central ring But it is not a real 4 star hotel The pictures are not accurate at all It deserves to be rated as a 2 star hotel This is the first time after ages that booking com disappointed me

500001,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, The only thing I could fault is that there was no kettle in the bedroom , Staff were very friendly I loved the high ceilings the d cor the spacious rooms and the lovely view from the balcony Location was excellent Just a short 10 minute walk away from the centre It is a lovely walk and you basically just walk straight There are many restaurants and cafes beside the hotel which are a lot cheaper than the restaurants in the centre 
500002,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, It was very warm inside no air conditionjng We opened the windows to cool down but the bouse of trams and other traffic firced us to shut the windows , The location was really good only 15 walk from the city centre 
500003,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, The wifi internet was not very strong in our room we had to usually go down to the lobby for stronger connection If you re planning on working browsing during your stay this is a major problem , The location is great right in front of Sigmund Freud Park and the Votive Church Votivkirche There is a metro station a few blocks away The reception was helpful in booking a trip to Bratislava and arranging an early check out

500006,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, 1 The interior furnishing is not quite well maintained Extremely irritated with the uneven stretch of laminated wooden flooring near the bed as I often got kicked or tripped by the protrusion Another minor issue is the wall cabinet in the toilet that cannot be closed 2 Shower unit is relatively small even for a petite size Asian person like me At times I would hit myself as there is not much room space to maneuver Perhaps a double room unit might give you more room space 3 General cleanliness is above average 4 Sound insulation is not too good between rooms Even though I requested for a quiet room the room that s allocated to me is near the kitchen restaurant area so it seems my request was not really taken after all The above mentioned matters are probably due to the discounted price that I got so I guess what you pay is what you get , Staff at reception are helpful and friendly fortunately 
500007,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, There is no one at the reception from 8 pm till 8 am the room wasn t well cleaned it does not look as 4 stars hotel but for the low price we paid compared to others hotels what we got in a good location was enough for us, The location is good

500015,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, No air conditioner Although it is not hot outside if you open the window you cant close the curtain and very noisy since there are many bars downstairs Wrong rating by the site doesnt look like a four stars hotel should be at most three star hotel, Location is quite good 
500016,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, We had a misunderstanding with the breakfast and had to pay 60 for an ok breakfast The shower was horrible and the room didn t have an airconditioning only a mild fan This hotel is far from four star hotel as advertised in booking com , Room was clean the location is ok 
500017,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, It is definitely not a 4 star hotel in my opinion I picked this hotel instead of others which were also offering breakfast because it claimed to be a 4 star but this is not the case Also the shower was not very clean After a couple of minutes it accumulates water which is an indication that there are many hairs It was only for a night so I didn t bother Finally the room was quite small even without a chair , Location was nice and the staff friendly but nothing more A typical 2 3 stars hotel

500033,Hotel Pension Baron am Schottentor, The only downside is that some rooms are entering from breakfast area so I guess it can be loud in the morning althouth it didn t wake us up But anyway it was more then great for the amount we paid We recommend it and would definitely come again , Nice cozy apartment with friendly staff in beautiful part of Vienna Awesome double bed and very clean in a beautiful building in safe neighbourhood About 15 minutes walk from Stefanplatz cathedral Nice neighbourhood with bunch of caffees stores and nice restaurants
