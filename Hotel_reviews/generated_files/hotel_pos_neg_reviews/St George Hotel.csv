195046,St George Hotel, The staff was rude and couldn t be answer basic questions The bathroom had mold all over the expose so sections of the sink piping The bed had multiple broken springs , Location was good near the action in London 
195047,St George Hotel, I stayed 2 nights and was bitten very badly from bed bugs Since returning I am covered from head to foot in bed flee bites They are large hard red bites which are extremely itchy and unsightly and will last between 1 2 weeks according to my doctor I called the hotel to advise them I stayed in room 6 since I would not want other guests to suffer this When I asked to speak to the Manager I was told they were on holiday no deputy manager available either so I simply had to relay my experience to a receptionist who did not offer any apology or seem bothered Great location but I would not recommend you stay there since you will suffer for weeks afterwards to be avoided , Location
195048,St George Hotel, We arrived on a wet afternoon and the temperature was quite cool outside When we got up to our room room 10 it was unbearably hot We had to keep the window open all night with a fan running constantly It was so noisy and hot it was impossible to sleep We were attending an awards ceremony at the Dorchester the following day and the sleepless night had such a negative impact on the way we felt all day , Staff were very friendly
195049,St George Hotel, We stayed on the 3rd floor it got pretty hot the fan was not helping Investing in an AC or a better fan would go a long way No elevators , Location was close to train station and easy to access Room was clean 
195050,St George Hotel, One of the steps felt a bit rickety on the way down The bathroom was small but the water pressure in the shower was good and so were the toiletries , Very happy in room 18 it was in the basement so just one flight of steps to navigate The room was spacious had air conditioning and a fridge king size bed cot and seating area Great news for us when we had a baby and it was so hot outside We were visiting the US Embassy so had to check out at 7am so couldn t have breakfast but the staff kindly allowed us to leave our suitcase for a couple of hours until after our appointment which saved us a lot of trouble 
195051,St George Hotel, Very noisy in room 1 right next to front door and reception almost felt like the receptionist and guests were in our room noisy from 6 30am lovely hotel but make sure you ask not to be in room 1, Nice big room comfy bed
195052,St George Hotel, Lack of air conditioning when summer sun hits that west window No flow thru ventilation due to building design and lack of retrofitting of fans or similar Had to leave drapes wide open so fan could draw cooler night air into the room Lack of elevator lift and of help with bags when the topmost stairs are so incredibly narrow and steep When bed is made into a double king size is nice then the head of one side is right up against the hot air coming from the in suite refrigerator Uncomfortable We found the duvet inappropriate for a summer night and needed to take the cover off to act as a single sheet Bedding options limited Only one modest occasional chair Wi fi must be pretty far from the router booster needed for top floors , We slept well here 4 floors up on the back facing west is at least insulated from car noise from the street Feels private as other buildings are fairly distant nice for a crowded city Room was fairly spacious Provision of a fan without a long enough cord was valued Good drawer and hanging space for clothing Wi fi access Great location for getting out into the city with many breakfast and meal places nearby Thus we didn t eat in the hotel at breakfast Clean towels daily hot water even if pressure is low 
195053,St George Hotel, No double glazing on a busy road Not very clean No fridge in room although it was detailed in the description I ve stayed in better accommodation for less money in a similarly great location in London , Really comfy bed great location nice thick curtains good lighting Helpful reception staff 
195054,St George Hotel, We stayed for 4 nights Room 18 was in the basement it was extremely noisy up until midnight due to other guests and staff and running water in the bathroom We asked if we could be moved to another room they told us no The room was not very clean on arrival the carpet had not been hoovered we asked 3 times for this to be done and on day 3 this was done however the staff member left our room window wide open thankfully all our things were still there The room was tired and grubby , The location was good and the free wifi was helpful as I needed it during my stay 
195055,St George Hotel, Limitations of an old building bathroom fixtures getting a bit old so shower wouldn t hold position toilet flush button sticking Wednesday night quiet Thursday night really noisy party going on until midnight sash windows difficult to open or close But lovely helpful staff, Central location really nice staff free wifi room nicely decorated and clean reasonable price for London
195056,St George Hotel, The heat was too high in the room We couldn t lower it at all That s the only one disadvantage I can find , I was pleasantly surprised that for the good value of money especially in central London the room was really good clean and warm It was clean and the breakfast continental was really good as well and fresh Overall experience was really good 
195057,St George Hotel, The place was dingy not really a hotel There was no one to help us with our bags and we had to go up several flights of narrow stairs There was a small check in area that was manned until 11pm after that the place was unmanned The beds and pillows were uncomfortable The bathrooms were shabby and the bath was stained , The location was very convenient and it s a nice area The sheets were clean the hotel provided extra heaters when it was cold The rooms were tidied every day Lots of hot water The rooms were quiet and the twin room was spacious 
195058,St George Hotel, hot water is rare and scarce resource You have to wait 5 7 minutes before you get any if at all Water pressure is so low that you have a choice take a ice cold shower or not to take it ,No Positive
195059,St George Hotel, Nothing, Lovely staff who were polite and welcoming The room was lovely clean and modern and cleaned to a high standard daily The small TV room was a lovely feature and the hotel was in a great location It was actually better than is shown in the photos Would stay here again 
195060,St George Hotel, Being put into the front bedroom as the other room intended for myself up stairs wasn t ready to check into so had to put up with the endless traffic noice from outside complained to be told by managment that other guest haven t complained about the noice before next time your in London to ask for a quieter room I would have expected my room to be less noice in the first place I stay for business in London all the time all I wanted is a room to have a restful sleep I had none what so ever The manager said even if I was put into the room I asked for when booking my room that the noice reduction would be around 10 15 less only so not much of a differance how could she calculate that figure even so to tell the customer that , The room was clean comfortable
195061,St George Hotel, Everything in the room was old and sort of run down it probably looked nice many years ago Fabrics looks old the ceramic in the bathtub was wearing off and the handles are just so old the installations are not aesthetically appealing the spring mattress was also old and you could feel the springs Reception is not 24hrs the staff not very professional but nice There are lovely hotels in London for the same price unless you need to stay in this area or want a larger than usual room I would not recommend this hotel We did not have breakfast so I cannot comment on it , We booked a deluxe room the room was clean it was large had nice with big windows and a small table with two chairs by the window It was warm In the room we found a wardrobe mini fridge empty so not a minibar a small TV air conditioning cattle with tea bags nescafe milk sugar sweetner two mugs and spoons hair dryer electric heater in addition to the central heater a fan towels two glasses a safe soap shampoo and hand lotion 
195062,St George Hotel, To be honest I was more than happy with my stay I cannot think of anything that struck me as under par , Walking distance from Paddington Station and also Oxford Street The staff were very polite and friendly which made for a relaxed enjoyable stay The room was a good size clean and comfortable 
195063,St George Hotel, We found the place rather sterile No personality we may have we ll have stayed at the premier inn at a fraction of the cost , Location was just fine for our purposes
195064,St George Hotel, The place is dirty There s mold in the bathroom The noise from the plumbing is very loud at all hours The kitchen staff woke us up at 6AM both days The rest of the staff is no friendly They wouldn t move our room , Location was the only redeeming factor 
195065,St George Hotel, My parents who are in their 70s were given a room on the 4th floor with no lift There was no warning to indicate the rooms were so inaccessible and they asked to change and were refused The staff were unsympathetic even when a malfunctioning key card meant my parents had to climb the stairs twice ,No Positive
195066,St George Hotel, Top floor is awful Beds are old and the street side is noisy even late at night No elevator, Good location for getting around Most of the staff was helpful Good breakfast Very clean 
195067,St George Hotel, Basement room view of electrical equipment musty smell too crowded for 3 beds noisy quite early in the morning other guests and staff , Clean air conditioned room
195068,St George Hotel, The location was a little way out the hotel itself lacked a lift and no offer to help with any bags also no room service things which I would expect as standard from this star rated hotel , The room itself was very comfy and I had a good nights sleep 
195069,St George Hotel, The breakfast menu cost did not tally up with amount charged There was no air con in loft rooms No secondary glazing in the room which faced the main road, Staff were available
195070,St George Hotel, This hotel is not a 4 hotel The bedroom and the bathroom need a massive remodeling The bathroom was really mouldy and the carpet saw better days It was really hot in the room and no air conditioning We just had a little fan that saw better days also Be aware that there is no lift and the stairs are steep so if you are older or with kids it could be tricky , Great location 
195071,St George Hotel, Our room was at the top floor but we only brought backpacks so not really a problem The water in shower was a bit weak , Huge comfortable double bed nice and friendly staff On a quiet street with decent restaurants within walking distance perfect for a short stay 
195072,St George Hotel, Room on ground floor very noisy No lift terrible for people Living On the first and second floors, The location is very good not far from Marble Arch underground to and to Oxford street
195073,St George Hotel, No lift so impractical for older clients with luggage Booking com clients may be given inferior rooms Very busy road 24 hour heavy traffic very noisy Towels too small not proper bath towels Not a hotel but a B B guest house, location
195074,St George Hotel, Long way up 4 flights of stairs with case baggage no lift , Perfect location for where I needed to be for my course Double bedroom en suite was very nice all found to be very clean Staff friendly 
195075,St George Hotel, Very warn and gubby Beds were clean but the bathroom was dirty The room was far too hot and the Windows wouldn t open Would never stay again , Not much 
195076,St George Hotel, In room we felt hot but we couldn t open the windows , Room was spacious with all facilities in it Location is just perfect About 3 or 5 mins walk to oxford st and marble arch tube station
195077,St George Hotel, I am lucky enough to travel to different countries on holiday and I can safely say that this was one of the worst 4 stars hotel of my life We were placed in room number 9 This room was badly in need of a good clean The room had stains and damp on the walls Net curtains and carpet were dirty and very dusty I couldn t sleep because of the dust from the curtain There was dust on the light switches sockets headboard lamp shades and the past client left a clothes lable on the tv screen that wasn t removed when we arrived It s not a 4 star hotel which it claims to be in my view 2 star is enough Three beds were squeezed into a very small room which was billed as a triple room Breakfast was very poor for the price of 10 Not recommended , Location perfect for Oxford Street shopping
195078,St George Hotel, The third floor Not specifically disable friendly as has a lot of stairs to most of the rooms , TV available alongside a large mirror Great little room 
195079,St George Hotel, Windows rattled all night so much traffic noise from the road The bed was too hard and the toilet made noise for 20 mins after each flush Staff were not overly friendly , The location was good 
195080,St George Hotel, Reception was uninformative There is no lift and I was up 4 flights or more of stairs carpets were in a poor state and were not nice to walk on no slippers provided The bed sagged and was not comfortable I didn t eat breakfast so couldn t comment , The location was ok with little street noise The room appeared clean 
195081,St George Hotel, Can t think of anything , Very convenient location having a room at the rear of the building meant it was very quiet Only stayed one night and didn t have breakfast but would definitely be happy to stay longer 
195082,St George Hotel, It s not a 4 star hotel which it claims to be it s a B B The shower is terrible and the heating was on throughout the night which made for an uncomfortable sleep, Location is the only redeeming feature of this property 
195083,St George Hotel,No Negative, I did not stay there but my relatives They enjoyed and the staff was really great ready to help in any situation Charming hotel nice clean and great location 
195084,St George Hotel, We were in a basement room next to the kitchen and breakfast room which meant we were woken at 6 50 each morning by noisy staff preparing breakfasts The room was small the tv didn t work properly the fridge hadn t been cleaned out and there was musty smell 3 beds were squeezed into a very small room which was billed as a triple room , Good location
195085,St George Hotel, Room was on a fourth floor with very steep stairs and NO LIFT Being asthmatic this was an issue but the only offer was to a third floor room the following day Room was very small bed was two singles pushed together and had hard edges in the middle Bathroom tiny Obviously a small attic made into a double room which it was not , Location was good for many of London s attractions shopping theatres etc
195086,St George Hotel, Didn t realize there was no elevator Would have preferred not to have to climb all those steps But a minor inconvenience , Location is superb Very central easy access to transport Room was good size comfortable bed 
195087,St George Hotel, The air conditioner broke down suddenly but lucky it was a chilly day and our last night As our room was next to the breakfast room we could hear the talking from our room , Location is excellent
195088,St George Hotel, Bathroom was in need of refurbishment bit smelly too The room was at the top of the building there is no lift and the steps are very very narrow , Fab location close to all atractions

195091,St George Hotel, Our rooms was on the fourth floor and I have a bad back Staff were mainly functional rather than welcoming Breakfast was very average and expensive , Location and cleanliness of room
195092,St George Hotel, Television reception was terrible Kept breaking up so rather impossible to watch Power outage when I returned on the second evening so I had to wash and brush my teeth in the dark Went to front desk and was told it would be fixed in about 15 minutes which to be fair it was but I think that perhaps I should have been offered some compensation free breakfast room rate reduction , Central location and near the conference I was attending Perfectly pleasant although not exceptional 
195093,St George Hotel, The essential net curtains and carpet weren t the cleanest , A great location very central Welcoming helpful staff we had a room on the first floor which meant only one flight of stairs and the manager carried our bags for my daughter and I The room was small and along with the bathroom is somewhat dated with dark furniture but it was quite acceptable The fan was welcome as it was hot when we stayed This hotel is very good value for money which is its best asset just a few minute s walk from Oxford Street Marble Arch and Marylebone Road Recommended 
195094,St George Hotel, no lift had to bring our own bags up to our room we were on the second floor but it was four flights of steps, Rooms were very clean We were three to a room and found it a decent size Room was close to Oxford street and a 15 minute walk to tour bus station at Marble Arch Hop on hop of are the way to go
