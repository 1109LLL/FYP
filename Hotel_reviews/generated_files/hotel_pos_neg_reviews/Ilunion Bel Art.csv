370265,Ilunion Bel Art, The shower floor was slippery , The room was clean and comfortable with a window overlooking the street The lobby decor was interesting A couple sidewalk cafes and a grocery were very close The staff was friendly and very helpful While not in the center of things metro stops were 4 5 blocks away allowing access to pretty much anywhere 
370266,Ilunion Bel Art, Took forever to check in At least 15 minutes waiting the another 15 minutes while the guy checked us in Filling in all kinds of forms Scanning in passports of all guest for a 1 night stay Sign forms all sorts That was rediculous Then the key cards for the door have to be put in a certain way If u do it wrong then the card is deactivated and you have to go back down to reception to activate again WiFi was terrible No wnglish channels on TV Audio language selection option had been locked on the TV remote Only 2 small milk sachets yet 10 or more tea and coffee sachets Bathroom tiles and floor were grubby in areas Hadn t been cleaned properly Hotel overall is OK but it s positioned on a steep hill so it s hard work in the heat walking to and from, The beds are very comfy The air con was nice
370267,Ilunion Bel Art, The room was very basic and a high price for a location a good 4 miles from the beach Staff were helpful when asked but there seemed to only be about 3 staff that worked there Value for money wasn t there and it certainly is not a four star hotel If they had said they were 2 3 stars and knackered 250 off of the bill then that would of made sense I would return to Barcelona as the beach and port is fantastic but not with this hotel We found we had to rely on walking or the metro to go anywhere , The cleanliness of the hotel was to a good standard
370268,Ilunion Bel Art, Nothing that we can remember, Excellent housekeeping service Helpful reception staff Convenient location close to the main sights of the city Cozy and quiet rooms
370269,Ilunion Bel Art, The lobby was not very inviting and the space did not make best use of its potential The breakfast was expensive 14 a reason I did not eat at the hotel but you can get breakfast nearby for far less 2 4 If you want to stay in central Barcelona l Example Passseig de Garcia its about 1 5 miles away , The room was a good size included a refrigerator a wardrobe closet and coffee tea with kettle The bathroom was great modern larg great shower The property is located near Alfonso X and you easy access to the Sagradia Fam lia 5 miles and many restaurants near it Park Guell is in walking distance too Quiet neighborhood The hotel is on a main metro line L4 with access to central Barcelona or the beach without having to change lines 
370270,Ilunion Bel Art, We did not have very good luck this time We changed our room after the first night because of a clotted shower and a broken tv Then at our thrid day we were stucked in the elevator for 10 minutes It was not very nice , The staff was very helpful and kind 
370271,Ilunion Bel Art, To be completely honest it was way too expensive for what you get Yes the hotel rooms are nice but the location really isn t the best We had to walk miles to get to desirable areas and the restaurants around the hotel are either non existent or just not good Wish they were more helpful with finding reserving taxis as well , The rooms were comfortable The shower head is amazing and they are very generous when it comes to extra towels and linens Our room was throughly cleaned everyday which we really appreciated the staff is very accommodating 
370272,Ilunion Bel Art, The cups in the room is not clean enough and the scent in the hall is really really strong , The location is good There are some bars nearby which offer food with reasonable price 
370273,Ilunion Bel Art, Noises from in the hall other rooms were very noticeable Cleaner came in even when there was a do not disturb on the door, Sergio was extremely helpful Room was lovely Bed was comfy Air con was good Pizza delivered to the room door was so tasty 
370274,Ilunion Bel Art, It is not close to sea staff of the day were not so kind But in the night shift responsible person was very friendly Breakfast was a bit expensive, Cleanness Comfortable area good facilities Good offer in the period that we wanted to stay Actually we had booked this property one night in advance 
370275,Ilunion Bel Art, The Bad For the price there is no breakfast included breakfast is 14 pp In fairness you are told this when booking In my opinion it should be included My advice to people staying here pop out to one of the many local food places for a much cheaper breakfast The Ugly Staff are rude inconsiderate and perhaps even incompetent Allow me to give you just a couple of examples of why I say this if I gave you all the examples during our stay this would be a thesis Think expensive Fawlty Towers 1 We arrived at the hotel to be grunted at by the reception staff Initially I thought we could win him over with a smile but no Everything he had to do to check us in came with an exasperated sigh Everything he picked up he made sure to slam back down on the counter We were made feel very uncomfortable no greeting or basic manners 2 Reception will not answer when you ring them from your room Many things went wrong with our room every time we tried to ring reception they never answered on the 4th time having to trek to reception I asked why the phone was not answered the reply was a shrug perhaps it was broken I asked if it was going to be fixed Again another shrug I asked when it would be fixed got no answer This was very frustrating 3 The circuit board tripped in our room we had no power That was not our issue as sh t happens our issue was with how the hotel dealt with this We arrived back to our hotel with 30mins to get our mobiles charged get back out to meet friends for dinner No electricity I walked down to reception phone calls are not answered to tell them this They offered us an adapter I explained that that will not work as there is no power Receptionist came up to the room to plug in the adapter walk away We called him back He just looked at the plugs shrugged yes it seems to be the 1 communication method here , My friend I stayed here for 5 nights in June this year It was not a cheap hotel to book so we expected to be treated well during our stay sadly this expectation was short lived The Good Hotel is modern and has an art deco vibe when you walk in Rooms are normal size well decorated Big bathroom Mini fridge in the room Air con that works Toiletries provided in bathroom Daily room cleaning Clean towels TV in room Good storage space Near a metro station that is a 5 min up hill walk
370276,Ilunion Bel Art,No Negative, Excellent service The room was very modern and practical Wouldn t hesitate to stay there again Is located in a very safe and pleasant neighborhood The facilities of the hotel were in great shape 
370277,Ilunion Bel Art, Everything was perfect Nothing to dislike , Everything was pristine clean great quality and wonderful location 10 15 min walk to the beautiful Park Guell and 10 min walk to Sagrada Familia location was excellent for our short trip to Barcelona 
370278,Ilunion Bel Art, Room was small There was no place for wardrobe or a chair in the room Even our two suitcases was a real problem because we couldn t walk in the room , Bathroom was very nice and comfortable The personnel was very helpful and pleasant 
370279,Ilunion Bel Art, Location was good but it was still a walk from center TAking taxi to center was best option if you don t want to exhaust yourself taking the metro , Hotel was good Rooms were a good size 
370280,Ilunion Bel Art, No swimming pool or sauna lol not a great loss though considering all the other great things to do in barcelona, Felt comfortable clean and had an excellent cheap little local bar 1 min walk away and a cheap reasonable restaurant with big servings 2 mins walk away and a nice park for children across the road soccer goals table tennis tables playground etc
370281,Ilunion Bel Art, Room cleanliness was marginal at best with much dust everywhere and a few dead bugs in the same spot for several days Repair crews entered room without giving advance notice and left room dirty , Nothing really stood out during our stay 
370282,Ilunion Bel Art, No complaints , Excellent English spoken at reception Pretty good location In a quiet area but not too far a walk from main attractions 15 min to Sagrada Familia 30 to park Guell and a short walk to the metro Accommodations were excellent very comfortable bed excellent bathroom shower facilities Many freebies even a comb shower cap shaving kit 
370283,Ilunion Bel Art, When we arrived we noticed it was very cold in the room When we asked the reception to help us use the air condition machine to warm the room we were told they stopped the heating in the hotel The situation is unacceptable from my point of view for a 4 stars hotel where we paid 200 EUR night , The rooms were clean The hotel is well positioned near metro station and Sagrada Familia walking distance The street is very quiet
370284,Ilunion Bel Art, My room didn t have natural light The window looked out on a wall which had a mural painted on it but I could not see the sky There was never anyone in the lobby No atmosphere I spent very little time in the hotel just to sleep and shower , I didn t eat in the hotel I considered the breakfast too expensive
370285,Ilunion Bel Art, Heater function was turned off yet the average temperature in Barcelona during our stay was still in the 50s When I informed the front desk they just issued us blankets Also the window in the room that we stayed at faces a wall it felt like a prison Cleaning staff also do not replace toiletries unless you ask them that is if you can find them All these for 260 average per day ,No Positive
370286,Ilunion Bel Art, In my opinion they re not enough facilities for the price that I paid No bath robes or slippers Reception staff only greeted when I greeted first , The hotel very clean and the temperature in the room is also very nice The location is also good 10 min walk from the Sagrada Familia 5 min from metro and 3 min from the bus 
370287,Ilunion Bel Art, I can t comment on anything I didn t like, The whole experience wan nice every one that works in the hotel is so nice and friendly they treat you like a friend the Room was super clean comfortable and pretty I would totally recommend it 
370288,Ilunion Bel Art, Too far from la rambla and the beach bar never open in hotel lobby , Really nice that was out of central Barcelona a little but probably not as handy if you wanted to be where everything was going on Very modern hotel and extremely clean 
370289,Ilunion Bel Art, The room had back inside machinery view so kind of missed being able to open windows and enjoy the view Reception explained they were remodelling the front rooms so not their fault Although rooms are of convenient size for a double it gets a bit too cramped when the sofa bed is open to turned into triple room Nothing major but would have been nice to have a bit more space , Staff was extra helpful and kind Reception made a mistake but apologised explained and we got a fruit platter for the inconvenience It wasn t necessary but was a nice touch Very well located Sagrada Familia restaurants cafes metro station and bus stop were at walking distance We were very happy with this 
370290,Ilunion Bel Art, This is tiny No iron in rooms or face cloths to wash face with, Great place wonderful staff everything is close as this city is walkable if u like walking and it s only 5 mins from metro so clean and comfortable beds As we were friends travelling we wanted two singles not a double as we requested on booking We were told after booking this was not possiable Note toooo late to cancel booking as no refund we spent one night in a double bed this is too small for friends but great for couples But we were moved the next day to two singles which was fantastic The stafff were wonderful And made our stay much more relaxing as room was a better size for two friends
