240328,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, The room was very small and consequently so were the shower toilet generally making the stay uncomfortable This was a classic double I would upgrade if I returned there , Location in Montmartre is terrific just below the Scare Coeur and near bars cafes and restaurants Lots of steps in the area though something to consider for those less mobile 
240329,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, Staff were a bit inconsistent some staff were very friendly and attentive whereas others were indifferent and not that helpful Temperature control was difficult to manage even though the air conditioning was set to cool in the evening we d wake up super hot and clammy The mini bar fridge wasn t cool enough to store goods so our foods and drinks went off Location wasn t great it was also on a hill which made it difficult for transporting luggage using public transport The internet was not consistent it kept cutting in and out no matter where you sat in the room , The fact they had complimentary afternoon tea and appertifs with snacks e g croissants for afternoon tea and savoury biscuits for appertifs was a nice touch but it would ve been better if they had complimentary breakfast or morning tea as generally tourists are out in the afternoon evening sightseeing It was nice that there were plenty of nice restaurants nearby Rooms had a Nespresso machine but there was no milk and no milk frother so you pretty much had to have your coffee black 
240330,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, No, This was my favourite hotel we stayed in on our recent trip Europe Location was perfect Room comfortable and clean Loved the atmosphere created by colors and the artistic murals on the wall Staff were incredibly helpful and friendly Would definitely stay at this hotel again
240331,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, Some surfaces and couches were dirty On departure reception we re unable to call us a taxi though we had a short walk to the train station , Staff were extremely helpful on arrival Gave us a map with local sights etc perfect location around the corner From Sacre Couer and gorgeous Montmartre streets A quiet comfy nights sleep here 
240332,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, The hotel wasn t flexible when I tried to change the date due to an unexpected operation , Sarah is an amazing receptionist thanks for your help and kindness again 
240333,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, Room service although advertised was practically non existent when I wanted to order a snack I received a recommendation to go to a restaurant nearby , A very nice hotel in a prime location on the Montmartre hill The room was good sized nicely outfitted and modern 
240334,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, Not conveniently located up hill and many stairs from nearest metro Located in questionable area where felt unsafe at night Rooms were so small no room for toilet bag in shower Dated and dim lite rooms , Nothing
240335,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, The night concierge rude and helpless we have no internet in the room ok can t help he didn t even try to restart router we asked for bottled water he said was finished so we should drink from the sink really really not nice There is a very bad smell at reception breakfast area the rooms are not so nice as described in the website quite disappointing overall, Was nice to be so close to the Sacre Coeur Basilique receptionist Sara very polite
240336,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour,No Negative, The love theme is carried through the hotel some might say a little ott but why not great fun and it works Position is great and surprisingly quiet Not a great deal of tourists in that patch Bar Botak next door a sort of local 
240337,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, The lift was very small and narrow corridors made getting to our room with luggage challenging At least there was a lift though There was no iron and ironing board in the room which is something we value when travelling , The ambience had a unique theme of Amour The staff were very friendly helpful and professional The Montmartre location was superb Our room was clean quiet and comfortable 
240338,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, The wifi kept disconnecting or not working at all The price didn t include breakfast , The room was spacious and clean Each room was themed differently after a couple with pictures and quotes on the walls The amenities were great as well 
240339,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, The shower taps be careful a bit awkward otherwise fine , The Location decor and the facilities nearby It was a very pleasant stay for three nights One of the receptionist was very friendly and helpful 
240340,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, The bathroom needed some work done specially under the shower , We stayed in the hotel for our anniversary so the love theme was perfect for the occasion Also the staff was really kind and attentive the room was perfectly arranged when we arrived with ballons ans macarons and the bed was very very confortable The location was a great bonus of course 
240341,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, 1 The hotel did not offer what he said when I rented room on booking com 2 The walls of the room was very dusty 3 When I book the room there was a little box with the mention BREAKFAST INCLUDING but after I do the check out from the hotel they put me to pay 35 euro very unfair to me and shame to the staff VERY DISAPPOINTED , Nothing special
240342,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, Dirty room Hearing ventilation s noises all of the night Bathroom too small Room not really clean No fridge No breakfast Elevator too small 1 person , The location The staff
240343,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, We assumed that the Deluxe room would have a view we were on the ground level of a small internal courtyard looking at 4 air conditioning fans which we could hear the hum of in our room We would have hoped for a street view or at least been told that there were no views as it was a deluxe room,No Positive
240344,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour,No Negative, If I could give 15 out of 10 for location I would Montmartre is a MUST see area for anyone visiting Paris and the Hotel Montmartre Mon Amour made our stay extra special The staff go out of their way to attend to you the service is most excellent and while this is definitely a love themed hotel it was just the right level of cheesiness to be fun Highly recommend
240345,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, Internet was really almost not available If you need internet It is not good place to stay I bought some fruit and left it in my room When i come back I noticed some of fruit was taken I think it was probably cleaning people , Friendly Staff thank you Sarah 
240346,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour,No Negative, The staff here is absolutely fantastic The rooms themes are just the perfect extra magic touch Lovely location too a few steps from the Sacre Coeur 
240347,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, The room is quite small and when you have a bit more luggage it gets really cramped especially if there s two of you , Location is really good as it is just a step away from the Sacre Coeur 
240348,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, Rooms were pretty small for price The theme of the hotel might not be the best for families , The hotel has a theme which goes with the Moulin Rouge area that is near by Location was good hilly part of Paris but not far from metro and train Great staff Good cafes very close

240358,H tel Montmartre Mon Amour, Water pipes above our room were a bit noisy and didn t have a view at all from either window but it didn t matter as we were out most of the time , Location was excellent at foot of the basilica rooms were small but beautiful all rooms are small in Paris staff were so helpful recommending restaurants looking after luggage and book on river cruise Definately worth paying the extra for deluxe room
