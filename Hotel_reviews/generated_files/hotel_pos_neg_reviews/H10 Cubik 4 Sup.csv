468819,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, , Excellent location Very clean rooms Delicious breakfast including local food Smart industrial design A very good option for a city break in the middle off the town 
468820,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, It can be difficult to get a lounger in the day there are only 8 but if you re going out and about then this is a very minor issue Plus you could upgrade to a room with a balcony and that would solve the problem , The hotel staff were amazing they could not have been more friendly or welcoming without being pushy The arrival drinks and bar vouchers were a really nice touch I would recommend the white wine The location of this hotel is perfect So easy to walk around the city but also right next to the metro to get to the beach Hundreds of great bars and restaurants nearby to suit all price ranges yummy crepes 2 minutes down the road and within 10minutes you can be on La Rambla DO was extra special with delicious food for our anniversary meal Barcelona has something for everyone food art culture watersports nightlife and this hotel makes it SO easy to find what you re looking for It is part of the H10 chain but it feels like an independent because the staff are so personable and invested in you having a good stay 
468821,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, We didn t go with the breakfast option since 23 Euro seemed like a lot for breakfast , The hotel is in a central location and has a great balcony Welcoming staff plus a welcome drink and another complimentary beverage 
468822,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, Everything was perfect Staff room breakfast and location Loved rooftop terrace and interior of the whole hotel And thanks for the welcoming drinks 
468823,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, That we couldn t stay longer , Everything Most wonderful location and excellent levels of cleanliness Fabulous design and incredible staff Brilliant rooftop with delicious food and drinks and view 
468824,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Rooftop pool was very disappointing mis match between website image and reality a wading pool only lucky if 3 feet deep , Very generous size rooms Breakfast facilities excellent Last day was an early start to train station the kitchen staff kindly offered to make up a picnic pack which would be at reception on check out great service 
468825,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, My only complaint would be that the downstairs basement restaurant area had a musty smell No other complaints , Great room Jr Suite had everything we needed Very comfortable cozy Stayed here for 2 nights but wished we had stayed longer Rooftop bar had a nice view of the city Room service was very good Great neighborhood to explore 
468826,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Had a room with an interconnecting door which meant some noise flow from the next room which was a bit embarrassing late at night I suppose that can t be helped , Stunning bar and library area downstairs design and art and furniture A Lovely views from deck helpful patient staff helped me with organising tix for outings Loved our stay 
468827,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Pool area is a bit small can be crowed sometimes , Very friendly staff the looby bar and library downstairs are lovely awesome decoration The room is spacious totally clean and the big windows makes all the diference I definitely recommend 
468828,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, The rooms were stylish and very comfortable and the staff really couldn t do any more to help us enjoy our stay This really is the best place to stay in Barcelona
468829,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Extra bed in room for our 4 year old was a sofa bed it wasn t suitable at all For a hotel that was apparently opened in 2015 it felt a bit rough around the edges e g shower door kept sliding open The terrace and pool upstairs wasn t particularly inviting felt like a lot of people there weren t hotel guests Not a 400 a night experience , Room was a good size and location was great for getting out and exploring Barcelona 
468830,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, I wish it was an adult only hotel It is a little small to allow for the noise of screaming children through the thinnhotel walls and ruining the calm mellow music on the roof top bar pool It was be 10 in my opinion if there were no children For this reason we will not stay here again and instead look for an adults only hotel in the same area , I loved the relaxed atmosphere and stylish deco
468831,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, The housekeeping was very sloppy and even rude at one point Screaming and noisy children ruined a couple of calm days on the terrace sunbeds Fantastic bar but noe hang out spot Few people , Hotel with excellent location great amenities and perhaps the best breakfast we ve had in Barcelona The roof top terrace is cozy with nice view and great drinks
468832,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, It s a bit of a cheek to list the pool as anything other than a paddling pool It s about 5 or 6 metres long and no more than 60cm deep end to end It really is a paddling pool Our room was quite small and there s nowhere to put anything nowhere but the floor for a bag or case , The hotel is nice it s not knock out or amazing but it is new clean and modern We didn t bother with breakfast as the hotel is so central that it felt a shame to have another generic breakfast when there s so much to choose from just a few minutes walk from the hotel Everything about the hotel is fine but I think I was hoping for a bit more at that price point 
468833,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, The rooms are a little small There was no desk or room for one I would have liked tourist information While I don t want to be swamped with advertising it is helpful to be given some recommendations of things in the area including hours and other heloful tips , The bathroom was luxurious The beds extremely comfortable The location was great We could work almost anywhere and were near a subway to go anywhere too far to walk to 
468834,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Lovely view from 1st floor forward facing room but some traffic noise, Warm welcome with attentive very pleasant staff at breakfast serving wide range of delicious food Loved the surroundings and atmosphere at breakfast Beautiful artistically designed hotel Spacious comfortable room with large bathroom Room faced very pretty street Excellent central location close to Gothic quarter short walk from airport bus 
468835,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, we initially had an interior room much too small and not clearly indicated on booking website it would never have been booked we had to get an upgrade for a larger exterior room i e with window at additional cost pet peeve no hooks or shelves in bathroom, great staff comfy beds big washrooms nice rooftop lounge
468836,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, The bedroom and bathroom had great decor the rituals products were great robes were very comfortable The roof terrace was the highlight gorgeous views great food and drinks Decor of the hotel was superb the staff were very attentive couldn t fault them at all I would definitely stay there again and stay at h10 hotels elsewhere 
468837,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, Friendly and immaculate Attention to detail Made a fuss of us as celebrating my birthday cake and bottle of Cava delivered to our room on arrival and also a few days later on my actual birthday Roof terrace bar and pool with view of Barcelona also great 
468838,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Small pool Sunbeds usually busy Poor light and view in rooms facing patio , Great location Friendly reception staff Cool hotel design Nice rooftop bar 
468839,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, I loved the roof top bar I did not try the little pool but people were sunbathing and enjoying the sun It is a great place for lunch or a drink The breakfast room was quiet and the service was good It was my birthday and they brought me a surprise sparkling wine and cake so the staff takes notice of things like that Via Laietana is a noisy busy street but close to shopping restaurants metro stations etc I would book a room on a higher floor preferably facing from Laietana if possible The terraza upgrade is worth the money 
468840,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, The first night we had a room that didn t have window only to the indoor stairs which gave us claustrophobic feeling , The final night in Barcelona was great as we had a room with terrace to the courtyard It was small but clean and nice 
468841,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, The pool was very small shallow If you like to sleep in perhaps ask for a quiet room as the cleaners were rather loud in the mornings vacuuming into my door Breakfast really expensive 23 euro per person , The Rooftop Bar was a stand out beautiful views plus the food and drinks served delicious Beds were also super comfy Great location 20 minutes to the beach 
468842,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, I did not notice a gym , The hotel was very well run A big hotel with plenty of space and everything worked like clockwork and was clean Staff very friendly attentive and committed 
468843,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Switched to a room with a window to the street as the rooms with window facing the courtyard were quite dark Booking com did not clearly differentiate between the rooms The hotel was great but that issues with booking com they also charged me a higher rate than I initially selected when I checked out were unacceptable I ll book with the hotel directly next time , Great lobby lovely fresh OJ on with cava arrival Nicely decorated room 
468844,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Room was not ready when we arrived however we communicated earlier That s ok in principle but did not seem pollite not to inform us till check in and everything completed and the payment is done A little expensive Not enough sitting area only one armchair Not nice view from room at back side No balcony, Perfect location at center but very quite area Bed was extremely comfy Two sinks in bathroom More than enough toliettaries bathrobes slippers Water boiler and ironing facility in the room
468845,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, A big thank you for the thoughtful gesture by staff at H10 cubik for a chilled bottle of cava and yummy chocolate cakes in honor of my husband s birthday You made our trip to Barcelona even more special 
468846,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, The bedroom was odd shaped and the breakfast room was in the basement They don t tell you they will serve you a full breakfast if you ask Otherwise European buffet The junior suite was not no much a suite as a slightly larger room , Loved the roof deck and showers bathroom 
468847,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Rooms overlooking the road can be a touch noisy The traffic noise is mostly muted by keeping windows closed , Staff were attentive and friendly Roof top bar was great spectacular views 
468848,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, The rooms were spacious and clean the bathroom well stocked with robes and toiletries and the bed was huge and comfy Very convenient location to public transport and easy to walk to the main tourist attractions 
468849,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Im nitpicking here but the Coffee was mediocre The amazing breakfast compensated for that , Building interior and exterior deign The room was superb The staff were very friendly and the overall service was excellent 
468850,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, The Hotel was great especially the location which was very central and within walking distance of a lot of Barcelona The interior was very stylish and our room was lovely The staff were extremely friendly and helpful although not very keen on giving out extra tea bags I would definitely recommend staying here and would come again 
468851,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, Staff went out of their way to help when we had a problem booking an attraction The food was excellent and the design was beautiful which made it a pleasure to have cocktails on the roof terrace tapas and San Miguel in the lobby and dinner in the restaurant Would definitely return 
468852,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, They weren t able to clean shoes which given the weather was soaking wet for two full days and my shoes needed drying out and polishing was a shame I had two rooms and neither of them had a great view , Welcome drink voucher was welcome Bed was comfy Room amenities were good Breakfast was good Car park handy but expensive at EUR 22 for the night as was the breakfast 
468853,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, More people on the front desk please Lot s of guests you need more people ready all the time to assist check in and check out or consierge requests Staff is great 1 more guy and you are done as perfect , Nice Hotel good location clean room nice view The room is not so big the bathroom it s quite big Beautiful terrace and design pool Stilysh choice 
468854,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, There isn t much I can think of it was a nice stay If I wanted to be picky I would say the tea selection wasn t great but that s really the only thing I can think of , The room was quite spacious for two people and the bathroom was actually extra large which was nice There was absolutely no noise from other rooms or the street unless you opened the window We went to the Palau de la Musica and it was literally a stone s throw away which was great The airport bus is a quick walk away as is the subway We didn t really visit any restaurants around there but I saw a few that looked good Hotel staff were attentive and friendly the offered welcome drink and chocolates plus other sweets at reception were a nice touch The rooftop bar was also very nice for a view of the city at sunset we didn t use the pool but it looked inviting Wifi in the room was easy and quick and we appreciated the nespresso machine for our morning coffees 
468855,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Only a tiny desk and bench for furniture No chairs tables luggage racks or other comforts We were tripping over our stuff that had to be left on the floor Staff could have been much more responsive also View from room was terrible clothes drying in people s backyard and dogs barking , Very clean 
468856,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Nothing, We were celebrating my partners birthday and can t think of anywhere better to have done so To start with the staff brought complimentary Cava and cake to our room as a gift from the hotel which was completely unexpected The hotel is placed perfectly in easy reach of everything The roof terrace and pool area is unbelievable offering and unparalleled view that you could never tire of The staff in the hotel were really friendly and no task was too small We can t recommend H10 Cubik highly enough We love Barcelona and will definitely come back and stay at H10 Cubik again 
468857,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, Great hotel in good location very comfortable room but the window looked into the inner lobby so no view not that this was a problem as we were only there for a weekend break All the staff we met were very friendly and helpful the complimentary glass of cava on arrival was a great start to the weekend 
468858,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Our original room had a window looking onto an internal light shaft where there were corridors and people could look in if the curtains were not drawn Luckily we were able to move to a room with a street view , Great central location close to the Aerobus drop off at Placa de Catalunya Quirky reception rooms and great terrace with bar at the top of the hotel The reception staff were most welcoming and went out of their way to be helpful even letting us use the computer to book tickets and print them out For breakfast there was a choice of hot and cold food which was beautifully presented 
468859,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, There was no hairdryer in my room I called and they told that one will be brought to me immediately It unfortunately never made it to my room , The moment I arrived at the hotel I felt very welcomed The lobby is nice bright and smells so good The room is spacious and clean The Hotel is perfectly located so you can reach pretty much everything in the city 
468860,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, The hotel is pretty central good transport links approx 50 mins away from the airport using the Metro The staff is young and very friendly The design of the lobby was really nice and also the room was good size with great views on the 5th floor The breakfast is also good with all the basics and also hot meals choice like omelettes and pancakes from the meny at no extra cost The rooftop bar restaurant and terrace are amazing for drinks and meals Great for chilled eveinings with your friends before a night out 
468861,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Not really everything is good But only the Lift system is not good and smart enough And the smile of one of the floor are not good at moment because of the cleaning but their nice staff help change to a good floor very quickly , Good Location in city center Nice staff and gave good advice for traveling Very nice lobby and sky bar Comfortable bedding 
468862,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Some basics re thoughtfulness in bedroom i e no rubbish bin in room other than tiny one in bathroom difficult to get into cupboard not all products restocked by housekeeping etc Breakfast insanely expensive given cheap tasty options nearby , Renovated room with unusual stylish bathroom Rooms very quiet a nice change Quirky setting lots of light street noise minimal despite being on 1st floor Great to have Nespresso in room Rooftop views great nice place for an evening drink Excellent location for Gothic Quarter El Bonn both food markets walking to main sights etc 
468863,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Not much view from the room , Perfect location for seeing Barcelona Easy walking distance to Las Ramblas El Born and in the Barri Gotic Staff was exceptional Splurged and got the junior suite very spacious Rooftop terrace was very nice restaurant was good recommend the lamb Very good breakfast Windows very effective at eliminating travel noise slept soundly 
468864,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, Will book it again for our familly stay in Barcelona later this year Location is perfect After walks in the town you can relax in the roof top terrace great espresso good quality cava perfect view Spacious suit well organised space love the art and design Stuff personal approach you don t expect that from a chain hotel All for a very reasonable price 
468865,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Breakfast for 23 just to expensive , Design Bathroom Small details like complementary water in the room and water juices and snacks at the front desk 
468866,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Nothing negative to say We had a perfect trip highly recommend this hotel , The staff are so nice and helpful the hotel is beautiful The location is perfect just about everything is in walking distance The skybar is cosy and nice and quiet Room and bathroom very clean and comfortable Really made our trip extra special 
468867,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Beds hard as a rock And shower while looking cool gets water everywhere, The lobby and terrazza is beautiful Front desk very kind to help with dinner reservations 
468868,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Receptionist on arrival was rude and we had to argue to get the twin room we had booked she was trying to get us to take one king size bed then suddenly a room became available not a nice start to our holiday Our twin room was small and looked out on a big white wall , Rooms were soooo clean roof top bar is amazing
468869,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, None that I could think of , The hotel itself is beautiful even though its in the center The staff is very nice the beds are amazing big comfortable clean The staff is very kind they are able to provide cabs recommendation anything you require 
468870,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, I loved everything The room is equipped with all the necessary staff including the ironing board and coffe making facilities They even provide 2 bottles of water per day 
468871,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Somewhat overpriced, Excellent location Comfortable spacious room junior suite Good sound isolation given that the hotel is on a very busy street Care for details like fresh flowers in the room free Nespresso coffee tea water etc Excellent breakfast
468872,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Only one minor comment for improvement There is a small working table in the room without any electricity outlets near by This is a major issue for any business traveler such as myself, Great location and great room One of the best buffet breakfasts I have experienced and I travel a lot
468873,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Breakfast was too expensive for what it was , The beds were very comfortable shower excellent and everywhere was very clean The roof terrace and pool was outstanding Reception staff were very helpful and check in was perfect with a nice welcoming drink 
468874,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Breakfast bar is very good but pricey 23 EURO It would be a good price for lunch but buffet closed at 11 I wish they would stay open little later This is my personal probably it works for most other people I like to wake up later , Very friendly and helpful staff Room is very spacious and clean Bed is super comfortable Terrace bar and pool are very nice I loved decor very unusual and modern Really enjoyed the stay Great location close to everything 
468875,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, I had my 50 year birthday and the hotel sent up champagne and cake It was great Location great the room great and the bathrom fabulous The balcony upstairs good but the swimmingpool is perhaps not as big as one would think looking at the photos 
468876,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, Fabulous stay Friendly helpful staff Great accommodations Breakfast is not to be missed a buffet like no other coffee was the best in all of Europe 
468877,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Nothing The photos made the room look much smaller Both bedrooms and bathrooms were quite big , Rooms are very new and clean Professional and attentive staff Very nice design of the exterior and interior Would come back again to this hotel 
468878,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, Excellent location The staff were helpful in helping us with printing our train tickets We highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona 
468879,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, I chose this hotel for my first step in Barcelona also Europe in Chinese New year vacation It didn t disappoint me Everything was perfect Nice staff great service When I walked in hotel they said Happy New Year to me and gave me a free upgrade to a suite That was definitely a wonderful experience I know I will come back to Barcelona one day then I will choose this hotel again 
468880,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, The bar on the top flour is boring inside we didn t had chance to see the terase as it was raining outside , I loved the lounge area Nice breakfast buffet We were 3 friends staying at the jr suite great to have a big bathroom 
468881,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, nothing at all , We arrived 4 hours too early yet our junior suit was available it was large convenient and looked precisely like it s pictures Someone realized my wife had her birthday during our stay Room service surprised us with free nice bottle cakes and a kind note from the manager The place is stylish very unusual in a good way Public space is divided so as to makes one feel as if in someone s home Stuff were very kind and helpful Didn t eat at the hotel nor use the roof pool came in winter when temp was very cold Lot s of good eating options just nearby Would happily make this hotel my Barcelona Home 
468882,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, The toilet in the bathroom was a little awkwardly placed , Reception service was fantastic I requested a bottle of cava to celebrate with which they also added some lovely macaroons Location coffee machine iron bed rooftop bar heated pool all great 
468883,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, When making the booking it said 1 single bed and 1 double bed but was informed on arrival that family room had sofa bed not single bed Was disappointed but when we saw it the sofa bed was huge and the other bed was a queen size Good size room if you have older children with you , Staff were really helpful and friendly Couldn t fault this hotel in any way Location was brilliant 
468884,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, Could not have asked for a better and more comfortable location My partner and I were celebrating a special occasion so they upgraded us to a room with view for free and brought up to the room a special treat A bottle of bubbly and strawberries dipped in chocolate Best start on this visit to Barcelona 
468885,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, The breakfast was a bit too pricey for what was offered Additionally I wanted to get a massage but couldn t find anything inside the info booklet in the hotel honestly I was also lazy to ask the staff , The bed was great the room amenities are amazing you have a coffee machine inside the rooms The bathroom was also spacious and amazing the design of the hotel is impeccable The staff was very polite Would really recommend and already did to my friends 
468886,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Honestly I have no complains that s unusual for me so you guys are doing a good Job , I like that there was complimentary coffe in the room and of course welcoming drinks are always nice Staff was super friendly and helpfull It was my girlfriends birthday during our stay and when we came back to the room on of the staff members brought as a botle of cava and a lovely chocolate cake that was a wery pleasant surprise Thanks again for that 
468887,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Welcoming should be better they told us checking in is at 15 00 which we have waited more than 4 hours, Great location very convenient and awesome decoration
468888,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, The odor at the lobby area too much eucalyptus but thats minor Perhaps the lobby bar could be more lively I think they are missing something there but it might be the season I can see some trendy tapas and some cocktails , The decor and service were great Outstanding English skills Beautiful bathrooms Great breakfast and the event lady and the reception desk were all very friendly 
468889,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Liked the whole experience Can t think of anything I didn t like , The style of the hotel including the furniture art colours and patterns Very funky and friendly Staff were excellent always friendly and helpful 
468890,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, All was amazing only thing to notice is that the basic rooms may have a window only to the inside patio of the hotel , Amazing hotel for this price range Great service great room great lobby for meetings nice roof deck with a small pool
468891,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Nothing , Clean nice lovely hotel with great breakfast and in the perfect location Above all the staff is amazing Thank you all staff members David Jerano Albert and everyone else Just great people 
468892,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Great hotel in many ways unfortunately are they using an air freshener in the public areas that made both me and my friend a bit sick If they would stop using that I would definately come back ,No Positive
468893,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Free drink at the hotel bar on the roof seemed like a plus but the waitstaff up there seemed less than helpful , No matter what you want to do you ll be in the heart of the city staying at H10 Cubik The location is close to everything from shopping restaurants cafes and museums You ll have no issues getting to all the nightlife on Las Ramblas or along Passeig de Gracia The hotel is super clean the room was spacious and well appointed and the staff were exceptional We would definitely stay here again 
468894,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Nothing everything was perfect , The staff were outstanding They went the extra mile way to make our trip extra special as we were celebrating a birthday Excellent location rooms were gorgeous brilliant views from rooftop terrace 
468895,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Rooms need to resize, Location was perfect They offered me room with city view online later at check Inn they give me a room facing back of hotel some poor dirty building Terrace was so big without a view and room was so so small even one cannot stand with a luggage inside the room May be the fare is only for a great location 
468896,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, The location was perfect and the staff very helpful We ended up on the 7th floor in a room with a balcony overlooking the City a very nice surprise Clean room and an excellent rooftop bar 
468897,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, An odd overwhelmingly rich and pungent perfume on entering the hotel foyer that if deliberate is a significant error in taste The lifts are slow and the rooftop bar was a little dull and given the rest of the offerings in the city probably best avoided Also being asked to join the membership of the hotel to improve the room wasn t appreciated at the hour of check in after midnight Being told that I had a small room and so should become a member to increase the comfort meant I had to challenge this in finding the confirmation of the room booked it was a superior double , A decent hotel for a short stay The rooms had good flooring plenty of space and full length windows The location is pretty good in terms of proximity to the main sites but this also meant that it s on a somewhat generic street You have to walk somewhere else to experience the city I didn t have the breakfast there were plenty of interesting options around the city Staying here is absolutely fine for a short stay but we shouldn t pretend it s anything beyond a solid experience and for that I think it s slightly over priced 
468898,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Pricey right on the edge of discomfort , Bed was high side comfortable bathroom large and showers new design Bring your electrical converter Found plug inside the safe for recharging devices Great location not in touristy area Quite secure from street thieves common in Barcelona Good local restaurants in neighborhood and great bar 
468899,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Unsightly graffiti could be seen out of our window on neighbouring houses , There was a great selection for breakfast The roof top terrace was a lovely place to chill out with a glass of wine I loved the pots of sweets around the hotel 
468900,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, The hotel is centrally located with easy access to old town port and public transportation Five minute walk to airport bus The staff were exceptionaly helpful and friendly The room is bright modern and tastefully decorated with alll the necessities My wofe and I were very happy and plan to return in the near future 
468901,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, Location close to everything The rooftop was amazing The beds were super comfortable And the whole vibe was very cool We loved it and would definitely stay there again 
468902,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Rooftop bar service a little slow, Rooms very modern and junior suite spacious Rooftop is brilliant and comfortable Great way to wind down after a day out exploring Helpful staff welcome drink was nice after a long flight 
468903,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Like a lot of Barcelona hotels out room was overlooking the internal covered courtyard this makes the room quiet and away from street noise but its also makes it very dark and not a place to relax during the day , Fantastic central location and wonderful roof top bar and terrace with affordable drinks and friendly service
468904,H10 Cubik 4 Sup,No Negative, I emailed them before our stay to say our trip was to celebrate my Mum s 60th birthday When we checked in and went to our room we d been upgraded to a suite and they d left us a bottle of Cava chilling in an ice bucket and cakes such a lovely touch 
468905,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Nothing, Location perfect for everywhere Hotel team very attentive and they provide little extra special touches Beds mega comfy and ambience of roof top bar perfect for chilling with a warm blanket they provide and a lovely glass of Rioja 
468906,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, I paid a little extra for a better view but was given a room on the second floor with a view of flats with washing hanging out Also the bed was a little hard, The breakfast was excellent Service and front reception very helpful We loved the sweets that were scattered around 
468907,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Long waits for the elevator but luckily i found the stairs which were much quicker , Friendly staff nice clean room great rooftop terrace with small pool Very cheap compared with other hotels at least at the time of booking 
468908,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Nada, Warmy welcome with free drinks Designed environment Spacious large room very confortable bed so cosy and nice like at home Nice located Perfect Place to enjoy Barcelona 
468909,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, I certainly didn t like how the stuff was very not helpful They forgot about my late checkout didn t order a proper sized taxi and was very unpleasant, Location is great that s for sure I liked the interior very much and I just fall in love with the bathroom 
468910,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, The room was a little on the small side but the outside terrace was a bonus , The roof top bar is a real plus and the tapas and wine were all excellent Really appreciated the complementary drinks in reception on arrival and the roof top bar The staff were all very helpful and attentive Our room was very quiet 
468911,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, We got dropped off by our taxi at the entrance and had to carry our bags into the reception and then also up to our rooms no one to help us with that which was disappointing We were on our honeymoon and let the hotel know before arriving but again no recognition at all from front desk on this which was a shame given the two previous hotels had given us various complimentary gifts gestures to celebrate the occasion The roof top bar is nice but nothing special and the pool was roped off with caution tape both nights we went up All relatively small things but when you pay a certain amount and it is meant to be 4 star you expect a certain standard , the ground floor lobby reception area is very nice and unique with great artwork and plenty of comfortable lounge areas to sit down and relax and a nice bar too We stayed in one of the junior suites and it was nice without being amazing good size bed nice shower and well layed out 
468912,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Nothing Everything was amazing , Great rooftop bar and drinks comfortable beds and lovely bathrooms It is perfect for walking around and close to shopping areas gothic quarter and good restaurants 
468913,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Didn t have any luggage racks in the room , The bed was very comfortable The staff was super Provided with welcome drink while checking in Then provided us with complimentary wine or beer to have on their rooftop terrace We were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and my birthday and they sent champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to our room one night and another bottle of champagne and chocolate mousse cake the next for my birthday They were very helpful with helping to book sites to see and restaurant reservations Very clean Good sized room with nice big bed and large bathroom with large shower Very nice hotel

468933,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Not much wrong with this place Downstairs bar staff a bit abrupt to the point of rudeness Both bars closed at midnight which seemed a bit early for Barcelona , After a very tricky drive through Barcelona stressed and a little warm we were extremely efficiently welcomed and checked into the hotel by staff on reception who topped it all off with complementary cava We were shown to our very comfortable room on the 7th floor which had great views over the city from its balcony

468966,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Not much that we didn t like The rooms are small but who cares really The walls are thin so you can hear people walking on the wood floors This didn t bother us though Breakfast seemed very expensive but they had a pretty good selection I would just walk down the street and grab a quick bite for 5 euro instead of 23 euro though Roof deck bar was just ok but glad they had it It s worth grabbing a drink one night The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful but you will get better deals in the bus shows etc if you just order online , Great location Near everything but not too noisy or crowded Tour bus is just around the corner which is great Las Ramblas short walk Beach is 20 minutes or so but nice easy walk All the good restaurants are 15 minute walk Very happy with the location Very clean hotel and very modern Nice bar and sitting area 
468967,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Extremely disappointed by 2 points Firstly I asked many week in advance for a bottle of sparkling wine to be delivered to my room on arrival as this was my Wedding anniversary This was confirmed NOTHING ARRIVED The day before I asked whether we could check in early This was confirmed albeit subject to availability However when we arrived there was basically no chance as the hotel was fully booked which must have been known the day before We were even told to come back at 330 even though the official check in time was 3 The main point here is that I asked 2 very specific questions and both were confirmed in particular the bottle of wine to the room I could have asked but the moment had passed and given the cost of your hotel I really should not have to Unfortunately its the small things that make the biggest difference and Im afraid this has left me very unlikely to book with you again , Location breakfast roof top
468968,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Breakfast overpriced best to get your own in Barcelona at a fraction of the price, Good location nice terrace on the 8th floor Great nespresso machine in the room if you love good coffee Good shower 
468969,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, I had asked prior to visit for a room higher up due to reading other reviews on road noise this wasn t dealt with and we ended up on 2nd floor with lots of road noise through the night as hotel on main road Given it was a special occasion for visit and hotel informed of this I feel this wasn t taken into consideration Person checking us in at time was trying to do 2 other jobs at same time which wasn t I was impressed with, The breakfast was very good rooms clean and modern

468971,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Quite a strong perfume smell permeated the lobby and hallway areas each day we were there It would have been pleasant in smaller doses but was a bit much You could sometimes hear the staff and people next door quite audibly walking on the wooden floors next door or outside the door vacuuming the hall Not a biggie but noticeable , The Junior Suite was very spacious the bathrooms a super generous size and the waterfall shower absolutely glorious The staff were extremely friendly and helpful Its location is absolutely second to none We graciously received Cava and chocolate covered strawberries at the start of our stay to help celebrate our honeymoon The rooftop bar overlooking the city is stunning at night time Be sure to ask for a blanket you ll end up out there for hours 
468972,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Rooms could be a bit bigger but for the great price location and cost they are wonderfully appointed , Beautiful and well presented hotel in a great location just up the road from the cathedral and medieval city staff were delightful and so friendly

468998,H10 Cubik 4 Sup, Our room was fronting the street and the facade of the building is lit up with LED lighting It would be even better if stronger blackout blinds could be installed to make the room darker at night However this wasn t a huge issue for us , Basically a brand new hotel that was very well presented The quality of the finishes of both the room and the general hotel facilities were very impressive A very modern hotel The staff were amazing and were always friendly and helpful The hotel is located in a great spot Whilst not located immediately close to anything amazing a lot of great things are within a 10 minute walk or a couple of stops on the train
