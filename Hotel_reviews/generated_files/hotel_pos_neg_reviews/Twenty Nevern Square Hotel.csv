98461,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The room was incredibly small We had no room to keep our suitcases in the room we had to empty our clothes into a tiny closet and store our suitcases under the sink in the bathroom The double bed mattress was poor The air conditioning unit in the room had a hose out the window so the window had to sty open Not good when it was raining Mould in the bathroom We ve stayed in Earl s Court before and love the location and do not expect anything but a smallish room but this was quite unbelievable , The front desk staff were extremely helpful and courteous as were the breakfast and housecleaning staff The breakfast was excellent and the breakfast room bright and cheerful We loved the cappucino coffee maker available all the time 
98462,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The room we were in 1 was in the basement near the elevator machine room and an exterior entrance that maintenance housekeeping used frequently in the morning which was noisy It made it difficult to sleep in on the couple of days we wanted to get a few extra hours The bed was very hard but if housekeeping were a little more quiet in the morning it would have been fine , The location was excellent Just a short walk to the Earl s Court tube station The staff was super friendly and helpful The breakfast that was included offered many choices The room we had was cozy nice and clean but I don t think it was luxury even though it was advertised as luxury four poster bed 
98463,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The room was nice but a bit too warm , The location of the hotel and the feeling to be at home in a well decorated house Good breakfast and helpful staff 
98464,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Disappointed to find that room was at basement level There were patio doors opening on to a small courtyard but this meant that it was not possible to leave a window door open at night and as the weather was very warm this was not particularly nice Apart from this the hotel was fine but I would definitely not want a basement room next time I would be happy to stay here again as it is a very pleasant location for exploring London , Good quiet location with very easy access to buses and underground Quite a small room for a luxury double but comfortable bed and plenty of storage space if required for longer stay Excellent continental breakfast although coffee not brilliant Very welcoming and helpful staff with 24 hour room service 
98465,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Tea coffee making facilities weren t available in the room although they were provided FOC by room service , The continental breakfast was excellent with lovely fresh fruit cold meats and cheese cereals breads and pastries The room was spacious and the power shower was very good The hotel was a short 3 minute walk from Earls Court tube station 
98466,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel,No Negative, The staff was wonderful and the breakfast was delicious Anything that we needed the staff would provide for us We could order free tea or coffee right to our room at any time of day Our concierge Miguel was phenominal and so accommodating to us We booked a room with a height limitation we exceeded We emailed them before our arrival and they immediately switched our room and even upgraded us I would stay there again in a heartbeat 
98467,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Ensuite light sensor needs adjusting as long delay in turning off Wasn t happy that we were blocked in the car park because one selfish guest obviously refused to leave his car keys at reception as clearly stipulated in the booking conditions I don t blame the staff as I know how truly difficult some people can be The staff apologised profusely which is more than can be said for the guest , The staff were all very polite and helpful Nothing was too much trouble for them Lovely continental breakfast good variety Bed very comfortable great nights sleep 
98468,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Was in the annex and we were unable to open door It was laborious having to ask the reception to open our door every time who also took minutes to get in Would prefer breakfast to served until 10 rather then 9 30 No room to change in when your room isn t ready so had to use the smallest WC , The location the hotel The staff were accommodating 
98469,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The bedroom was a bit small the deck helped overcome that a little bit , The restaurant staff were amazing in fact all staff were very good
98470,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, However the little touches within the Room were not quite right for one of their premier Rooms the Bed Mattress was very hard not even medium firm but very Firm indeed most importantly the Pillows were also very firm unforgiving variety not commensurate with such an expensive and nice suite this led to a poor nights sleep You would expect natural Down feather pillows of a high comfort quality not one s your head literally bounces off No easy plug lead arrangement for hairdryer to Mirror dressing table that we could work out Most disappointingly on returning from the Albert Hall quite late but not early Hours late 11pm the two evening reception staff informed us the Bar was shut nor did they even offer us a nightcap drink which one might expect at a London Hotel such as this at this time of evening , Lovely ambience and breakfast staff very good generally Reception staff very polite and pleasant too Hotel very clean and lovely classic spacious Room which you wouldn t want to change at all we stayed in the Pasha Suite 
98471,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Never n again The mezzanine room was sub standard it was located in the building next door Locks didn t operate well which was frustrating as we had to open 3 doors before getting into the room The heating could not be turned off on the hottest day of the year when we returned to the room at midnight Discovered this at 2 am and tried to manage this situation instead of walking out of the building with my daughter Complained in the morning prior to having the worst buffet breakfast We had to compete with the staff for food as they were clearing the table and licking their knives in glee They then pushed pass our table to go outside for cigarettes the smoke then wafted in whilst we finished our breakfast I have communicated with the manager who ignored my last phone call and communication as I asked for 50 of the cost to be refunded I thought this was fair as we had the most horrific nights sleep but he refused stating that they could have resolved the issue at 2 am Let s start moving rooms sorting out the problem at 2 am Hotels need to know that this is unaccepatable service I would not recommend this place to anyone it is a shabby place trying to look good ,No Positive
98472,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, No phone or wifi signal in room in basement area but room itself was comfortable and quiet , Quiet location easy to find helpful staff clean and quiet fan in room had already cooled room during the London heatwave Good continental breakfast Will use again 
98473,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Bathroom a bit small but good shower , Excellent location as could walk to tennis at Queens Very pleasant staff and good breakfast We were able to sit in small garden late in the evening which was a bonus as there during heatwave 
98474,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Was extremely hot in the room even with fan Safe didn t work even after 2 days and more than 2 persons cleaning was extremely bad hair in the bath tub Bath robe was not replaced for second day even was dirty and left on the ground early check in was not possible and hotel didn t even reply to the question about it before I arrived breakfast is average nothing special one day was very full finnished tables wasn t cleaned no fridge frankly was a waste of money Lastly they didn t have an electrical convertor till EU all ones in the room are uk standard ,No Positive
98475,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, 1 The receptionist when I arrived was harassed and muddled perhaps because inexperienced untrained 2 The fitted carpet in my room was wet because it had been washed that day I was not warned about this 3 The room was advertised as luxury A minimum condition of luxury must be more space in the room than a narrow strip round the bed and enough shelf space in the bathroom not to have to juggle one s gear 4 A number of food items that were part of the buffet breakfast arrived on both days I was there twenty minutes after the start of breakfast 5 If you want a cup of tea before breakfast as I do because I get up early you have to go downstairs to get it as there is no room service at that time It would be much easier to provide tea and coffee making facilities in the bedroom , 1 Most staff were friendly and one was very helpful 2 The breakfast room is very pleasant and the buffet is attractive 
98476,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The ceiling in the suite was too short almost hitting the head if you jumped It gave more of a loft feel than a room , Great breakfast wonderful staff Location is great with easy access to Central London and the Airport 
98477,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, the duvet was quite heavy, Small room but lovely design not like a hotel more like a private room and in no 17 you can open your window which is perfect as you are just overlooking the back of the hotel with mature trees very quiet unless you get noisy neighbours in room 16 Aircon also very good No tea making facilities in the room but you can order from the reception via phone or as you come in fast service of tea pots on tray Continental breakfast is very good too really all you need and served in the conservatory very light and airy 
98478,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel,No Negative, The room Mezzanine is a split level room in a very old house separate to the main hotel house next door The place is very noisy at night I was up till 2 30am kept up by noise from above and below neighbours Not recommended for business trip at all Ceilings are very low both bathroom bedroom if you are over 165cm tall you will struggle bathroom shower dated not the most modern I would not stay at this property again The breakfast is only continental and you can t even have a toast If you are visiting London and looking for a quiet place to stay this is not the place Staff is very friendly but that has not compensated for the discomfort 
98479,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel,No Negative, Our small double was small but very comfortable with everything we needed It was close to the tube station but was quiet at night for a good night s sleep Breakfast was lovely in a bright conservatory room Tea and coffee were available free of charge Staff were all very pleasant and friendly 
98480,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Very squeaky floorboards , Walking distance to Earl s court station Staff polite and friendly Breakfast very nice we had the suite which was spacious with nice view of the park and spacious with small balcony 
98481,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Superior double room was small the double bed was pushed up to the wall so you have to climb over your partner to get out of bed Also female receptionist did not look up and greet us as we walked into the foyer area its not nice to be ignored,No Positive
98482,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, I have nothing to reproach I was delighted with everything Was far ahead of expectations before traveling to London, A superb quiet location Very close to the means of transport in any direction Very good breakfast fresh and tasty food I will come back with great pleasure and joy whenever I have opportunity and opportunity
98483,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, I changed room 3 times The first had no lock on the outside Terrace door which was an invitation for an intruder The second room had no bath for my young baby only a shower The third room was in a basement with no lift Stairs and fire escape to get to it with a small toddler it s inconvenient None of the radiators worked in any of the room Only a plug in heater available The third room was basically dark , Location and Miguel 
98484,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Ran out of tonic after one drink and had no prosecco which I found odd then to top it off only had 2 miniature red wines too then that was finished as well Stock the bar , Lovely staff very helpful Room was nice and very comfortable Location was good too tube station just round the corner 
98485,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The smallest double bed possible that could still be called a double and this applied to the room size too It was tiny and absolutely boiling There was a fan but it was too noisy to have on overnight And all this for far more than we usually pay in the Earls Court area NOT GOOD ,No Positive
98486,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Although tea and coffee were free I did not like having to order from reception each time and would prefer the usual tray with a sel cation to choose, Excellent breakfast Stayed in Pasha suite which was very good Surprisingly quiet considering just off Earl s Court road
98487,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Arrived an hour early and was told room was ready however when we got to room it was still being cleaned Had to come back downstairs and wait we were offered tea and coffee and within a short while we were told room was ready Room no 9 is a delux double however there isn t anything delux about it In need of some furniture in room it was very bare Plain white wall with a tv hanging on it Also a lack of plugs there isn t one plug socket by a mirror to dry hair the plug sockets are near enough on the floor on one wall away from any mirrors Very noisy in room above footsteps could be heard and banging doors No tea and coffee in rooms had to order it milk came with tea and it wasn t fresh it was those little plastic cartons of UHT milk not nice Fresh milk would of been so much better , Room was spotlessly clean Bed was comfortable with crisp white sheets Towels were soft large bath sheets and Bath robes were a added nice touch Lovely view out of window overlooking square room no 9 Breakfast was plentiful and tasty lots of choice 
98488,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The wifi was terrible the breakfast was pretty basic and the bathroom was tiny The door opened in the bathroom so it was hard to get inside , The room was clean and nicely decorated The bed and pillows were comfortable The area was quiet and close to shops restaurants and the tube station The staff was friendly Nice little boutique hotel 
98489,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Food was very good quality but there wasn t much of it Dining room was tiny crowded and noisy Coffee tea machine was not working properly For the cost of the room the standards were rather below expectation Given that coffee and tea came through the same spout on the machine the coffee tasted somewhat tea like We were in Room 1 a four poster that turned out to be in the basement Room was nice but rather noisy given that it is at the front of the building Street noise Also hallway noise as this is where staff converge to organise cleaning laundry hoovering etc Woken up before 8am with chatter outside the door Room was ok but location in the building not good for 160 expected much more Strangely there were certain things not in room something as basic as a box of tissues for instance Plug in the sink is broken so my husband couldn t fill up the sink to shave Little things but they do undermine the experience overall , Nice touches fruit in bowls free for taking and apple on the bed with a linen napkin odd but rather sweet but a chocolate or two with the apple would have been a nice touch Interesting decor antique furniture and four poster bed Location just a few minutes walk from Earl s Court was much appreciated Nice neighbourhood 
98490,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The light in toilet is automatically on and off but last too short you need to keep moving the toilet , Good location 3 mins walk to the Earls Court station The hotel is on a quiet street the room is tiny but with a nice balcony Many restaurants near by Staffs are very friendly n helpful 
98491,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel,No Negative, Friendly staff very good breakfast close to subway and therefore London within reach Room was a little bit outdated compared to what we expected and the wooden floor and drains from the room upstairs made a lot of noise However an ideal hotel for a weekend sightseeing 
98492,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, We had a basement room which was very good but it was a little noisy from creaking floorboards in the room area above The room service area was in the basement and this also generated some noise first thing in the morning not a problem for us as we are early risers but might be for anyone wanting a lie in , A very good continental breakfast Clean and well presented room and hotel reception lounge and breakfast bar area Good location near to many restaurants and Earl s Court tube station Friendly and helpful staff 
98493,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, It was hard to find something I didn t like but maybe a few extra plug sockets would be good , The hotel was beautifully clean and the staff were very helpful I would always stay here again 
98494,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, There was bad mobile coverage as I was in the basement suite Also the Wi Fi in the basement suite is far from the best , Lovely place Again And will visit again Very convenient and easy location the tube station is just a few hundreds meters away Very nice and friendly staff Nice big suite Amazing bathroom and very good breakfast 
98495,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Small details , Quirky beautiful room Form was better than overall function and we got the luxury room Nice balcony overlooking Nevern Square Garden Big bathroom Claw foot tub in the middle of the room was sweet 
98496,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The room was very small but very clean but we did not book the room until the previous night we stayed it was the only remaining room , The property was very clean staff couldn t do enough for you especially Miguel 
98497,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Nothing Its always good , Staff very friendly as always Miguel very kindly explained the new handy hotel smartphone The breakfast is alway excellent and the rooms are very clean with very comfortable beds 
98498,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, For me the biggest disappointment was that there were no facilities to make tea in the bedroom I was told I could order it from room service at any time When I did that at 7 30 in the morning I was told there was no one to bring it as it was Sunday I had to get dressed go downstairs get the tea and come back upstairs and get back into bed Not a really relaxing Sunday morning which I was looking forward to Would not have minded so much but asked specifically and was told i could get tea anytime , Great location and room 
98499,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The Wi fi signal could be a little bit better but I guess it happens Nothing else to complain, The hotel itself is very easy to find and locate just a few hundreds meters from the Earl s court tube station The breakfast was big and delicious The staff is very polite and helpful Definitely one of my favorite places in London and will visit it again

98502,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The room was very small the shower didn t empty properly the restaurant was very cold in the mornings There was no tea or coffee making facilities in the room I thought for my room it was overpriced especially for one person , Friendly staff and few little extras in the room such as bottles of water dressing gowns and apples were a nice touch
98503,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Booked mezzanine but beam jsb so low that we had to ask to move for fear of nasty accident New room smallish but charged same price , Reception very helpful in moving room Breakfast was better than expected 
98504,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Tiny room Only good for 1 person No plug for hairdryer in the bathroom No one was ever in the bar no socializing Staff were smiling and friendly but knew absolutely nothing about the surrounding area , Very clean and nicely remodeled room with nice furnishings and built in USB ports Location is outstanding 
98505,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Bed so hard it gave me sciatica Breakfast very sparse On piece of toast one cup of coffee Advertised Room Service but it only applies to drinks Very poor show as one of the reasons I picked the hotel was for this Don t ever book Room 2 In basement near staff room housekeeping Terribly noisy Staff are lovely but hard to understand Avoid this hotel Not 4 stars only 3 , The staff are very friendly 
98506,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The Mezzanine room appears to have once been a lovely room with a very high ceiling about 12 but is now split level The bathroom is is about 6 but I am only 5 11 and had to duck up in the bedroom At the headboard end the room is about 5 8 so I banged my head hard when I got up in the morning At check out the people in front of us had a few little complaints too Nothing major but as with our room a maintenance man would be a good idea , Common rooms are nice breakfast room etc
98507,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Sadly my coffee was far too strong for me but the Cappuccino I had the next day was very nice And next time I would try to get a room with a bathtub , Loved the beds and the water pressure on the shower was good and strong enough Location was very good Hotel and rooms clean and comfortable Many choice restaurants and handy shops nearby the area felt safe even at night which is important to me as a solo female traveller The staff were very gracious and went to ensure I would have a copy of the Metro in the morning even though that staff would not be in until the afternoon Loved the option of having my breakfast via room service 
98508,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Wifi connection was very bad in our room Solarium I had to stay in the lobby to do the emailing , The Victorian building provided a unique staying experience Each room has different decoration and style Earl s court station is just 3 mins walk 
98509,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, our room was a basement room and access was down passages and across 2 enclosed outdoor areas fortunately it didn t rain The room was a little cramped,No Positive
98510,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Our bathroom in Room 7 was very small But it was still very nice with marble tiles and basin sink , The staff were friendly and helpful The hotel is boutique and individual we love that It is very clean We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will hopefully stay again 
98511,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The mattress was SO hard I did not sleep at all And I usually like a firm mattress Such a shame , Staff location facilities decor all great
98512,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, They tried to convert the payment into euros at a very unfavourable rate without asking if we want to pay in euros or not I recommend all overseas guests to keep an eye on this ,No Positive
98513,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Only one issue there were no coffee making facilities in my room The hotel said to just call if you want any but at 3 am in the morning I didn t want a visitor For the price this option should be included , Rooms have lovely old world charm Staff are excellent and caring Public areas beautiful Close to the underground but on a quiet square which made the stay pleasant My room was small but well thought out so it wasn t cell like I stayed here years ago and was very pleased to return 
98514,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Staff was pleasant but need more training Access to our room was not easy and we were locked out twice and required assistance The outside door was very difficult to unlock My boyfriend and I were locked out for almost a half hour on the first occasion The staff couldn t figure out how to open the door and had to call someone else for help Absolutely ridiculous A bottle opener corkscrew should be available in every room We asked for one to use and the employee told us if he needed it back he would come in our room and get it That made us feel uncomfortable He also didn t know how to operate the fireplace Breakfast could have been better considering the price paid Eggs bacon sausage are suggested , My boyfriend and I stayed in the Ottoman suite which was absolutely stunning Very spacious room with lavish decor The bathtub was heavenly and loved the high rise ceiling We had our own private balcony with a lovely view Great location and very clean Would definitely stay here again

98517,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The room was comfortable but quite small The meat platter at breakfast it looked very processed , The staff were really friendly and you could order a cup of coffee to your room for no extra charge The room was cleaned daily and the towels were changed without request The hotel was a short walk from the underground station on Earls Court Road 
98518,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The rooms were not exactly quit and soundproof A couple a sockets did not work and the toiletseat was broken , Good location Friendly staff 24 7 open en free wifi 
98519,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, We had no in room tea and coffee no kettle but reception staff brought coffee and tea when we wanted it within minutes of asking so that made up for inconvenience, Staff were brilliantly friendly Location excellent so close to earls court tube but on quiet side street Loved our lower courtyard room 
98520,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The only minus was the area surrounding the bathroom basin as it was tiny and no room to put anything , Friendly reception staff and very attractive hotel from the outside and in Spotlessly clean everywhere Our room No 14 had a big carved bed and the sheets were crisp and the towels white and fluffy The room was very comfortable I misheard breakfast timings and arrived a little late however the lady in charge let us have breakfast and couldn t have been more pleasant or accommodating 
98521,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Room was not in the hotel and was in a house next door This was mentioned on site but it didn t feel like it was part of the hotel at all more like an apartment and I had 3 keys to get into my room Would stay at hotel again but not in the next door rooms , Nice large room in a good location at a very reasonable price for London Very clean and excellent breakfast especially good coffe Shower was powerful 
98522,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The room was very small but nice Due to the size of the hotel bar services and similar is not available but there are many rstaurants and bars nearby , Peaceful area next to the park cosy and beautifully decorated little hotel in a victorian villa Only few minutes walking way to Earl s Court 
98523,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Rooms are small Continental breakfast is okay , Great location Quiet residential type neighborhood yet close to dining and underground station Quick access to Westminster and London by Earle s Court station Staff offered to upgrade the room without being asked Piccadilly line goes to Heathrow Complementary fresh apples and tangerines were always provided and prepared coffee delivered to your room on demand 
98524,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Would have like tea making facilities and more drawers for clothes , Very friendly place providing excellent value for money and a good location close to Earl s Court tube The continental breakfast was superb Good level of comfort but service is outstanding 
98525,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, No lift in building we stayed in but not a problem for us the staff carried all of our luggage anyway Free continental breakfast not bad but could include more options, Extravagant rooms Friendly helpful staff Unique room designs
98526,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, First room offered was reeking of bleach and four poster was just a few poles wasn t like pics at all second room didn t have four poster but needed room too rest for our stay and it was our anniversary didn t want it spoilt by arguments, Love the hotel and staff coudnt have been better
98527,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Unfortunately guest upstairs above our room was extremely noisy otherwise the whole experience would have been excellent but the noise was awful Luckily it stopped by 9pm , Beautifully laid out breakfast tablecloth etc The whole experience was lovely except for the noisy neighbours Staff lovely and helpful tea served on tray with lovely china bed really comfy beautiful bathroom with gowns would definitely stay here agin 
98528,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Temperature in small double was above 25 degrees C in february Only solution offered was the advice to open the window This opened to a shared balcony fire exit structure which enabled easy access to intruders I hardly slept the 3 nights I spend there Staff was polite but did not offer solutions They advised me to contact the hotel manager via mail He reacted a week later and clearly did not care at all This is a well known problem in this hotel I heard other guests who were offered another room against extra costs Apart from the heat the room was very basic no chair no working space , Breakfast
98529,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Nothing it s always a pleasure to stay here , Excellent service from the staff and I always look forward to staying here at this hotel The staff remember me from staying here and it s close to the Tube station I get the best sleep and the hotel is very clean and breakfast excellent and great value for money 
98530,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Storage space in the bedroom was limited but for a two night stay was no problem , We have stayed here before and returned because of the convenient location good value and friendliness of the staff This time we had a slightly smaller room but perfectly adequate and the ensuite bathroom was excellent The buffet breakfast was exceptionally good 
98531,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Bathroom on the small side Light in bathroom on motion sensor so when you re in the shower stick your hand out every now and then , Nice furniture you know you re not in a chain hotel Proper strong coffee and nice tea brought to the room at any time good service Good selection at breakfast lots of fruit cooked meats and cheeses pastries continuously replenished Hot and powerful shower Newspapers to take out Very friendly staff at reception and breakfast fixed minor safe issue within 2 minutes gave us spare key Comfy wide bed No noise at all from other guests Quiet location set back from main roads so no traffic noise either 5 minutes walk to Earl s Court tube station Definitely good value for a London location 
98532,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, There were a few things I would like to see improved The windows are single glaze and difficult to open and shut Therefore a lot of draft gets in and you need the extra thick curtains to try and stem this The fireplace we did not use but would have been nice to have the option no lighter in the room No plugs near the bed Ash tray on the balcony not emptied I was under the impression smoking was not allowed anyway in hotels even on a balcony The room is in another building Featuring peoples mail on the side as you enter and in a dimly lit entrance way The doors are locked by single key security of swipe cards not used and the fact you need 3 keys to get into your room is not great one for the front door one for the hotel rooms and one for your room You only get one set too which is not great for a couple as most hotels give 2 Room service is not available in the suite , Stayed in the Ottoman Suite The bed was extremely comfortable and the room very large We are talking 12 foot high ceiling The bath in the room is freestanding and rather luxurious The adjoining wash room containing a open style shower twin sinks and toilet was clean and modern I found the room to be quiet and the overall facilities to be very adequate for the price paid The location is great too Just a 3 minute walk to Earls Court tube station The view from the room overlooks Nevern Square which is a touch of greenery in an otherwise concrete jungle The balcony would have been great to use if we had stayed in the summer mid Feb was rather too cold to use it though Our room was actually in the adjoining building but is easily accessed as it is literally next door The breakfast is continental and featured the usual cereals and fruit as well as fresh yogurt and continental meats I would happily stay here again and felt the price matched the quality being provided They were happy to hold luggage securely whilst we went to lunch prior to check in 
98533,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel,No Negative, Stayed in Ottoman Suite Definitely worth that money A big room very big and comfy bed bath and fireplace in room Will be returning one day Thanks
98534,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, I cannot think of anything it was a very nice experience and the staff was really wonderful I will recommend this to everyone I know , The breakfast was just perfect 
98535,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, For my taste the deluxe double didnt really meet a 4 star standard but for the price we paid it was ok , Good breakfast close to tube station nice room friendly staff Very good value for money 
98536,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, It was difficult to flush the toilet I feared me or one of the next guests could get a problem with a broken lever I would prefer having breakfast without being distracted by the TV , The hotel room was quiet and nicely done up with a good bed I appreciated the muesli yoghurt and the fresh fruit very much Nice bright breakfast room with nice Christmas decoration Nice people at the reception 
98537,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Didn t find TV cos hidden in a corner cupboard We weren t bothered about a TV so didn t matter to us but might to someone else Prefer to have tea coffee facility in room than have to order it although was free , Quiet room very good location for local tube Liked decor in dining room and small lounge area Reception staff very friendly and helpful Free fruit Lovely fresh breakfast rolls and croissants good selection of cheeses meats and fruit Enjoyed it 
98538,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Don t book the mezzanine room if you re over 5 foot 7 The ceilings are very low I m 6 foot 7 and couldn t stand up anywhere , Friendly staff Breakfast was reasonable 
98539,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Service not satisfactory We got the check out time wrong and when we returned to the hotel the staff had removed our luggage without our consent they did not even give me a call ,No Positive
98540,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Unfortunately the suite was not warm enough There was an extra heater but really small for the suite and even if it was not that cold was not warm enough In a that expensive suite I was expecting everything to be perfect But was not The windows are not closing properly and the room is not warm enough to be relaxed Also the breakfast was ok Not ok for an English hotel miserable bad for a European one I had much richer breakfast in two star hotels in Italy and France Not either dare to mention the differences with equal star hotels in other will countries or even Middle East countries like Dubai but for uk was ok , Center of London good value nice suite acceptable breakfast 
98541,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, light in bathroom times out after 2mins no window in bathroom so awkward when in shower and bathroom blacks out Room cold Bed creaky , Continental breakfast good view from balcony nice room layout good 
98542,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, I was in the Solarium which I deliberately had not booked and which is in the next door building I did not feel comfortable with this as a lone female traveller as far as I knew I was the only person in the building at night The entrance to the main hotel is excellent but next door was stark with junk mail on the floor A socket in the main room would have been helpful the only ones were in a very small corner of the ante room and difficult to access , Very near the tube Breakfast excellent Staff very friendly The furnishings were luxurious and very good quality 
98543,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Worst stay in my five years of business travel Hotel was booked and paid for by my company for business purposes Upon arrival to the hotel I was told I could not check in without the same card that paid for the room but as this was done via my organisation I did not have that card on my person The booking was in my name however and I offered my passport driving licence and alternative credit cards all of which were refused as an alternative I also had a printed document with authorisation from my company for the card use yet the receptionist still demanded to see the card itself before deciding to accuse me of identity theft because I did not have the card This debacle lasted for about half an hour before the receptionist eventually said that my company could send over a faxed copy of the card and a filled out copy of his specific credit card authorisation form With a business booking it is extremely common not to have the card used to pay for the room and usually proof of authorisation which I had or an alternative card which I had is accepted instead In my five years of travelling for business I have never experienced such a rude and accusatory service and after 200 miles of driving to get there it was not at all what I wanted to be greeted with Unfortunately the story does not end there I was eventually allowed up to my room on the proviso that my company would be faxing through the information in the next hour only to then get trapped in the very small lift for several minutes before finally making it to the top floor This was not the only thing that did not appear to be functioning correctly as when I arrived in the room the window was wide open it was the middle of a frosty day in January and upon trying to close the window I realised why it was open it was broken as the latch was hanging off ,No Positive
98544,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The insulation on the window Big victorian window should be better there was a very thick curtain that save me I am smoker so it will be nice to think about us Ashtray outside the property will be nice Be aware of the low ceiling upstairs in the mezzanine I am 5 10 and managed to hit my head several times if you are taller could be a problem It will be nice if the hotel put a fridge in the room in the future Even a small one The orange juice at the breakfast has very strange taste Don t get me wrong it is lovely place and probably I will book it again just pointing some weak spots , Good location around 200 m from the Earl s Court tube station Nice area and place outside the hotel The staff at the hotel is very helpful The mezzanine where I stayed was very good Lot s of space Quite unusual room on two levels and i like it The bathroom was very nice Complimentary mineral water

98554,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The breakfast room was quite small and fairly busy on account of every room deciding to turn up 5 minutes before service ended Myself included The four poster in Room 1 creaked considerably if two people were engaging in energetic activities This can be avoided if activities take place across the bed as opposed to along the bed , The staff were exceptional with their genuine desire to assist and accommodate us The hotel was clean warm and quiet

98559,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel,No Negative, The hotel has a luxury attention to detail feel about it and doesn t feel like it is part of a standard chain It is large enough to feel anonymous as a single female traveller but small enough to feel personal Have stayed many times over the last 5 10 years and like it very much 
98560,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Solarium room had a few odd features My 82 yr old mother really didn t enjoy the long steps up to the door and there is no hand rail for the steep internal steps down from the door to the beds and bathroom facilities The window against which one of the twin beds was situated was cold at night my mother covered it with her pillow The room was crowded for two people with no bedside tables and one electrical outlet around a corner in an inaccessible desk area for lamp radio kettle hair dryer phone and laptop chargers Hot water tap in the toilet basin was not functional turned on , The breakfast was fresh and nice The shower was good and hot and we liked the beds and bedding once we d untucked everything so we could get in People were friendly 
98561,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Weekend staff particularly an indian man was not friendly and i assume that has no clue of what good customer service means Abrupt and ignoring way of communicating makes me think that I should not make it a 6th time in the hotel , Ottoman Suite is the best 4 times stayed before and never regretted Total relaxation

98575,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, I would not recommend a small double room for a couple The room was too small and very hot There was a fan but even with that and the window open it was uncomfortably warm even in November , Location excellent couple of minutes from tube station 
98576,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Alhough the staff were always happy to provide hot drinks I would have liked tea and coffee making facilities in the room and also some slippers I don t know anyone these days who uses trouser presses perhaps the hotel could provide an iron and ironing board instead The building is quite old and creaky and one can hear a lot of noise from outside in the corridors and from adjoining rooms my room was downstairs in the basement next to a service room and I could hear the staff unlocking the door moving cleaning equipment about etc extremely clearly This didn t really bother me but it might be something that would affect noise sensitive people It s possible that the rooms on the top floor are quieter , The room was really well heated which is unusual for England especially in old buidings I greatly appreciated that It was also great to have a big wardrobe space and plenty of coathangers plus bathrobes and toiletries and complimentary water I liked the fact that the windows were able to be opened and that there were both slatted blinds and also thick curtains The bed was very comfortable I had booked a four poster room with nice crisp linen and good pillows plus I was happy to find a pure wool blanket in the wardrobe for one extra chilly night There were many different staff members on duty during my two day stay but all were friendly and personable 24 hour reception is always good to make one feel safe The location is excellent as Nevern Square is very quiet but it s only a few minues walk to the tube station

98583,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, My only gripe and this is nothing to do with the hotel is that it is very close to the Heathrow flight path so there were planes coming over continuously from about 5 30, The room was small but very comfortable the shower was hot and wonderfully powerful breakfast was lovely and set me up for the day and the staff couldn t have been more helpful The cleanliness was excellent throughout

98637,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Room 25 is in the building next door and is a mezzanine split level room It has a very low ceiling and the bathroom is on the level below which can prove difficult in the middle of the night , The location is ideal for getting to west and central London Have stayed in other rooms which are better 
98638,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The room was a little small but more than adequate so nothing at all , It s perhaps the quietest hotel we ve ever stayed in no noise from outside or in including no plumbing noise at all Staff were all delightful and helpful There was a welcome fan in the room Good value for London and even locked parking spaces 
98639,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Breakfast is very basic The place is a bit thread worn but the staff does keep it clean I asked for ice one evening and told there was none , Location on quiet street 2 blocks from Earls Court Tube station and several pubs wide selection of inexpensive restaurants and some supermarkets Reasonably quiet for a London B B but will hear neighbors if they are loud

98644,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The fact that staff every half an hour went out on the step early in the morning and late at night and smoked We were staying in room four and smoke kept coming in our room, Location and comfort
98645,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Receptionist was hardly able to speak English Junior suite was underground next to service personnel maintenance room etc awful experience We only stayed one night and left to another hotel However needed to cover the full cost Not 4 star hotel ,No Positive
98646,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The room was far to hot We came into the room with the window wide open and fan going and it was still 25 degrees in the room This was left on all evening until we returned at 11 30 and it was still far too hot It wasn t that hot outside it was almost as if the room was being heated Bought this to the attention of the staff in the morning who didn t seem that interested Tiny room Our bags took up entire floor space , location
98647,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel,No Negative, Nothing was too much trouble for the staff they were attentive at all hours of the day and night and they were friendly We got upgraded which made for an even more special trip A truly incredible stay at a perfect hotel It was incredibly clean very nicely decorated and extremely good value for money for a hotel so wonderful in such a prime location Will definitely be visiting again 
98648,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, How long has the lift been out of action Could there be a modern air conditioning installed in the room which could get very hot , Great location and very friendly helpful staff Nothing was too much trouble Comfortable quiet clean room with very good bathroom Very good breakfast 
98649,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Cold croissants at breakfast, The room was lovely with a very comfortable bed and super spacious bathroom We were upgraded on arrival Tea and coffee available on request and brought to room quickly This is nicer than drink making facilities in roo
98650,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Lack of AC in the summer months made the room like a sauna , Loved the friendly staff They went out of their way to make us as comfortable as possible 
98651,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, How dare you ask me this question , I have stayed here before It is an oasis of calm in London just around the corner form the tube station a few great restaurants close by easy walking distance to places like the Natural History Museum etc Rooms are large but not huge HOWEVER please be aware that the quality and attention gone into the rooms and service is BEYOND THE USUAL LONDON HOTEL If you are working in London and want somewhere that will look after you in a personal and small high quality setting I cant recommend this hotel and the staff enough 
98652,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, No wifi connections as we were told we have been upgrated but we wre in a lower ground floor instead with no line and no wifi connection, The cleaninless of the property
98653,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The room was tiny only 9 square metres There was no air conditioning and it was so stuffy that we could not sleep Should not be a four star hotel , it was in good central location and the staff were lovely
98654,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, no air conditioning the room was in another building having to go through shabby dark hallway to get to it bad door locking system , the staff were nice the location was central 
98655,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The very first words spoken to us as we arrived were not Hello or Welcome or How was your journey but in fact I need your credit card The final words spoken to us were not Have you enjoyed your stay or Was everything OK but Everything s paid I don t know where the marvellous staff were who ve been mentioned in other reviews but there was no sign of them during our stay If a room is so small that you cannot fit in a double bed that each person can get in from their own side it shouldn t be sold as a double room A very average stay with a great need for staff training in evidence , The hotel is in a good location in Earls Court Continental breakfast was ok though staff offhand 
98656,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The room whilst very big and on a split level was extremely noisy from the people walking around upstairs and slamming doors to the other tenants guest arguing partying until the early hours Little to no sound proofing which is a real shame The room was clean but the cushions bed cover not quilt were not very clean which gave the room an unkept feel , The staff were great nothing was too much trouble 
98657,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Lifts were broken for entire duration of my stay As I was on the top floor this meant innumerable hikes up the stairs sometimes with heavy luggage Completely unacceptable for the price I paid, comfortable enough room but small Stayed during the hottest part of the year so the room was like an oven even with window open and fan switched on Nice enough breakfast 
98658,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Think we realised the mezzanine had low headroom hadn t realised just how low Wasn t an issue for us would be if you were 6 or taller Bathroom was nice but a bit smaller than we anticipated , We booked this stay to have some just us time together so was hoping for a room we could just stretch out in some comfort slow down and quietly spend some time together It was utterly perfect the mezzanine bed platform is just perfect for lazing around in comfortable but unpretentious luxury Bathrobes and towels were great quality and generous both in number and size it may be a bit of stereotype but still tend to find it holds true that bathrobes if they have them and towels are good indicator of the care and thought a hotelier puts into their rooms and taking care of you In this respect and all others can t fault 20 Nevern Square Thanks for a great stay and I m delighted to recommend you to others without reservation 
98659,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Lift did not work for entire stay Allocated very small room on top floor involving many flights of stairs No compensation offered Noticed a gas leak whilst there but felt the staff did not deal with this properly We ended up summoning a proper gas engineer ourselves , Good location nice breakfast

98664,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, noisy fan but needed it as really hot and sticky quite small for a deluxe room, lovely linen robes nice bathroom great staff good breakfasts great location
98665,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The room we booked was not available when we arrived They tried to upgrade us to the Scheherazade Suite which is in the basement off a yard which had no windows It was like a dungeon and totally unsuitable We did not accept it and were given a smaller room which was comfortable but not what we had booked It was a shame as the hotel is nice and if you get the nice big room you book then I would have no hesitation recommending it , Nice friendly staff good location and nice breakfast 
98666,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, it said in the description on the booking site that we could have breakfast brought to the room which we where looking forward to but when requested we couldn t have this service in our room which was disappointing , room was gorgeous exactly what was pictured 
98667,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, No airconditioning had to leave door on to balcony open all night 3rd floor Lift broken Thin walls woken both nights when other guests came in early hours of the morning , Continental breakfast good Room was clean with comfortable bed even if room a little small Balcony made up for this but only because the weather was good

98671,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The floor in the room is very squeaky when you walk across it The gentleman on reception at night was much less pleasant and helpful than those on during he day he told us breakfast was until 10 30am but neglected to tell us it was 9 30am on weekdays , Stayed in the Ottoman Suite good sized room nice quality furnishings nice bathroom Daytime staff at reception and breakfast room were extremely helpful Wifi good Continental breakfast was lovely Good value for money 
98672,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The bathroom needed a deep clean There were hairs and dust down the side of the shower cubicle and the shower head was dirty Would prefer a tea coffe tray in the room rather than having to ring reception for refreshments , Location was excellent and the staff very friendly Room spacious and bed comfortable 
98673,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Staff not overly polite espescially whoever was at reception during the night and for what you would normally pay for the suite I think 175 a night its not a great room But for the 99 we paid it was fine , They upgraded our room which was really nice of them the bed was huge and comfy Lovely bathroom shower was super powerful and generally nice room 
98674,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel,No Negative, Quiet area across from a lovely private park but very short walk Earl s Court station easy to access without the feel of being in the middle of traffic city Particularly easy access to Heathrow 40 min on the Piccadilly line 
98675,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Air conditioning Had there been hot humid summer nights think sleeping might have been impossible despite a very comfortable bed , Staff excellent and friendly Food breakfast only of high standard with plenty of variety Hotel spotlessly clean 
98676,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Room could of been bigger we were upgraded to luxury double as no small double left If that was a luxury double would love to see a small double for the price , Clean friendly and good for transport 
98677,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, basement room had no window only a door leading to a small patio however kitchen was located off the patio and the noise for preparing breakfast started at 7 a m , great staff especially miguel at the desk 
98678,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Wasn t aware of basement room upon booking plus when arrived about 11pm staff member barely spoke English Very noisy bed in room above me Downstairs smelt of cigarettes when arrived Poor cleanliness in bathroom TV in cabinet whose doors barely stayed open No mention of having to pay extra for cooked breakfast despite paying for breakfast with room Overall a little disappointed , V helpful and polite staff in morning nice continental breakfast Bedroom comfy

98681,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Floors are very squeaky and interrupted our sleep a lot plus there was a lot of noise from outside , The bed was very large and comfortable as was the room I stayed in the ottoman suite which was decorated beautifully and had private balcony 
98682,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Staff not very helpful Room facilities listed were not all present no alarm clock no iPhone dock no bathrobes no tea or coffee facilities and the WiFi never worked We asked for knives and forks and the reception said he was busy with something at 21 30 and we will have to wait we never received them There were incredibly loud people in the patio talking from 12 00 to about 1 30 am we were unable to sleep and when called the reception at some point to ask them to be quiet he was stern with his voice and did not do it as the noise and talking went on for another half hour or so Breakfast was nice The rest of the staff were very nice only the evening receptionist whom seemed to hate his job , The room and bathroom were nice 
98683,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, We had a Junior Suite which was in the basement it had no windows except by the front door I would stay there again but not in that room , Staff were excellent friendly and helpful
98684,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, I booked in advanced and specifically requested to not be placed in the basement unit given all of the other negative reviews of basement units Unfortunately we were placed in the basement This is partially because when we checked in they didn t have our reservation This is because they relied on paper printouts for guest details The room we had essentially had no sunlight Also the bathroom lights went out While the hotel did fix the lights they left the repair ladder and equipment in the bathroom and we had to remove it ourselves Finally while wifi was supposed to be included it never worked and no this wasn t user error I work in IT and understand wifi networks very well There are definitely better hotels in the area for the same price point or lower I would advise others to choose a different hotel due to the quality of the facilities and rooms If you do book avoid the basement at ALL costs , The location was very convenient for exploring London It s a very safe neighborhood extremely close to the tube station very close to several tourist attractions and lots of good restaurants pubs etc near by The staff was very warm and welcoming Even with a very early arrival they accommodated us by storing our bags and even offered to provide a very early breakfast 
98685,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Room 19 not worthy of 4star Suites look amazing but not even choice of teas no lift to Ottoman suite No tea making in smaller rooms Shame three keys to suite but none marked time wasting , Great location Room 21 is tiny but with a beautiful balcony Staff a are very friendly and helpful

98688,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Size of the bed Queen was more of a double and filled the very small room , The staff was very friendly and tried to be helpful Breakfast was decent 
98689,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, the harshness of that east european receptionist doesn t fit the kindness of all the other staff , great individual cozy hotel at perfect location and great value
98690,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, I honestly wouldn t change anything about our stay but if I had to nit pick I personally prefer softer pillows and would probably check into a larger room next time Also egg and maybe bacon should be added to the continental breakfast Although even if nothing changed we would most definitely choose 20 Nevern again Awesome hotel and staff , The location is excellent The staff are all very friendly and accomodating I left my phone charger after we checked out and they went out of their way to find it and keep it safe for my relative to collect later in the week There s no tea coffee facilities in the room but you can order this unlimited and for free 24 7 to your room which actually works out better Husband and I were attending a seminar in the area so didn t stay in the room much but after a long day 20 Nevern is a treat to come back to 
98691,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Could have done with some air con as it did get a little warm in the room , Breakfast was excellent and the room although on the small side was comfortable and clean
98692,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, One can find fault with any hotel really but my only comments are the room was quite warm even with the windows open and slightly dark due to the trees across the way in the local garden Neither were really a problem I simply slept on top of the cover , The hotel is nice is handy for the tube station and is in a quiet area The breakfast room has been added and is really a garden room which was lovely It was bright and airy and the continental breakfast which was very adequate was nicely laid out The lift is small but despite reading complaints about it we found it perfectly adequate and at least there IS a lift Staff were all very pleasant and helpful Instead of having a tea coffee making facilities in the room one can order tea coffee from reception It comes quickly and with a tasty biscuit very nice 
98693,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, the room we had was very noisy from setting up breakfast time above the bed creaked badly there were no tea coffee making facilities and the toilet roll was not stocked up on cleaning room all the rooms i went in were overly hot , the staff were very friendly and the breakfast was good 
98694,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Nothing we can think of , Wonderful place Fabulous breakfasts Very comfortable room Lovely staff Walking distance to Earl s Court and train station 
98695,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The size of the room it says 12 square meter It looks like it is smaller than that seems like that bathroom included with room size , Very good location clean bed room and comfortable near the tube 
98696,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Were in basement room was nice but next to elevator Light and fan stay on for quiet some time and is supposed to turn off Also personnel have their break in corridor , Nice and quiet area location close to restaurants underground 15 min to fe Waterloo station 
98697,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The way that they accuse you of stealing a TV remote when it was not even in your room when you booked in and charge your credit card for it If they treat there customers as badly as they have treated e they will be out of business pretty soon , location
98698,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, I only wish our room would be a bit bigger Everything else was great , Cozy hotel with wonderful stuff Our room was quit tiny but clean and comfortable Location was excellent quiet neighborhood great access to central London 
98699,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, paper thin walls and ceilings with late night and early morning disturbance when people were moving around one decent night out of five made this London trip one of the most exhausting Don t take the mezzanine room looks cosy but its so stale and no proper ventilation in sleeping area , breakfast was good and access to garden with quiet fresh air to start the day 
98700,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The shower was not very hot and I didn t like our subterranean room although it was spacious there was very little natural light and I felt a little claustrophobic because of that , The staff were very friendly and courteous and the bed was extremely comfortable The entire hotel was clean and well taken care of and the location was very convenient for us 
98701,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, the bed was huge but the mattress was not the best the only minor fault , The sheer size of the suite was amazing The tasteful decoration The Clawfoot bath in the room The double height ceilings Incredible value for money for London especially as breakfast was included Wow
98702,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The bed mattress was a bit lumpy and not the most comfortable ever to sleep on , Great value for money The hotel s staff is amazing always willing to help with any issue always smiling and liikable The hotel s location is super great 2 minutes from earl s court station on the Piccadilly and District line very useful to get from or to Heathrow airport and anywhere in the city Not too far to get some rest during the day and go back to the city for dinner or night visit The continental breakfast was great and surprisingly satisfying A lot of restaurants coffee places and shops very close to the hotel on Earl s court street Definitely will come back to this hotel on my next visit to London 
98703,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Room too small no space for a table and chair Would have preferred to have kettle tea coffee available in bedroom rather than have to phone desk service , Good location Very comfortable bed Excellent breakfast with lots of choice Nice touch to leave fruit and bottled water in room Staff friendly and helpful

98707,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The standard double rooms are both too small and badly laid out Definetly not be enough for 2 It should be possible to open both close the closet and bathroom doors at the same time , Overall the hotel is a nice place to stay The breakfasts are excellent Would definetly stay again in a larger room Far better than other small independent Earls Court hotels 
98708,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, 30 day parking charge needs more prominence in Booking com listing particularly when you are under pressure to confirm booking very rapidly ie only 1 room left pressure , Staff friendly helpful Continental B F excellent Showers VG easy to use Everywhere Clean Comfy bed Well written hotel guide in room
98709,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, On this occasion I didn t like the room I stayed in basement junior suite room 3 as the chair table didn t work height wise so I couldn t sit work chair was way too low there was no mobile phone reception the TV was left of the bed so you neither watch to from the bed or armchairs comfortably It is a double bedroom not a suite Please don t be put off though as generally the other rooms are great staff are welcoming , Location is spot on most of the rooms are truly awesome The staff are welcoming the free wifi is good plus they have some car parking spaces too 
98710,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, I travel to London regularly on business and am pretty relaxed about where I stay This was without doubt the worst hotel I ve ever stayed in I seriously considered moving but couldn t find an alternative on the day The room I was allocated was in a next door building NOT the actual hotel there wasn t actually standing height around the bed or in the bathroom because of the mezzanine and low ceiling Above the mezzanine room the neighbours a private flat I m guessing were very noisy until 2am , lovely overdecorated rooms masking a serious lack of all the things you actually NEED
98711,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Room was a bit small so my husband banged his knee on bed post EVERY time he went past but very good price quality ratio , Very friendly reception so overall first impression was excellent Bed surprisingly comfortable despite smallish room

98719,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel,No Negative, A 5 minute walk from Earls Court and West Brompton tube stations Lovely clean rooms with character No AC but a fan provided No tea coffee making equipment but we were able to order some from the front desk as and when we wanted Breakfast was simple but good with an extra fee for a cooked breakfast

98725,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Nothing All good, The place is impeccably clean The staff is friendly courteous and helpful The towels are large and soft very comfortable There is the nice detail of the bath robes The sheets are of nice pure cotton so that after the long walks in London one feels like coming home Three blocks from Earl s court underground station Picadilly and District lines very convenient Continental breakfast is all one needs the fruits are varied and fresh The breads are very fresh 
98726,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The dining room staff at breakfast were a little stern We booked a Small Double room we got room 8 and it was just that extremely small The Double bed had approximately 12 14 inches of free space around it and that was it no other space at all in the room The door to the bathroom hit the bed you have to be stood to the right of the door to the hallway to be able to get out for me and my husband to be able to get out successfully he d have to exit first then I d have close the door behind him step past the end of the bed reopen the door either that or clamber over the bed The bathroom obviously doesn t have a bath the free floor space was about 1m square but We aren t bath loving people so that was irrelevant to us The bathroom lights were automatic timed and went out in the middle of both of our showers meaning we had to yell to the other person to open the bathroom door to re activate them , The hotel is lovely It s clean and well situated it took minutes to walk from Earls Court station the continental breakfast was lovely and the dining room bright and smart The reception staff were great and very welcoming We arrived at the hotel at 1pm to drop our bag the room wasn t ready then but that was fine they held our bag no problem They held our bag again the next day after checking out til 6pm I was looking for a reasonably priced room close to an underground station and it was definitely smaller than I expected but I knew that we would be spending minimal time in it so just the fact that it was clean and tidy and staff friendly meant I was happy 
98727,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel,No Negative, Thank you guys for a perfect stay in London Totally satisfied Stuff is superfriendly tea in the room totally yes it comforts after a long walk in the city One of the best hotel experiences i ve had so far next time in London i ll comeback here

98730,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Our room was very small but comfortable and clean It really should have just had a single bed rather than a double , Breakfast was lovely with fresh fruit yogurts croissants and coffee The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and willing to make you a coffee at any time Newspapers and fresh fruit were available in the public rooms

98733,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Room is neither modern nor traditional Furniture a bit worn Large TV hid cupboard , Easy access to underground Quiet neighborhood Nice breakfast area and good breakfast Same area is open for drinks and maybe more Staff helpful Restaurants within easy reach 
98734,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The bed was a little small even though I chose the bigger option The room was very hot but a call to reception fixed that We were in a lower ground room so unfortunately I had no signal for texts and calls , The bathroom was great very clean The facilities around the hotel were good Staff and location were excellent WiFi is free and has a strong connection Free tea and coffee brought to your room 24 7 and free bottled water 
98735,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is 4 mins walk from the earls court tube station It s down a beautiful historic terraced line street and is in one of the old terraced homes itself The staff were friendly everything was immaculate The room was lovely and of a good size and the bed very comfortable Breakfast was good and for the rate location and breakfast included we will definitely be back 
98736,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Compared to the 2 other places i stayed on this trip in london it was double the price and i was in the basement with little light and no panache , Its was clean close to Earls Court Nice staff
98737,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, I loved absolutely everything , Hotel is located at a residential area just off Earl s court road so it was very quiet and safe and yet Earl s Court road and tube station is literally 5 minutes away There is 24 hour Tesco grocery store very nearby 5 7 minutes walking I usually walked to Kensington High Street from the hotel it took me 15 20 minutes I have asked for a quiet room with a window and I had exactly what I wanted We had room 6 on first floor Two windows were overlooking beautiful Nevern square Room was very cosy and clean bed fantastically comfortable Bedding and towels and bathrobes immaculately clean all white I loved design of the interior and furniture and fresh apple every day And also I have to mention amazing shower it was the best I have ever experienced Breakfast is good you get freshly baked pastry jams variety of cheeses and cold meats muesli yogurts and fresh fruit There is also a menu from which you can order but this menu is not included in room rate I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is travelling to London 
98738,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Bit dusty in some places and didn t sort out the room when bed was made pillows and curtains , Decoration was amazing and contemporaneous items were cleverly hidden from sight making it that bit more into context 
98739,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Bathroom wasn t as clean as it could have been needs a little more attention to detail , Very pleasant helpful staff Good location few minutes walk to tube 
98740,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, We booked the small doubles and this was a mistake In hindsight we should have avoided this category and booked the larger double The small doubles are in my opinion more like a single so much so that the double bed was tiny Not very restful , The location is excellent The staff were all very friendly and looked after us very well The continental breakfast was good with good choice of meats cheeses cereals and pastries 
98741,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The reception staff weren t very attentive or welcoming , It was my birthday and they upgraded us to the Ottomsn Suite free of charge A lovely touch 
98742,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Room too small for the price paid Service not up to the standard previously experienced at the hotel on a previous visit in 2015 Staff were polite but did not seem over motivated to help when requested ,No Positive
98743,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, I had to go out and in another door for breakfast Also where I was the initial entrance was like an entrance to flats cold and colourless however the room was charming , Room was really cosy and a little quirky Little touches like apples and bottled water along with bath robes and a good shower and TV made the place feel luxurious Breakfast was excellent with lovely selection of cold meat cheese and bread rolls They also had a good quality fruit salad with yoghurt with was refilled regularly Staff were helpful without being overly so The location was on a quiet square just near earls court station Just was really pleasant with a bit of luxury at a reasonable price 
98744,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, There is parking but it is pay and display The room was very hot although all the heating was off So not sure where the heat was coming from , The room was very homely Staff were very friendly No issues
98745,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, We were upgraded but the room was in the garden area no windows At first it seemed like a problem but there is a frosted window that looks into a closed courtyard so there is light and two small windows into the court for fresh air In the end it was ok but would not be good for someone needing to see out , The staff were very welcoming The bed is very comfortable quiet hotel and area Great location a few blocks from Earl s Court tube stop Good breakfast Nicely decorated We were upgraded to a suite Breakfast good Powerful shower We have stayed here many times and will return 
98746,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Let down by little touches like marble table top loose draws badly fitted so unable to use doors to balcony very stiff so had to force shut and draws on suit hanger both broken just such a shame as such a beautiful room that not everything is to standard , Fantastic location for getting around London Earls Court tube 4 minute walk with trolly case Staff friendly and helpful on check in all facilities explained sleep the atmosphere etc were excellent We will return
98747,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel,No Negative, Miguel on reception was exceptional with his information of the local area nothing was too much trouble for him or any of the other staff We were upgraded on arrival which was a nice touch All in all a lovely intimate hotel Highly recommend

98749,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, No complaints, Lovely location Hotel is quiet and calm Bedroom was excellent for 1 person with a good sized bathroom also Very good value has a quality feel about it 
98750,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Nothing , Feels like a family run hotel where they take pride in doing it properly Bed was clean and comfortable shower was big and powerful wifi was excellent and they even deliver tea and proper coffee to your room if you call reception free 2 minutes from the tube but on a quiet square Really great find 
98751,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, I would stay there again but i suspect that they are thinly staffed and have a basic internal system making it difficult for the night shift to notify the morning shift eg we couldn t get them to deliver coffee to our room the next morning Ultimately the difference between a good and a great hotel are the little things There are few perks to be had here There is a basic shower and no temperature control we never did get a response to our question on turning down the heat , The room was luxurious incrediblly quiet and spacious 
98752,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Beds very small double bed is a 3 4 size astro turf lift dodgy exceptionally hot one minute then cold rooms not as described booked Deluxe double exceptionally small very noisy no soundproofing cupboard very high and I am 6ft4 Hotel describes itself as boutique most definitely NOT Bathroom was filthy we had to clean before use cleaning cupboard was nearby fruit left in room was rotten , it was dry and warm wifi was good

98756,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The room was a bit too warm for us but then again it depends on what one is used to We kept the window open all night and it was not noisy at all , The public areas are tasteful with large flower arrangements An interesting mix of far eastern decor and country house slightly faded extravagant elegance The staff are really lovely very friendly but not in your face Room service is excellent and tea or coffee can be got at any time of day or night Our room was comfortable and homely to rest in after walking for many miles around London Underground train is within easy reach only a short ride to any central district There are many places to eat in nearby streets some of which are described in the booklet placed in the hotel room We ate in one of those and were really happy with our food We really liked the breakfast room full of natural light through the glass ceiling like an atrium with view of outdoors Tasty selection of breakfast foods beautifully laid out and great coffee in a pot Our stay was really good value for money and we would stay in this hotel again when exploring London 
98757,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, I felt like the breakfast staff could have been friendlier or at least allowed my own access to tea or coffee if they aren t going to automatically ask but it s not a big issue really I enjoyed this hotel overall Floors are a bit creaky so we could hear the antics of the room above but the hotel staff can t do much about that , Really good croissants and the bed was very comfortable The bathroom was very pretty and cosy The receptionist we dealt with was very friendly and polite The housekeeping staff also did a good job and the room was clean on arrival The location was brilliant as it was close to the tube station Also major appreciation of providing bathrobes as that doesn t happen too often any more 
98758,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, View over roof tops and back of property but in winter who s bothered Full English looked OK but expensive plenty of cheaper alternatives close by , Quiet Room fine and comfortable Continental Breakfast bit basic but quite edible and plenty of it

98760,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Some eighties decor and breakfast area was small so had to eat at the same table as others unfortunately but the food was great , Comfortable room with excellent shower 
98761,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Windows didn t close tight some noise from the adjacent room , Breakfast was delicious wide range of food incl cheese fresh fruitsalad yoghurt and pastries 
98762,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The hotel was advertised as non smoking one of the main reasons we booked but they had a designated area for smoking which was immeadiatly outside french doors to our room The hotel had placed a table chair about a foot away from our doors to encourage smokers to relax chat not only did this disturb us during inconvenient hours we felt it an intrution to our privacy the room was filled with the smell of tobacco and my child age 6 stayed in the room with me who is Asthmatic I was totally amazed that a smoking area was in this area which i feel would be illegal especially if health safty were to visit , The staff breakfast was really good The fact you could order free drinks 24hrs 
98763,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel,No Negative, This is reasonabley priced Hotel in a beautiful Georgian building in Kensington overlooking a beautiful park The rooms are all a little bit exotic and the breakfast area is a delight in a glass and solid wood conservatory The service and attention to detail from the staff is great I have stayed twice now and nothing is too much trouble There are a great selection of restaurants within a 5 minute walk and the tube is also very close to hand I will definately stay again 
98764,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Get the night bell sorted, The hotel was very good the room for price was brilliant even had a real fire which was lovely there was plenty for breakfast the staff where friendly and helpful

98766,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Free breakfast is rather basic , Located in nice quiet district of Kensington within easy reach from Earls Court Tube station Room was attractively decorated Complimentary tea with milk and cookies fruits is a nice gesture of hospitality and makes every guest feel welcome 
98767,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Unfortunately our room was at the ground floor and next to the reception So for a couple like usvwho wanted some intimacy it was a bit awkward room 4 At early morning we were awaked by the footstep on the top floor , Good location next from the bus stop and subway Plus there was a good for chips nearby The room was charming

98770,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Junior suite is in the basement which sort of put a downer on the experience Had we known beforehand may have chosen a different room That said room was comfortable , Location for the hotel is a great bonus but a really nice boutique feel to it Rooms appear to be tastefully furnished and fully functional Room was warm and an extra radiator thoughtfully provided we were in Junior suite Staff very pleasant and were willing to assist in any way Continental breakfast as more than adequate with croissants to die for

98774,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The room was not well sound proofed and footsteps from the room corridor above were very noticeable in the very early morning , Excellent and quiet location within easy walking distance of Earl s Court underground station The included continental breakfast was good and free newspapers were provided in the attractive dining room 
98775,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, In the room was quite cold beacuse the windows couldn t close properly and they were leting in air cold air The breakfast on weekends starts at 8am and not 7 like during the week Since we are tourists we like to start early and not lie in we can do that at home but in London is that a waste of time so this hour waiting was a shame , Me and my friend liked the location because it was really near the tube and the bathroom was nice although small except the shower was nice size The breakfast was ok although it had only toast jam butter fruit njami cereal and cheese ham so despite poor selection if you re not picky you could get full and not be hungry until 2pm 
98776,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The only somewhat negative point was the customer service at breakfast I don t know if it was because we are a young couple but some days we arrived at the breakfast first but everyone arriving after us were served before us , Great quiet location in a nice neighbourhood right next to Earls Court tube station Absolutely brilliant customer service in the reception we even got upgraded when we told the reception we we re celebrating a birthday Nice rooms with comfortable beds clean bathroom with shower and a tub and effective heating system not always so common in London Even the standard room had a huge balcony with a table for four Small but excellent breakfast too

98780,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Nothing to complain about , We were visiting London for seven days and it was awesome stay Despite our room was a little bit small it was gorgeous and very comfortable though The hotel has a beautiful backyard where we ve been witnessed a beautiful squirrel and a small fox from around the area Sulai is a great manager and I m convinced that he should be promoted We ve really enjoined our stay and would definitely visit this place again

98784,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The location is horrible and really dirty area The hotel is awkward and uncomfortable The bathrooms are a joke so small your knees hit the sink when using the toilet Horrible awkward rooms I believe we would have enjoyed London a lot more had we chosen another hotel , The staff is nice most of them and breakfast was nice

98798,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, I would have evaluated the comfort as superb but there was a problem in the bathroom To save energy there is no light switch A sensor regulates the light and fan The bathroom door can never be left open because anyone walking by activates the sensor And if a guest is inside using the bathroom the light can go off in the middle of say showering and has to be activated in the dark by some kind of adequate movement , Very friendly and helpful employee at the reception when we arrived 
98799,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, 20 charge on my credit card upon my arrival as a guarantee This is bad for a 4star hotel and I m still waiting to be reimbursed, Fresh fruits for breakfast

98806,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, One apple on a double bed is confusing How about 2 chocolate mints , I booked the hotel for 2 nights and then thought I d read some reviews I got a bit of a shock after reading the really poor ones about horrible staff money fraud loud noise etc So I thought the stay was going to be horrible because it was a last minute booking We arrived at the hotel and I was prepared for the absolute worst well I didn t have to fight anyone Receptionist was quick and friendly and showed us to our 1st floor dbl bedroom nr 7 It looked OK The hotel is not modern but you can see that from the pictures Possibly at best it would be hotel but then again it s London Value for money is OK and acceptable for the location around the corner from Earls Court station 
98807,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, But the room was the smallest we ve ever stayed in I would rather have tea and coffee facilities in the room it s much more convenient than having to ring for a drink, The room was furnished and decorated very nicely as well as being very clean Staff were friendly and helpful

98852,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, First we were given a deluxe double room which was a tiny Hobbit size room where it was almost impossible to move around It was also rather run down Luckily we got another bigger and better room same deluxe category for the rest of the stay that was ok The quality of rooms seem to vary a lot The words luxury in hotel description should be removed for example the luxury toiletries were ordinary shampoo and soap bathropes very sad jokes Not a good value for money , Friendly staff good breakfast

98854,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The room was in the basement dark and floors very squeakie The whole room needs a facelift Curtains hanging loose from the curtain rail plus white splash of paint When the heating was turned on the room became extremly stuffy due to poor ventalation Window was nailed shut The staff did turn off the heating after I requested Listed as four stars but hardly worth that rating Staff very freindly and helpful , The location

98859,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Smaller hand basin in bathroom as well as PowerPoint and a place to hang towels after use We stayed 6 days and didn t require fresh towels every day every second would be OK you could hang if ok and leave on floor when clean towels required this would also save on your costs , Very happy with everything will stay next time we are in London
98860,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The staff could have been a little more helpful with directions eg giving a map and making where we needed to go Also I bit more confident in recommendations for restaurants and attractions The room was a little bit too small as well , the comfort of the bed and the power of the shower Also the politeness of the staff was noted
98861,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, We were in a basement room that was cosier than the impression we had from the photos of the four poster rooms here plus the floor was really creaky I felt a little like I was embarking on a noisy furnished assault course when negotiating a nightly route to the bathroom and hence woke my partner every time , The quiet location was great as was the ability to easily find on road parking on the square We were able to walk quickly to a good selection of bars and restaurants yet open our bedroom window at night without risk of noise or exhaust frames The shower was hot with great water pressure and thick quality towels to follow always appreciated We were very impressed with the Continental breakfast each morning 
98862,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Nothing i didnt like but restaurant staff could be more attentive and when booked as breakfast included it didnt say only continental and additional charge for cooked food Four poster needed a dust and polish and there really should be tea facilities in the room , Comfy bed reception staff friendly and helpful
98863,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, In a 4 hotel no minibar no room service after 11 PM rude staff no shower gel no iron I had to carry my 3 luggages up in my room I wouldn t recommend , Location

98866,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel,No Negative, Found this hotel on booking com and it lived up to all of the positive reviews The hotel is ideally situated a short walk from the tube in a quite part of Earls Court We stopped in a junior suite that was ideal for our one night stay The staff we re excellent and helpful in all respects I would definitely use again and thoroughly recommend it 
98867,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Hotel itself good would happily stay again but as per most hotels a few noisy inconsiderate guests make the nights sleep a bit of a challenge, Location very good for local transport but just far enough away to ensure reasonably quiet in the evenings
98868,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The room is so very very small so there is hardly any room for the luggage The bed is actually a single bed plus half Luckily I am very small so I could squeeze in the bed with my husband The room was SUPER HOT There is no air conditioning but a fan We slept with the windows and doors open We felt a bit frightened doing this the balcony can be accessed by other properties next to it When we complained at reception about the heat and how we had to sleep with the window and door open we were told it is safe to sleep with the windows and doors open We paid for a room to have a good night s sleep in a hotel but we had to camp for the 2 nights at the hotel I hope the hotel understands that sleeping with the window and door open is not safe , The property has character 
98869,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Hmmm all perfect x, Great location for central London and access to Heathrow Lovely staff great tea service good breakfast included just a very pleasant place to stay almost don t want to tell people about my find Hope I can book in next time 
98870,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Room was too hot and portable a c unit had a big white exhaust duct that had to be positioned through a window My room had only French doors and I didn t want to leave them open overnight so the duct blew hot air into the room A ceiling fan might do a better job and be less unsightly , Great location close to Earl s Court station but quiet and calm Excellent breakfast and friendly helpful staff Pleasant slightly exotic decor 
98871,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel,No Negative, The staff were so helpful and loved the hotel itself Lovely room and good value I travel a great deal and could not recommend this hotel highly enough A genuine find 
98872,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, It was next door to main hotel as if renting a room in someones flat no lift this was fine but it meant that despite having a room service menu there was no room service no hot breakfast, The mezzanine room suite was nice to look at it was more like a studio flat my wife loved decor and features
98873,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Beware small double ours was exceptionally small even the bed didn t seem to bed standard double with nowhere to put anything We moved into a larger room for the second night it was so much better , Location staff breakfast public areas
98874,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, We were not in the main hotel but next door where they have a couple of rooms that means there are other residents not associated with the hotel It was noisy although I do believe the staff managed to quiet things down by 0100 , Very quirky but quaint 
98875,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, We weren t expecting a big room but this was the smallest hotel room I have stayed in Fine if you just want a base but we were hoping for somewhere to chill out Larger rooms are available , Clean quiet and good location Plenty of breakfast which was tasty

98877,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, Room was incredibly tiny almost impossible to move inside no air conditioning just a fan , Clean cozy elegant wonderful quite location 2 min walk from Earl Court tube station good continental breakfast included complimentary water bottles spacious bathroom with good toiletry
98878,Twenty Nevern Square Hotel, The rooms need to be cooler in the summer We had room 4 right off the front desk The room was hot but we could not sleep with the windows open because we were awoken all night be people literally right outside our window We asked for a fan and we were told they did not have a working fan Also the room above us needs to have the floor boards tightened If we weren t getting awoken by the outside chatter it was from the noise coming from people just walking across the creaky floor above My advice to help get this hotel up to par invest in ceiling fans for all your rooms helps provide cool air for sleeping and white noise to cancel out other noises For the money we paid for 5 nights we were disappointed in the quality of sleep we got mostly lack of sleep It s one thing for a hotel to look nice it s another to make sure the rooms are comfortable and quiet for your guests You may get them in the door with your nice website pictures but you will disappoint them after one bad night s sleep , Hands down the staff was great They were very nice and always greeted us with a smile Great location
