318596,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, The downside was the condition of the furniture in the room Chairs and sofa were so dirty and worn we did not want to even sit on them Also lack of AC made it a bit uncomfortable during the day even with the fans , The staff at reception and the bartender were all wonderful They were attentive efficient friendly and knowledgeable The outside patio area was very nice and the availability of water with fruit in the lobby was always welcome after walking out in the summer heat 
318597,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, Poor wifi Sometimes we didn t have connection to internet It was really Low speed And there was no air conditioner in the room Rooms facing the street were noisy at nights We ask the reception to change our room with an apposite sites room and they kindly changed our room, It was a good hotel with nice and helpful staff and spacious room Breakfast was good Good access to public transportation And only some minutes walking to Duna river
318598,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien,No Negative, The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and spacious Larger than the average UK chain hotel There was a mini bar which kept some of our supplies cool If you stay more than one night there is an option not to have the room cleaned and to claim a free drink each at the bar instead There was a lovely terrace and grassed outdoor seating area in which to have said drink Almost opposite was a Billa supermarket which was well presented and had a lovely choice of food and drink An Aldi was also located about 100 metres in the opposite direction The location was also just a few minutes walk from the underground station and also convenient for the Danube waterfront The hotel room brochure recommended a place to eat which although we were dubious about trying was really good It was about a 20 minute walk but worth it for a very authentic pub bar with reasonably priced food and the option for eating inside or out 
318599,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, Very expensive parking There was a fan but no air conditioning which made the room quite hot as we had 30 degrees weather Otherwise no issues , Nice staff big room good breakfast good location near metro and river 
318600,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, very slow internet almost not working Not many English channels on TV Very smelly room from smoking , friendly staff willing to help possible to check out hour later 
318601,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien,No Negative, Very clean everything Excellent breakfast A private parking it s very secure but you have to pay an extra for it anyway it s cheaper than parking in the street 
318602,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, Staff and in particular the reception staff the most miserable looking people From the moment we arrived no friendly greeting no smile no feel of a welcome And nothing changed from when we checked out What dose it take to smile at customers , Over cleanliness was very good
318603,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, There are only some small things to mention the fridge was a bit weak and the wifi reception as well , I think the price value ratio is really good with this hotel even if We were charged an extra 18 euro for the parking The flat was brand new and nice and the hotel was close to the stadium which was really important for us There are supermarket pharmacy public transport restaurant etc nearby The staff was really helpful and I loved that the check out time was 12 am The concert was too good to wake up early 
318604,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, It was very clinical like staying in a concept Lacked personality Staff at front desk though always courteous lacked specificity of detail when answering questions almost a pro forma efficient answer , Clean room with excellent facilities including a fridge Excellent quality of opt in breakfast 
318605,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, Unfortunately it was disapointment about serviss 1st girl at recepti on when we arrived 1 hour before cheking time seemed really exausted didn t look at clients didn t smile later after cheking in our time we called reception to ask to get soap as soap bottle in the toilet room was empty but we didn t get it when we checked out we had to wait a long time another girl from serviss helped to find reception girl who didn t even appologize and after cheking that our bill is paid ai everithing is fine with out saying goodbuy or smth like that A real disapointment for 4 star hotel , It s nice to have possibilitie to place car in garage for aditional cost the room was clean 
318606,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, Garage is for additional charge but it was Sunday so we parked on the street for free So it wasn t the problem for us , Very clean suite close enough to metro
318607,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, It s just minor and can be overlooked if booking I would prefer wider range at breakfast What I would definitely change serving scrambled eggs in little glass jars That was somewhat strange felt like from some kind of laboratory If ordering omelette there was a note about extra charge so I did not try but boiled eggs were awailable on request boiled to your requirements , 24 hour reception helpful professional personell in both reception and restaurant Although not in immediate centre the holtel is only a few metro stops away from main points of interest centre railway stations ets Few minutes walk from the metro station Great size room my room even facing the street was still quiet comfortable beds At the time of booking good value for money Ideal for solo travellers and business fine for families and couples if no romantic perks are required If needed supermarket is just opposite the hotel Acceptable breakfast if included in room rate When in Vienna again I ll definitely check this hotel for availability
318608,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, Unfortunately there s no kettle or tea coffee making facilities in room It would be a great boon if hotel could provide one in each room Otherwise no complaints , Warm welcome at reception they even let us check in early which was very handy Clean and spacious room with everything we needed including fridge and hairdryer Spare pillow provided Breakfast was filling and healthy wide selection of bread and warm rolls Supermarket opposite and 5 minutes away from metro station Vorgartenstrasse about 15 minutes to the centre We d certainly go back there again 
318609,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, I miss having coffee and tea making facilities in the room This may be an Austrian thing though , The staff were friendly and helpful The decor and cleanliness were excellent There was an excellent selection for breakfast Soft boiled eggs are available to order There are a few extras which have to be paid for Ham and eggs omelette etc
318610,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien,No Negative, Comfortable beds spacious rooms and bathroom Variety of choices for breakfast Our room was quite airy though we did not notice an existing air conditioning We stayed mid of springtime staying during summer could be a bit different though if our observation is true For those not favoring the walking to the center 30min 3km there is a metro station nearby 
318611,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, a bit old fahisoned room, not at the city center but fair enough to reach breakfast is vey well big room bathroom comfortable bed very friendly staff close to public transport
318612,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, Breakfast was OK but I feel that there is definitely space for improvement Maybe introduce some more variety What I found especially annoying was that the glasses that I got for breakfast were the size of my thumb I guess 1 dl so I had to get up several times to refill , The room and bathroom were large and clean especially the bathroom Wi fi worked great staff was helpful and in general I didn t have any complaints during my stay At the moment that I booked this hotel I couldn t find anything even close to this quality for the money The hotel is located very conveniently near to the airport train city center and Vienna international center It is also very close to Prater amusement park Donauinsel and Saint Francis of Assisi church 
318613,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, The location is not bad but not really good either while easily reachable still a while from the centre and somewhat outskirtish The room could do with some more utensils in particulare shoe polish shoe horn Their policy of charging 12 euro a night for a pet without even offering any service for that money is outdated these days , The room was overall clean except for the shower head which was covered in limescale and spacious enough Wifi worked fine 
318614,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, Not enough light in the room lack of restaurant for dinner or at least for having a light meal at night, I like the connection WI FI automatic the room clean breakfast good desk for working with my computer
318615,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien,No Negative, Everything was fine It was a short stay and not many things can happen but all in all it was a good stay If you are staying there over the weekend the parking outside is free ignore what it says on the site Good connection to the underground Friendly staff It was great value for money but I have to emphasise we god a very good one day deal on booking com 
318616,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien,No Negative, The hotel is very cosy and clean rooms bright and spacious Breakfast was fine tasty bread and rolls Thanks to the friendly staff we could check in earlier the hotel is next to the metro station and supermarket I would strongly recommend staying in Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien 
318617,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, Location is not very central but only 5 minutes from the U bahn station so it was fine We did not have a car so I cannot evaluate parking Wi Fi was sometimes not working , I had a great rest there very comfortable beds and amazingly delicious breakfast with tasty coffee and bread Room is well furnished and quite big for a hotel In addition my personal thanks to the personell of the hotel who gave us a kettle to the room when my husband cought cold so we could make hot tea ourselves without running to the bar all the time Thank you for your support 
318618,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, More variety in breakfast, Superb bang for buck wonderful place and very cosy n comfy Clean and close to the centre and public transport would love to come back
318619,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, Only a water boiler in the room was missing in my opinion , The hotel is very comfortable The breakfast 10 p I can highly recommend And the sauna in the cellar was really awesome after a cold sightseeing day in Wien 
318620,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien,No Negative, The staff was very pleasant Location is very good 4 5 minutes to metro station near the river We arrived early and they organize our early check in Everything was amazing the hotel the city the atmosfer Thanks a lot
318621,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, There was only the option of two single beds instead of a double one but it was comfortable, The staff was very helpful and they gave us very helpfull info to make our holiday easier
318622,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, 1 the hotel charged me for the parking place 18 EUR although I have already paid for it when booked the room with parking place I repeated it twice to the night shift and morning shift at the reception and even sent the booking confirmation at their corporate E mail but had to pay for parking anyway Later on they sent the letter with the appologies and returned the money for parking but this question could have been solved in advance 2 poor communication of the staff 3 Breakfast for 4 star hotel could be more substantial and various and sauna could be for free for the visitors 4 would not recommend the hotel to stay in , nothing
318623,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, They tried to change us more money for breakfast and we had paid for it already The bread fell on the floor and they just up it back instead putting it away And poor communication with stuff, The hotel was clean and nice rooms
318624,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, The hotel equipment needs to be refreshed Everything is shabby Sofa in the room used lamps over the bed rathet not to switch on it smells like it burns One can hear the elevator situated next to the room It makes a lot of noise so I don t recommend to those who have light sleep Carpets in the corridors are also outdated with lots of stains Bar in the lobby closed during the day It was a hard job to ask for a coffee Floor was dirty pillar in the bar dirty Put some more effort in the hotel maintenance Definitely is not worth 4 I won t come back , Rooms are spaceful Hotel situated close to the river and within walking distance to the UN U Bahn 5min walk Room was clean but shabby 
318625,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, Nothing , Smooth check in and check out process Spacious room nicely arranged Large windows that can open Very comfortable bed and bedding Nice complementary set of toiletries Good breakfast Excellent value for money 
318626,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien,No Negative, I truly recommend this hotel Clean comfortable place nice and helpful staff The hotel is not situated in the city centre however there is an underground and it takes 6 7 minutes to get to the centre 
318627,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien,No Negative, Good location easy to reach from the highway and on the other hand only few metro stations from the main square Spacious rooms and bathrooms Nice staff I always go on weekends and I usually come on saturday at 9 am and they always let me enter the room When I leave on sunday they let me leave the car in the garage till afternoon Across the hotel is a large supermarket which is open on saturday afternoon 
318628,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, we didn t find any particularly nice restaurants nearby, Location excellent for walking across the river to the Austria Centre Vienna in 20 minutes clean quiet spacious room nice breakfast
318629,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, Stayed 8 nights The bed was very uncomfortable and gave me back pain The cleaning service was terrible everyday a new disgusting surprise one photo attached as example The wi fi is free but won t stay on for more than a minute so useless for work you retype the same email several times before sending When my partner joined me towards the end they refused a bigger room with a double bed and gave us the only option to move to a worse hotel They refused to reimburse the rest of the stay when I had enough and wanted to just leave the hotel The staff was very unaccommodating and nothing was ever the hotel fault if I wanted compensation for the horrible room bed and service I had to pay ludicrous extra amounts They continue to say they did everything they could and it s my fault I didn t want to move to a worse hotel in their chain and will not reimburse any of the nights because I had pre paid AVOID, Breakfast was OK
318630,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, We had included breakfast inside room price but they ask us additional money for a basic omelet , Very friendly and helpful the staff Hotel is closer to metro line 
318631,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, I have no clue how this hotel is 4 Examples left a towel on the floor one day after cleaning wasn t replaced booked a room for 2 After arrival we found one bathrobe and 1 gift candy bar that was expired After reporting this to the reception desk and asking for a 2nd bathrobe we were told our booking shouldn t include any bathrobes the toiletries were provided on day 1 but weren t replaced on following days, Located near a metro station
318632,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, I needed a late checkout and it wasn t possible We understood that the hotel was fully booked so probably that is why they were not able to help us, Nice room very nice breakfast
318633,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, Breakfast could be served a little later for late risers There was no wash cloth in the bathroom , The front desk staff was extremely helpful with great tips on how to get to Vienna City Center and what to do 
318634,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, It was a shame that the fruit served at breakfast seemed to be from a can and not fresh I also thought that the orange juice tasted like it had been reconstituted Apart from that the choice was very good , Nothing was too much trouble for the staff whether at reception or the ladies cleaning the rooms I had booked as a single and enjoyed a twin room which was very clean and comfy I wouldn t hesitate to stay at this location again Late checkout at is useful and there is a room where your luggage can be stored if required Only approx 15 mins away from the centre of Vienna using the underground 
318635,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, No airconditionning in the room It was quite hot in the city and the window was opening to a streed with quite a few car Breakfast was rather poor , Location is quite nice close to the river and a metro station Clean room At least they provided a fan 
318636,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, A few more facilities like having a kettle and tea coffee facilities in the room We would have preferred a firmer bed , Quiet location and good environment around the hotel Excellent services to compliment this 
318637,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, I took the cheapest roomwithout A C was hot and stuffy on the top floor It was my own mistake but check your room has an A C in the summer as it does get warm, Good Location Close to Ubahn Friendly staff Clean Hotel Garage 
318638,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, The hotel has theoretically a restaurant but in practice you can have dinner there only if you are with a big group and it is announced in advance The hotel parking is additional 18 euro , The hotel is in a quiet area close to Prater it is easy to arrive to the center the building facilities are nice 
318639,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, All was great , Location is great for the money you pay one or two subway stations and your in the center Breakfast is great with loads of variety It was a real great surprise The staff was flexible accomodating and really nice no complications and super efficient Will stay again for sure

318642,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, Not being able to control room heating was up every night because I was too hot Opening the windows meant being disturbed by traffic noise, Friendly and helpful staff Close to U station and across road from supermarket
318643,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, No restaurants at all around Not a 4 stars hotel No air conditioning Breakfast is poor and can be better for the price paid , Close to a public subway and Convention Center Easy to arrive in from airport by train and metro Quiet rooms 
318644,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, No Air conditioning in the rooms at all Had to open the windows at night to avoid seeating at night very uncomfortable in that regard, Location was fairly close to city center with just 3 stops away from the underground metro
318645,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, I am in a wheelchair and the fire alarm went off at 11pm while I was staying on the 7th floor I was very disappointed no hotel staff came to see if I was ok and I had to make my own way down 7 flights of stairs , We got a very good price for a room While not in the city centre it is very handy to the Metro
318646,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, The staff from the night when we checked in barely spoke English it took us 30 minutes to get a bill and the keys There was a fire alarm and in our room it didn t work we were lucky our friends were next door and they woke us up When I complained to the reception the manager was very disrespectful and claimed that it was supposed to happen like that because the fire alarm was in a different area When my boyfriend complained too she said that the alarm in our room was actually broken I heard people complaining that it was not the first time when it had been a fire alarm during this week I don t recommend it at all , Breakfast was fine spacious room
318647,Austria Trend Hotel Lassalle Wien, There s a lack of lighting in the room only has 2 lamps over the beds it s missing a central light On Saturday I wanted to sleep in and the cleaning staff knocked at the door every 30 mins now I know I did not leave the do not disturb sign on the door but if I dont answer the door I think it should be obvious , Close to the Danube very clean I stayed during the winter and it has good heating
