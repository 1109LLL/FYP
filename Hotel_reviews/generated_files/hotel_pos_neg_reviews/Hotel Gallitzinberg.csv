350451,Hotel Gallitzinberg, We didn t take the breakfast because 18 for breakfast is expensive At the metrostation we bought bread and that saved us a lot of money It can be very hot in the room so maybe a fan would be handy , Parking for free was for us the reason to book a room at this hotel The city can easy be reached bij bus and metro We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel 
350452,Hotel Gallitzinberg,No Negative, The breakfast is amazing and rich healthy food plenty of choice The room was big and comfortable with no noise from outside The location is on top of a hill with an amazing view over the city The parking is on own property and is secure We arrived wasted after a 12h drive and we left completely energized and refreshed 
350453,Hotel Gallitzinberg, Location you must take a bus to the last stop on a metro line Last bus leaves before 10 30 pm There is no elevator instead a long set of steps Wifi or rather lack of In spite of valiant efforts of owner staff wifi remained very very poor , Breakfast and very friendly staff
350454,Hotel Gallitzinberg, This was a last minute booking suggested by booking com as my original booking at kadima apartments was cancelled by them on the day of my flight I was assured it was no further from my conference than the apartments but it was on the outskirts of Vienna close to vineyards and there were no pubs or restaurants in walking distance The trip to the conference involved a bus and then two tram rides walking distance haha I was assured there was WiFi but it did not work in the room and was deadly slow in the lobby The bed was a Waterbed just what you want after 36 hours of travelling The shower lacked power the extractor fan was noisy I had to drag my luggage up the stairs I made a formal complaint to booking com and using phone coverage as WiFi useless found myself alternative hotel Amadeus in City Centre highly recommended for remainder of my stay This hotel is for those who want to get away from it all including emails , Staff although unable to speak a word of English were very nice Breakfast was amazing 
350455,Hotel Gallitzinberg, 1 Due to some misunderstandings I had to pay some extra for a bed that actually was not an extra bed It was part of the room At booking com it was indicated as free for a child and we used it for a child of course I didn t get used to this kind of bevahing however I spent some nights at hotels in Europe Maybe it was my fault not to check it earlier correctly however this situation got me choosing another accomodation next time when in Vienna 2 Small parking lot 3 Not stable wifi, Nice surroundings good breakfast kind staff well equipped room 
350456,Hotel Gallitzinberg,No Negative, I thought that the hotel were nice clean modern and comfortable The staff were friendly and always helped with whatever we needed The breakfast was very good and bio Overall I thought it was excellent and we really enjoyed our stay and will definitely return in the future
