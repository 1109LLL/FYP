509233,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The cleaning service in second floor was awful This was not the case for the 4th floor where we initially located Lack of refrigerator in standard room Limited opening of windows , The stuff were very helpful Our room didn t have refrigerator and Tessa was kind enough to upgrade or room with kitchen Thanks Tessa High speed internet and the laundry room which is very convenient Closeness to the metro station

509238,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Super Nice Hotel with a very friendly and professional staf We had a problem with our booking It was our own fault but the assistant manager Ayesha did everything in her power to help us We were very happy with the service and the stay And they gave us icecream and stroopwaffels at the check in The neighbourhood has a lot of breakfast and dinner options at walking distance as wel as the subway to go to the city centre 
509239,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I first didn t like the smell of the room maybe they use a kind of medicine to clean but it would be nicer if they put a freshener, It s a mixed of modern and stylish kind of hotels I like it
509240,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Our room wasn t cleaned during our 2 night stay The rooms were quite literally dorms which I didn t fully realize before hand not sure I would have stayed there knowing that , Cool lobby nice lobby bar the people I spoke with at the front desk were friendly and helpful
509241,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Extremely basic dorm style rooms with no facilities whatsoever Had to run downstairs to reception to get a hairdryer and there wasn t even a bottle of water in the room Checking in there was no one at reception and once a person finally came they spent 10 mins in haggling about prices with another customer Meanwhile the rest of us were kept waiting Really unprofessional Air con struggled to work and was impossible to adjust so room was stuffy and hot This is a very overrated hotel they seem to think that cool interiors are substitute to good service ,No Positive
509242,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The bed indeed was like a cloud The rooms were very nice everything clean solid wifi helpful staff and best only 1 min walk to metro which takes you downtown in a few minutes 
509243,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The bed needed to be flipped or replaced long ago it had large dents in the foam mattress where many people before me have slept Pretty uncomfortable we might as well have gotten a twin room Because of the lump in the middle it felt like we were in different beds anyway , Very modern and clean hotel They have bikes for hire which makes getting around the city easy plus the metro is super close 
509244,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Air conditioner a little weak rooms a little too dark, Clen room a lot of space comfy bad clean bathroom and shower very close to train station very nice decoration coffee machine 2 water bottles every day clean towels everyday 
509245,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, For the price paid for the hotel we all agreed that breakfast should have been included , Staff were spot on lovely people Served by Deborah On the first day had no idea what I was supposed to be doing and she helped me through and we sorted everything very polite too Loved that there was luggage space for us as we got an early flight in and were unable to check in until 3pm and a late flight out checking out at 12pm but thanks to The Student Hotel luggage was not a problem Bedrooms and bathrooms were very clean and tidy and we loved the small souvenirs in the room like the postcards There were 11 of us staying here and we all loved it perfect placement with 2 metro entrances one to the left and one to the right of the hotel Plenty of activities within the hotel including pool tables and ping pong tables a cinema style area football tables a gym a swimming pool and there s a very nice bar restaurant too 
509246,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, One only problem was the wet room shower which flooded quite a bit out of the shower and around the toilet Adding another drain may be a good idea , Rooms we absolutely amazing Much more than we were expecting Super cool friendly and relaxed environment 
509247,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Payment should be card only they don t accept cash The rooms not well sound proofed I send an email before 4 days of check in and nobody answered After the first night we ask them to change the room and we kept the luggage in the luggage room we came back and we found out that they forgot to change the room, Nice interior design and good location near the metro station Due to conflict of changing the room they offer us 2 free drinks and a free breakfast for the next morning
509248,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Cleaning and room and house service every day, They dont clean the rooms everyday but every other day It is not for families and kids shouldnt be allowed It is not clean 
509249,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Windows don t open no fresh air Snack machine was not working most of the time, Not expensive modern restaurant inside a hotel good location can rent a bike
509250,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The breakfast was very simple but OK with 12 a little overpriced for my taste The breakfast club around the corner had great breakfast too for the same price or less A fridge mini bar also would have been nice since we couldn t store cool drinks or small snacks , First of all the staff was AWESOME We felt welcome from the first second we stepped into TSH Bike rental was easy and the drive was only 10 15min along beautiful Amstel and Amsterdam houses We would come back for sure 
509251,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Breakfast was a bit pricey especially for children Wouldve been nice for us to have 1 room as a family but we survived 1 night being split , Clean comfortable and very cool rooms Staff were very friendly and helpful Location is great Will def book again on our next visit 
509252,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Its a bit of a walk to the city centre but thats just the position of the hotel Breakfast was expensive for what it was , The room was excellent very modern The staff were very helpful

509255,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Our bed sunk significantly in the middle Halfway through our stay we lifted up the mattress to try and work out why and noticed a number of slats were missing Not sure why the bed was left like this and not fixed or replaced , Great location super clean and very friendly staff Wonderful facilities 
509256,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Exceptional cool hotel with young staff and audience The ugly exterior is more than made up for by a very hip interior design Would go there again in a heartbeat 
509257,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, We had dinner at the hotel resturant and we had to wait forever for the waiter to take our orders Then we waited almost an hour to get our food It wasn t a very busy night and we got no explanation or apologies Other guests left because they had to wait for so long to get drinks We went back a couple of nights later and with different staff working things went much quicker , We loved The Student Hotel and would gladly recommend it to our friends The staff was cool helpful The rooms and the common areas were all very Instagram worthy The metro and the tram were only two minute away and it felt really safe to ride the metro even during the evening We re coming back 
509258,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, It was a little pricey , Friendly staff really comfy large bed nice ambience Perfect location for public transport from hotel to town centre in less than 15 mins 
509259,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, There should be more than 2 people at the front desk in the morning to check out people Our check out took about 15 minutes which we didn t expect and made us late for our morning appointment , Room was good Great gym and facilities such as ping pong tables Breakfast was nice 
509260,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Nothing , We absolutely loved this hotel Young hip and very unique It s a college student resident and a regular hotel all in one There are spaces to work collaboratively spaces to relax there is even a TED space where you can watch ted talks The laundry room was so helpful after almost 2 weeks on vacation We also rented bikes from the hotel huge bike storage in the basement They even provide their own maps of Amsterdam with recommended bike routes and tips of what to do on your way The room had very high ceilings which made it feel bigger It was designed as a college student bedroom with a desk bookshelves with great books kitchenette and many little great details Room was spotless clean and so was the rest of the hotel Absolutely wonderful 
509261,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Cleaning every two days The day before arrival was taken from the credit card all the amount for 6 nights I think correct taking in advance only one or two nights out of six in the case of no arrival this was NOT my case if the room eventually left vacant is occupied by other customers , Good position just near Metro stop and Amstel railway station Very juvenile climate it was original to find a condom in bed for the first night Our room at the 11 floor had a fine panorama over the city Many facilities in lobby and a well equipped free gym
509262,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Nothing not to like, The room was of a generous size everything was modern and clean Tea coffee facilities in the room even a Nespresso machine The reception staff were very friendly and helpful The hotel is located a very short distance from a Metro Station Wibautstraat giving easy access to the rest of Amsterdam 
509263,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Breakfast is quite expensive and not especially amazing , The room was very original comfy and with an edge The whole hotel had an amazing amtosphere Really recommended for young people It was really nice to have the possibility to rent a bike at the hotel 
509264,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I didn t have a main light switch close to my bed Only a reading lamp , Similar to Volkshotel simple rooms original concept close to the Metro stop good rates for Amsterdam 
509265,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Shop across the road was closed for refurb and the vending machines in the hotel were out of order Very difficult to get drinks etc , The bed was absolutely amazing The standard of the room was fantastic and the bathroom was gorgeous also The little touches around the room such as books and funny puns were brilliant 
509266,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, A lot of dust on the jalousie and on the windowsill and bath is also not very clean full of fingerprints on the glass and tiles There is no hair dryer No telephone in the room and therefore to contact with reception you have to go downstairs to the lobby Rather dark room not enough light The wardrobe is too close to the bed and thereis no passage left when the door is open so you get captured if you want to look in the mirror inside the wardrobe , Relatively low prices taking into account average prices in Amsterdam Nice and helpful hotel staff Metro station with line to the Centraal railway station is very close Center of the city is in walking distance only about 2 3 km 
509267,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, I love the entire concept of the hotel What we liked the most was the entire decoration The staff was very helpfull and kind It is very good comunicated with the city center just a few min away by underground 
509268,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Staff extremely friendly and helpful Place had a very good relaxed vibe Breakfast spread was lovely even for us vegetarians Barista coffee Lots of quirky details and unusual design in rooms and overal building Lots of comfortable areas and couches to sit in and relax Impressed with the special Ted Talkx corner Metro to city centre almost at doorstep 4 four stops to Centraal Station But also easily walkable with lots of cafe s bakeries and shops on the way We arrived exhausted after a 24 hour plane trip and couldn t have received a better welcome Will definitely stay again Ps not just for students 
509269,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, sent a few messages to the hotel prior to my arrival which I didn t get a response to , Our room was very spacious and comfortable Nice big bed There was a hairdryer and also lots of fun funny and quirky touches The staff were fabulously helpful 
509270,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I didn t like the bed because was uncomfortable The bed was old with wooden slats However the slats were falling out with the slightest bit of movement in the bed and its become a real pain constantly getting up in the middle of the night to put a slack back in We have to put mattress on the floor and sleep on the floor Housekeeping didn t clean our room one day , Bar staff was very friendly and some of the reception staff 
509271,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, A new age kind of hotel Fun quirky and colorful but also eco friendly The use of technology to make regular things simple is fantastic Location is ideal A short bike ride away to Amsterdam s city center They have bike rentals and laundry on location too Lots of collaboration spaces in the lobby
509272,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The vending machines were broken 2 of the 3 nights we were there , The hotel had a very friendly atmosphere The staff were very helpful and the communal area was great Very relaxed environment with pool tables table tennis and plenty of seating The rooms were very clean and modern 
509273,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, It is a good 20 min cycle to dam square, The reception staff were so lovely welcoming They gave us a welcome ice cream free drink on arrival and were so helpful We were staying for 3 nights staying in a suite room each day our bed was dressed towels replaced etc The room itself was so funky spotlessly clean a decent size with the most amazing black out blinds So easy to rent bikes food was lovely in the bar 
509274,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The bed was quite uncomfortable because the mattress was sunk, The ambience at the lobby is very enyoyable especially if you have teens in your group there are some nice details as the map with bike rides that they give and the tap in the entrance to refill your water bottle
509275,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, i kinda expected from a four star hotel to find a small bottle of body lotion in the bathroom The bike rental was more expensive than I expected too 12 EUR day , This is a fun hotel with super friendly staff easily accessible clean good food We enjoyed the pool tables as well 
509276,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, It would be very nice if there would be fridge and maybe more chairs for two people, Bed was perfect location was perfect next to metro and night bus You can get a hairdryer in reception Design of room was very interesting 
509277,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Photo booth didn t work which was unfortunate , Very comfortable bed great presentation of the bedroom layout very into big windows Great breakfast 
509278,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, No in room dining but the staff always recommended near by restaurants We couldn t order water to the room but there are vending machines at the lobby which were out of order the hotel staff gave us complementary water, We stayed 3 nights in this hotel the decor is really cool and modern The room was pretty basic however very clean We loved the location as the metro station was directly in front of the hotel Central stations is just 3 metro stops away I really liked the atmosphere and attitude of the hotel and staff I would recommend specially for young people 
509279,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Everything was perfect, Everything was great The welcome pack you get a waffle and a condom which is a nice personal touch the common areas are perfect for working staff was lovely and the coffee was great Would definitely stay again and recommend to others 
509280,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The mattress was very squashy and could have done with an extra 2 pillows as we only had 1 each Also the room was only cleaned for the first 3 days of our stay and not on the last 2 unsure why possibly our error as maybe we needed to place the hanging sign on the front of our door for it to be cleaned but this didn t seem the case for the first 3 days , Absolutely loved the fact that we had a coffee machine it was a really good addition to our stay Also we were on the 12th floor and the views over Amsterdam were absolutely stunning 
509281,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The room was not acccording to the photos online that trigged me into booking this hotel instead of another one that looked very nice to me So the room was a dissapointment but it was clean Really bugged me not to have nightstand and a plug in beside the bed Overall it was really nice and i enjoyed my stay , The staff is nice from my experiance I would think about coming back here 
509282,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Rooms are not clean Dirty walls bathroom not very clean bed sheets had holes Dark carpet makes kind of old impression Breakfast is for the price of 12 Euro really somewhat limited and basic Skip breakfast and just take a coffee place some meters down the road , Entrance and ground floor is really nice and modern 
509283,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, For the most part staff was very friendly and helpful However they did very little to accommodate or hasten the pace at which I could check into my room They showed little concern or sympathy that I had flown red eye and was extremely exhausted No sorry we ll do the best we can No checking the system periodically to see if a room had become available Also the bathroom and room had a faint smell of gym locker room , For the most part staff was very friendly and helpful The space was very creative and fun 
509284,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, They need more staff there was a line up for checking in and out and also long wait at the restaurant not for breakfast though The location is convenient because is near the metro but it is not a nice area to walk around , The common spaces were nice the restaurant was great the staff was super helpful 
509285,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The hotel was perfectly situated a train and metro ride away from the airport and the staff couldn t do enough the help We had an amazing time in Amsterdam and will be returning to this hotel on our next trip Any one going be advised to take good comfortable walking shoes The hotel is a nice little walk away from the main strip of this part of the city The river views are beautiful which ever way you look and the local shops are staffed by laid back friendly people Take the metro two stops up towards the city centre and take a walk through waterlooplien as this area is beautiful and has the zoo botanicals gardens and the historic flea market with Waterloo square being surrounded by coffeeshops gift shops restaurants and the canals Find a supermarket and make yourself a picnic be warned though they can be hard to come by and open at different times to we English are used to The room we stayed it was comfortable and clean a very trendy hipster location for students and travellers Would recommend this hotel to everyone and anyone oooo and go and find TAPMARIN an 800m stroll from the hotel and the best burger you will ever have 
509286,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The staff of this pretentious frat house were extremely unhelpful and condescending They have a lot to learn about hospitality understanding and compassion , The room was comfortable 
509287,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The price is higher than some other option but it s totally worth it , The decor of the hotel is fantastic The room is modern large and comfortable The laundry also helped a lot It s not very very close to the city channels but you are a few steps from the subway 
509288,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Shower is organised so badly that we had a bathroom full of water on the floor and had to it every time after shower with towels So floor was always wet and dangerous They need to change it Another problem was isolation We could hear our neighbors talking , Hotel location was not really central but it was easy to reach everywhere by Metro the station is right outside the hotel Room was spacious and clean Staff was very friendly 
509289,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, A little far from the Centre but this did not impact upon our enjoyment of the stay, Excellent design in the rooms and hotel loved the pool tables etc and the hang out zones the bar was excellent the receptionists lovely and helpful and the bike rental very cheap easy and useful 
509290,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Safe did not work initially very quickly sorted by staff One of the bedside lamps didn t work didn t bother me that much so didn t raise with staff , The location of the hotel is perfect 6 minutes by metro to central station Hotel was nice and clean staff super friendly They prepared a little surprise for my boyfriend on his birthday as well which was very sweet 
509291,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Our bathroom door had a hole in it which wouldnt be acceptable if we were staying longer , Pillows very comfy gorgeous interior design but its not continued in all of the rooms 
509292,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Was looking forward to having a bath and was disappointed that the room didn t come with one The pressure in the showerhead was also pretty poor , The bed was huge and extremely comfortable and we appreciated the USB sockets and smart TV 
509293,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Our pillows were left on the floor and a dirty sponge was left our sink it seemed like the maid was interrupted during cleaning and forgot to finish the job No room service and the attached bar restaurant The Pool was closed in the evening each time we wanted a late night snack drink we had hoped for more paying around 200 nt , Excellent wifi in the room Comfy bed Cool decor Friendly and helpful people on the front desk Metro station is very close Nice park nearby 
509294,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Could do with a Fridge and a locker in the room No provision or space for extra bedding in the room , Good location and very friendly staff Close to Metro and Tram lines 
509295,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The atmosphere around the hotel is buzzing full of energy staff are so friendly was given a complimentary ice lolly in arrival as a welcome guests are friendly too there s a restaurant and bar next door restraunt offers breakfast to guests and open to the public in the evening there s a laundry room in the basement gym bike garage to leave bikes subway is close by with quick travel to Amsterdam centre places to eat fast food and supermarket 5min walks away rooms are clean information guides and maps 
509296,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, It was quite loud at night time but that s expected in a city I suppose Also black walls in the hotel room was a bit odd as it didn t match the atmosphere downstairs , Great atmosphere and decor in the hotel lobby very cool and contemporary great vibes Staff were lovely and welcoming Ping pong and pool table in the lobby was a nice touch 
509297,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Perfect hotel a little out of the centre but easily accesible by the underground which was cheap and easy to use there is a stop just outside the hotel Beds were ridiculously comfy and rooms were very modern and spacious and kept super clean Cant fault this hotel at all 
509298,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Poor and unreliable room service Upon complaint at reception they are friendly and promise everything But nothing happens Staff does not take much responsibility and is often unreliable General impression Overall in this hotel there are far too many seemingly funny and cool statements clustering all the walls The cool designers clearly overdid in that respect , Good breakfast Nice rooms Good bathrooms
509299,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, For some odd reason the room key kept de magnetizing We had to go back to Reception every night to fix the key which took a total of 5 seconds but was still a little annoying , The bed was super comfortable Almost started crying when I left hecause my bed at home isn t even that comfortable Staff was extremely nice and helpful We used Uber throughout our stay but it was nice that there was a subway station pretty much right next door 
509300,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Booked an apartment on 3rd January and at the beginning of June I got an email informing me our apartment was undergoing renovations and was given 3 bedrooms instead no living room kitchen etc as planned and we were put in bedrooms on different floors There didn t appear to be any renovations ongoing I do believe they rebooked our apartment at a higher price When I emailed to say this was not as I booked they told me I had an option to cancel but everything was much more expensive than when I originally booked in January so this wasn t an option for us There wasn t even an apology when we arrived at the hotel,No Positive
509301,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Not clean housekeping is inadequate did not fill shower gel maybe for cost cutting reasons although concept is good it is not a good hotel experience , Staff was great and attentive
509302,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Everything was amazing from start to Finnish we got upgraded as a extra surprise to the 6 bedroom apartment which was one of the Nicest I have ever stayed Thank you for such an amazing trip
509303,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Bedsheets we re not changed the room was very basic with high unpainted undecorated ceilings The hotel was about a 45 minute walk from the centre at least We took the metro and it was 3 or 4 stops from central ,No Positive
509304,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Bike lock broke as it was flimsy Hotel were ok about it but we had to walk back a long way Would have preferred hotel to be more central it was still expensive I thought , The ping pong table and easy hire of bikes 
509305,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, It was very comfortable to live in this place because room was very spaciously and quite Just 20 minutes to Van Gogh museum not far from De Pjip Few places to have breakfast just in 2 minutes 
509306,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I travelled with my boyfriend and we wanted to both pay separately upon arrival however I was told on check in that my account had already been charged A little hiccup but I realise that charging policies vary between hotels, Staff were very friendly and helpful provided plasters extra coffee supplies and any information you could need about the city and transportation Free ice cream on arrival was great too Transport was very easy between the hotel and as the metro into the city centre is very closely located to the hotel Rooms and the lobby look exactly as they do in the pictures online
509307,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, You have to use the METRO in order to get the city center The metro is front the hotel and easy to use , The room is big and comfortable The restaurant offers good food with a pleasant atmosphere
509308,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, We were told our room wouldn t be ready until 3 upon arrival despite checkout being at 12 We waited around however and a room became available at 1 30, The attention to detail made our trip really special receiving a welcome snack on arrival and being giving bottles of water The bed was extremely comfy and amenities within the hotel an added bonus after a day of sightseeing pool table gym etc 
509309,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The breakfast isn t great not much of chooses and overprice , The location is great 5 minutes walk from the metro station Room is big Bed is very comfortable Staff are helpful and friendly 
509310,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The breakfast was overpriced for the options available Limited hot food which was disappointing , The bed was so comfortable Made for relaxing after walking around the city for hours 
509311,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, this hotel shouldn t have 4 star with 8 7 ranking We were in this hotel for 4 night one they in the morning I signed for clear room and asked reception at 8 Am for cleaning room but in the 16 when I came back they did not clean it and I asked to clean after 18 and they said we quit after 18 another day I signed Do not disturb and when I came back an electric technician was in my room and worked on lamp breakfast quality was very low and I payed 14 Euro for each day two times I asked for bottle of water and reception told me we are busy now I asked for an extra blanket and I received dirty blanket , Nothing
509312,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The hotel is a 30min walk into the centre which is a little far however bike hire from the hotel made this all better and we were then relieved to be slightly away from the hustle and bustle, The hotel had a lovely atmosphere about it with lots of friendly people around
509313,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, the common walkway lighting a bit dull and dark Scary if walking alone , The overall concept of the hotel Unique and modern The staffs are friendly and approachable 
509314,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Very poor sonorized the room 100 you can determine what s going on in next appropiate room even what you dont want to do so Therefore not so good I think,No Positive
509315,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Unorganized staff at the restaurant Lots of staff but nobody takes care of you They are very slow do not forget to order the bill ar least half an hour before you need to leave Apart form that and if you bring enough time and patience everything was fine ,No Positive
509316,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I was a bit confused by the breakfast restaurant I didn t think it was set out too well , I liked that on arrival you received a complimentary biscuit and the staff were always available if you needed any help finding places 
509317,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Rooms hearing the people s conversation next door, The hotel was very clean the staff were very helpful but the rooms were not sound proof and you could hear the conversation that the people next door were having
509318,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The room was not soundproofed which we observed during the daytimes and resulted in a disrupted final night s sleep Our complaint was taken by reception staff around 02 30am and action has not yet been followed up by the hotel manager as promised We were situated in a corner suite and disappointed by the lack of privacy not forgetting the expense of the room We declined the option of sending security as our neighbours were only talking and vomiting not shouting or partying and did not feel they were at fault to escalate the situation , Excellent location near the metro and local amenities Fun relaxing concept mixing students with visitors 
509319,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, it seems that nobody took care of cleaning up our room Taking into account overall quality of hotel services I guess it was a mistake in housemaid schedule, modern rooms dressed like a student campus room coffee ma hine in the room room was quite big big double bed good bikes for rent
509320,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The bed in this hotel was amazing This was my first time abroad without parents or a school trip but the hotel staff could not have been more helpful with directions or any question we asked them 
509321,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The staff were great as soon as we arrived and let us check in about 5 hours before check in time Metro station directly outside 4 stops from dam central The room was great and bed was really comfortable Have already booked same hotel for a return in a few months time 
509322,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Air Con may as well have not been there Lats kept popping out of the bottom of the bed Service at the bar could have been better , Great design nice rooms Good location right beside metro 
509323,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The only thing was the price I splurged a little bit and got a private room due to some circumstances but it was more expensive than I was expecting Still a great place and worth every cent but that s all I can complain about , The hotel was at the edge of the city which was honestly kinda nice It was about a 5 10 bike ride to get into the heart of Amsterdam and see everything The staff was beyond helpful and friendly It has every amenity you could possibly think of and then some Very edgy and modern and full of people at all times 
509324,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Very basic rooms and facilities Nothing wrong with them but certainly not the four star hotel it is advertised to be Felt very overpriced , Nice staff clean good public transport links to the city centre 
509325,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Bed was not good changed to another room Sam problem Mattress was sinking Not much options for trams from hotel to center , The hotel is very nice and cool Staff is very nicev great breakfast
509326,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The air conditioner in the room scarcely worked the rooms were a little dark and didn t have a fridge or anything , The hotel had a really cool vibe clearly aimed at students It was a 2 minute walk from the station or the tram which took you wherever you needed to go in Amsterdam so the location was absolutely excellent and really easy to travel from 
509327,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The staff were lovely and the hotel was better than we expected Lovely and spacious We arrived early in the morning and they checked us in straight away with the rooms ready and waiting 
509328,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Great hotel clean modern well designed room with Tea Coffee facilities in the room Good WiFi comfortable bed quiet rooms The hotel is well located a little further from the centre than some hotels but still easily walkable to Rembrandtsplein in 15 20 minutes or there s a Metro train station within 50 metres of the hotel entrance Wibautstraat 
509329,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Definitely not worth close to 200 a night incl breakfast and parking Rooms dark with long narrow corridor Quite noisy from the outside Also didn t really like used condoms lying on the stairs on my way up and down to my room All in all very disappointing ,No Positive
509330,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, All was good, Showed up early from our cruise Rooms were available Since we had booked through Booking com we were eligible for a free upgrade Very nice Frozen popsicles when we checked in As it was also my wife s birthday Staff showed up at our room with a small birthday present socks cookies key chain and balloon A most pleasant surprise They have a restaurant attached to building discount breakfast if you buy at check in Excellent deal The building itself as I understand was a former newspaper plant that has been converted into a hotel They have retained much of the original building during renovations The appearance is one of Spartan yet retains a certain old building vibe and excellent ambiance The hotel is also very eco green which as a Canadian visitor was different yet very sensible
509331,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Spent 9 nights in the same room The last 3 4 nights they didn t change my bed linens But it was in general very clean and not really needed to change them , Nice huge bed with extremely soft bed linnens Spacious room
509332,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I don t have any bad comment My overall stay was great , The first person that greet me was very friendly I was basically feel welcome at first greeting The room was spacious and clean The hotel may not be in city center but it s easy to go there using the train the station is just a walk away The surrounding was near the water canal sea I manage to take a walk around and snap good picture of it I m very happy with the stay there The most that I like is the staff hospitality hotel coziness and cleanliness and the interior design is awesome They staff even give me orange paper crown to celebrate King s Day and that waffle thingy 
509333,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, they say they change sheets every 2 bay s I had to ask them 3 Times before the change them in the third , the palace it was convicted with the trains 
509334,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, There wasn t anything not to like , Our reception was friendly and efficient we were even offered a stroop waffel upon checking in I loved the eclectic interior of the hotel the additional facilities would have definitely been used if my stay was for a longer period I will definitely recommend The Student Hotel to anyone looking at staying in Amsterdam 
509335,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Breakfast was dull But hey it s Amsterdam and there are alternatives close by I would have liked to have a fridge in my room for the longer stay but generally all facilities were good , It s just about everything I needed for work accommodation Very close to our office and the city and close to train that I only used once and bike rental they had their own bike rental system which was excellent but I chose to use an alternative Great facilities for students which work well for business people as well I loved that there was a great mix of people from young students to older business people and even families 
509336,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, to be able to change the Eco temperature on the thermostat Hot , The bed was massive not far from the local shops You can easily get an Uber into town costing around 5 7 euros 
509337,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The hotel is good but is really expensive for what we get unless it s the case for Amsterdam hotel prices The room is not soundproofed at all we hear everything happening in the corridor and other rooms so bring your earplugs and we discovered that the bed board had been fixed with duct tape All of this didn t hinder our comfort or sleep much but an hotel at such night fees should be more careful about this , We really liked the concept of the hotel which is very young and lively The room was big and very comfy The wifi is exceptional which is really rare nowadays The restaurant in the hotel is convenient for breakfast and dinner The hotel is very well located closed to the city center and to the airport 
509338,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I could find no fault love the ethos behind the concept and pleased this is now a group of hotels that is rapidly expanding in other great places , Nothing at all to dislike or dissect Beyond any nitpicking 
509339,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Very expensive breakfast with no discount in the bar the pool for residents Price for hotel was also high but not too unreasonable , Very comfy large bed Free condoms Very cool lobby games area 
509340,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, nothing bad at all, Our room was amazing really spacious modern clean and had a nespresso coffee machine Really great common areas the gym had every piece of equipment i needed and the staff were really accommodating and nice The stroopwafel was a nice touch too
509341,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, only one key save energy and have to close window for AC to work was too hot , Great style great service they also offer bike rental for 9 euros a day great bikes located near the metro just a few minutes from the central pool ping pong and more at the lobby and a gym and laundry room on site too
509342,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The bathroom tub was designed by monkeys It had no shower curtain and the glass separator only extended out 2 or 3 feet from the shower head So what ended up happening each night was that a bunch of water would just splash out of the tub and onto the floor I got tired of moping up my mess every night and just ended up letting it evaporate off the floor But still it sucked , The room was actually quite large compared to my expectation I also appreciated the trendy upbeat vibe that was consistent throughout the property 
509343,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Greate location in a quite area the nearest metro station is just 2 minute walk from the hotel and only 4 stops from central station The stuff were lovely and was ready to help with any question we had the hotel facilities and room were nice and clean
509344,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Ckeck in is a bit late at 15 00 however when I came even at 15 00 my room was not ready I recieved a lot of appologieses from Reception staff but you know It is 4 hotel and I paid as for 4 hotel there I do not support it I do not mind by which reason my room is not ready I was waiting for around till 15 30 and then they gave me a key saying that as a bonus of their mistake I can have free breakfast at the hotel restaurant I thought just one day But then I discoverd that they included all my staying with breakfast however I did not understand it and did not use it Because Recepcion was like in panic during my check in They even did not ask my passport and did not give me a receipt of staying with my name and with information that i paid everything there The room was clean but not perfectly clean My mattress was like with big dint from someone fat who was sleeping there before me I did not ask to changed it because I wanted to enjoy the city but do not solve the problems It is 4 hotel but you do not have access to Cooking Lounge and there is no fridge in the room Why There is no safebox phone just phone to reception I did not get why this hotel is 4 because if the hotel has new furniture hot water and heating that does not mean automatically to put this place to the high level Yes of course I felt comfortable But for this price and stars I expected really more Thank you , Heating city view location near metro and tram stations also you can walk to the city center by very nice way new furniture big room 
509345,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Some reception staff not very helpful when I asked about where to find restaurants and bars in surrounding area , Very comfortable bed and lovely room Very helpful bar restaurant staff when asked about where to go for food drinks 
509346,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Everything was great , The Student Hotel is a unique place with so much positive vibe The staff was very kind and helpful Room was extremely clean and cozy Metro station is in front of the hotel and you are in the center after 10 15min You can go to the center by walking in 25 30min I ll be back as soon as I can Thaks that you make our stay in Amsterdam so comfortable and full with good memories 
509347,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, There was slightly loud music one morning and the shower wasn t powerful , The hotel is slightly out of town but can easily be reached by metro or by hiring a bike which we did from the hotel and had great fun The hotel is very well decorated and has really cool spaces to hang out in The room itself is gorgeous and we slept well Would recommend to a friend 
509348,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Excellent location you can take the subway to reach the centre of the city or if you prefer you can rent a bike which is a wonderful experience in Amsterdam Rooms are clean and comfortable breakfast really good Thanks to the friendly and professional staff
509349,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, My room was a little too dark and the lighting is a little harsh , Location near the metro remarkably friendly staff great breakfast for a good price cool interior 
509350,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Nothing , Good selection of food in the resataurant amazing pizza Reasonably priced drinks Table Tennis was a bonus Free wifi Rooms were large and very clean 
509351,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, a little dusty in the room and the closet door very little gap to the floor keep hitting my parents toes because it is design very close to the bed , Very cozy place to stay at the metro and supermarket are nearby and my parents loved the lobby with great atmosphere 
509352,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The beds are too soft for guests with lower back issues , The reception is man by young energetic and pretty staff who are helpful in answering questions 
509353,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Nothing , The room was very unique and chilled Amazing to have a coffee machine and free water Staff were very friendly and loved the break out areas to play pool and table tennis 
509354,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The walls were very thin not a big problem but it might bother some guests , Very comfortable room the staff was very friendly and the hotel was very warm The room had modern installations and was very user friendly The location despite not being in central Amsterdam was excellent it s right next to a metro station that takes you quickly into Amsterdam Centraal or if you stop earlier you re at The Waag Take a nice walk over the Amstel and you re close to the Albert Cuyp Markt a further along and you re at the Museumplein 
509355,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Only wish it was slightly more centre but we didn t mind the 5 minute metro ride And metro station was just outside the hotel Well worth it for this hotel , The apartment was a perfect space for a hen party Staff were friendly and loved the welcome check in treat mmm
509356,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Nothing I really enjoyed my stay here , The hotel is done really well with good facilities and extra touches The staff are great easy going and helpful The on site bike hire made life even easier especially as the lady on reception then circled good places to go on a map and highlighted how easy it is to get there etc An altogether pleasant experience and would definitely look out for these hotels to use in future 
509357,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Found the bed too soft although that is I guess down to personal opinion , Friendly and helpful staff great bike rental and good sized rooms Loved the small touches the stationery fun sayings on soap hairdryer bag etc the table tennis and relaxed atmosphere Had a small issue with the drainage in the bathroom reported this as we checked out and our bike rental was removed from our bill as a result Thank you Melvin great service It is a good walk from the centre 20mins we didn t mind this at all the exercise and the journey along the canal home was worth it 
509358,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Nothing it was all perfect, Could not fault the hotel It was clean and comfortable and the staff were excellent and so friendly easily one of the best hotels I ve staied in
509359,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The entire property is very modern and has a clean look Anemeties wjerenal fantastic as well as the gym Rooms where also very clean and modern Highly recommended
509360,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, First of all It is a shame for such reputable hotel in Amsterdam the TV didn t work for three straight night The answer from the staff was very ridiculous i e it was because too many guesses were watching at the same time thus the tv signal became weak Secondly to my surprise I found a man s brief underwear underneath the bed unnoticed by the housekeeping , A comfortable bed and proximity to the metro
509361,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, It was my second time in this hotel and I really expected to have same good stay as the last one almost one year ago However this time I went to a room not so well cleaned with a deformed mattress , The wireless is fantastic The laundry is very good for self service but the regular service could be an option to whom can afford 
509362,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Shower could use a bit better curtain in current state it requires a bit of carefulness to not spill water on the floor The breakfast despite being quite nice is not included so you have to add a bit to the price if breakfast is must have for your needs , Very great hotel having everything even remotely required and with quite manageable price Location may seem to be a bit remote however simple metro and tram usage allows you to travel to all possible common tourist location and back in just 10 15 minutes All the things required are in the room like teapot coffee microwave refrigerator TV and even stove Everything seems really neat and tidy A lot of restaurants in different price categories nearby plus neat little park if you prefer running or cycling 
509363,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Alicia the receptionist was so kind and helpful Everything about the hotel had such a cool and relaxed vibe including the lounging area and the study area too Would highly recommend especially if you are young and travelling with a partner or a group of friends 
509364,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The building was already aged with dark narrow corridors and rooms had some errors in design E g the bathroom sink was so close to the shelf above that the tap lever nearly touched it when used The glass wall in the shower corner was too small The microwave oven was placed too high The second room did not have fridge Some facilities did not work TV channels did not show up until the very helpful lady from the reception came to boot it Sockets beside the bed were not connected to the mains The safety box in the second room was locked by arrival and had to be opened by the staff , Metro and Tram lines goes nearby Rooms are quiet although many loud happenings in the entrance hall Young students give you a feel of life Fast and reliable wi fi and modern computer available for customers Rooms were cleaned every day but toilet paper nearly run out Breakfast quite simple but worth of price The staff was polite fast and always ready to assist 
509365,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I was disappointed with the choice of food at breakfast for the price we were charged Everything was very tasty however choice was limited and I found that the way bread was touched and cut by every other person was very unhygienic We arrived at the restaurant at around 9 30am and there were no rolls left for us and only 1 5 loafs of bread left I would also like to note that cups of coffee are tiny and coffee was luke warm , I loved the room and how friendly and helpful the staff were I also thought that having a laundry room was a great idea and very helpful 
509366,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, We got a free upgrade to a suite which was amazing and free drinks token Everyone was so friendly and helpful Renting the bikes were super easy and worth the money Perfect location just jump on the metro a few stops to the centre and cheap too Better than staying in the centre 
509367,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The restaurant was limited on food for vegetarians , The bed was very very comfortable The room was modern and beautifully designed There was both a bath and shower which was nice You can rent bikes from the hotel which is very handy 
509368,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Each morning we mentioned to the staff member at the desk that the cable television was not working properly and would cut out half way through a program or movie it always seemed to come back for the dreaded TV ads We were told it would be looked at As I do not have a television at home it is a treat to watch it when I travel after a long day of visiting a city I was mildly annoyed that it was never fixed or that we were not told it could not be fixed which would have been fine too In the grand scheme this complaint is so minor when I consider what a great spot to stay it was Keep up the good work , The staff members were spot on and the facilities restaurant bar room quality of food all excellent Great upbeat place to stay with staff members who were interested and interesting 
509369,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The thermostat in the room did not work Tried all the directions we were told but still did not work We should have asked for a maintenance person but since we were out and about so much we never got around to it As I mentioned before I felt the cleaning of the room was a little sub par , This is a marvelous hotel for us seniors The staff are wonderful very friendly and accommodating The room was spacious and comfortable The cleaning left a little to be desired but nothing awful just not very thorough With the metro stop just outside the door Centraal Station is only five minutes away With all the students in the area and the cute signage in the room we felt young again Great experience 
509370,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The soundproofing i heard something hahaha, Easy to metro The staff was very kind Everything that you need just ask they are so helpful The hotel was designed very well so many fancy thing that you will find inside the hotel Neat Big space room Lobby was good Instagramable Will be back and stay again 
509371,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The hotel is in energy saving mode lights only work while in the room no fridge Showers don t have doors water gets everywhere Service is not of major importance but all of Amsterdam is that way Breakfast is just OK but across the street is the Breakfast Club and they re really good The Metro shuts down at 1am I was able to walk home from the red light district twice but while intoxicated it s a hike , Location was excellent next to a great supermarket right next to the Metro 51 53 and 54 trains 4 stops to Central Station There s also a great local restaurant SINBAD that stays open after the hotel and central bars close and a bodega just up the block from there that carries beer both are only around the corner The room has a window that opens loved the fresh air The restaurant has great pizza and burgers and a great staff made up of students Ping Pong Pool very internet friendly with tons of usb charging stations 
509372,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Check in time could be a little earlier as we arrived at 10 and couldn t check in until 3 However the hotel were very kind as to take our luggage and keep it safe so we didn t have to drag it around Amsterdam so it wasn t a major issue, The staff were amazing any little question we had the answered and helped with a smile When we arrived we were greeted with chocolate bunnies and caramel waffles to celebrate the Easter period Me and my partner loved the photo booth from the 60 s they had in the lobby Overall couldn t fault our experience 
509373,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Modern hotel with friendly staff and nice restaurant It has a big parking behind the hotel 17 5 per day if you come by car it s good It is located 25 minutes walking from the center We have rented a bike 9 per day to go to visit the city The bikes are really nice The rooms are clean and spacious 
509374,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Extremely bad soundproof in the Hotel We were troubled by all the noise from the neighbours I would hesitate booking this again because of this , Great bed and nice rooms Great location close to de pijp and the metro
509375,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, We booked a few hours before checking in for one night The price was more reasonable than any other of the better hotels in Amsterdam but still quite expensive We payed 350 , The hotel was very nice The interior is very modern and entertaining let yourself surprise the staff is very nice and helpful The hotel is very clean and we had a comfy stay with btw very fast internet So we were positively surprised and will probably come back The hotel has a metro station closeby which we did not use because the city centre is not far away Nice location Nice neighborhood 
509376,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Sadly there is no double rooms or twin beds only bunk beds or rooms with one queen size bed , Very Fresh new concept it brought me back to my student times Facilities are great and staff is extremely friendly 
509377,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Bar cafe staff could have been more attentive were quite rude , Great hotel and friendly helpful reception staff Excellent location would visit again 
509378,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, This is a design hotel with all facilities You need Very friendly and helpfull staff Good atmosphere where You feel welcome and have a good fundament for a relaxing holiday in Amsterdam There are good bikehire for a very reasonable price which make You transport around Amsterdam the perfect way to experience the sight of the City 
509379,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Room was large with high ceilings and plenty of space and recently renovated Bed was comfortable and they supplied us with a Nespresso machine which my friend was delighted about 
509380,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Couldn t change the temperature of the conditioner The water from shower split over half of bathroom There wasn t a hanger for a face towel , Really cool design friendly staff near a metro station Young and vibrant atmosphere 
509381,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Although easy access to centre via train it stops after midnight and we like to play late so needed to get taxis back to the hotel but only a small minor detail overall, Loved young atmosphere and design details Great Margaritas at the bar Bike hire useful and fun 
509382,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, No problems at all everything was beyond expectations would love to come back , The massive bed was fabulous The decor was wonderful and very different Right beside a train station that took us to Centraal Station in less than ten minutes extremely regular too 
509383,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, No fridge in room , The Student hotel is a very youthful and buzzing environment to be in when you walk into the lobby you instantly see friendly faces and people studying The staff are also very nice and polite and in addition to that may I say the pillows are so comfortable I would honestly come back just for the pillows Looollllll 
509384,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, A kettle and small fridge would have been a great addition to these rooms , The location is brilliant right next to a metro station that has trains every few minutes right into central station The decor in the lobby is very cool and the bar restaurant area is also very nice Our bedroom on the 12th floor was spotlessly clean bed was comfortable and there was lots of storage and power points We didn t eat breakfast there but it did look good and we were given a card to claim two free drinks there when we checked in This hotel is ideal for people who just want somewhere clean and comfortable to sleep maybe not for those who like real luxury 
509385,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Quite a long walk to the city although the metro was right outside Breakfast Very expensive for what you get , Rooms were amazing Spacious Comfy Bed Pool tables and Table tennis table Restaurant provides take away option as well as dining in 
509386,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The shower could do with a little bit more pressure and a little hotter It was fine for the weekend Any longer and I think it would ve become very annoying , The bed was to die for Super comfy The room was a great size and very clean 
509387,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Too soft bed mattresses slow and unhelpful staff in the hotel restaurant average breakfast, Tasty waffles as a welcome snack nice spacious and clean room amazing and cheap bikes for rent
509388,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Unlike during my previous stays the bed had a shape of a trough and wasn t comfortable at all Normally this place has nice and pleasant beds this time I got unlucky , A clean slightly spartan positive in my eyes place at a good location with decent soundproofing 
509389,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, but the material is really really bad they have this problem with their bed which are all broken once u sit at them and they know this problem I ve asked the to fix my bed 3 times u can hear the next room talking or whispering trough the wall so lets not talk about if the tv is on but its an beautiful hotel, value for money is amazing is a very well designed hotel 
509390,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Room design may not appeal to all tastes bare concrete ceiling high contrast black white decoration , Very clean nice and helpful staff special thanks to Melvin from reception Convenient location not far from city center Quirky design 
509391,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Nice hotel real refreshment comparing traditional hotel styles It might be hotel for young people but for business traveler is real refreshment if you are open minded Like design location is perfect as metro is 50 m away I have done early booking and they have upgrade my room I support this way of life and doing business 
509392,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Bathroom was lovely however a few times there was no pressure in the shower so couldn t shower properly, great location close to supermarket and metro Great bike rental Rooms spacious and quirky Would stay again 
509393,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, all was fine just had to wait quite some time for reception people to assist us but only because they were understaffed In fact when more than one person was there we were attended to very well Breakfast also could be better with some scrambled eggs and bacon sausages best I loved was the room the writings the statements and the naming of the things inside hair dryer tissues etc So orgininal 
509394,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The lighting in the rooms and hallway are very bad and the shower head pulse is very weak it s an ok hotel would stay in it again, Friendly staff fast check in
509395,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The beds, Hotel was 2 minute walk from the metro station Excellent pool tables Bar and restaurant inside hotel There was also a laundry service and bike rental place in the basement 
509396,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Bike hire seemed expensive compared to public transport Staff could be abrupt and rude under pressure there were not enough on the front desk most of the time, Great Facilities including bike hire Spacious Rooms Clean Bathrooms Comfortable Bed Nothing wrong with the room what so ever
509397,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I was awakened early in the morning by the noise of the puncher and other construction noises from the opposite room As I discovered later part of the wing was under construction , The atmosphere of the hotel is amazing everything is so live The room I stayed in was very ncie and cosy I d love to have had the room like this when I was a student myself The personal is as always nice and friendly 
509398,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, I liked the decor of my room In my room was so many detailed items that at times I believed that I am at home The Student Hotel has the theme of Love Service in reception was nice and I was satisfaction Everything was easy and nice in the weekend Metro is very close and it s easy to go Schiphol Airport and come to home 
509399,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Nothing major just a business tip I tried to buy 2 drinks in the bar they had to check for me if they had change for the note I was using to pay with The note I was using was a 20 note Poor organisation from the bar to not have change for 2 drinks 10 from a 20 note , Very comfortable easily accessible has everything you need want 
509400,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The breakfast is not worth the money I would rather recommend having breakfast at the Breakfast Club restaurant which is only 200 meters away towards the city center , Excellent location with easy access to the metro and a main tram line Very nice design of the rooms Very friendly staff Cleaning services everyday and excellent gym in the premises 
509401,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The service in the cafe was very slow but the food was fantastic , We had excellent staff on reception and the room was spacious and clean We loved it very useful to be near the metro so we could jump on that to get to the centre quickly 
509402,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Loved the hole idea and philosophy of the hotel Modern and inspiring decoration warm and friendly people working from all over the world Nice breakfast
509403,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, nice friendly and helpful staff relaxed and chilled atmosphere perfect for a short visit to Amsterdam easily accessed via metro would definitely stay again no complaints
509404,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Our car was broken into in the Secure Car Park that we were advised to park in After visiting the police station a police officer told us that he s had problems with the receptionists in the hotel not warning people that the car park is a hotspot for break ins Also the receptionist admitted to us after we reported the break in that she doesn t park her car there because of the high chance of crime Really disappointed with our stay and annoyed we listened to the advise to move our car from a secure car park to their not so secure car park Very expensive stay for us and have had to continue our trip around the Netherlands with a broken window,No Positive
509405,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Nothing, All the staff here is friednly and extremely helpful There is free gym Studio which is a bonus I will definitey come back here should I travel to Amsterdam again
509406,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Obviously would have been nice if breakfast had been included but I only put that as I don t really have anything bad to say , Hotel was decorated in a cool and edgy way I liked the everybody should like everybody flags The room was perfect bed was comfy nice to have a TV and plenty of space We had a top floor room which gave good views too No doubt our fave bit was the ping pong table loved that The TedX talks area was also a nice touch 
509407,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, A couple of times the vendor machines for food were not functioning but that was a minor problem , Access from public transportation is excellent and to get Amsterdam center is super easy The rooms are very quiet and extremely confortable not to say the special attention to detail If you are a designer your are going to love this place 
509408,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Hotel is slightly further out than being smack bang in central but we easily got the metro that s right outside the Hotel everyday takes max 10 mins to center With this you obviously don t have the most amazing view but the quality of the room and overall hotel experience completely makes up for that , The room was amazing beautifully decorated and very spacious Loved the little touches like the cute postcards and pencils Great coffee machine in the room tv linked to YouTube and fast Wi Fi The restaurant and bar were again beautiful and had great choice of food and drink There was a vintage photo booth which was cool and staff were super friendly and helpful It felt better than a hotel and I would highly recommend 
509409,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The whole bathroom got wet when showering as the shower screen only covered half of the shower area , Bed was very comfortable Reception staff were friendly and helpful Area was quiet and there was a large supermarket just across the street which was useful for breakfast Games area was good for some late night entertainment 
509410,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The bed in our room was really uncomfortable and when we investigated further we discovered that there were three lats missing on both sides of the bed In fairness they were replaced the following day but the damage was already done to my back And sadly during our second night there was a lot of noise which apparently was because there was some sort of event downstairs So at 04 00 there was a group of very nosy guests running around the corridors , The location of this hotel is great right next to a metro station that brings you to central station in about 7 minutes The hotel is large and spacious The food is good in the restaurant The reception staff are super friendly and helpful 
509411,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Other hotels were nearer to city centre Not much of a view , Communal facilities such as relaxation area old photo booth and free table tennis Friendly efficient service Complimentary nespresso in room Fast WiFi 
509412,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Corridors are dark like in horror movies and rooms have pretty dark colors but nice lightning makes up for it in rooms, Students theme is amazing in every detail Keycard says Love is the key paper and pen Think in ink and so on It makes you smile 
509413,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The location is okay but not the best Easy access to metro to central though , Nice Hotel really nice and comfortable Architecture is amazing Would definitely stay there again All pictures you see you are what you get
509414,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The bed in our room 2121 was uncomfortable s and seemed to dip so me and my partner had to sleep at opposite sides of the bed to be comfortable , Loved the decor the bathroom and bedroom was really really clean and everyone was happy and polite 
509415,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The only thing I would suggest is to make it clear when breakfast starts and ends We were told when we checked in that breakfast went for an hour later on Sundays 11 30 However when we showed up at 11 we were told a little sternly that breakfast had already ended and were told to find a table quickly and to leave quickly This was a bit disappointing as it slightly brought the experience down which thus far had been awesome , The bed was very big and comfy the room itself was decorated to the smallest of details which was really appreciated The bathroom was also really clean and stylish The rooms are a good size and the hotel itself is very cool and has a chilled vibe 
509416,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Room was either to warm or too cold and the Windows not opening properly did not help , Staff where great Everything you need is 10 minutes away If this hotel was in the city centre it would be triple the price
509417,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, I chose a deluxe room for my partner and I however we found it very weird that we had seperate duvets Wasn t a huge issue but you guys were so good it s easy to telll the only thing I didn t like 
509418,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The personel was rather slow and unfriendly In the first place I was told that my room was unavailable and they would give me a smaller room with a compensation However in the end they have charged me 50 eur more and it took them forever to figure out what have happened Didnt get my compensation in the end , location is ok but still not central
509419,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Unfortunately the bed was really uncomfortable Both mattresses had a very deep dent which was rather unpleasant , Nice hip and trendy hotel Nice accents and humor Cool atmosphere Very easy to reach by public transport city centre easy to reach 
509420,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The staff were rude at times Especially in the Pool restaurant here we were served food that had been sitting under the lamps for 10 minutes served by a very rude waiter given a bill which had overcharged us the waiter questioned us on this very rudely and never apologized for his mistake and given change from our payment which was 10 short Also the wifi and TV were sometimes unstable the connection on the TV would drop constantly , The bed was wonderfully comfortable and the room was well decorated and furnished with good quality furniture The whole experience was of a far better quality than we had anticipated The location was brilliant the Metro was right outside and only 5 minutes to the city centre 
509421,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The common areas around the reception were not the cleanest , Fun games area with pool and table tennis Quirky interiors and student dorm style made it different not your standard hotel room 
509422,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, nothing, Very nice hotel and staff Metro is just outside the building and going to center is exremely easy Room was very nice and the free espresso in the morning in the room is a lifesaver 
509423,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Not a lot of options on the menu, Cookie on arrival was a nice touch the interior design of the hotel was amazing bed was so comfortable Overall a beautiful hotel within good distance to Amsterdam central square
509424,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Too pricey paid around 85 a night would have been happier if breakfast was included in this price I had to pay 12 euros extra for continental There were a lot of young people staying at TSH It did make me wonder how they were able to afford it One evening we came back to the hotel around 9pm Went to the pool bar to have food Was made to wait 20mins then told they were no longer serving food the sign said 24 hour dining Second night of 3 night stay we went to bed aorund 11pm was woken up by loud noises from next door at around midnight had to call reception who said they would sort it out they did however it took around 20mins , Communal areas and facilities were nice Rooms were nice Location was ok as it was easily accessible by Metro whilst being away from the busy city centre 
509425,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, We wished more variety on breakfast it was not worth 14 Soundproof was a bit weak you could easily hear talk and tv from next room Good luck with good night sleep if you live next door to a partyanimal , Big room comfortable bed underground station close nice decor in hotel pooltable and pingpong were nice 
509426,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Best ever Never been so happy to be in my hotel room while in a place like Amsterdam Didn t want to leave it and wish my own room was that comfortable
509427,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Everything was perfect When we were booking we requested to be on one of the floors higher up to get a nice view and when we arrived we had been allocated a room on the top floor Absolutely amazing view and such a lovely spacious room with a very clean ensuite Went to the pool restaurant beside the hotel which was Delish Definitely recommend 
509428,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Although the bathroom itself was good the shower pressure is a bit rubbish but that to be expected with so many rooms , The room was exactly as advertised spacious and fun The hotel itself had so much to offer such as restaurants bars and bikes to get around The location is great right next to a metro station and a 12 minutes bike ride from some of the main areas 
509429,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Only plugs one side of the bed and bathroom is a wet room with shower with a fan that didn t really work but these were minor details , Stylish modern hotel right beside a Metro stop that is only 4 stops from Centraal Station 3 stops from Nieumarkt from where you can walk to the Red Light District It is less than 10 minutes from Nieumarkt on the Metro Hotel also has several vending machines one of which contains travel essentials you may have forgotten 
509430,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The hotel is great The employees are polites The hotel has young look and its very new has been built a new year ago The rooms very cleans It s not at the Dam or at the main center but you have metro station 10 meters from the hotel and by 3 stations you can arrive to Dam Square The price is fair and I will return this hotel while ill be back Amsterdam 
509431,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The location is a bit far from the center The hallways connecting the rooms are a bit dark and gloomy as appose to the vibrant entrance , The look and feel of the hotel The staff were really nice and helpful 
509432,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Unfortunately the bed was not comfortable it was sagging exactly at the same place where you lie Apart of it It took us some time to find out how to have some warm in the room The ventilator had to be fully run and it took us some time to have higher temperature in the room we were in Amsterday while it was snowing and the temperature was approx 0 The staff was a bit confused about the parking at their premises A price of the parking is quite expensive , I really liked the room an equipment an appearance and a size were absolutely perfect Also the location is very good very close to the center 
509433,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, It was a tad annoying that we had to get a train from the hotel to the city centre but it was only a few stops and only took 2 minutes but would of liked it to have been a 15 minute walk from the centre however was about 50 minutes 1 hour , The bed was amazing And the curtains were completely black out Staff was very friendly 
509434,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The room service could have been a little better but overall it wasn t too bad just needs a bit more attention to detail , The staff was amazing they helped in everyway that they could Hotel offers great services from bike rentals to laundry and a modern lounge if you decide to sit down and study 
509435,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The restaurant the Pool served delicious food and staff were very friendly however it was unorganised and very slow when it came to serving We were forgotten about several times , The bed was huge and the room was quirky Not to mention the amazing view

509438,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The room was quite cold at times and unable to increase the temperature easily seemed to be on a controlled setting , Nice spacious room great leisure facilities and bike hire available 
509439,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, One of the beds was a little hard to sleep on memory foam mattress on wooden slats and the ladder to get up there was very rough on the hands and feet but there was plenty of sofa space to get comfy on , Loved the location Decor and the playroom was perfect for small guests
509440,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, One of the days the bathroom floor was dirty , We were in honey moon they give us a really nice room With romantic details Staff really friendly polite and datails oriented They have a really good rental bicycles services 
509441,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, If I had to choose something it would be that the nice big bed was covered by two single quilts rather than a double , We loved this hotel Very modern very clean decent shower and a comfy bed 
509442,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, I liked the customer services on reception People was veryyy friendly Enjoyed bicycles which I and my boyfriend rented The room was just amazingly amazing I did not expect to have small kitchen there which was very handy They cleaned the room every day on my big surprise and it wasn t even necessary I loved staying at the student hotel a lot a lot highly recommend it 
509443,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Mattress had a big dip in it We kept forgetting to mention it to the staff and according to what I ve seen and heard they would have changed it if we d said something so it was our own fault really, Staff were really friendly hotel was really cool Spent more time in the hotel than going out Facilities were all good Table tennis awesome Really good chilled out atmosphere cooking and fridge facilities in room located next to metro station 5 minutes ride from centre
509444,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I pad lighting control kept losing signal No info in the room about hotel facilities except small info on screen , Huge room and value for money Great locale Staff were happy to help 3 beds and almost 3 separate bedrooms 
509445,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Bed sheets and towels were not changed daily nor had new toiletries provided post housekeeping , The location is perfect relative to the City Center in addition to having a Metro Station 2 minutes away walking and a Tram Station 5 minutes away The hotel is clean had a nice and unique decor and staff were very friendly Free wifi was available in all areas 
509446,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Too big pillows so a bit hard to sleep on and it was a bit cold in the room Also the tv keeps loosing internet when I tried watching Youtube , The room was really pretty and the staff was always very helpful 
509447,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Bed was very uncomfortable and was actually broke when we first got there and had to be fixed Very noisy as expected and walls had marks all over them , The bar table tennis and pool tables that s about it 
509448,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, It s a bit of a long walk to get down town But bikes and the metro make up for that , Great hotel The metro is right out side and you can rent bikes for cheap All the staff was exellent and the bar was nice Rooma are nice and the whole look of the hotel is very cool 
509449,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, great staff well organized facilities such as bikes Felt at home with the room because of all the non standard shampoo books roomkey just a little different from the usual 
509450,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Ive been to Amsterdam more then 10 times now and this is def the best hotel ive been to pretty cheap and very clean A little far for walking but 1km away so 6 7 min max with the bike so totally worth it Staff very friendly comparing to other Amsterdam residents who if i wouldnt get in Trouble i would Smack all of them in the face People in amsterdam are very rude generally But this hotel is the best Everything was perfect gave us kitchen utilities forks spoons iceeee 
509451,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The Hotel is characterized by its modern style and facilities I loved the table tennis and pool area and the number of sits tables and couches around the groundfloor The double room was the definition of comfort very comfortable bed amazing view and a Nespresso machine with selection of capsules in the desk Sounds like a dream but it s actually reality 
509452,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I stayed there for 3 nights but I was asked to change my bed for 3 times The arrangement is the worst ever On weekends there were a large group of students booked the dormitory and the staff only cared about them but not the individual travellers The students were out at night and back in the midnight They were inconsiderate and made much noise until woken all individual travellers up and scolded them However the staff never helped The rooms were equipped with heaters but I was freezing for several nights Even the corridors and toilets were as cold as fridge The showering facility is in old fashion and you have to press the button outside of the sprinkler when you are taking a shower under the cold weather There are not enough electric sockets in the rooms Not enough lights either I would definitely ask anyone to reconsider whether to stay in this hostel I do think you have other choices in Groningen ,No Positive
509453,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, You took the payment for the hotel in couple of transactions and when I booked my room through booking com it shows that it was 427 pounds and you guys took 466 pounds I did message booking com and studenthe hotel but no one got back too me , Everything was great aisha who was at the resepction she was lovely 
509454,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Everything was so much bigger room entrance just plenty space I liked very much, Everything was great straight forward at reception Room was massive compared to other hotels in Amsterdam breakfast normal big breakfast room plenty tables in all perfect
509455,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Our shower was broken The drain was clogged so after 1 minute showering the bathroom was full of water and it started leaking also in the room We told the staff 4 times total and every time they would tell us that they were on top of it and they would fix it but alas 2 days with broken shower was what we had It was disgusting and the carelessness of the staff was astounding No compensation was offered not even an apology just indifference and at times annoyance On top of that the check in and check out process was simply dreadful One employee was happily chatting with tourists to give directions through the city the other was minding his own business it took 20 minutes to check out Seriously awful staff It s almost as if they are on holiday and happened to be there by mistake , The rooms are nice I liked the theme and the attention to detail You can dim the lights instead of turning them off there is absolutely no noise Bed is really super comfy 
509456,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Absolutely love this hotel came back for the second time and will definitely stay here when visiting amsterdam again Not even a 10 minute tube ride from centraal station and a 2 minute walk when you get off the tube The rooms are spotlessly clean full of nice modern touches to make you feel comfortable The bed was super comfy and the curtains completely black out The staff were very friendly at hand for all needs We hired bikes from the hotel which were fantastic and saved us finding somewhere to rent them We love it here so much have recommended to all our friends and would 100 advise you to stay here too 
509457,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Unfortunately the only negative thing was that the staff were slightly slow and the rooms were so cold , The moderness of the hotel The location was fantastic metro literally 2 minute walk away Cleaners are fantastic 
509458,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Could have been closer to downtown Amsterdam let s say walking distance but that was easily resolved by taking the subway , Perfect for young people Close to a subway station that takes you straight to Central Staation Nice decoration on the rooms 
509459,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, We are not used to Amsterdam s cold Aircon was set to 24 at max I am not saying to burn fuel at max but it would be nice to have a bit warmer room in Amsterdam s freezing cold , It is a very cool place Rooms are spacious Design is vibrant and energetic We absolutely loved it
509460,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The only thing was the bed it was a little hard to get comfortable on not impossible just hard, The room and the facilities that it provided were above and beyond
509461,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, We had a few hassles with the flash light control system not working but the staff were great and got it fixed quickly, We had really funky deluxe apartment our teenage boys loved it especially the ps4 and it is a 1 min walk to the metro and 5 mins into the city centre
509462,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Poor reception staff We had booked two of the larger rooms we were travelling as a family 2 adults and 2 teenage girls through booking com Initially we were told that the hotel was absolutely full and that we could only have rooms at completely different ends of the very large hotel Reluctantly we agreed only to find that one of the room was a very small double different to what we had paid for This had not been mentioned on the desk When we complained to the reception they were quite off hand saying that it was not their problem it was a problem with the cleaners Finally when it was clear we were not going to be brushed off they miraculously found us the right type of room on the same floor as the girls The rooms were nice although a little cold When we did ask about how to turn up the heating a little again staff were unhelpful , Stylish rooms and a good base 
509463,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Breakfast was not worth the money only bought it 1 3 days and would definitely suggest going out instead, The interior location and friendliness of the staff
509464,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Vending machines in main area broken Could have been useful to have more than one key Undercover smoking area outside would have been a nice touch as was extremely cold and wet when we visited Even with these suggestions hotel still exceeded expectation , Staff very friendly hotel comfortable and clean excellent location for access to metro Free bag was a lovely touch 
509465,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I was extra charged and after that wrongly charged But that was not the worst part it took them 4 days to solve this what was really annoying The shower drain was obstructed I complained two times about something broke in the bed that made my back hurt and nothing was done about that , Good location and value for money Restaurant is good Good atmosphere and structure 
509466,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The bed was huge and so comfy didn t want to leave it The staff were excellent and couldn t do enough for us The hotel itself was fantastic and quirky We loved the cute quotes that were on items Definitely be staying again if we go back 
509467,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Found the staff can be rude at reception and also it s called city hotel but yet we was spending the whole time in cabs to get places like the town and it cost us a fortune we easily done 80 100 euros a day on cabs from the hotel at first we walked into the town and it took us 45 mins walk, The hotel was really clean and a really cool place to stay it s really great for a group of young people plus a free gym and wifi
509468,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The rooms were beautiful but a little bit cold at night Heating didn t work the best As it had a time lock , The beds felt like sleeping on a fluffy cloud 
509469,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The only problem we experienced was the window in room 2412 we couldn t manage to shut it so it was a little cold on a night , The room and bathroom were exceptional very comfy the staff were very friendly and the restaurant served delicious food Would definitely stay here again

509471,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Cool hotel with that student vibe Stuff was really friendly and room was all we needed for weekend stay comfy bed and great view to main street It is situated near city center just 2 Metro stops or 25 30 min walk to Central station Supermarket and bakery all in the 2 3 min walk from hotel And Metro station is just a minute away from hotel so it was easy and fast to come and go to airport 
509472,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, , Everything about the hotel is spot on Loved the hotel and the way it is laid out No matter what age you are you can relive your student dreams there Room was big and toilets were clean Plenty of activities to do within the hotel itself i have stayed in brands like hiltons marriots plazas but this was different and better than those 5 hotels By far a great place to stay Very close to the central which takes 5 minutes on metro Staff were very helpful Loved everything about the place and for sure will revisit the place No hesitation in recommending this lovely place 
509473,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The eggs were extra fluffy the pillows were extra soft the room surpassed our expectations and so did the friendly staff Thanks so much for making our time in Amsterdam great In particular id like to give a shout out to the Pool Restaurant staff Their meticulous attention to detail friendliness and excellent service made us feel welcome

509479,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Shower could have been a little more powerful shower gel was not refilled and when I went down to inform the staff in the morning prior to going out he said that house keeping would check on that daily So I guess they missed that it out that day , Staff were really friendly and helpful helping to provide information when I asked about nearby xmas markets Staff was also really efficient when I went down to get a refill for my shower gel and tissue even willing to bring it up to me Location was 2 3mins walk away from metro convenient to move around 
509480,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The drainage in the shower was not good In other words we had a bath instead of a shower Not all staff speak Dutch , The room was very big and nicely decorated

509485,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Usual continental breakfast was a litte bit pricey and the coffe latte was not included air condition heating little bit noisy if you are running it at night and it did not warm up neither the room nor the bathroom , Comfortable and spacious bed good location next to the metro lines table tennis and American pool tables for fun 24h reception 
509486,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The room could have been warmer it always felt a degree or two too cold To be fair we never complained to the staff about it so did not give them a chance to rectify it should there have been something wrong with the heater , The people and staff at The Student Hotel are super friendly and happy which made such an amazing impression on us The check in was super smooth The room was as promised in the pictures and on the booking com website We had a wonderful stay in Amsterdam This hotel is an extremely convenient one minute walk to the Metro station The breakfast was delicious with a very nice buffet option I would definitely recommend it

509491,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, There was only one problem there were no single beds and I had booked a twin for myself and my teenage son We got over it but it wasnt the best I was quite surprised as it seems to be a young lively customer base and I thought more people would want twin beds , Everything else I would really like to stay here again The food was lovely and well priced lively bar lots to do in the hotel I wasnt well for a few days but I very much enjoyed staying at the hotel while my son went exploring Lots of lovely magazines to read and I found the large foyers really comfortable to sit and do artwork It feels like a productive artistic space

509504,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Nothing , The room was very spacious the restaurant lovely and the staff were really pleasant Plus the location was 5mins away from Centraal Station on the tram so was really centrally located to all amenities We would definitely return to this hotel the next time we visit Amsterdam 
509505,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Need to take metro to centre about five metro stops However the good thing is that it is next to a metro station It would help to buy day ticket or package ticket for metro tram and bus travel in the cold winter Otherwise it may take half an hour or so to walk to central station , The room is well equipped with good wifi a safe and even a coffee maker It is clean and comfortable Was given a free upgrade from standard room The reception is very helpful

509510,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The cleaning lady probably threw away our contact lenses by mistake Even though they came every day to clean the room they forgot to fill the shower gel which was empty during our stay , The reception staff was really helpful and friendly They offered us cookies while we were checking in and the check out was fast and easy The room was nice the bed was comfy We didn t have breakfast but we really enjoyed the coffee machine of the room Distance from the center is only 5 10 minutes by bike and the bike rental is very easy and totally worth it 
509511,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, When we arrived there was an issue with finding us a room We had booked several weeks in advance but it seemed that our room had been given away to someone who had booked that day and arrived just before us It was fine as we were found a room However for 5 10 minutes three staff at the check in desk argued amongst themselves about who had messed up making no attempt to hide this from us or apologise or explain what was going on A very unprofessional attitude and not a good first impression of the hotel , Location was good Just a ten minute metro ride to Centraal and the metro stop almost outside the hotel Memory foam mattress was great after lots of walking We didn t use the communal areas but they looked fun and seemed popular 
509512,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Room was extremely spacious and bed was so comfy and large perfect location few stops on the metro to the centre love the decor and the chilled vibes Quirky objects in the rooms a lovely touch and just to our taste staff really friendly and helpful with finding places didn t want to leave the best hotel I ve stayed at to date
509513,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The safe didn t work properly and someone had to come open it for us which took a few hours , I liked the staff the lobby was beautiful and the bathroom was good 
509514,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The food in the restaurant Service was slow and my food was cold yet it was expensive There s not much a variety of food or drink wouldn t go back to the hotel restaurant, It was funky and had many extras around for students View from room was amazing and room service was on point Staff also very friendly and so helpful and the facilities were amazing like having music on the TV was such a delight

509519,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The only thing that was annoying was the air conditioning it was very hard to use so 1 minute it would be cold the next minute it would get really warm which didn t help as me and my partner were both ill, The view was amazing from the 12th floor the bed was lovely and comfortable
509520,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The amount of water coming from the Shower needs to be improved It has low pressure and it takes longer to take a shower, The location very near the underground to city center The room size and cleanness The excellent bicycles to rent The student time feeling in the air
509521,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Nothing , The view from our room was amazing The facilities at the hotel were really good me and my boyfriend had many games of ping pong Also the location is great only a 2 minute walk to the metro which takes you straight to the city centre within 10 minutes 
509522,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Very stylish hotel Location is good Not directly in the overcrowded town center but close enough for sightseeing and activities Public transportation is directly in front of the hotel But it s also just a 15 20 minutes walk to all attractions And you can rent bikes at the hotel for 9 per day Staff is outstanding friendly

509530,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Waking up because some stupid guest turn on the fire alarm, The staff is most friendly and international helpful in many languages and familiar with the surroundings They always greet you with coockies and smiles The rooms are large and comfy The overall design is creative and the location is perfect outside the center and yet accessible by the near metro station and next to a lovely park 
509531,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Could be a bit cheaper , The vibe was brilliant and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful Laundry was self service and hence budget friendly It reminded us of our student life hostels As a welcome gift they gave us a packet of waffles This was awesome Huge collection of cycles is present at the premises The room was very well decorated Very close to metro 4 stops to central station

509534,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, No phone in the room to call reception wake up call or call another room , Hotel was fun quirky location was a little out of town but very easy on the train only 4 stops from central Breakfast was simple good food Bar downstairs and next door was chilled with decent music at night Rooms were small and clean 
509535,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The room was really unique I felt like at home The metro is a 2 minute walk away and you have a direct access to central Amsterdam The hotel looks amazing and you can get an amazing dinner at their restaurant Really worth it 
509536,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The staff just we re not helpful atall we booked 3 rooms and there were problems with each 1 My booking wasn t even there when we got to the hotel even tho I paid for all 3 rooms and there was no sorry or anything we waited for about 50 mins before we got a room key Drilling every morning at half 7 aswell just isn t good, Beds were huge and very comfortable Room was clean and tidy
509537,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The 2 things we didnt like were bathroom flooded everytime we d shower first time it almost flooded the room we had to call maintenance they showed up in a heartbeat and fixed it which could be solved by puting a sliding glass door to open and close shower and we wish we had a mini fridge there we bought cheese and a couple of sodas to drink and didnt have anywhere to keep them cool This is minor stuff though the hotel is great , This hotel is great Great atmosphere awesome staff room is very well decorated and clean had bottled water everyday and a nespresso machine refilled with capsules everyday Bed is comfortable had and conditioning and heater Bathroom amenities also towels changed everyday 3 min from Metro station right across the street from a big grocery store cool places around very close to Amstel Station if needed Totally worth it 
509538,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, breakfast seemed a bit pricey so we ate out most of the time but that was also because we did not want full breakfast, the relaxed atmosphere of this quirky hotel with staff who were all young and extremely helpful Ayesha stands out and seemed to enjoy their jobs
509539,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Relatively expensive although we did book it quite last minute on the weekend of the Amsterdam marathon , Big bed nicely designed room good coffee machine and great little kitchen area in our room fantastic staff quirky design and nice touches throughout Great bikes available to hire too highly recommended 
509540,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, None , Great hotel The rooms are very nice decorated big and comfortable The stuff are extremely nice and friendly The hotel has 2 main room blocks Regular hotel rooms block and Student rooms block this creates a very unique and cool atmosphere Sunway station is right next to the hotel very big private parking

509542,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Location was OK for me but if you are not on business it will take 30 min to walk to downtown or 10 min by metro , Modern hotel beautiful design large room suite with all facilities Quite room if not facing the road comfortable bed very quick internet very vice staff at reception Cheaper then other similar places 
509543,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The first night we got a room with Bonker bed which was making noise and since its stairs were close to the wall wasn t easy to get to to the upper bed For any reaosn the hether in the second room we have got wasnt working , Staff were friendly location was awesome very close to the metro station 10 minutes to the Amsterdam CS and Hotel itself is located in a very nice and beautiful neighbourhood 
509544,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Breakfast was too expensive for the quality quantity Ive slept on a better bed before , Young fun vibe with lots of art witty messages to make you smile during the stay Great location 1 min walk to wibautstraat metro station Friendly stuff both at the front desk and restaurant Gave me a stroopwafel upon check in
509545,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The room reminded me of a dorm room furnished by IKEA except very clean unlike my dorm room and pretty spacious with a full bath , The location to the subway was great and the room was pretty quiet They had full services there and the students and mixed in gray hairs were all pretty pleasant 
509546,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Absolutely nothing , Everything was brilliant Our holiday didn t start out very well as we had noise trouble in our previous hotel but it all went really well as soon as we stepped through the doors of the student hotel Thank you 
509547,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The hotel was a bit out of the loop but not very much , The bed was amazing memory foam The facilities were impeccable Right next to the metro 10 10 
509548,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Bar prices disgusting If cheaper would have spent far more money there , The bed was so comfortable and with the blackout curtains it encouraged a fab night s sleep Would recommend to anyone thinking of coming to Amsterdam 
509549,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The bed slats were broken and kept falling out in the middle of the night we didn t complain otherwise it would ve probably have been fixed ASAP There were only plug sockets on one side of the bed bathroom would flood when taking a shower because of the bath screen not being long enough and the towels were tiny The cleaners walked in on us at 9 50am getting ready they did knock but didn t wait long enough for us to answer the door before they strolled in , When we arrived at the hotel around 11am we weren t expecting to be offered a room until 3pm and were just going to leave our luggage in storage and come back later but our room was ready and we were able to check in at no extra cost The receptionist was lovely and offered a map of Amsterdam and also gave us both a stroopwafel We stayed in a suite and had a kitchenette Two bottles of water were put in the room each day TV in the room had access to YouTube and ITV player and local TV channels Hotel was a minutes walk from the metro which is three stops away from Centraal Station and was easy to reach from the airport via train and metro which was a concern when booked 
509550,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The room and the breakfast, Very good hotel location is very convenient been the metro station just 50 meters away in 5 minutes you are at the central station very convenient the rental biking for 9 euros good breakfast reccomended 
509551,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Kitchen need to add forks spoons knifes plates bowls Make sure you get coffee capsules every morning If not just pick up from the counter, The room design is very nice and useful Great kitchen is installed at the room Staff is super nice and helpful Tips us power adapter Israel power adapter is needed in sdvance The volks hotel that is across the road have a better bar and cool parties go there if you are looking for late night action
509552,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Water temperature in the shower could have been a tad warmer , Service is AMAZING Staff were superb Drilling works happened in the building right next to my bedroom so I was given a room upgrade and free breakfast for the duration of my visit Amsterdam is a beautiful city and TSH made my experience very pleasant I will be coming back when I return
509553,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, There was a construction right outside my room window it woke me up right at 6 00 am I didn t sleep a wink after also my room view was not nice I expected a room on the higher level floors but instead they gave me and my sister a room on the ground level , The hotel room was very clean and comfortable and wide the staff were excellent I didn t have breakfast there because I though it was a bit pricy I opted to have it in the city center instead The location was a bit outside city center but there was a metro station nearby it takes 5 mins to reach center by metro or about 45 mins by foot 
509554,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Hot and cold water supply could be better at shower room The drain at shower room must be control very closely , All food in breakfast were fresh and home made with deligtful taste The bed was really comfortable Fantastic room decoration with good thoughts 
509555,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Everything was perfect, The concept of the hotel and the decoration was brilliant it was so laid back and the staff was great and helpful the bikes we hired were great and very convenient to go to the city centre Location was good to you had metro just 2 mins walk from the hotel Would definitely stay there again 
509556,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The construction that was going on starting with drilling and banging at 7 in the morning wasn t the best but I m not complaining because I understand that these things have a deadline and need to be completed Everything else made up for it , Loved everything about the hotel the staff the rooms just everything 
509557,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I was assigned to a ridiculously small room with no amenities at first for about 120 euros a day My friend for the same price had a much better room After complaining they changed me to a large apt with complimentary water a safe a nespresso machine Sort of what you expect from a decent hotel What I gather is that they just try to put solo travellers in the rooms they rent to long term students So avoid the individual room at all cost Only the l room and the one just below it are worth staying , It s an interesting proposal of juvenile decor with amenities like a Nespresso machine Very convenient location close to the metro and trams and some nice bars and restaurants 
509558,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, That we had to go home , Your reception staff are first class what a welcome very knowledgeable and friendly and the sugar waffles are very addictive very personal touch Great hotel facility and location Rooms are more spacious than we expected very clean and serviced regularly Close to metro super market and resturants We had requested a quiet location within hotel as well as a list of resturants in advance we arrived to a personal hand written list of carefully selected resturants that covered all bases not often you get this as many hotels we have stayed in pay lip service to requests made in advance as well as a room with a great view on the 12th floor This is an excellent hotel with great value for money that is a stones throw from the entre of town that will appeal to travellers of all ages dont let the name be a deterrent As Arnie once said I ll be back 
509559,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, As much as I enjoyed this hotel the showers could do with a better drainage system Was very annoying having a shower and worrying in case you were going to flood the bathroom , I thought the staff were very welcoming and helpful I will definitley be back
509560,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The reception was crowded on Friday night because of the student party I had to follow through the emergency exit at the back Not really nice for a first time guest, The reception was superb and WiFi access was perfect My 2 phones and 1 laptop were connected and internet speed was great 
509561,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Car park costs 17 50 and isn t secure Our car was broken into on the first night and 2 bags were stolen from it Rick on reception went absolutely out of his way to help us hoovered all the glass from inside the car recommended a good glass fitter down the road showed us where the police station was He really went above and beyond Kudos to you Rick If you re planning on driving here don t make the mistake we made and leave valuables in plain sight on the back seat an expensive lesson learned for us , Stayed here for 3 nights driving across Europe Massive student vibes from this hotel the room was just like student accommodation or what you wish your student flat was like From the welcome cookie checking in to the muffin and water left in the room there was so much attention to detail The bed was magnificent lots of quirky books and posters in the room a kitchenette with hob and fridge We couldn t have asked for a better place to spend 3 nights 30 minute or so walk into central hotel does bike hire Staff spoke amazing English and were so welcoming and friendly 100 recommend 
509562,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Only small issue was no plug adapters available at reception but this was my error in not bringing one with me as you can see you d e hard pushed to find a negative with this hotel, Bed was super comfy lovely style and atmosphere in the hotel wouldn t suit people wanting a more classical styles hotel experience but for those wanting a break from the norm or a standard boutique hotel then this offers something fresh Vibrant with the right amount of luxury Plus a metro station directly outside enabling transport to city centre and back in five minutes and the trains are regular and beyond easy to work out Perfect location 
509563,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The bed was massive and amazing but a little hard for me anyway And the tv didn t work the first night But after I unplugged it and jiggled it a little it worked perfectly with access to ITV hub and other online services , Loved how when we got there early they gave us free ice lolly s and a map to go exploring 
509564,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Still have to use metro to get into town unless you have time for 30 min walk , Spacious room with high ceiling friendly helpful staff easy bike hire fact I could have second person stay for free 
509565,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Rooms face one another so there is a lack of privacy but it can be resolved by keeping blinds shut , Great concept hotel rooms have kitchen facilities Very clean Good nutritious breakfast Friendly welcoming staff 2 minute walk from metro station and overall 10 minutes away from central train station 2 minute walk from large supermarket 
509566,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Not much just small issues No shower door or curtain so bathroom floor gets very wet , I loved the decoration in the common areas Very artistic and well thought out Excellent leisure facilities table tennis chill out area etc There is a very relaxed atmosphere in this hotel very friendly and helpful staff Location is good with places to eat and drink close by a supermarket and a metro station both within a couple of minutes walk away City centre is about a 20 min walk or a 5 min cycle I would definitely stay hear again 
509567,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The showers could be stronger but not a big issue , Great hotel Cool common areas clean comfortable rooms Wi fi worked fine Staff was super friendly The hotel is not super central but easy to get around using the metro station right in front of the hotel I look forward to staying again 
509568,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Extremely bad service Giving impression when booing it of beeing a deal but was very disappointing very pricey yes I have been in Amsterdam before and stayed at different hotels and not worth the money at all Very hard beds small rooms no fridge Written out that pets was allowed but only said they allowed service dogs after we paid and checked in Happily after a long discussion they allowed us in since it would have been complicated to pay us back Had to pay 20 30 euro extra for 3 hours late check out on departure day but cleaning staff walked in while sleeping 6 times and woke us up from 9 am in the morning And we had paid extra for getting some sleep seem to be no communication at all 4th time they asked us but excuse us but when do you check out still other cleaners entered two times more No late food to get no room service or nothing staff recommended thuisbezorgd One soda candy machine in the main entrance which had not prices written out on it it was very expensive and did not give any change back I seem very bitter now but to be honest we are not picky but this was the worst hotel stay in our life And this is my first ever resume because I am o damn disappointed I really have to warn you , Extremely bad service Giving impression when booing it of beeing a deal but was very disappointing very pricey yes I have been in Amsterdam before and stayed at different hotels and not worth the money at all Very hard beds small rooms no fridge Written out that pets was allowed but only said they allowed service dogs after we paid and checked in Happily after a long discussion they allowed us in since it would have been complicated to pay us back Had to pay 20 30 euro extra for 3 hours late check out on departure day but cleaning staff walked in while sleeping 6 times and woke us up from 9 am in the morning And we had paid extra for getting some sleep seem to be no communication at all 4th time they asked us but excuse us but when do you check out still other cleaners entered two times more No late food to get no room service or nothing staff recommended thuisbezorgd One soda candy machine in the main entrance which had not prices written out on it it was very expensive and did not give any change back I seem very bitter now but to be honest we are not picky but this was the worst hotel stay in our life And this is my first ever resume because I am o damn disappointed I really have to warn you 
509569,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Our shower drain was a little blocked so the bathroom was floated for a while after use but this didn t take away from the excellence of the room , The suite room was amazing 
509570,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, It was hot when we were in Amsterdam and the window only tilted so did not let in a lot of air The air conditioning was bordering on non existent FYI rooms only cleaned every second day and no cash accepted in the hotel plastic only , Good location Friendly staff 
509571,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, They were doing construction and neither booking com or the hotel notified me before my purchase Constant jackhammering from 10am 6pm This needs to be made clear to customers from the get go , Location is right next to metro so it s super easy to get around 
509572,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Bathroom would flood when the shower was used which happened in both rooms we were allocated It was a walk in shower which didn t have a suitable drainage system this meant that the toilet area would be wet whilst the shower area drained away We were allocated a second room because the air conditioning did not work in the first Location was okay but you d need to get a taxi after 1230am as metros do not run after this or you could walk 15 minutes Final point we were not warned about the building works which were happening during the week until we arrived Drilling between 1030 am 11am to 6pm We understand building works have to take place but we should have had warning prior to our booking as this would have been a factor that we would have taken in to account on whether to stay here or not My partner is a builder and he was rather looking forward to getting away from work on our holiday not being reminded of it haha , Comfy bed and accommodating staff great black out curtains and nespresso coffee machine Design of the bedroom was modern and nice 
509573,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Breakfast could have been included in the price of the room There seems to be a little problem with the design of the bathroom as a lot of water from the shower ends up on the floor of the bathroom Otherwise everything was great , We stayed in a suite which was lovely the room and all of the hotel was decorated nicely and the bed was very comfortable We were also able to check in earlier which was great The bicycle rent was very convenient as well and the cycling map in the room was handy The location was very nice not quite in the centre but easy to walk or cycle or take the metro which we didn t try I would definitely stay here again 
509574,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Although the staff answered all of our questions about public transport it would have been very helpful to have printed information available on how to find our way to significant destinations in the city how to buy a metro ticket how to find a tourist centre how to get to the Rijksmuseum etc It was actually easy to work this out but older tourists can become anxious about such things , It was wonderful to be in an environment where there was a mix of people doing different things not just tourists It was delightful to be mixing with students we felt like students ourselves again although our student experiences were not as luxurious The staff all young were wonderful all cheerful helpful and efficient The room was perfect for two people with all the facilities we needed Great breakfasts and the meals at The Pool were so good lots of multicultural variety that we ate there most nights Although the hotel is out of the centre we quickly mastered the metro and tram tickets available in the metro station close by The supermarket across the road is excellent We would highly recommend this hotel 
509575,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The bed was caved On both sides As if someone very heavy slept in it And the pillows were synthetic filling , The design is great Also we chose it because my daughter is renting the student facilities this year 
509576,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Room service can be improved, Bed was so comfy The saff very friendly the interior architecture and the decor was very distinguished Perfect overall experience 
509577,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, It was not walking distance from the city After 7 nights stay and travelling to the city and back every day on the metro it became quite an expensive exercise , The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable Cleaners came in every day to spruce up Loved the laundry in the basement washed and dried all our clothes for 5 euros We thought the breakfast was a little expensive so only ate there once there were cafes nearby and a supermarket so we used those instead Nice modern hotel
509578,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, We cannot praise enough Our one night stay was superb Special mention to Daniel who checked us with such a friendly manner it set us up for the treat of an evening we spent at the hotel Facilities tops and the vibe and activity is relaxed open and friendly Comfortable beds well equipped room with everything we needed We didn t get to try out the restaurant but intend to on our next stay We would definitely return 
509579,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I would have preferred to be able to make a cup of tea or coffee in the room but that is probably the only thing I didn t like , This was a perfect place to stay being so handy to the city centre and to the Metro It is situated just far enough out of the city centre to be relatively quiet and in a nice area The restaurant attached was also very good The staff were very helpful and obliging 
509580,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, a bit pricey but this is Amsterdam so what can you do , The place looks very young and cool the entrance hall is awesome ping pong and biliard that you can use the staff was nice the hotel is clean and they make sure you have towels and toilet paper even if you put the don t clean sign on the door 
509581,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Honesty from the management, Location but when upon chk in 11mins heavy concrete drilling work from 2 20 pm to 6pmTell me is this a pleasant stay Why aren t we inform upon check in of such renovation work gojng on is absolutely cheating the cuztomer When contacted the reception as usual with apologetic so on Indeed i ve asked why you didnt notify bkg com reception replied bkg com didn t wants to mention of this subject I m totally flabagastered with this unpleasant experienced and demand serious investigation and urged bkg com to evaluate properties before update them I m demanding full refund plus the inconvenience that disrupted my stay as we were dying for a afternoon sleep but it was unfortunate to get such a loud drilling noise To add on the room that we stayed had an exposed ceiling which looks incomplete I m extremely dissappointed as this is a deliberate attempt to mis led the customer i hope to have an answer in the next 48hours Awaiting for your reply Rgds Ahmad r
509582,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Last time a had a marvelous room Reason for booking this hotel again This time my room was not even decorated and much to small Breakfast at 24 euro and not even fresh orange juice or coffee I m very disapointed , Liked the dynamic atmosphere in the hotel and the friendly people working in the restaurant 
509583,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, poor sound proof i was kept awake by the guy nxt door all night The towels are really small and worn out I booked in advance but still paid a lot for what it was essencially a posh hostel I wouldnt stay there again for the price i paid , Most comfortable beds i have ever slept in Really cool atmosphere and design 2min walk from the station 4 train stations away from amsterdam central so 10min from city centre on the train
509584,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The rooms were a little basic but this was reflected in the price compared to other Amsterdam hotels and as expected , Nice really positive feel about the place The ground floor area with ping pong etc was great 
509585,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, a fridge in the room would be nice and come on 14 EU for a breakfast is way tooooooo much , the best mattress ever found in a hotel super comfy room and very nice design The hotel works on mottoes and well you might feel as excited as when you were back in your students years or a bit like Methuselah surrounded by young sparkling people in a super trendy environment Up to you to decide The Nespresso machine in the room with complimentary capsules is a real blessing 
509586,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Not applicable , Loved everything Handy to public transport Staff really friendly and helpful Breakfasts were brilliant so much choice and food was great quality 
509587,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Gym gym gym gym gym gym If you are a frequent business traveler and long for a hotel with a decent gym this is your place The rooms are small but comfy and there are plenty of things to do at the hotel 
509588,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Location ia a bit far from the center need a trum or metro to get to dam takes appx 15 minin total , The guys at the reception were super nice and proffesional the decoration interesting and young
509589,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Room was next to REALLY loud people playing music shouting and laughing banging doors every night Also a smell of smoke cannabis from their attempt to blow it out the window using a hairdryer came right in our window Not pleasant , Air con in rooms and great location 
509590,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, They could add some extra glass pane to prevent the water spill , The staff and overall environment Their execution is phenomenal the staff is wonderfully fine and polite without being obnoxiously extroverted and in your face nor cold and terse Just perfect The rooms are fun yet modern and clean 
509591,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Door closing a bit abrupt but after passing this on door closers were adjusted , The position of the hotel was perfect being next to the metro Staff very helpful indeed Could not have been better 
509592,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Very good location subway 1 min walk from hotel almost in front or you can walk to city center around 30 min Staff is very friendly hotel design is modern and young The bed is just extremely comfortable Food at restaurant is good and not expensive Very Good breakfast buffet Good wi fi 
509593,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, No info given on breakfast 12 14 was all we were told And thinking back dependant on what it was would of been good But just didn t know , The bed pillows was amazing Changed towels every day and fresh bottles of water

509595,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Room didn t have a fridge which I d find really useful and I found the bike saddle very hard and uncomfortable , I ve stayed in a number of hotels in and around Amsterdam and this is as good as any better than many The hotel has a youthful vibe with the mix of guests The staff are very friendly and helpful good sized room comfortable bed nice en suite The Pool restaurant has good service and some incredible food There are also a variety of restaurants nearby along the river Bike rental is relatively cheap with great underground secure bike storage and the metro stop is literally outside the front door

509598,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The room was small and was really like a university student room Nothing fancy inside fairly old furniture Does the job but do not expect the room at least the single rooms to look as fancy as the lounge , Staff was young and helpful Lounge was very nice and the hotel is at walking distance from the center Room was quiet 
509599,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Amazing staff very helpful from beginning to end The location of the hotel was perfect as it was a few metres from the metro stop The hotel itself exudes good vibes Hotel room was spacious and very comfortable 
509600,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The location wasn t as close the the centre as it sounded on the website so was a 30 min walk into town The price of the booking was also more than we were told it would be The size of the room did not match the amount of money we paid for it , The style of the hotel was very good it was quirky which is what I liked Also the staff were very friendly 
509601,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The reception wasn t fast because i think the reception staff was too limited The hotel is big and many costumers needed to check in out simultaneously I think the time it took was too long, The position the room and the hotel in general 
509602,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Clean and quiet hotel Great location right at the subway station and close to street cars Didn t try the breakfast so I can t comment on that 
509603,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Needs a minibar fridge in the rooms this is not even available in the suites Metro stops running after 12 Night busses works though , Trendy decor boutique hotel experience excellent food in the restaurant friendly staff
509604,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Cleaning service I stayed for 5 days and they only came once to clean my room and change my towels Since on their website I read that the cleaning service was given once every 48 hours I expected one more time , Great hotel Very close to the metro station and so very well connected to the city center Welcoming staff lots of opportunities to catch up and meet new people I ll come again 
509605,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Bathroom was a little bit small for us Shower water was all over the bathroom floor and no supply to clean it away , Metro was right outside the hotel so it was was very comfortable to travel to Amsterdam Centre Room was clean and cozy Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful Definitely recommend this hotel 
509606,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, There was no safe in the room where I was which didn t turn out to be a problem but I would have been a bit more relaxed had there been one When I asked staff at reception about this they seemed very surprised that I thought that was important I d also asked staff by email beforehand helps to know and they told me there there would be safes but it turned out they were only in suites To me it is standard industry practice to have safes in hotel rooms just like having a hairdryer which you had to borrow from reception But then again this isn t your standard hotel and what it lacks in facilities it makes up for in other areas Cleaning wasn t as thorough as in your regular hotel either and there were no bedside tables to put your stuff on which made the room appear messier None of these things were that important to me personally but could potentially annoy someone else who is used to having these facilities in rooms I am only comparing it to others I have experienced in this price range as by the way , Nice relaxed and friendly atmosphere Quirky design Good location away from the touristy centre but in a nice residential area which was still very close to town and de Pjip with its market and restaurants A supermarket and a nice Surenamese restaurant takeaway nearby

509612,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, AC was not working well throughout my stay there which was only a problem because of a heatwave that hit several countries in Western Europe at the time of my visit Hotel got it fixed for one night and then it snapped right back to Eco mode which isn t what you re looking for during a heatwave Also the room didn t have a fridge , The hotel offed me a nice little single room that looks exactly like a college dorm room Bed was comfortable and the whole room was clean It wasn t noisy and the location was great for me It s a 25 minute walk from the city centre and is a 1 minute walk from the Wibautstraat sp metro station The hotel itself has really nice facilities gyms restaurants and something that looked like a room for video games and is very modern 
509613,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Very disappointed by the breakfast We stayed two nights and The front guest agent told us that we could have breakfast for 12 p day p pers instead of 14 we were not sure so she said if you dont like it come back and we ll take it off In the morning no menu at the entrance so we gave room number and Big disappointment very poor choice and even the milk was lacking was obliged to run after the waiter to get me some surprising for a 500 rooms hotel The few things that I ate was really not that good 12 just for juice and cereals pass your way When we went to front desk to say We didnt want breakfast for the second day she said its too late you took the discount and ate already so we had to eat this poor breakfast a second time Honestly pass your way and go to a caf for breakky there is some on the same street, The room was nice and comfy the location was perfect very close to the station and the city center

509618,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, No room service but that s no dealbreaker as there is lots of food drinks around the hotel, Great staff I got in to early after a very long flight and still needed to wait 5 hours before I was able to check in Unfortunately I wasn t aware of this and asked if I could get an upgrade to be able to check in straight away I wouldn t mind paying for it as I was desperate for a shower They upgraded me for free and therefore I can say Thums up Brilliant hotel stayed there twice now and I will definitely be going back Thanks crew

509635,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, No mini bar in a small suite it s strange nowadays bicycle conditions and their management should be completely revised to avoid wasting of time and risky tours considering that not all guests are youngsters The rest is ok , Charming and friendly staff unconventional ambience suitable both for young and adult people

509692,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, No fridge mini bar in the which you need to keep some of your food or drink must have also bathroom small, Hotel is good with new design like cars parking is good for young people restaurant is good location little far from the center room size is good
509693,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Location is wasn t really ideal as I was going into town every single night however there was the use of the metro near by which was usefull But it closes at midnight so walking a 1 5 miles to the hotel from the RLD at 2 in the morning was abit of a pain l especialy with all those drug dealers telling I need drugs to keep the party going , The staff are really friendly The use of the gym and laundry facilities was really useful being open 24 7 and laundry cost was not very expensive Rooms were cleaned once every two days and didn t impede on my lie ins 
509694,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Staff are very friendly nice atmosphere Rooms are a on the small side but clean and comfortable with modern furnishings 2 minute walk to the metro station 
509695,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, 1 Taken money from my credit card I used for booking even before I checked in without any notice Resulting in a high handling fee and currency exchange fee I prepared cash of the exact amount and debit card when checking in but they wouldn t take it saying it had been paid Towels and bed linen were not changed as frequent as normal hotel franchises , Good location and connection to city centre staff were friendly Bed was very comfort

509699,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Only stayed for a night as I was sharing accomodation with other friends elsewhere but the location is not the most convenient , Loved the energy and vibe of the entire hotel The staff was super friendly and there was just a general youthful buzz around the place 
509700,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The vending machines were usually out of order , We liked the friendly staff the variety in the breakfast buffet and the fact that the hotel is right next to a subway station Also there was a cute cat hanging out in the lobby sometimes 
509701,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Customer service is poor possibly incompetent SafeBox was not working even after informing the front desk Vending machine not working also no help from front desk Room not extensively nor thoroughly cleaned Bed slat was broken but this got luckily fixed after notification , Student hotel concept and simplicity Nice and cozy atmosphere Friendly staff Free Wifi 
509702,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, No kettles in the room to make tea coffee, Everything from the rooms to the restaurants and lounging areas Would recommend this hotel to others in an instant Really pleased and would stay here again if I returned to Amsterdam Even the music that was played was good 
509703,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, I loved the location of the hotel It is literally across the Metro station depending on which side you get out It is very convenient to get around The hotel itself is absolutely fantastic It is a nice young place with a lot of colours comfy couches books and entertainment It is a great place to stay in 
509704,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, There no room service there is no safe box and the thing which made me unhappy that there was dust on the room furnuture which is not acceptable at all, I liked the location Breakfast the hotel design 
509705,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Kind of expensive given that it is not on the very center of the city and without breakfast included in the price , Excellent design of rooms spacious and clean with attention to detail Helpful and polite staff Hotel very close to metro station 
509706,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, When i requested to extend for more one night they didnt give me the same room but requested me to move to another smaller room with more expensive price, Laundery room facilities a lot of staff can help
509707,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, we stayed 3 nights but never got our room serviced seems that room cleaning always coincided after 5 pm and breakfast was very choice limited , The hotel location is quite good although not in the centre but neighboring is quite nice and peaceful The room was large enough with fair design but bathroom a little small And bike rental is available as a whole the mood is relaxed and positive at the hotel 
509708,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The hotel had free gym table tennis table movie corner self service laundry etc the wifi was fast staff was friendly clean room close to the metro station 
509709,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Not much would have liked a mini fridge in room to keep drinks chilled , Large generous rooms and very comfortable bed Friendly staff particularly the guy who welcomed us at breakfast every morning Plenty of on site parking 17 per day Convenient location next to metro only 4 stops to central station
509710,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Love the location metro stop outside the hotel is great Beds were very comfortable friendly staff great looking hotel already looking to come back 
509711,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I was though that hotel accept payments by credit debit cards only but some services accept cash only vending machines and laundry The hotel doesn t offer any laundry bags for bringing dirty and clean laundry out of the washing machine The breakfast is not included in overall price , Very nice location close to metro tram station and excellent price range for bike rental if you prefer going around on two wheels Overall interior is an excellent example of how student like hotel should looks like The personal was very polite and fullfit most of my requirements The breakfast is truly supercharge my day especially if you re up to stay up for thr whole day and night 
509712,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The rooms are not suitable for the families with kids under 16 mostly because of the books There should be some notice about this on the website or on booking com , Decoration is fun and very practical specially for the young travelers The metro station is in front of the hotel And the hotel is not far from the old town You can go to the Rembrandt Square in 30min by walk 
509713,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, the fact that you can t choose whether to pay with card or cash only card is accepted but hey this is nothing really bad so in the end it s fine, staff friendliness beautiful room with many towels excellent rent a bike service 
509714,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Only thing was that our bikes from the hotel broke down twice but that s just about it , The location was really great only 10 minutes on a bike to everything we wanted to find The room was really clean and you always got fresh sheets water bottles and new towels every day We are both athletes and the gym there was really good with a bit of everything you need to get a great workout

509716,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, room service is low don t expect a real 4 start hotel the cleaners only make the bed and put towels nothing else no toothpaste body shampoo bottle was empty we had to go and pick it up in reception they won t bring it to you we stayed for 4 night they didn t even change the dirty glasses on table we had to wash it in bathroom or put new bottle of water or sort the messiness in room shower was small breakfast not worth the price, we stayed in suite the location was ideal the room was clean and new
509717,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The breakfast was not worth the extra money spent on a breakfast inclusive tariff if I knew the Breakfast would be so simple and limited I would rather have saved the extra money and spent it on a nice breakfast outside of the hotel in the cafes around the city It s bad that they sadly don t have fridges in the rooms to store drinks or foods that visitors typically want to buy and store Also that standard rooms such as the one my brother had don t have any safe deposit boxes only Deluxe rooms have this It was also a hassle to ensure that I had the Exact change to pay for my bike rentals because they never offer or store any change there and I ended up walking around looking for change wasting so much time , The staff are very friendly most of them Their nice facilities such as the games in the downstairs lobby it s fun and a nice extra at the hotel Location being right next to the metro station is great help The laundry system is great you can wash things yourself by using your own washing machine in the laundry room they offer downstairs and pay a small price compared to most hotels out there who rip you off with extortionate prices 
509718,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Only thing would maybe be the location but the place and it s cleanliness made up for it Metro right outside very helpful, Really funky hotel loved it there Staff helpful and really nice

509720,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The room didnt feel very cozy On the pictures it looked quite cool and hipster however when we walked into the room it just felt cold Also i have asked for room with city wiew but i got room opposite another part of the hotel I could see into every window and as it was so close the people opposite propably could see into mine too Also the hotel havent had storage area where to store luggages just incase you have a late flight and want to explore the city a bit more , The staff were amaizing great welcome The hotel shared area had a ping pong table pool table and tv with internet which is handy if you traveling light Very close to the centre only two stops by metro which was very handy 
509721,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, no room service the first two days matress was worn out no fridge in the room suite , very stylish room and hotel quiet good opportunities to wash in house bike rental good restaurant and breakfast parking
509722,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, It s not worthy to eat breakfast in the hotel even it only cost 12 You can buy a breakfast under 12 in the near supermarket And my room wasn t completely clean There are somethings that left by the former visiter , Staffs are really kind 
509723,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The waiter working in the meet me at the pool bar could be a bit faster Also the cocktails were uninspired there Nevertheless the was one waitress who figured out the missing support and quit her break to help out Great job , The complete set up of this hotel is fantastic I like the idea behind this Also the breakfast was delicious Further they have billiard tables a table tennis plate and a book corner There is also a small gym which looked well anyway 
509724,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, We had a suite room which was spacious and comfortable Staff were very friendly nice food options in the restaurant and atmosphere not your usual boring hotel Despite the name their were people there of all ages 4 stops from central station 5mins and metro right outside hotel so very easy to get around

509726,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, 1 Scandalous cancellation of my reservation on the day of my arrival 2 hours before for credit card number mismatch purposes without calling me on the phone beforehand whereas I had proactively confirmed my coming the day before by e mail and specified my time of arrival to make sure hotel would know Luckily I could have my room in the end but only upon calling myself when seeing an automatically generated e mail and it could have been otherwise as it had been un booked in the meantime 2 Room was not cleaned in spite of tag clearly put at the room door when leaving it 3 No hair dryer in the room given the price I would have expected one, 1 Clean functional room but small 2 Fairly close to town center via metro 10 15 mins 3 Nice playing and fitness facilities in the ground floor ping pong pool baby foot 
509727,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, No fridge , Friendly staff a very big comfy bed cool furnitures and interior decorations a nespresso machine high ceiling aircon very close from Metro and tram stops lots of lots of positives

509732,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The restaurant joined on to the hotel was not the best food best off going elsewhere , This place was amazing facilities to chill such as ping pong and pool Also the wifi was great The rooms perfect size and very clean Also an amazing view out of the window over some of the city There are numerous restaurants close to the hotel down by the river front I would recommend the Tapas across the road The check in was the best one yet as we got a free ice lolly which won us over Also recommend renting the bikes for riding around the city 
509733,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, I travel a lot for work and stay in some high end hotels but the Student Hotel is by far the best place I have stayed purely for the vibe facilities and friendly staff 
509734,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, There are still renovating the cheery sounds of drills in the morning were marvelous No AC Our room on booking was supposed to be 28m2 but instead it was no more than 20m2 The shower gel was empty on day one and no one changed it ever but we had hopes till the very last moment The floors were never vacuumed as well The sink was stuck The staff wasn t friendly and didn t inform me that the payment had to be done in one go and that they didn t accept hard cash After the issue arose they didn t help me to change the booking had to do it myself and they were like Nah OK Regards not answering my payment question which was asked a couple of days prior they replied we do not answer all emails as we do not see the point Who the hell says that Vending machines were not working The cleaners stole some of our green tea that is unheard of And we are not the first ones to complain not by a long shot , Good location modern building the design was closer to a hostel design though 
509735,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, There are still renovating the cheery sounds of drills in the morning were marvelous Our room on booking was supposed to be 28m2 but instead it was no more than 20m2 The shower gel was empty on day one and no one changed it ever but we had hopes till the very last moment The floors were never vacuumed as well The sink was stuck The staff wasn t friendly and didn t inform me that the payment had to be done in one go and that they didn t accept hard cash After the issue arose they didn t help me to change the booking had to do it myself and they were like Nah OK Regards not answering my payment question which was asked a couple of days prior they replied we do not answer all emails as we do not see the point Who the hell says that Vending machines were not working , Good location modern building the design was not too shabby

509738,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Further from the city centre than I realised although that s probably my fault The room was very basic a bit sad there was no kettle or tea or coffee in the room The decoration of the room didn t match the cool vibrance of the communal areas but these are nit picky points it served it s purpose very well , Very comfy bed Very clean Liked the decoration and interior of the communal areas 
509739,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, My deluxe room really took me back to my university days looked very much like my student accommodation Normally I m not overly fussy but I d expect to have a coffee machine or at least a kettle available in my room in a 4 hotel A hair dryer and some shower gel would also be nice I paid 12 for the worst hotel breakfast I ve ever had and I do travel a lot All in all it was an OK ish very basic experience Far from a 4 hotel , Friendly staff The downstairs area was trendy quirky 
509740,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Not all rooms have a safty deposit box and the hotel doesn t have a central one rooms are cleaned once every two days the toiletries are not replenished unless you ask for at the front desk , The location is next to the metro station 5 min the city center the staff were so friendly the breakfast was great the decor and the spirit brings you back to college again the wifi was good comfi beds good to have facilities room size was just fair 
509741,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, No faults to report We enjoyed our stay immensely , The staff were amazing and couldn t do enough for us Nice little touches in hotel and our room Loved every minute of it 
509742,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Maybe a drink or some glasses in the room would of been better as we had to use the plastic bathroom cups for a bottle of wine but I am being pedantic there and we didn t ask for one at the bar or reception so they may have supplied them on request,No Positive
509743,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Our security box wasn t working and although we rang twice nobody came to fix it there s no fridge in the rooms and the hotel only accepts card payments for everything no cash , The wifi was excellent the bed was extremely comfortable daily free coffee great facilities like the laundry room and we took advantage of bike rentals Friendly staff the hotel itself was modern with a great vibe Adored the book shelf in our room 
509744,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, No frills efficient hotel with friendly staff and good rooms we stayed in a suite which is really just a good size double room with some kitchen facilities Comfy bed room cleaned daily Good location next to metro and cycling distance to city hotel bikes are plentiful and decent 
509745,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, If you are planning to stay just 2 nights then don t expect any room service Nobody gonna make your bed clear the trash can or clean the bathroom I understand that they wanna be Eco friendly but at the end this is a hotel and it s pricy Anyway I don t think it worth another visit , The staffs were very nice and helpful The lobby was really cool you would prefer to stay there rather than your room 
509746,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Breakfast is 14 euros which i felt was a bit much but there are cafes nearby i recommend a bagel place up the road , Cool hotel for young people Very friendly and helpful staff 30 min walk to city centre or East Amsterdam Perfect location if you re not fussed about being right in the heart of it all 
509747,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, 1 Cleaning of the rooms was of suboptimal quality once the cleaning staff had forgotten some of their tools in the room another time there were no trash bins left I had to improvise by using my own bags 2 Their IT systems appear a bit messy my first booking confirmation had got lost and also on one of the mornings I had not been included on the free breakfast list although I had paid for it , 1 If you can get a room on one of the top floors you will be able to enjoy truly fantastic sunset views over Amsterdam and up to the port 2 Friendly staff 3 Modern feel and soul
509748,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Location over 40 minutes from central station Metro service is outside but still a little out of the way , Excellent wifi excellent facilities including pool tables and ping pong

509751,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Although there was a nice variety of breakfast foods we thought it was over priced The on sight restaurant is convenient but the selection was limited and the service was quite slow , The location is nice because it is very close to a metro station The staff was helpful and knowledgeable Nice lounging area and good WiFi 
509752,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, It would have been good to have a socket at both sides of the bed Also the breakfast was nice but could have been better and the alcohol selection in the bar was a bit small , The bed was an actual king not two singles pushed together and it was SUPER comfy The room was very clean great decor and had a bit of fun For the coffee lovers there was a nespresso machine in the room 
509753,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The room air condition was regulated to 18C which in my opinion is very warm Night sleep became a struggle for me and my wife , The location of the Hotel 
509754,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The room is so small no AC they cleaning only every two days without chnaging the towels or the bed cover The corodore and the room decorationis closer to a hostel than a hotel, I loved the staff they are really helpful and always smily 
509755,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The hotel was slightly out of centre but was literally right next to a subway station which was only a 5 10 minute journey to central station , Amazing hotel The hotel was really nice with very cool decor the staff were excellent and really friendly Bike hire was available for only 9 for 24 hours and the rooms were very spacious including a few freebies would defiantly stay again 
509756,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Location is not the best yet not too far from the city center The immediate surroundings are not very lively but it s a good quality hotel at a reasonable price , Staff is very welcoming and tries its best to look after you Design is great and very modern The public areas are well thought and certainly make up for the lack of activities in the immediate vicinity of the hotel 
509757,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, They clean the room once two days and even that was after we told them no bed cleaning no soup and shampoo renewal air conditioning in the room is super complicated We had a broken lamp on our room which haven t been fixed after we told them , Easy bike rental really good and comfortable lobby is amazing really like the design of the hotel 
509758,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, There is no Shampoon and hair condition in the room You have to buy water to the machine f you forget buy it you ll burn to the morning, Beds and pillows perfect good location perfect design

509763,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, More coat hangers , Hotel is a modern quirky and funky Very clean and arrived to a very friendly and helpful receptionist A few bars on your doorstep or take the metro to Dam centre in only 10 minutes 
509764,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The slats of the bed gave way while we were on it Breakfast while okay the bacon and scrambled eggs were not to my liking However when this was noted fresh supplies were quickly made available , location and ease of travel to the city centre Very friendly staff and keen to help in any way
509765,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The cleanliness of rooms The fact that on booking com it lets you choose the option of paying by cash but then when you go to hotel they tell you they are a no cash hotel , The decor was beautiful The location was good due to the fast metro service 
509766,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, There could of been more food options, It was the best hotel I ve stayed in Amsterdam before friendly staff clean and comfy room good food and facilities overall a pleasurable stay
509767,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The staff, Bed was uncomfy no kurtains sun shined through all morning early hours room was dirty and dusty no clean towels was ment to stay for two nights and had to leave was that bad Ac didn t work room was so warm staff couldn t provide a fan for comfort had no sleep as there are no kurtains and the sun shines through the blinds all morning
509768,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I think calling the room we were in a twin room probably amounts to false advertising it certainly was not a twin room as it had a double bed and so that made the stay a bit awkward as we had not anticipated that we would have to share a bed Apparently there are no twin bed rooms in the hotel but if this is the case please don t call the room type a twin room as this gives the wrong idea I understand that if one clicks on the room type there is a fuller description given saying it has a double bed but this is not really enough in my mind the room type really needs to be renamed or preferably separate beds should be installed , It was surprisingly quiet even though the room faced a busy road Everything was as expected and the hotel is very conveniently located with metro and tram stations practically next door and it isn t really a very long walk to the city centre either 
509769,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Super friendly staff The hotel was great There were people there of all ages and backgrounds playing ping pong or just hanging out with friends or on their computers in the main area The lighting and ambience were terrific Bike rental was super easy and affordable The room was super comfortable and I enjoyed the way the key activated the lights and turned them off when no one was in the room as to save energy I enjoyed the quotes that were randomly placed throughout the hotel Someone put a lot of thought and care in creating this amazing hotel 
509770,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The rooms were a very small for the price we paid 180 and the bed was not Kingsize as i reserve online , I liked everything It was cleaned and quite Very Nice Hotel
509771,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I think breakfast it was expensive enough not too much variety the quality of coffee was poor enough There is no small tefrigarator in the room and the bath foam bottle was empty for 3 days , The cleanlines of the room the king size bed
509772,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The d cor outside of the rooms seemed a little tacky and the hallway was very dark was abit creepy It was quite a distance from the centre but metro was so cheap and fun and right outside the door The first staff member wasn t very nice but all the others were lovely Also couldn t check in till 3 but it did state this and we understand it , The bedrooms and bathrooms were amazing The bar was nice drinks expensive but nice to chill and have an evening drink The blackout curtains gave us a perfect sleep and it was soundproof we swear The hot water was perfect temperature and the room was filled with books and fun things to look at and read 
509773,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Nothing Although the key card didn t always work, It was great Very cool hotel nicely done out Loved the table tennis area Great location especially if you rent out the lovely bikes
509774,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, We were warned by a customer not to use some parts of the parking plot because of the danger of breaking in in cars with foreign number plates , The way the electricity cut has been handled by the restaurant staff Presence of books magazines in the in the restaurant 
509775,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The only thing I can think of is the low stream in the shower , Where do I start Super friendly staff chic design nice breakfast great location just next to the train station about 5 minutes ride to the city centre We stayed there for 6 nights and can t wait to get back there again Highly highly recommended great atmosphere Also our room had a kitchen so the crew gave us tools to cook and of course the coffee machine that made our mornings nicer 
509776,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Could have done with an extra pillow and the bedside light was insufficient for a double room, Staff were so helpful and efficient made us feel very welcome and relaxed 
509777,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Milk for the breakfast tea in the room in a morning , The feel of the rooms were modern and up to date I really like the books in the room and having the touches such as post cards 
509778,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Would have liked the pillows to be a bit bigger , The staff were really friendly and helpful The hotel was bright and airy and right next to a Metro station This made it so easy to get around 
509779,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Excellent hotel concept feels much more personal and home than the typical hotel Great atmosphere spacious and well equipped well furnished room great bathroom with bathtub lots of value for your money 
509780,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Some confusion around check in but dealt with well, Very modern comfortable hotel with easy access to the city centre Exceptional restaurants both within the hotel and next door

509783,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I was most distressed to arrive back on my second day to my hotel room in the afternoon to discover all my baggage and clothes removed from my room There was clearly a lack of communication between staff working in the hotel As my check out day was two days later The situation got eventually resolved and my baggage was returned to my room But as I remained near the reception area I did not think staff appreciated how serious the situation was and in my opinion took far too long to get it resolved I had already booked and paid for the three nights using booking com and shows a lack of organisation in the hotel If I had returned back to the hotel later that evening or that night the question arises would all my baggage still have been retained and returnable to me I have travelled to Holland before and stayed in different cities and hotels and I have never experienced this level of incompetence As I was concerned the hotel could be so incompetent enough to do it again the next day I had to take time out from my travel group to return to the hotel in the afternoon to check my luggage was there The rest of my travel group were staying in different hotels and could not believe what had happened to me and remarked that they were glad they had not booked in my hotel ,No Positive

509870,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Nothing much but room got a little cold at night due to high ceilings , Spacious room Comfortable pillows Funky design Nespresso machine Bar next door was extremely good too

509872,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The cleaning staff on two occassions came in to my room barely announced and offered to clean which would be fine if I was not about to have a shower on both occassions I asked if they wouldn t mind coming back later and left the sign on my door to make sure Both times I came back to my room as it was It was 4 days before my room was cleaned and nothing was restocked considering it wasn t fully stocked in the beginning this was particularly frustrating The other thing I noticed is the lock on the heating at 24 degrees I get really cold easily and was sick so this wasn t ideal I liked it here but it was more like a hostel with private rooms than a hotel I couldn t entirely relax here , Bed was very comfortable the options for facilities that are available are amazing the layout of the rooms are nice and its not too far from town if you re walking Decor is outstanding and the med breakfast at the pool is amazing The staff were kind enough to let me check in early 
509873,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, A graveled dark platform barred the view from the blocked window on 1st floor which was a bit depressing Our wish to be located on a higher floor which we communicated beforehand was no topic , We liked the newly renovated room even black was the dominant colour with a very comfortable bed and even a bathtub the coffee tea gear the easy access to the center by metro and nearby connection to trams and busses

509878,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Great rooms just VERY thin walls So thin that when the people in the next room was having sex it was so clear it sounded like they was having sex in our bed , Very cool and stylish hotel Staff were so nice and helpful and I loved the little welcome treat from reception 
509879,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The glass partition of the shower is very narrow so water splashed out and wet the bathroom toilet floor , The room we stayed in is brand new so all is great It was very comfortable with a great surprise of a Nespresso machine kettle and 2 water bottles 
509880,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I assumed there was a mini fridge in all hotel rooms apparently not only available in rooms with kitchenette Wanted to keep my drinks cool , Loved the room and interior of the overall hotel very artsy and modern Only 4 stops away from the city by Metro there is a convenient store opposite and the bus stops directly in front of the hotel too Loved it it was great Lovely staff too very accommodating and helpful Oh and there s two restaurants one on either side of the hotel really lovely 
509881,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The only issue I had was that booking com had made an error meaning that there was two bookings under my name and confirmation number when I only made one booking Luckily I picked the option that meant I paid upon arrival and so was able to sort out the issue before being charged for two rooms However I feel as though I may have been charged for the type of room that we didn t stay in which is annoying However this is not so much the fault of the hotel and more of booking com , I took my partner to Amsterdam for his birthday with a few other friends We could not speak highly enough of this hotel It is only 4 stops away on the metro to central station about 5 10 minutes and there is a metro and bus stop right outside the hotel The hotel itself was amazing the decor was beautiful and we had the pleasure of staying in one of their brand new rooms The staff were so lovely and always happy to help with any queries we had about where to go or how to get there On arrival we were even given a traditional Stroop waffle as a welcome Molly at reception was so lovely and ironed out any kinks we had with our holiday

509890,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, A step up to the bathroom caused me to trip once and stumble forwards and stub my foot once as i wasn t expecting it to be there because usually rooms are single level So i put a bright white towel down on the tiled step where it met the main room carpet which made the step easily visible from then on Probably wasteful of a clean towel not great in a highly environmentally friendly hotel but it was definitely a safer option It s in a mainly residential working part of the city but was an easy hop by train to everywhere you d want to go , Staff were wonderful incredibly sweet and helpful Room was functional clean and comfortable I m an older person in a student hotel and felt most welcome Great value for money 
509891,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Breakfast was not like breakfast in an attempt to be ubercool the presentation seemed more important than choice or taste if you don t eat porc or cheese there is hardly anything left only choice of break was toast or dry sour dough bread it seemed like an end of afternoon aperitif buffet rather than breakfast Very small room for the price , The design on ground floor is really cool with the ted corner the red hallway and beautiful furniture Very practical next to metro station

509942,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The price of a single room was very expensive and the room was tiny with a not so nice view I found it to be very overpriced Breakfast was not a buffet instead you could either opt for a menu for a fixed price choose from a specific list of items or buy items not on the list separately The hotel was about a half hour walk from the city center It was a pleasant walk as we lucked out with good weather but may be a bit long for other people or in rainy weather , Wifi was appreciated The hotel itself the common areas has a nice modern fun decor There is a gym but I didn t get the time to use it ping pong tables foosball etc

509947,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, It is still unfinished with some construction noises but not bothersome to me , The hotel was near the metro It was clean and had a friendly staff The idea of students and hotel guest hanging out in the hip lounges with wifi and ames felt like a internet cafe 
509948,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Cool design of the interior The hipster style was more funny than nice But that s also great The internet was also very good It s about 1 2min walk to the metro station and not that far from the centre by foot Also the soap smelled really nice

509951,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Brilliant hotel the newly built area is very nice with a cool atmosphere for youngsters The price is very good for Amsterdam 5 min metro ride from the Central Station I wouldn t stay anywhere else if you re looking for comfort a good price and new clean facilities Last but not least the staff is extremely friendly and very accommodating 
509952,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The room was small and of modest standard in spite of a relatively high price The cleanliness standard was poor and erratic Clean towels appeared between every 2 4 days and the cleaning was rather poor when it finally occurred The most irritating feature of the room was the shower which has a too short shower curtain which meant a flood of water on the bathroom floor every time one showers The expensive and so called breakfast buffet was in fact a bagged breakfast with refills of a coffee cup A Bun a croissant one piece of fruit a little bottle of juice hardly comparable to other hotels of the same price level , The location was close to a train station and the place where I had business It was within walking distance Excellent WIFI connection 
509953,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The hotel had only just opened so everything was brand new all the facilities are great and there are table tennis tables and other games in the communal areas Staff were amazing we travelled to Amsterdam on a whim so wanted some advice as to where to go and what to see and all staff gave us excellent recommendations Cohen greeted us with smiles and an ice cream on arrival Located right next to a metro stop it is walkable to the centre in 30 minutes or around 10 minutes by metro Would highly recommend

509955,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Not everything was ready yet so a little overpriced The breakfast was not buffet style as advertised but more like a pack lunch and very overpriced, We were there the day after the establishment opened everything was beautiful clean and the Australian girl on the front desk was so helpful with directions etc
509956,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, , It just feels like home We can do some sports such as pingpong and billiard at the loby The receptionists were very helpful and friendly We got an ice cream as a welcome drink and yellow sun glasses for farewell gifts What a great experience

509962,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, nothing, i loved the nature and vibe of the hotel the atmosphere was relaxing and inviting the facilities such as the strong wifi connection were incredible the entertainment provided table tennis pool a gym etc were fantastic and comfy seating all around great 
509963,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, It was really greawt staying there Theminute we walked in we got some free strawberry ice cream and the staff was so nice Location wise it is probably not within walking distance of Amsterdam Centraal but it is only a couple stops on the metro which is super convenient 10 10 Could not recommend this more 
509964,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, It was very misrepresented on booking com We were expecting a bar and restaurant but this was not open until December The photos on booking com are not of the accommodation we stayed at when we arrived we were given a key and that was it No tour or explanation about how things work ,No Positive
509965,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I had to ask 4 times for a hair dryer No kettle in the room and no safety locker as well No decoration at all I don t like the red color of the wall at the corridor to the lift Every time I got out of the lift I felt a little bit dizzy seeing that striking red It may be ok for young people as it is actually the hotel for student , I like the room which is spacious and clean Close to Metro but very limit restaurant near by but there s a very good Spanish restaurant Tapas de Arroyo 10 minutes walk across the road 
509966,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Great hotel Really nice rooms with very comfortable big beds Everything was nice and clean Amazing design friendly stuff Its definitely a place to be We will recommend it to our friends and family We were more than happy to stay there and we re already planning our next holidays with The Student Hotel Keep doing what you do Its great

509970,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, As a traveler people tend to forget to pack tidbits so I think to include toothbrush toothpaste in the bathroom would be beneficial for the customers You have the option to turn on the air con but due to them being environmentally friendly you can only turn the air up to 24 degrees so it was a bit pointless anyways but a bit hot for the summer Also as I stayed on floor 2 I can hear EVERY WATER GUSHING noise as I sleep which was really irritating and unpleasant , I absolutely loved the interior design every room every space was immaculate totally Instagram worthy The service was very good too very friendly and the overall cleanliness of the hotel is superb Would definitely come again esp when the pool opens up 
509971,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Wonderful Hotel Its newly constructed so the rooms are clean and equipped with modern facilities Definitely worth the price The hotel is located right outside the metro station so travelling within Amsterdam is super easy

509973,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, No tea coffee making facilities and no access to the kitchen there is at least one each floor as it s basically student accommodation to make a cuppa Unintelligible climate control system but it did work From what I could figure no bar I think you could buy bottled beer from a fridge but that s it Bear in mind it is a fair walk from town The bike rental service at the hotel wasn t up and running yet and the place across the street charge E12 50 daily plus E50 deposit These are minor issues considering the comfort for the price , Very comfy bed Like very Bathroom and furniture very high standard decent size room Friendly staff Good quality 
509974,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, the only minus point here which i also communicated with the reception was that there was no option to use the breakfast voucher for yoghurt and muesli instead of bread it seemed silly it would be excluded as an option for those who may not like bread of have allergies , I loved the design and the room was simple but very comfortable As this hotel caters to both actual students staying a semester and regular guests staying a few nights its a nice place to be
509975,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Payment can be made only by credit card Hotel does not accept cash , Very good hotel Staff was very helpful Rooms are clean and comfortable There is no hair dryer in the rooms but you can always take it at the reception desk if necessary Hotel located not far from the city center It takes aroud 15 20 minutes to get to the center by foot In a minute walk from the hotel located a metro station Very good albert heijn supermarket located across the street Breakfast was also good and rather cheap 
509976,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, We were honeymooners and they gave us a room with a stunning view two bottles of martini spumante no fees for late check out and two yellow sunglasses The staff was very kind and helpful There is a ping pong in the hall 
509977,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Mainly due to my own mistake we didn t realise we couldn t pay with cash which is difficult coming from overseas as we would get charged 7 5 of the transaction which for 500 is a lot Also the AC in the room was impossible to change and the lights took a little time to figure out but I m nit picking really on what is a brilliant hotel , The staff and general atmosphere was excellent Really relaxed and comfortable all of the staff spoke to us as individuals and took the time to actually talk to you rather than just perform there duties which makes a massive difference to your stay The room was clean functional and easy on the eye We loved our stay and have already recommended the hotel to friends 
509978,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, nothing not to like, Brand new hotel We were the first people ever to stay in our room Staff excellent 2 min walk to metro and just 4 stops from Centraal station
509979,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I didn t pay for my breakfast but I won one free ticket for my second day it wasn t awful but it could be much better from my point of view it shoul be more homemaden and a buffet , Beautiful place very modern furniture and quite a lot of extra services 
509980,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Extras not ready yet like swimming pool and gym But not big deal I didn t need those Not breakfast included, Excellent new hotel Very clean and comfortable Modern and welcoming Breakfast was not included and I found it a bit expensive I thought it will be more central but I m afraid youo ll public transport to go central By underground is quick 
509981,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The small stuff in the room is missing like slippers shaving razor comb hair dryer iron and bath ropes , The atmosphere is great the facility itself is great as well 
509982,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The value for money was pretty good The room looked realky nice and was very comfortable The best thing was that the place is right across from a metro station 
509983,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The receptonist was rude and unfriendly the corridors are super modern but look like prison there was no hairdryer in the room and i had to go down 6 floors elevator was blicked and then 6 floors up and i had to pay a deposit for the hairdryer If this is supposed to be a student hostel the prices should go down dramatically , the location is great just in front of the metro station and close to Amstel River The bed was extremely comfortable and overall it s very clean 
509984,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, No iron No kettle There was a kitchen but it is only accessible to the students No fridge and the cleaners don t change bedsheets Breakfast was way to expensive for couple of rolls, I loved the decor room size and the view from the room was amazing we stayed on the 10th floor It was very clean and cosy Also very modern and trendy When we got there they gave us a ice lolly 
509985,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, It was not easy to find the hotel when I first arrived It might be easier if the hotel can give more detail which metro exit is the best , good location very easy to travel to city centre
509986,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, It was a good hour and a half walk from central with cases thought it was closer that s why we tried to walk although only 5 minutes on the metro and travel is cheap , The staff were lovely and you get little gifts checking in and out The hotel is amazing and we were shocked at it all pool tables foosball ping pong lovely atmosphere and even a mini ted talk library section 
509987,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, My negative about the room was that there was no no tea and coffee making facilities I thought you would have access to a kitchen which is not true if you stay as a hotel guest So the only way to get tea or coffee is to buy from a vending machine In my room there was a large poll post in the corner I am assuming it holds up the building but took up a lot of room I ve marked down for breakfast as it s ready made so if like me you have any allergies I m gluten free there is nothing you can eat If though you are a standard eater it looked great and good value for money The vending machines are expensive nearly 3 euros for a bottle of coke, I really liked this place It s a comfortable room with a lovely en suite It may sound a bit odd but I loved the bathroom Good size and great shower I had a standard single room The bed was wider than a standard single and the room was a good size for one person Everywhere is very accessible in the building and the metro station is directly outside of the main entrance There are a couple of takeaways close by and also an Albert Heijn supermarket across the road for snacks drinks etc 
509988,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Bed was a bit short for a tall person Breakfast was so so , Great location near the metro and museum district Bed was very comfortable aside from length Space was clean and welcoming and seemed to have the potential of being social 
509989,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Breakfast A small little isle in a corner and two tables for the breakfast of a whole hotel really For sure it will be fixed soon , It is how modern youth hotels should be like 
509990,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Nothing negative at all , I loved the clean modern design and the fact that there is a dedicated quiet zone for watching TED talks The pool will not open until 2016 but should be great when it does The gym also appears to be work in progress The staff were friendly and helpful and I would not hesitate to return on future trips 
509991,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, but the free gym and bike rental service are not ready yet , newly opened everything is fresh and clean Strong color decoration A nice cozy area in the lobby 
509992,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Breakfast is basic as sadwich and croisane with cofe or tee No hotel parking for cars So better to use local transportation , Many facilities as pool gym pilyard and table tennis 
509993,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Everything was great It s a new hotel with great location in one minute from the Metro station The room was very nice and clean The staff is great and very helpful I want to come back here again and again 
509994,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Just the distance from the centre otherwise this hotel is amazing And great value for money , Brilliant hotel the rooms were spotless and comfortable Lovely area and good connections to the centre Just don t try to walk back once the metro has stopped and get lost for two hours at three in the morning lol The guys on the reception are perfect even gave us an ice lolly when we arrived because the weather was hot
509995,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, How can anyone have a bad experience af this location , From A to Z The Student Hotel City was a TOTALLY pleasant experience The staff and facilities were EVERYTHING that one would need for a relaxing stay 
509996,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, no in room coffee facilites but little stall downstairs with a nice cuppa, very nice hotel staff very helpful esp tim and deborah nothing too much rrquested two extra pillows for room delivered straight away Any issue dealt with quickly metro right outside 4 stops into central station taxis home after midnight only 12 13 euros nice cafes around hotel and supermarket straight across road would highly recommend and would stay again 
509997,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Not as close as I d like to have been to the centre of Amsterdam but the metro station is just outside the hotel train is only 5 10 minutes into Centraal station, Helpful staff clean hotel good hotel lobby with pool tables and a ping pong table 
509998,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, The hotel is situated quite far from the city center But we walked by foot every day round about 2 5 3 km to the main railway station but if the ticket on the metro for 2 9 isn t expensive for you just don t read this , Very comfortable room with brand new furniture good young personal young doesn t mean stupid which helped us with staying for one more night in the weekend 
509999,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, I made reservation via booking which allowed me free cancellation until day before arrival For some reason the whole amount for our stay was already charged when we came I don t know if it is a hotel or booking com new policy but this is the first time it happened I was concerned because I wanted to pay with different card and only after I see the room When I pointed it out at the reception they were ready to offer me a different solution and very helpful , Although there is still work in progress at the hotel building we didn t hear anything Reception guys are very kind and friendly and offering welcome popsicles while checking in was nice touch We liked absolutely everything room comfort modern and funny design hotel stuff and we are definitely coming back 
510000,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, There wasn t a hair dryer in the room and one day they forgot to put the towel replacements in the room so had to use the set for the 2nd guess, The staff was ready to help with any inquiry and when I arrived managed to get me a very nice room despite there being a problem with the booking
510001,The Student Hotel Amsterdam City, Although you might need to spend a bit more than in other 99 of the times dirty and low in secureness student hostels you won t regret it at the end of the vacation , I had the pleasure to stay at TSH for two nights on the same week they opened and it was simply great The building that was probably once a factory has been for sure recently refurbished and both the rooms and the communal areas you can find a lot of them where to hang out and meet other customers are brand new clean and welcoming The people working there really know how to do their jobs and were always helpful and super nice to us The city center is easily reachable with the public transports and by bike also it must be 10 minutes It s recently opened but I m sure it will soon be by far the most known student accommodation in Amsterdam
