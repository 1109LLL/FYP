117241,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, The housekeeping at the hotel was quite bad When we asked the reception to make sure the beds were made properly they simply left us a new set of sheets on the bed and dirty laundry on the floor Very disappointing , The property was very conveniently located just 100 m from the Raspail metro station The room size and facilities were quite comfortable for 3 people

117244,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France,No Negative, The hotel staff and receptionists were genuinely happy to have you as their guest They treated all guest who checked in or out with the same level of concern and quality The room our family stayed in was a suite Enough room for 4 adults The view from our suite was superb as you peered over a small window balcony So Parisian 
117245,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, A little bit of a walk to Luxembourg gardens but only ten minutes, Lovely hotel Great value Difficult to find two double beds in this price range This had a family suite My five year old got a goody bag 
117246,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France,No Negative, Fabulous hotel with lovely rooms Very attentive and helpful staff When booking reserve a superior room and you won t be disappointed Very close to Raspail Metro station and Gare du Montparnasse is walkable Would certainly stay at this hotel in the future 
117247,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France,No Negative, It s very comfortable but keeps its costs down by being compact Perfect for those out all day seeing the sights or working because you aren t paying for lots of needless space in your room It is 30 seconds from the Raspail metro stop and the lines from raspail take you directly to the Eiffel Tower and to the arc de triomph amongst others Great bars and restaurants all around and an excellent bakery just a 5 minute walk up the road 
117248,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Someone on our floor was smoking so we were woken up several times with a smoke filled room This was obviously not the hotel s fault but they were unable to prevent it the next night too , Good breakfast very nice rooms and facilities and in a great location of Paris 
117249,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, I could smell cigarette smoke by the door of my hotel room due to its proximity to the breakfast room , The hotel was very clean and the location was excellent The hotel was walking distance to the train station as well as several cafes restaurants

117251,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Bed was too firm needs a top mattress Car and restaurant noise coming up from the street is loud even with shutters closed I loved the place but didn t get to sleep so well Would recommend asking for a top floor room , Staff welcome and helpfulness Reliability of room service and option to order from awarded restaurant at competitive prices Room appointments and hotel appealing design Excellent breakfast
117252,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, The kitchen and cleaning staff sometimes did not speak English , The reception staff was very helpful The location was great and the hotel was clean with the beautiful design

117254,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France,No Negative, Tastefully decorated quiet and pleasantly undersized Efficient and friendly staff The 2 bedroom apartment provides generous family quarters for a decent price Not a bustling palace but a very comfortable and relaxing hotel I ll be happy to recommend 
117255,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Nothing , The Hotel is very conveniently located The room is small but nicely decorated The good sized bathroom and a separated toilet are useful The staff are really kind and helpful We had a great time 
117256,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, breakfast choice limited compared to price but quality good The kid gift stated in their website for family room was not given to our son but not that important Raspail metro station which is closest to the hotel was closed and hotel needed to tell in advance and in the booking or hotel websites to plan to get off in Vavin station or Edgar Quinet which are also very close , cleanliness design decor ceramics lighting in the room location toiletries bed linen towels and pillows beds Beautiful books everywhere Airy rooms with lots of day light Very well designed and good size 4 bed family room with suitcase wardrobe drawes which is rare in normal Paris hotels Eveything of the best quality and plush Montparnasse Raspail area with lots of early 90s character Dome Couplule a fondue restaurant nearby Montparnasse cemetry Open Hop on Hop Off bus with station in front of hotel
117257,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, My major complaint was no washcloths I know not much to complain about Breakfast for adults was a bit pricey but really not much more than anywhere else in Paris And it was quite a nice spread Choice of full buffet or just a continental breakfast , This hotel was highly rated by others but we were still stunned by the luxurious accommodations Truly beautiful rooms immaculately clean nicely decorated firm beds We had a suite with TWO rooms one with a king bed and one with a sofa bed Walkout balcony in each room Location was great Very quiet we did not hear any other guests Free breakfast for your kids Overall very good value for the money 
117258,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, That I had to leave so soon , I loved the location of this charming hotel The room was beautifully appointed comfortable bed I loved the extra long bathtub The staff was professional welcoming friendly I would have loved to stay longer Peut tre la prochaine fois 
117259,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, The elevator is tiny true of all inner city Paris hotels though , The rooms were beautiful clean and spacious and good value for money Location right next to the Metro staff friendly and helpful 
117260,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Great location with plenty of restaurant choices and several supermarkets very close There are also large department stores less than a mile away Friendly and helpful staff Train station is walkable and metro is very close to this hotel , Wrote in wrong box all the good things 
117261,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France,No Negative, Everything was perfect Excellent location clean and spacious rooms with beautiful and stylish design Staff very polite Easy access to underground 
117262,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Sofa bed as only option for children could have been more comfortable Would be great if they could fit two small singles or pull out beds in same space , Welcoming staff child friendly helpful information given Peaceful and tasty breakfasts Good coffee Caf s nearby for other meals 
117263,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Rooms were small which is typical for city centre but modern and very clean , Great location next to metro bars and restaurants and supermarket and shops 
117264,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, We paid a lot for our one bedroom suite and were still charged extra for parking and breakfast didn t feel overly reasonable even for Paris Would have been nice for a four star property to have a gym available , Our one bedroom suite was designed extremely well for privacy We were traveling with our adult son and it made all the difference The hotel is in a beautiful old building and the rooms have been recently renovated in a subtle modern style that complements the original era of the building quite nicely The garage was right downstairs The neighborhood is fabulous full of great eateries and only a 10 minute walk from the Montparnasse train station 
117265,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Not applicable we liked everything about the hotel , The staff were extremely friendly patient and knowledgable Nothing was too much trouble Location is ideal as there are two main underground lines within a stones throw of the hotel door It s also great for local restaurants and cafes 
117266,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France,No Negative, Everything was perfect friendly staff helpful reception manager breakfast location spacious room bath accessories the whole atmosphere The only small confusion is about very slow elevator
117267,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Too short a stay , Lovely location for the underground nice balcony over looking the main road Lovely little Caf on the corner typically Paris Garage for the car 
117268,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France,No Negative, Staff were very helpful the only issue us there is nowhere to pull up with a can outside we had to partially park over an intersection for our luggage There is a secure storage room that the staff allowed us to keep our bags while we returned our rental and had dinner Nicely decorated and a very comfortable bed 
117269,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, The breakfast was excellent but providing a smaller breakfast would be an alternative As an older couple we participated in the breakfast only once during our stay of 7 days because for us it was too big of a meal to start the day , Everything The service was excellent Staff were courteous and helpful Air conditioning was a bonus and the rooms were very clean The mosaics were a special treat The shower one of the best in Europe 
117270,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, The staff were uninterested the hotel was very unaccommodating when we requested a refund 6 weeks before our stay for the last night as we had to leave earlier Booking com approved the refund but the hotel blamed their decision on Booking com , Not bad location close to public transport 
117271,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, The rates per night are okay for Parisian standards but not cheap We didn t have the breakfast for 18 EUR which was quite pricy in our opinion There are so many places to have a good and affordable breakfast in the Montparnasse district , Right next to Metro station Raspail which brings you to all sights very easily From CDG airport it s also very easy with the RER to Port Royal station The double bed room was very clean and looked newly renovated I would stay here again 
117272,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, The hotel advertised that it was very close to the train station Gare Montparnasse as if it was just across the street and it was more like a 10 15 minute walk from the hotel No big deal but I thought we were going to just have to take our luggage across the street to the train station , Very clean and comfortable wonderful staff made us feel welcome and valued as guests The room was a decent size along with a beautiful bathroom 
117273,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, the bedroom was small but adequate, the bed was very comfortable the linen beautiful large shower in bath room the staff friendly and very helpful terrific location 100m to a metro lounge room had English papers and books computer and printer available caf bar bistro close almost at the door step
117274,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, The only thing was that the hotel is small so the corridors and rooms are not very spacious , The level of service is high the place is really clean and the location is perfect Really good value for money 
117275,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France,No Negative, Great location excellent staff clean and tidy rooms soft beds free wifi and very good air conditioning Great value for money and with the Metro across the street then an ideal base form which to explore the city Lots of restaurants close by 
117276,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Nothing , Best cost x benefit we have stayed at this hotel quite a few times Modern charming comfortable 2 steps away from the metro close to many restaurants 
117277,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France,No Negative, Staff are amazing Great attitudes very helpful and went out of there way to make our stay brilliant The location is perfect located not far from a metro and many great restaurants Rooms are perfect everything you need with a comfortable bed and very quiet We have been traveling for 2 months and this is one of the best hotels we have stayed in Highly rate it and will be staying here again 
117278,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, The traffic noise is not louder than any other part of downtown but we are a little perspective because we live in a pedestrian area back home , Very kind smiley staff Walking vicinity to best places in Saint Germain and downtown Not only to tourist attractions Well off clean area Almost above a good bar to drink coctail and people watch 
117279,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, The beds could have been a little better but pretty good still, Great room and bathroom lots of space for Paris And great for the kids Good location in interesting area Staff were great and friendly helpful
117280,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Service was appalling I love france french culture french products history But there is the bad side too this hotel represents that Go elsewhere , Average
117281,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Well they don t have a fitness facility but I knew that going in , Just a really nice little hotel with a personal touch The room was as described and just right for me and two kids 
117282,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, We liked to all but did not take breakfast there because we felt it was steep at 18 However after our comment concerning the high cost of their breakfast they responded most positively and now offer a continental breakfast for 9 So nothing to not like , Excellent location facilities and helpfulness of staff Loved the book lined reception area We were able to browse books there and borrow them to read in our room International newspaper were available Free stylish umbrellas for guests to borrow as well if needed 
117283,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Nothing , This is a hotel where the room is a decent size and everything I hoped to find was there e g safe fridge Properly worth 4 stars Friendly reception 
117284,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, The personal at the reception was really confused talking to himself and seemed to bit unorganized The rooms are very small for a four star hotel for more than 1 2 nights the rooms are too small to stay The elevator was under construction during the days of staying there so carrying luggage from the very top to the very down floor and upstairs in pretty narrow steps might be tricky if you re have heavy bags , The location is close to bus metro and train station and the connection to the airport CDG is relatively fast and easy The rooms are clean but very small 
117285,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Like all french hotels very small lift elevator , Staff friendly welcoming and very helpful We were getting a train from Montparnasse and it is a great location for that close enough to the station yet not in the confusion and squalor that accompanies large train stations 
117286,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France,No Negative, I was staying with mom She really liked this hotel Good location 2 min to the metro station by walk Beautiful Luxembourg gardens 15 min by walk Every staff was very kind and friendly I will definitely come back here next year Thank you so much 
117287,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France,No Negative, The hotel Aiglon is a nice small hotel located close to a Metro station for ease of getting around The Eiffel Tower Arch de Triumph and Louvre are just short rides away The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and the room was very comfortable and pretty quiet 
117288,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, The noise of the people next door, Room is decorated nicely and elegantly The bathroom is new and clean and nice Staff are friendly helpful and always welcome you with a smile Loved it
117289,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Pity breakfast was an additional expense Hot water hot milk and a tea bag does not make a good pot of English tea Although complementary tea coffee were provided housekeeping had left provision for 2 instead of 3 persons We did get the extra cup etc when we contacted reception , Close to Respail Metro and walking distance from Montparnasse Station Plenty of restaurants nearby Welcoming staff excellent family suite comfy beds and good bathroom facilities Complementary kettle and tea coffee an extra touch English speaking news chanels
117290,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, bathroom needs updating but we knew that before arriving and it was not a massive problem , great room breakfast and surroundings Super friendly and helpful staff 
117291,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Nothing could have been better Staff extremely helpful and courteous , We recently spent four nights at the Aiglon hotel in the Montparnasse area of Paris The hotel is conveniently located one half block from the Raspail metro station and connects to some of the most interesting sights in Paris We noticed in several views the remark that the rooms were small and that is true but this is Paris and par for the course The bathrooms and shower were first rate however and the room very clean The staff was just wonderful and I especially am grateful to the receptionist who counseled me to just go to a concert I had bought tickets for but had gotten confused and missed the proper date We took that advice and all went well and we had an unforgettable evening there Breakfast was excellent with a wide selection and attentive staff I would certainly recommend this hotel 
117292,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Didn t like the handheld shower The bathroom tile was moldy and or dirty Bathtub was dirt stained Pictures on the web were nothing like the decor of our room , Towels were big and fluffy Robe and slippers were nice Big space for a city hotel Loved having a balcony to see the city Front desk provided umbrellas for rainy Paris day nice touch 
117293,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, I didn t like the air quality in Paris as much as I do where I live esp the man smoking on the balcony next to ours I didn t like crowded metros That s about it , Thanks but I do not really want to write a review for you It was a nice clean hotel with excellent staff 
117294,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, The bathroom had large clear window with no curtain had concerns regarding privacy At night main door was closed until opened by Reception Sometime needed to wait several minutes as it was unmanned , Room size and decor location both in central Paris and right near metro station A lot of good resturants quite close by 
117295,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, We did not take breakfast as it was EUR18 per person including each child That would have been EUR 72 for a family of 4 which I found a little bit too expensive for breakfast I would have wished for a cheaper kids price in many hotels kids eat breakfast for free or definately at a discounted price , The room suite was perfect for a family with 2 kids 8 and 11 yrs They had a sofa bed in one room for the kids and we slept in the bedroom Nice bathroom and everything was super clean The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful Location is good 
117296,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, The bed was very creaky and old and not that comfortable , The staff were lovely the balcony was a real bonus great little hotel close enough to everything Plenty of storage spaces and the bathroom was the best bathroom I ve seen in a hotel 
117297,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Breakfast was expensive at 18 so gave it a skip and had a nice breakfast out for 10 , Located right next to the metro in a quiet part of the city We had an upgrade to the family room which only had one bed However we had plenty of space Very nice rooms 
117298,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Everything was fine , Excellent location next to metro and also tourist features to stroll by Straight at the backside of Montparnasse graveyard with all gourmand infrastructure 
117299,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and made us feel very welcome A most enjoyable stay Only stayed one night but would have been very happy to stay longer 
117300,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, The breakfast room did not look appealing so we ate elsewhere as there are many cafes nearby , Good hotel on a great location for Montparnesse Rooms are well decorated and bathrooms above usual standard in many French hotels Staff are very friendly 
117301,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, room is very comfortable and smallish no problem for a single traveler , First class staff Silence location Very good deal with booking com Will come back with pleasure given the opportunity 
117302,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, We ve requested one queen size bed when making reservations but there was two single beds just brought together , Good location very close to metro station The elevator was out of order during our visit it was very nice of them to offer free breakfast for compensation Breakfast was delicious it would worth the money even if we had paid Room was clean 
117303,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, I would have given a much higher rating but unfortunately upon arrival I found out the elevator was not working and had not been working for more than 2 months It should have been noted on the site as the works have been going for over 2 months and it should have been reflected in a discount on the room price , Good location clean rooms small but nicely appointed Quiet Breakfast was good but too expensive 
117304,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Nothing at all , Staff were very helpful and attentive The elevator was out of service but we were given free access to their lovely breakfast buffet the next morning because of our being on the 4th floor The hotel also kindly accommodated my advance request for a quiet room which they made a point of telling us when we checked in and we really appreciated that 
117305,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France,No Negative, This was an amazing location almost on top of the Raspail metro station It s a ten minute walk from the catacombs and is very close to good cafes The staff was incredibly helpful even letting us store our bags after check out The room was small but comfortable perfect for our needs 
117306,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, A bad start with an arrogant unwelcoming receptionist The lift was not working with 5 floors to climb and I did not feel well The room was over heated and air conditioning not working Unfortunately you can t open the windows as the hotel is on a high traffic avenue Reception had no idea how to control the temperature nor did they make any effort to help except for shouting at us One of our worse hotel experience ever , A great location if you like off main track atmospheres 
117307,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France,No Negative, Very friendly staff Room was perfect very comfortable clean warm and facing a quite street overlooking Montparnasse Cemetery Checked in late after dinner and safely left my bag with them the following day Would definitely recommend based on the rate I got from booking com 
117308,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, The hotel was generally very old It really needed renovation Bidet in our room was broken and it just had an out of order sign on it instead of being repaired I don t recommend the rooms on top floor The windows are above head level So the room had a cell feeling , The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable The location was incredible The Raspail metro station was across the hotel The area is very lively There are a lot of cafes and restaurants at just walking distance 
117309,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France,No Negative, Right on top of metro 75 meters away from front door Staff was helpful with bags and suggestions for an evening meal Room had all amenities we expected 
117310,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, alleys are tiny old building elevator is small you have to wait sometimes for other to use it until your turn comes , the suite was nice big apartments
117311,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Just wish was one more mirror besides the one in the bathroom Saves time when two people are trying to get dressed in a hurry HINT There was room on the wall for one quite easily , Everything Room size was excellent staff helpful location excellent across the street from the Raspail METRO stop and short walk to the Gare Montparnasse Breakfast though a bit pricy was lovely We ll probably choose this one next time we are in Paris This place was really lovely 
117312,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Breakfast seemed expensive so we didn t eat there Traffic a little noisy in morning , The location was perfect for us as our son is studying just south of Montparnasse so it suited us all 
117313,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, I think that for the price the breakfast should have been included As I recall the breakfast cost 17 Euros , The staff were very friendly and helpful especially Camile whom we dealt with most of the time Our room was very comfortable and we had lots of room in the family suite The hotel location was fantastic with the metro across the street and lots of restaurants etc on the area I loved looking out the window onto a very Parisian street with trees Location was also pretty quiet 
117314,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Nothing really other than perhaps the cost could have been a little less , Staff were very efficient Our family suite was spotless and comfortable Very nice breakfast The location of the hotel on the outskirts of the historical sector was pleasant with the Montparnasse Cemetery and a good shopping district close by and Luxembourg Gardens within walking distance A very nice hotel we would stay there again and thoroughly recommend 
117315,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Nice room but very small Tiny in fact Very small pokey elevator I used the stairs but luckily I was only on the second floor Did not take breakfast option as highly overpriced at 17 , Handy location for purpose of my trip Nice room just too small Nice staff 
117316,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, The doors are wafer thin you hear everything including it sounds like people in the hall are in your room The bathroom was oblong shaped and did not have a shower it was awkward and not relaxing to try and bath Last the towels were old and thin nothing that you would expect from a 4 star hotel let alone 2 star They were really worn out and should have been replaced a long time ago Would stay here for the right price if I liked to take baths and if I planned on travelling with my own towels otherwise would not stay here again Last they have a policy that when you leave you must leave your key at the front desk We are not used to such a policy at any other hotel and it was a bit unsettling to do so Though nothing appears to have gone missing , Looked nice from the pictures and from the outside once we arrived Also the staff are very friendly and provided an ice bucket upon request much to our delight 
117317,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, As it regards the breakfast the price of 17 euro I thought I had more choice to improveregarding the breakfast could have more choice to improve, They lent me the battery charger of cell phone for free I was saved 
117318,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, For a four star hotel and the price rooms were small Breakfast for what they offer is far too expensive, The location of the hotel is good with restaurants and shops nearby Staff were helpful
117319,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France, Not enough power sockets in the room could have done with an extension lead Logging into Wifi every 24 hours was a pain Breakfast was average but plenty of choice locally No shower curtain needed to hold shower head which lead to a very wet bathroom but I guess this Parisienne thing , Location 1 minute walk to metro 2 cocktail bars next to hotel ample number of restaurants within easy walking distance Staff very friendly helpful Rooms very clean and a good size balcony was an added bonus
117320,H tel Aiglon Esprit de France,No Negative, Jess Milan another another man whose name I did not get et Marie Christine were immensely helpful knowledgable and friendly Very good for this weary traveler They were also able to lend me an adapter for mymab book air as I d forgotten mine It also has a c which can be adjusted by the guest I would definitely stay they again
