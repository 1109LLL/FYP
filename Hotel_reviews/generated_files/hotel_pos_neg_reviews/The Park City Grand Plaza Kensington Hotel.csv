73989,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, I really didn t like much the WiFi because it was on and off It was not that fast but also not that slow , I love everything about my room I also love their staff They were really accommodating and friendly The hotel is really great for me since it is situated on a quiet neighborhood Earl s Court Rd station was just a 10 minute walk as well as the bars shops restaurants etc Location is really good 
73990,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, Since we had nice sunny weather perfect holdiday , The location price ratio is amazing Walking distance to Kensington High Street Kensington Gardens and Holland Park If you want to explore London do it via public transport 2 tube lines reachable under 10 min Bus stops are even closer Hotel stuff is good and supportive We had a nice stay 
73991,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, There was no business center for checking the mail and others during family was sleeping while there was a sign of it It is better to make the space for it , I liked the atmosphere and the location The staff was willing to take care of my little child 
73992,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, The lobby appeared to be very spacious in the photos a place you could hang out in but it s very small and there are no amenities here The restaurant was closed No bar for a late night glass of wine The fridge in the room was quite noisy which we solved by having the room fan running on the second night to allow for easy sleeping , The rooms were small but clean and comfortable with the little things that help make a hotel stay nicer like tea making facilities Location location location The neighbourhood is absolutely sensational especially the walk towards Kensington High Street Beautiful architecture with lots of fancy cars parked on the streets so that the boys had something to gawk at Lots of pubs shops restaurants and bars within easy walking distance Buses cabs and Earls court station a mere 5 minutes away 
73993,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, Air condition was very poor despite having on coldest setting the room located on the 4th floor was very warm there was is also a lack of power points in the room on 1 x double to shared between kettle etc Cooked breakfast was very mediocre most things where deep fried Overall expensive for the money and wouldn t use again , Room was very quiet and nicely furnished
73994,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, Poor English with most of the staff really hard pillows and dubious stains on bathroom walls room 209 , Restaurant on site does close early so they kick you out at 10 00pm iron and large room safe in room

73999,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, Nothing to complain about Didn t eat in the hotel so can t comment on breakfast or food served , Have stayed a few times now and certainly one of the better hotels in London Rooms are a good size bed is comfortable you get a mobile phone to use during your stay with includes internet and certain calls Sky box in your room which is a new addition 
74000,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, Booking a double room and put into a twin room with bed together just wasn t acceptable They did change after I saw them at the desk Me and my wife stayed here about 5 years ago and it was amazing and I think over the years it s gone down hill Rooms were showing cracks in places Especially the bathroom WiFi is useless, The bed was comfy and having a fridge was very handy Having sky was a nice extra
74001,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, A room service menu in the room would have been nice , The bed was extremely comfortable the room was totally quiet and I loved going upstairs to the bathroom it was very private and all completely clean Breakfast was great lots of choice and good value The staff were all very friendly and kind The hotel is located on a quiet but very elegant street This hotel is going on my list of great places to stay in London 
74002,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, The WiFi signal wasn t the best from our room but that wasn t really a problem it was still quite good , It was a really cozy room and had basically everything you could need safe fridge kettle tea coffee TV and sky box a safe WiFi and good storage space All the facilities were really good 
74003,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, no heating system in the rooms they had toads a portable heater that waste enough the plugs in the rooms we rent working and staff came to fix my kettle for coffee but putting it on the floor quite discusting i will never go there again even by complaining they didn t even apologies awful experience bad service im really disappointed wish they could do anything to arrangee it but receptionist was rude and manager useless what a shame dont go there,No Positive
74004,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel,No Negative, The hotel had this fantastic mobile device that gave you free data and phone calls whilst in and around London I saved the battery on my phone and used theirs for google maps and checking out information whilst away from the hotel Will go back to the hotel again just for this Made my life much easier as my mobile battery is always flat when I use too much data 
74005,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, Wifi wasn t very good its not only me the rest of the family also had a hard time using the wifi low signal Lucky we had 4G service for those coming from outside Europe this might be an issue , Great staff Amazing location not so close to the tube but not far either and very spacious room We even got an early checkin which was very good
74006,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, Nothing to complain about , I loved everything about this hotel it was immaculately clean throughout Lovely decor even extending into the rooms unlike some 4star hotels that have a nice reception but your usually left disappointed by the time you enter your room not with this hotel Very nice friendly staff 
74007,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, The bathroom fittings were old and loose The heating system in the room couldn t be adjusted very easily and made the air in the room very dry , Our three bedroom was very spacious considering the average room space in London The location of the hotel though in a residential area is relatively close to V A Museum Science Museum and Natural History Museum Gloucester Road Station is only 750 m distant 
74008,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, I booked one night in a triple suite for my wife s birthday and just to make sure I was happy with the room I attended the hotel a week before our stay Rm 202 allocated but when we arrived on the day we had been moved to another room that wasn t as nice When I politely complained we were offered another room which was even worse Finally after some hard negotiation we got 202 back The room was 340 but no breakfast included I agreed to pay the 9 90 pp but when we went downstairs we were ignored initially by staff chatting to each other The price only covered a cold buffet continental and did not include a cooked breakfast which was an extra 14 I really think breakfast should be included considering the price of the room but at the very least surely 10 should cover anything you want like most other hotels we ve stayed in The ambiance of the basement restaurant was a little oppressive so coupled with the pricing we decided to eat out I would emphasise that we had a lovely and comfortable stay but the breakfast situation was really disappointing and considering the quality of the hotel it was rather stingy , Nice clean room 
74009,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, We received an email inviting us to check in the morning of our first night which had the total cost at more than 4 times the price we had booked at This was an error but it took 3 international calls to the hotel from Berlin where we were to find this out It was a stressful start to the stay as we are on our honeymoon The beds are very firm , The room is lovely the staff are all very friendly and helpful The hotel is in a very nice part of London 
74010,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, Reception clerk Mr Redzoan is a liar and wouldn t take responsibility for his actions before the hotel s Reservation Centre I enquired about the possibility of changing my reservation but clearly it wasn t worth it so I decided to keep it as it was Mr Redzoan knew this he was standing in front of me with Booking com on the phone when we all agreed to keep the reservation as it was Still they considered it changed and charged me more than 600 on my credit card without my authorization And that was for one night At the Reception they simply said Contact our Reservation Centre tomorrow Monday The Reservation Centre never replied my email Fortunately Booking com did the right thing and reimbursed me I hope they got their money back from this hotel and I hope they penalized the hotel Be careful don t trust this hotel , Some of the staff who were ashamed of their colleague and the whole situation doing their best to help 
74011,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, I m pretty surprised at the score for this hotel Location is very good for London but otherwise the place is a typical characterless impassive not very well maintained average London hotel Very impersonal desk staff Not rude at all but not welcoming either Bad level of room maintenance Towel rails sagging out of walls on loose screws faulty toilet flush really hot room with poor temperature control Shame with a little extra effort the place could actually become quite good , Good location Clean room Very reasonably priced breakfast Reasonably priced taxi deal with partner firm to airport 
74012,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, Nothing comes to mind, Very kind staff Room was very spacious comfortable and clean Location close to Natural History Museum and a supermarket for some quick groceries Breakfast was quite good as well
74013,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel,No Negative, The location was perfect in a safe quiet beautiful neighborhood but also close to the Tube and lots of action Our room was spacious and immaculate with a large walk in closet and huge well equipped bathroom Staff was friendly and always ready to help The lounge was a perfect place for a nightcap after a busy day out on the town Great for couples We d stay here again in a heartbeat 
74014,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, Chilly bathroom with cold tiled floor Not warned that our room had flight of steps up to bathroom and wardrobe Quite a long walk from nearest tube station Gloucester Road , Friendly welcoming staff Early check in Good choice of breakfast Full English breakfast freshly cooked Comfortable beds Very quiet location Facility to leave luggage at the Concierge desk 
74015,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, Slightly noisy at night double glazing would have held keep the noise from the street down but wasn t too bad , Beautiful hotel in excellent location Didn t have breakfast but hotel room was luxurious and very large more like a suite Had a fantastic stay 
74016,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, a group with 3 4 different reservations meant we had to wait a while to check in as only 1 member of staff on the desk the Bar staff were very quick to close up even though we would have stayed up and ordered more after 11pm, bed was comfortable liked the toiletries etc provided in bathroom such as spare toothbrush and razor Brilliant size of room and ideally located a short walk from both gloucester road and earls court tube stations Price seems about average for London especially when I realised there were a lot of people in town due to national football game
74017,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, nothing negative to say, Rooms were a good size and comfortable Breakfast was excellent and location very close to the station Have stayed in a number of hotels in Victoria but this is one that i would go back to 
74018,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, Sheets were only changed once in 7 days staff moody at times while some were ok , The location was great 10 min walk to Victoria Albert Museum and Natural History many neighborhood restaurants self service laundry around the corner buffet breakfast was good towels were changed out every day Upgraded us to a larger room huge by European standards
74019,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel,No Negative, The breakfast while not included was delicious and reasonably priced The staff was very accommodating including ordering a late night pizza for us 
74020,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, There was a bad smell that lingered around the stairs and bathroom area both nights of our stay not there during the day Our electric sockets didn t work the first morning maintenance soon sorted a faulty kettle so I asked for some hot water to be sent to our room so I could make tea The hot water never arrived but they did replace the kettle Our room was fine other than the smell coming from the bathroom drain but our friends next door had some slats missing broken from the sofa bed , The size of our bed and the room size in general was excellent Clean and tidy Wifi although not brilliant was free There s a safe and mini fridge in the room Location was good 
74021,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, Nothing , Everything about this hotel was great Very Freindly staff especially the young girls who worked in the restaurant couldn t do enough for you In a great location and easy access to earls court tube station

74024,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, Breakfast not very varied no gluten free bread or dairy free milk and limited fresh fruit selection Duvet was too hot for my son to be able to sleep comfortably and yet no alternative option of blankets sheets in room No bathrobes , Great room size excellent location really close to Kensington High Street and also museums very friendly and attentive staff listened carefully to our special requests Room was super clean 
74025,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, The continental breakfast is a bit lacking given that it cost 10 pounds You can find good and cheaper breakfast place nearby but you need to walk for 10 minutes , The hotel is on a quite street but not far from three different underground stations and many good restaurants and stores Our room is spacious for 3 people compared to what you usually get in Europe Overall we are very happy with the choice 
74026,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, We did not have breakfast there this year as it was poor last year with little variety and fresh fruit , Impeccable service from the staff polite to a fault Attractive Georgian building in the heart of South Kensington Earls Court with bar and lounge A comfortable well appointed room very quiet with a spacious bathroom Only 15 20 minutes walk from the Royal Albert Hall Holland Park Knightsbridge good restaurants pubs and delis close nearby and a decent Malaysian restaurant at the hotel itself The hotel has a gym and a business centre

74030,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel,No Negative, Very professional staff and excellent comfortable room Perfect location with so much to do in the area Particularly liked the availability of a free mobile with loads of tourist information and some free calls during our stay A lovely touch and much appreciated 
74031,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, We booked an executive room with 2 beds a single and a double instead it was overbooked and we got a pull out couch We chose this hotel so my daughter can have a bed so it was unfortunate and paid more for this upgrade, Loved the powerful blow dryer Great shower and ample towels

74041,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, Room was full of sunny light incredible so it got too hot and we didn t know how to manage the temperature We didn t ask for help either and it was better at night Breakfast is the only thing that was not as well as the rest of the hotel although it was very correct , Big clean and quiet room much bigger than expected and compared to so many other hotels in London Staff was very helpful Lots of amenities in the room to make it much more enjoyable Very close to tube stations and minutes walk from some of the main attractions

74045,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, No bar for relaxing refreshments even there was one advertised signage in hotel We found it closed over 12 months ago Website needs updating , Good location friendly staff
74046,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, The room I was allocated was cold and the heating air con was broken The staff tried to help but they couldn t help ultimately It was definitely the cheap room as there was 50 off in theory But one couldn t possibly pay full rate for this room , Staff were very nice and the food from the resto was decent
74047,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, The room was uncomfortably warm disappointing breakfast buffet some grumpy staff at breakfast bathroom could have been cleaner, Great location large room comfy bed
74048,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, I thought that it was a bit overpriced for what it was I have ordered a plate and knife upon arrival and the receptionist forgot to bring it to me so I had to call them again The room itself was very small and the ceiling was dirty The windows wouldn t open enough and the room was either too warm or too cold There were not enough towels either in my opinion There were no slippers and no robes which I thought was very odd The duvet was a bit too small for the size of the bed There were not enough hangers for two people The mini bar only had two complimentary bottles of water but no snacks or small alcoholic beverages The room also seemed a bit dark The drains in the sink and tub wouldn t let the water run down properly which I thought was a bit gross since no one wants to stand in a pool of soapy water when they re taking a shower , The room was clean and I enjoyed the toiletries Overall my stay was reasonably up to standard The staff were friendly and the maids did their job well I loved the sound system in the room I thought that was very convenient as I do enjoy to listen to music when I get ready The safe was spacious which I also thought was very nice The bedding was nice and crisp easy on the touch and the TV was large and conveniently placed with lots of channels to enjoy I also really liked the fact that you had to take a little staircase to the bathroom I found that very sweet and rustic 
74049,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, Directions Lexham Gardens goes round in a circle and out to the sides a bit like a tennis racket with a flag on top I arrived by bus and ended up walking all the way around LG in the rain before I found the hotel at the opposite end Online search by Postcode unhelpful as it didn t reveal the shape of LG nor the fact that the house numbers went up one side and down the other , Hotel was a modern refurbishment of an old building It was nicely decorated modern but not cold or dark I d been a bit concerned with everything being online that the place would be automated but the staff were welcoming and pleasant 
74050,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, The air conditioning was good when we wanted it warm but the cold setting didn t seem to work , The bed was extremely comfy and the room was spotless 
74051,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, The room and the hallway were unpleasantly warm when the airconditioning was switched off, Quiet location near the museums Has all the amenities a modern traveller needs such as european socket kettle wifi fridge and wide screen tv
74052,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel,No Negative, We liked the friendly welcome when we checked in Compared to other places we have stayed in London this place was very quiet and the bed was comfortable We had a tastefully furnished spacious room and there was everything we could have wished for supplied in the room plentiful good quality toiletries and even complimentary bottled water in the fridge We will certainly make this our regular place to stay whilst we are in London 
74053,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel,No Negative, The room was spacious and clean The neighbourhood was very quiet There is a big food store just 5 minutes away The underground station Gloucester Road is also withing a walking distance 8 10 mins 
74054,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, We notice straight away that the bathroom was a wet room and we didn t think it would be an issue but later on the night I had a shower to find the room steamed up straight away which meant when you came out the shower it was very hard to dry yourself because of all of the steam we tried looking for a fan to put on when we were in the shower but there wasn t one this is something that needs to be looked into We also couldn t find a room manual on where everything was and what was in the room which also meant that the room was very very cold in the morning even with the heating full on By the third day I ask a member of staff about the heating and they did sort it but the room only stayed hot for 15 minutes and then a fan came on to cool the room down it is winter at the end of the day not summer we are lucky we come from scotland where it is colder than London Another we didn t like about the hotel is the fact it was all Malaysian food which isn t to our taste and we wouldn t have stayed here if we knew this before we booked and this wasn t clear when we booked this hotel We always had to make sure we had eaten before heading back to the hotel As for Breakfast it was a total rip off 9 90 for a continental breakfast and the food wasn t even fresh I wouldn t recommend the breakfast here I would eat out if you find somewhere nice , This hotel was in a great location for walking to Earls Court station to enjoy all the sites You are only minutes away from Harrods and Kensington Palace you don t need to use the tubes all the time you could walk there within 15 minutes We stayed in a triple room which had plenty of room for all of us without feeling like we were on top of each other the room was very clean and tidy The staff were very helpful when you needed them The hotel also let us leave our bags until our flight later on and even booked us a taxi to be there for us collecting our bags I would maybe stay here again if I couldn t get anywhere else in London 
74055,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, The food wasn t good value for money at all The staff on our first day were great help other staff weren t very helpful And the atmosphere was very quiet , The room was very good layout how it had stairs to the bathroom was an excellent touch And very comfortable bedding 
74056,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, The room was extremely hot When we asked the hotel staff about the air conditioning and why it was blowing out warm air when set to Cold we were told by a very rude member of staff that because it was winter we had no option about the temperature and would have to live with it being too hot Not comfortable to sleep when it is that warm Also bathroom had no fan so by the time the first person had a shower all the surfaces were soaking wet with condensation and was far too hot , The room size was very good for London jotels
74057,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, More breakfast tea sugar and Milk for the room, The bed was very comfortable the room was very quiet great amount of space for myself and my partner bathroom was amazing very very nice hotel
74058,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, Perhaps minor things but pillows on the bed were small definitely not standard size pillows which seemed odd when bed is so big Also bottled water was not replenished on 2nd night and only one English breakfast tea bag provided which meant both of us could not have a cup of tea I was left disappointed especially as hotel is not cheap I would not class as 4 based on this lack of attention to detail , Stayed for a couple of nights following a trip to the Albert Hall Hotel in a good location and within easy walking distance of the Albert Hall tube station etc Room was small but very clean and reasonably comfortable Staff were friendly 
74059,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, having to pack up and leave, Once inside this hotel just gets bigger and bigger Room was massive which it needed to be because of the size of the bed Even had a single bed in the same room Quality of alarm clock Bose Free WiFi Staff were really friendly

74063,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, We didn t make use of the dinning or bar facilities because our stay was relatively short, The standard of the room was excellent and it was extremely well looked after The standard of cleanliness was also excellent All the staff were good and really accommodating altogether a pleasant experience

74068,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, I do not believe this can be rated as 4 stars hotel hence the rate per night is a bit too high compared to the quality of the hotel itself , Great location room clean and spacious Helpful staff at breakfast 
74069,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, The Malaysian restaurant was very poor for dinner and out of line with the standards of rest of the hotel Also the breakfast was not great, Location and room size

74074,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, It was really hot in our room everytime Even in October it was absolutely necessary to cool down our room I wouldn t like to stay there in summer must be terrible We had to sleep with open windows every night because the AC was too strong and noisy , Situation in one of the nice parts of London South Kensington Earls court calm but still not too far away from all facilities like restaurants some shops and tube stations Earls Court and Cloucester Road Rooms were small but clean and convenient
74075,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, Room was pretty small for 2 people not enough closet space Had to live out of the suitcase for the week We managed because we weren t in the room much anyway Might add they did offer to change the room The next morning but I let it go Other rooms might be bigger I don t know, Really like the location and staff were very nice It s a pretty hotel very clean but small
74076,The Park City Grand Plaza Kensington Hotel, The hotel is in a residential area and two women walking at night four blocks from the nearest tube station was not comfortable , Very friendly and accommodating staff The room was a nice size and had large windows looking out on the street
