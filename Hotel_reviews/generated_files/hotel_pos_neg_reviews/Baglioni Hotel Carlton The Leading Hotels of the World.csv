488311,Baglioni Hotel Carlton The Leading Hotels of the World, The only small criticisms are 1 The breakfast buffet should be more expansive and include more items of food i e more types of fruit in the continental breakfast This is especially in consideration of the price they charge per head 2 Room service menu is very limited in the day time As a 5 star Leading Hotel it should not be limited to cold food only in the day time and hot food should be available 24 hours a day but wasn t It was limited to sandwiches and salads in the day time , The staff were fantastic and overall the experience was very good A particular thanks to Sara Concierge who made the trip all that more special based on her recommendations of where to dine Location is fantastic for shopping and within walking distance to everything
