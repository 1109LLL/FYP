492395,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Breakfast could have been included in the room as this was expensive The porter outside the hotel on Friday 14th July watched us with 4 heavy suitcases and didn t even offer to help A kettle in the room would have been good for a 4 hotel , Breakfast was lovely but expensive clean and brilliant location 
492396,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, The view was not good just some ugly street maybe it s better on upper floors our room was at 2nd floor, The room had 2 bathrooms 1 of them for handicapped people I think it s outstanding
492397,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, There is nothing to dislike about the property , Location great all access to transport short walk to bars restruants in Corsa Como district Rooms very clean and staff friendly and helpful 
492398,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, As this is an AC hotel there is no executive lounge didn t realize this when I booked My mistake not the hotels but if you are looking for this perk it s not here Still it s a nice property , It s your standard Marriott clean good sized rooms Great view from higher floors Good location walking distance from Porta Garibaldi train station Staff was very friendly helped with directions and recommendations several times Had a companion leave a bag by the taxi stand by accident when we arrived and someone turned it in Nice to know we were staying with honest people 
492399,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, The bed was not real comfortable Firm but thin The hotel location was not convenient to anything Way off the beaten track unless you want to go to the art museum I suggest you stay near the duomo , Hotel was modern and clean 
492400,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Must be new hotel still under construction tv present but no plug socket for it Didnt bother conplaining as not most important to us, Convenient location to train station
492401,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, TGhe showere was missing some caulking around the enclosure which caused water to get on the floor, Great location for getting around Milan Nice room with good bed 
492402,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, No tea or coffee making facilities in the room Not helpful advice about where to find markets Really only good as a business hotel because it was rather a wasteland around it Our fault really we should have chosen a hotel more for tourists , It was very close to the station we needed at 6am in the morning 
492403,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, AC didn t work for two nights after complaining twice they offered a new room , The location is really comfy and the staff is very friendly and helpful 
492404,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, The second time we stayed here the staff on reception desk knew nothing about how to work and what to do Spent too much time during check in then at check out they processed the wrong amount and we had to spent 30 min just trying to finalise the bill Not enough parking spaces at Hotel s parking Overall the first time was incredible the second not so much But only because of the staff In a five star hotel although new the people working there should be already very highly trained The service and guest relations should be improved Manager Luca helped us resolve all the issues but be prepared that young staff will make mistakes, The location is good really close to Brera district The hotel itself is super new stylish with very comfortable beds Nice view from upper floors We ve been staying here twice and first time was incredible received a free room upgrade and the staff was very professional The second time the impression was a bit ruined But overall great hotel 
492405,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, The bath tub leaked the bed sheets fluffed all over all our clothes the windows were not sound proof the location wasn t the best there was no food available at the hotel every time we asked for some,No Positive
492406,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, I did not like the golf ball soaps No container to place soap in on vanity basin Entire vanity is glass and always looks dirty No bottled water in a 4 star hotel Surely one complimentary bottle per day is not outrageous , Did not eat breakfast Not included in rate
492407,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, The Air Con was not working so the room was very warm They did open the window for us but we had to close it at night as it was very noisy , The Hotel was lovely and modern and close to the train station in Milan The staff were very friendly especially Andreas who was very helpful and gave us directions and recommendations of where to go 
492408,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Aircon in room barely worked it was always way too hot when we came back to the room in the evenings I didn t get around to asking them to take a look at it , Bed was super comfortable Bathroom was really nice Good location literally right next to the tube entrance 
492409,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Acoustics could be better The rooms are quite noisy neigbours and streetnoise Didn t sleep well due to the mattress , Proximity of metro and tram 
492410,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Although the hotel is very close to the Garibaldi metro station we did not find it a cool place to stay it is an isolated area at night and the metro access in those hours is a bit scary you can feel the smell of urine probably from homeless people who are staying in the outside area Personally I did not like the attitude of the receptionist with whom we ve made the check out I don t know his name Because they first request an authorization to your credit card the day we checked in my card was refusing another payment in the checkout with the same exact details The receptionist was arrogant and thrown away my card in the desk , We had a reservation for a double room but the receptionist named Roberto made a nice upgrade to a superior room and offered us a voucher for wi fi connection that would have been charged the price of 20 00eur Great facilities and free access to the gym 
492411,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Booked a Queen bed but non available on arrival due to it being NYE and the hotel being full so settled for twin beds , Staff were brilliant one member Massimio went above and beyond to help us on new years day Hotel is modern well located and generally very nice 
492412,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Breakfast was not included and the quality of the breakfast didn t justify the money they were asking for it And no free WiFi come on it s almost 2017 , efficient business like
492413,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, The hotel publish its rates in euro I booked and confirmed the amount in euro But the hotel converted euro into USD by their own rate with no basis for it and no notification of me This is is an outrage that they can do with your money Unacceptable ,No Positive

492415,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, I m cluthing at straws when I say this but they could of had a plug socket next to a mirror in our room That s all I can think of TBH , If you are looking to travel around Milan and the surrounding city s Como Bergamo Turin this is the best hotel to stay in as Garibaldi station is just on its doorstep There is a superb strip of bars and restaurants 5 min walk from the hotel The hospitality of the staff is first class and they will do all they can to help you if needed

492417,AC Hotel Milano a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Booked what I thought was a triple room with an extra bed but got a double with an extra bed maybe an issue with booking com When I queried this with reception they said they d speak to housekeeping but we then had no further contact until I returned to reception 30 minutes later I think they should have contacted me to let me know the outcome of the discussion Staff were unwilling to add a further bed despite there being room for another Youngest child ended up sleeping on couch The Hotel did provide extra duvet , Good view and location convenient for Porta Garibaldi station Close to tram stop for direct journey about 8 stops to central area
