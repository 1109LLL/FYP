49514,Hotel Le Six, Just the weather , Everything And on top of that they give you a Samsung phone to use while in Paris Free calls to the US excellent guides and directions right in the palm of your hand A fantastic touch from a fantastic hotel Eat at Chez Marcel right across the street but make reservations early it s always busy 
49515,Hotel Le Six, There is currently utility construction taking place on the street in front of the hotel so a little noisy at times and barriers in place , Neat boutique hotel Some of the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever come across Staff was wonderful Loved the location Not too touristy Luxembourg gardens close by and a great place for a morning run walk 
49516,Hotel Le Six, The only thing I would have liked is the option to have a smaller and less expensive breakfast than the full breakfast option at 19 Euros per person Just coffee juice pastry option would have been very nice to have for those who don t want a large breakfast , Excellent staff very helpful for anything needed Friendly and professional 
49517,Hotel Le Six,No Negative, Excellent staff helped with location of nearby restaurants and activities Centrally located in quiet neighborhood but still within walking distance to main attractions 
49518,Hotel Le Six, There was little room for our cases but apart from that nothing to add , Breakfast was served in a very pleasant room and everything offered was tasty and high quality I have seen more variety on offer at some Paris hotels but I felt that I had a good breakfast and enjoyed it This hotel is particularly convenient if you are travelling onwards to the south west from Montparnasse Until the end of May be aware that the metro from Gare du Nord cannot stop here and it s a fairly expensive taxi ride You see lots of Paris en route 
49519,Hotel Le Six, Small room Disappointed for 500 euros for one night in a suite internal courtyard room without air and it felt felt damp , Staff extremely friendly and helpful 
49520,Hotel Le Six, Noisy elevator was being fixed squeaky bed a large double bed would have been better than the 2 seperate beds , Small hotel very friendly and helpful staff small but comfortable room very quiet large modern bathroom excellent breakfast hammam
49521,Hotel Le Six, Wee bit pricey Breakfast much too expensive but the the staff recovered once again Trouble with the keys was a bit annoying but again great response from the front desk TV was on the blink for 1 night but those great staff again this time a bottle of Champagne , Tireless honest and timely helpfulness of all staff for everything repeatedly
49522,Hotel Le Six, street is a bit on the noisy side and a little difficult to find I was supposed to be in a superior room not sure if I was but it s a bit on the small side breakfast was ok but would be nice if they varied it a bit from day to day after a couple of mornings can t say I was looking too forward to eating the same things our room was on the side of the street and was noisy thru most of the night and early morning trash pickup was annoying would also be nice to have water in the room everything was charged from the minibar , bed was comfortable staff was very friendly and helpful and location is fairly central but not really close to most things we did a lot of walking to get around 45 minute walk to eifel tower etc
49523,Hotel Le Six, Couldn t fault the hotel, Really great location easy to get around on foot and close to metro staff v friendly great English language and informative re sights of Paris Rooms and bathrooms very nice Modern and clean and v good free wifi We were there when 38 degrees so air conditioning in rooms brilliant think one of the best we have experienced in a hotel Plus v comfy bed and a nice little chocolate on your pillow when they turn down the bed Great hotel all round second time we have stayed
49524,Hotel Le Six, We were happy with all aspects of our stay , I have travelled the world and stayed at a great many hotels but I have to say that the staff at Hotel Le Six are the best I have ever encountered Slimane was particularly helpful throughout our stay What a great team The hotel with an interior which looks fresh and new is very nicely decorated and furnished to make for a very comfortable stay Our deluxe room with a Juliet balcony was simply superb Thank you so much I would absolutely recommend staying here if you are visiting Paris 
49525,Hotel Le Six,No Negative, The staff were fantastic extremely helpful I loved the huge shower recess It s in a quiet little street but close to all the major attractions and there are plenty of good places to eat just around the corner Breakfast was good Highly recommended no negatives

49528,Hotel Le Six, The wifi lost reception often but it was free so that was great , We loved the extra little touches bottled water beside the bed wonderful O Occitane products chocolates and delicious croissants 
49529,Hotel Le Six,No Negative, Arrived to a once a year neighborhood get together After checking in I joined in for food conversation and wine Additionally the staff was extremely friendly and helpful I ll definitely go back when in Paris 
49530,Hotel Le Six, very poor internet This is essential in a business trip Would not recommend for a business trip Only if you need to use facebook or what s up from 8am to 10 pm Otherwise no access at all , very clean and big room
49531,Hotel Le Six, I actually like the sister hotel better also owned by Le Six A little more rustic old european which we really like Modern hotels we can get anywhere , I miscalculated and got in a day early Staff didn t miss a beat booked me in a sister hotel a few minutes away Complimentary basket of fruit the first night bottle of wine the next They left you alone unless you needed their services Metro nearby great places to eat Highly highly recommended 
49532,Hotel Le Six, The location is easily accessible but the main road is a typical big modern road with not so many beautiful things to see Hotel is situated just off the main road so not bothered by the noice , Had a lovely stay here Staff helpful and friendly and always willing to help advice Breakfast lovely with lots of fresh fruit bread juices meats etc etc The toiletries provided are of great quality and I was pleased to see there was the usual soap shampoo conditioner shower gel body lotion and also hand cream Wifi was free and worked really well And the location of the hotel was easy to reach with a number of Metro lines but being situated on a smaller side road off the main boulevard one couldn t hear all the busy traffic Would happily stay here again 
49533,Hotel Le Six, Shower temperature varied perhaps as the occupants of the room next door were also showering , All staff were friendly helpful The hotel was in a good location Our room was a great size lovely Italian shower deep bath bed very comfortable breakfast choice excellent Planning on returning 
49534,Hotel Le Six, The cost was a little high for the size of room but I understand this is normal within the city center of Paris , Le Six is clean and provides relatively large rooms The location is great There are numerous restaurants close by However I suggest to stay away from restaurants off the main street as they are expensive It was overall a great experience The Staff went out of their way to provide helpful services such as travel from and to the airport reservations at restaurants and good information regarding local attractions

49536,Hotel Le Six, The international television that were listed were not available The international chanels available needs to be increased and capability to modify the audio language of the program also needs to be available , The staff are all professional efficient friendly and accomodating Though the location is perfect for taking the RER B or any train from Montparnasse it is on a calm and quiet street also withi walking distance to some highly rated though little known neighborhood restaurants
49537,Hotel Le Six, Nothing everything was great, The team and service are fantastic L Occitane amenities are brilliant an freely replenished every day Staff are just wonderful and this is an easy hotel to come back to Rooms are big towels soft bathrobes feel new chocolates every night water is replaced every day free cakes in lobby bar glass ceiling in foyer beautifully charming lift and stairway And the location is just perfect close to Metro velib station and taxis all know where to find it
