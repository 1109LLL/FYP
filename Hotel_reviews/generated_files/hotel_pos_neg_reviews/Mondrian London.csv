100530,Mondrian London, The air conditioner was a little noisy , The bed was very comfortable and the bath towels luxurious The room was very well appointed and the staff so friendly and helpful 
100531,Mondrian London,No Negative, Staff were excellent very efficient helpful and friendly Exceptionally comfortable beds and superb shower Malin Goetz products very luxurious 
100532,Mondrian London, the Design and the Details in the Hotel are fantastic The Service absolute Top notch Only the free Wifi is much too slow for proper use , the price of breakfast should have been included in the days discount of 33 When we paid the bill it was not Also the price confirmed was not the stated price incl breakfast when I booked it online This has happened to me twice and I strongly recommend to make a screenshot at booking instant to have proof for opposing different confirmation 
100533,Mondrian London, Service was a little slow in replenishing coffee Unable to see additional knives for pastries and toast Bars were very busy and noise level high But great for younger guests , Breakfast was very good value excellent Beautiful view Doormen we re very helpful in getting taxis 
100534,Mondrian London, Room s electrics kept tripping out someone came at 05 45hrs on a Sunday to knock and wake my wife to fix it when the electric box was outside the room in the corridor No security latches on the door to enable slight opening to check ID very insecure As a Security Consultant I feel this needs to be addressed , Close location to good restaurants venues underground The bars in the hotel are modern and lively with a good atmosphere 
100535,Mondrian London, It was our silver wedding anniversary and we received a complementary bottle of red wine Perhaps the only disappointment Fizz would be more appropriate , The location The Rumpus room and views 
100536,Mondrian London, The bed was ordinary Good sheets but standard bed nothing like Sofitel beds I didn t like coming from the other side of the world and having no view when I could tell the hotel was not fully booked I didn t like not being able to book the Curzon Mondrian through Concierge I didn t like housekeeping knocking on my door to get in at 8am I didn t like cups stained from previous users I didn t like not being able to reduce the aircon down lower than 19 degrees as we had come from winter and needed it a bit cooler , I did like the bathroom products I liked the chic feel of the place I liked the restaurant setting so nice relaxing on the Thames after mad rush in London during the day 
100537,Mondrian London, Beaty music all day long More like entering a night club than a good hotel Volume and style of music in the dining room made conversation extremely difficult It really was excessively noisy Waiter said nothing could be done volume was automatic My party of 8 had travelled across the globe for this occasion and then we could hardly speak to each other , Great location Quiet rooms Comfortable beds Good bathrooms 
100538,Mondrian London, Leaving , Awesome modern hotel perfect for all ages and groups money well spent From my personal experience within London hotels this is the best I have experienced so far Great design and general layout of the building and hotel as a whole The rooftop bar was the icing on the cake there s not much that this hotel can t offer you Service from staff was second to none absolutely amazing staff The staff probably topped the weekend off concluding a great stay Awesome birthday surprise in the room open arrival for my girlfriends 21st also from the Mondrian Hotel service team which was a very nice touch This hotel won t disappoint 
100539,Mondrian London, Some facilities in the room were missing a dressing gown and some slippers would be great to have as the bathroom floor was really cold and slippery or some pads to take makeup off little shoe brush to clean shoes etc , The hotel is perfectly situated with a walking distance to the main attractions such as London Eye for example Nice area for walks along the River Thames Hotel has a very good restaurant nice views from the bar on the top floor 
100540,Mondrian London,No Negative, During the week the breakfast is a la carte and during weekends it s brunch We had an excelent english breakfast at the hotel The location is superb right on the Thames River very close to Borough Market and the Tate Modern Great views 
100541,Mondrian London, Check in time was 3pm a little late and all riverside rooms were more expensive so basic rooms overlooked other buildings , A quality hotel in a great south bank location 
100542,Mondrian London, We were told smart casual dress code for the Rumpus Room to get up there to find they let anyone in wearing shorts t shirts and clearly no dress code , Nearly everything quality of service location facilities and food were all excellent 
100543,Mondrian London,No Negative, Tacky upgrade spiel at checkin Breakfast not included in price Awful inappropriately casual and usually ill fitting sweatshirt staff uniforms Only one comfortable chair in pretty ordinary room Just underwhelming 
100544,Mondrian London, Lighting in corridors confusing Music in lifts and lounges very loud and disturbing l, Hotel very modern and glitzy Room a very pleasant surprise Bathroom and amenities exdellent Bed and linen very good Will return
100545,Mondrian London, I always booked with Booking com but this time the rooms different between Booking com and reality I booked rooms size 29 but the reality about 20 Also the smell of beds were not good , Nothing
100546,Mondrian London, Staff needs training it seems as though people are either new or just have far too much attitude for a service job From our check in to the restaurant and especially the dandelyon bar in which the young man running the door last night had so much attitude you would have thought we were at studio 54 people were just off with that being said concierge was fantastic , Gorgeous hotel great location and fair price for luxury experience
100547,Mondrian London,No Negative, Booked the weekend break for me and my daughters mentioned that it was a reunion no added extras which was disappointing Room was decorated well not that big great shower no view excellent location Loved the Rumpus Room and Dandeylan Didn t eat there 
100548,Mondrian London, The reception area was dark gloomy An architect gone mad , Loved the location Busy friendly bar Cleanliness of room bathrooms Excellent breakfast Lovely staff 
100549,Mondrian London, We went there on the day terror attacks happened we couldnt leave the hotel as our uber wouldnt pick us up the bar closed early we was suppose to have a riverside view room and never got it either ,No Positive
100550,Mondrian London, It s not PERFECTLY located for tube use there are stations nearby and very easy to get to from the hotel from there but Jubilee isn t the best line so if you need to be traveling all over the city or coming and going a lot and don t care so much about your hotel you could pick something a bit closer to the main arteries of the tube , Loved it great sheets beautiful hotel and a perfect location We loved strolling the South Bank and enjoyed drinks in the bar at night with spectacular views Perfect for couples and younger people who want to be at the heart of London 
100551,Mondrian London, We went to the Dandelyan bar to have afternoon tea but it didn t meet our expectations It s a great cocktail bar but if you want a more relaxed atmosphere for afternoon tea I would go someone else , Booked a balcony suite for a Hen weekend The suite was spacious The bed and sofa bed were very comfortable The bathroom was spacious especially for 5 women getting dressed to go out The hotel and left a bottle of champagne in the room for us It was really lovely to have the space to relax We used it as our hub and travelled around very easy from there We had breakfast in the room and it was really good quality Definitely worth booking a suite if you want some more space 
100552,Mondrian London, Rooftop bar is badly organised and the staff are rude When I checked out I asked for the bill to be emailed to me but it never happened , A cool place to be
100553,Mondrian London, The staff was friendly and helpful when they tried to upsell you but once you agreed to upgrade your room and pay more they were no longer interested to serve you ,No Positive
100554,Mondrian London, The menu in the room was dirty and sticky not what you expect from a hotel of this quality The rooftop bar was closed for a private function which was particularly disappointing , The location was excellent 
100555,Mondrian London, The staff at check in was a bit unpolite asking for my ID twice on arrival and later when the room was ready using as an excuse that it was a busy day , The rooms the attention to details on all the amenities and options at the mini bar 
100556,Mondrian London, Being really picky here I was surprised there were no robes slippers for a hotel of this star rating price Also bathroom floor was raised but all made of the same marble so hard to see the lip stubbed our toe numerous times But again being very picky , Great location next to the Oxo Tower opposite Somerset House St Paul s Cathedral Fantastic staff a nice touch that they gave us a round of free drinks as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary 
100557,Mondrian London, Check in was supposed to be from 3pm but our room wasn t ready until 5 20pm We were not the only people to encounter this problem it seemed everyone trying to check in couldn t get into their rooms on time , The bedrooms were clean and the beds comfortable The rooms were quiet 
100558,Mondrian London, Poor view from my room Staff didn t speek English in the main restaurant and we had problems ordering food, Excellent bar Dandylion had amazing cocktails and Rumpus roof top bar excellent view and DJ Plus modern deco clean excellent porters
100559,Mondrian London,No Negative, Our room came with a really nice outdoor space Location is great By the river great for walking around Equally beautiful during daytime and nighttime Especially in summer
100560,Mondrian London, Staff were professional and friendly but not warm and relaxed felt a little business like and rules based Crib setup in room for baby but didn t feel baby friendly in restaurant or bars , Great design for hotel and wonderful location on riverside
100561,Mondrian London, N A, I like everything about this hotel I have stayed there on numerous occasions and every time I love it even more The staff are attentive yet professional the environment is luxurious modern yet comfortable the location is excellent and the SPA is perfect What else can one ask 
100562,Mondrian London, Ordered room service and although the portion size was good food was very very oily Some sort of phone device in the room didn t even work properly and was slow Room looked so bland and basic TV was on wall at a strange angle even when pulled away from the wall Lifts are very slow and sensor isn t very good Can t believe the standard room charge can be as high as 300 , Nice Bathroom and shower Bed was comfy Reception area is quite funky and staff were helpful 
100563,Mondrian London, the restaurant was too crowded too many table squashed together and too noisy probably because its not carpeted so the chatter echoed all over the place and music wasn t necessary at the level it was on background it was NOT and actually a bit too dark but we are very ancient , the position obvs the style the more than attentive staff
100564,Mondrian London,No Negative, The location was perfect amazing views from the hotel and right on the embankment walk lovely bar and restaurant would thoroughly recommend even has a cinema 
100565,Mondrian London, I was charged GBP 12 for minibar consumption I did not have I sent an email to the hotel and they replied that they will refer my email to somebody else I promptly declared at checkout the items I consumed from the minibar which I was charged for at checkout The hotel then sent an email charging me an additional GBP 12 for items I did not consume The fact they are not taking my word for it is annoying I travel a lot everywhere and would never still from anybody I find astonishing that for GBP 12 they want to have an argument I must say front desk staff change frequently I was there a few times over last few months and that might be the problem They are just new and not very trained ,No Positive
100566,Mondrian London, Lovely hotel but hotel staff weren t very friendly on arrival However very nice staff when checking out , Hotel is on the Thames near Tate Modern the Globe theatre London Bridge waterloo not far from west end Fantastic position 
100567,Mondrian London, On late arrival from the tube after a great few days in Rome I thought this would finish off our trip with a bit of style we came in the front entrance via the restaurant bar and it was like rocking up to a night club security removing an inebriated man from an event that had been on during the day was a bit distracting The room was swanky but the view not great that comes with an added x 3 price tag as instructed by the hotel when I requested via booking com a view if available we gave that a miss The food and drink prices in the restaurant were extortionate and really limited the extent to which we could enjoy what was on offer which kind of defeats the object We heard a lot of US accents and anticipate a lot of the guests were from the US and I believe the hotel is part of a US chain so that might make sense Next time we will be happy to look for funky UK owned hotels If you really like the look of the bar you can enjoy that as a non guest along with all the other great places to eat an drink on the Southbank without the hefty accommodation price tag , The property was in a great location for the South Bank easy walk across to other areas and the tube It had a swanky vibe The restaurant fit us in despite our late arrival at 10 30 with a few minutes to spare 
100568,Mondrian London,No Negative, Both bars were excellent Really helpful staff who provided straighteners toiletries and a hair dryer to my girlfriend who s bags were lossed at the airport
100569,Mondrian London, Couldn t open window so air conditioning on all the time, Great location Very comfortable room especially the bed and pillows Good quality fittings and good mood lighting throughout the hotel 
100570,Mondrian London, I loved it everything , I proposed to my girlfriend so I d contacted the hotel to see what they could do for me for example champagne etc I had been speaking with Anthony who is on the front desk for a few months He was absolutey amazing He upgraded my room and even gave us a bottle of champagne The service was out of this world I ll definitely be staying there again 
100571,Mondrian London, Room service took 1hr 40 mins and a couple of phone calls to arrive instead of 30 minutes but I enjoyed th food when it did arrive, The hotel s location on the South Bank means it is close to everything and couldn t be better I love the quirkyness of the hotel and the very friendly staff
100572,Mondrian London, Rumpus room staff don t hold your table bookings even if you re 15mins late due to having dinner at the hotel and you re staying there A cocktail was accidentally spilt and they charged for the replacement which I think is disappointing when you re already spending a lot of money there , restaurant service is a bit abrupt
100573,Mondrian London, See above , The hotel us very ordinary with no wow factors considering how expensive it is compared to other 5 hotels I have stayed in I would not recommend the hotel or stay there again Not good value for English people The restaurant is expensive and the cocktails are over priced I had to send 2 bottles of wine back as the wine was off I had to upgrade to a bottle of wine that cost 66 to get a decent savignon blanc Tourist prices 
100574,Mondrian London, Only two negatives the first OBVIOUSLY seems to be a trait all over Europe being from Australia we dont NEED to sleep in High temperatures each time we left the hotel each day we would come back to the room with the Temperature RESET by House Keep to 24 5 degrees we would drop it to OUR comfort level and then it would get reset the next day A Tad annoying The strange one was the Room obviously came with a Hair dryer what was strange was it was of the incorrect plug to what was set in the room which was NOT EUROPEAN STANDARD Funny one , Where do I start Location Perfect right on the river perfectly placed within walking distance of everything for those that are inclined to walk but also equally close to all need transport hubs including the Hop on Hop off bus routes Facilities are awesome to beautiful bars one on bottom floor and one on the 12th floor from memory both with beautiful views of london and the river The rooms are large for BOTH London and Europe in general and the bed was divine to sleep on But what makes a GOOD HOTEL GREAT Its Staff being in business for myself its all the little things that stood out and the list is long The best example was I had late night drinks in the Level 12 bar on TWO nights I have a particular drink i like and only ordered it once on the first visit 5 Nighst later on a BUSY night in the Bar Im standing two deep at the bar and the Original Bar tender calls out to me with both MY choices in his hand asking is that what Im after Huge THUMBS up from me This pattern of behaviour was everywhere You would not be dissapointed staying at this Hotel 
100575,Mondrian London, Air conditioning stopped working and noise from adjoining room disturbed my relaxation , The location is great right on Thames Great for an evening cocktail 
100576,Mondrian London, More storage space in the room We had a double double room and there was just a cheap looking corner to hang your clothes and 3 drawers The corner storage was conceled with a drape For a 5 hotel I found this a bit well cheap Only 2 small towel hooks behind the bathroom door No towel rack for handtiwels face clothes No kettle or Nespresso machine , Breakfast was abundant Lovely sausages and portobello mushrooms Fresh pan au chocolat and croissant as well as lovely rolls greek youghurt and musli berry compot The gym was small but compact and had all you needed for a good workout There s a small Waitrose around the corner and a pharmacy opposit the main entrance We had requested a quiet room which we received Lovely down duvets and pillows Bath towels were huge Comlimentary wifi was fast and worked well 
100577,Mondrian London, The fitness center is not really on par with a hotel of this class but that is the case with most hotels in London The spa does make up for it , I ve stayed in the Mondrian multiple times and it one of my favourite hotels in London The location is excellent rooms are nice relatively spacious and well appointed The lobby restaurant and bar as super stylish and perfect to take business relations or a romantic date Breakfast and dinner are really good and with nice weather you can sit outside overlooking the river Thames The Rumpus Room is a great rooftop bar great view This hotel has everything it needs for me I ll be back read in terminator voice 
100578,Mondrian London, The restaurant and bar areas are lovely but the restaurant menu was somewhat limited and more to sharing platters than to plated meals although plated meals were offered on the room service menu a menu which was oddly enough not available in the restaurant A somewhat more conventional restaurant or cafe menu would be appreciated And while the room was very well equipped there was no outlet in the bathroom for the hair dryer so the hairdryer had to be used in the bedroom which was a bit awkward , Fantastic location on the Thames with a very comfortable and pleasant ground floor lounge area with views across the Thames to St Pauls and the City and easy walking distance to the Tate Modern and Globe Theatre We stayed in a standard room that was spacious and well appointed Among the amenities a courtesy mobile smart phone was provided with the room and the room minibar was in a beautiful well stocked bar area with cut glass wine and drinks glasses 
100579,Mondrian London, The only think I could complain about was that the fridge could have been little bigger to fit our own drinks inside , The hotel is located close to everything we were looking for Even there was a constant traffic of people we didn t have any noice complaints in our room The staff was so nice and friendly We had lunch at the restaurant the food was good and the bar was fresh and different and staff amazing 
100580,Mondrian London, The stay was a complete dissapointment for me and my colleauges At check in nobody was given a room before 3pm the were not ready At 3pm all rooms at a time became ready No information on hotel amenities from the reception staff they were just interested in credit card Overpriced restaurant with scarce menu No a la carte for breakfast on weekend just standard buffet not a 5 star no sparkling wine or champagne Had to ask for my coffee for 4 times and wait it for 20 minutes Late check out promised by booking com was not granted besides the reception told to come later and later to check That is not normal Room keys discontinued to work a couple of times I could not fond any difference between a standard and a superior room description and pics are all the same The hotel is not worth its money and a 5 star rating, Location comfortable bed
100581,Mondrian London, Rooms without a river view tend to feel second rate just beacause having booked the hotel for the riverside location it is a shame not to see it, Stunning design great use of an old warehouse building with clever referencing to its past River views are excellent and bars restaurant are as splendid as you would expect 
100582,Mondrian London, There were no slippers or robes which for a hotel of this star rating is unusual No bath either They also did not have the booking when we arrived as it had been put in for a fortnight s time Luckily they had availability otherwise it could have been a disaster , Quietness of the hotel the location and the restaurant 
100583,Mondrian London, Very basic selection of tea coffee instant didn t fit with the hotel branding We were only in a standard room but I have had better in other much cheaper hotels The view was also not great but we expected that in the grade of room we had ordered We got a good deal on the price but without that it is a very expensive hotel The breakfast was very expensive and I expected more for the price no omelettes eggs Benedict or smoked fish Providence of sausages and bacon not shouted about so I expect this isn t a priority for the hotel although it is for us , The size of the room was generous for London and the d cor made it feel special The bathroom was also enormous and the shower brilliant We visited both cocktail bars and even though we were over twice the average age in both were made to feel welcome and the cocktails although eye wateringly expensive were excellent and worth it The views in both bars were fantastic The location is great we were visiting the National Theatre a walk away and Tate Britain short taxi ride Tate Modern is also only a walk away 
100584,Mondrian London, Breakfasts are not quite as good as they should be Service is OK but apart from the maitre d female who is great the other waiters were not quite as professional as she was , Aries and Edward were most helpful
100585,Mondrian London, The plumbing is water supply to the sink and shower is very noisy unless set exactly right Room was too warm even with heating off , Very stylish hotel room very comfortable spotlessly clean staff very friendly
100586,Mondrian London, The room was average the lifts were an absolute pain, Staff were lovely location was great room was very average alleged river view then to be told it s a partial river view
100587,Mondrian London, A pool would be nice, From end to end my stay was great A very convenient location close to Blackfriars to be able to get you to anywhere you need quickly The hotel itself is a feat of design and I love the overall feel Quite often design hotels can be more style over substance but the Mondrian London does not disappoint at all Very careful attention to detail throughout with high quality rooms and services The rooftop bar is also stunning a worth visit 
100588,Mondrian London, I have visited hotels all over the world from 3 star 5 star luxury and found the staff at this hotel in particular not very friendly , The location is excellent the hotel is trendy clean comfortable and smart good breakfast and comfortable rooms 
100589,Mondrian London, little pricey but on london s standards , exceptional experience hotel is very cosy posh and instead informal helpful communicative staff our room was comfortable and quiet such a rare thing in london wifi ok i can highly recommend this accommodation for leisure travelers southbank tate nice restaurants near also both hotels bars lower upper floor and restaurant is a 
100590,Mondrian London, Although the service and facilities are worth it I wish it were a little less expensive as i d stay there more often for now it will have to remain a rare treat , Apart from the price I wish it were a little less expensive I love everything about this hotel Some time ago I was fortunate enough to get a really good deal on Booking com for a one night business trip and knew I wanted to bring my beloved for a stay The staff are excellent professional quick and very friendly the rooms are spacious very clean light and super comfortable The restaurant has some excellent food both for dinner and breakfast inc some good veggie vegan options and the spa is one of the best i ve experienced they ve certainly never complained of my snoring drooling when I zonk out in the middle of a massage My beloved and I were there to celebrate an anniversary and we were given a free drink in the bar or restaurant we tried the bar on the upper floor lovely ambience and decor great service and a good live band jazz when we were there Did you know they also have a cinema there 
100591,Mondrian London, I upgraded to a river view, Friendly relaxed atmosphere clean and tidy rooms our room overlooked Blackfriars bridge and St Paul s cathedral with the Thames directly in front great location on the Southbank Great atmosphere in the bars of an evening short walk to Playhouse London Eye and Houses of Parliament 
100592,Mondrian London, The Rumpus Room was great however if they are less than 4 of you you cannot book so are not guaranteed to be able to get in , Location and the shower were great Staff made an extra effort by giving my partner a birthday gift of 2x free cocktails We only stayed for one night and I don t feel this was long enough to get a feel for the hotel and to make use of the spa facilities 
100593,Mondrian London,No Negative, Staff was amazing Room was exactly as pictured Tube was easily accessible On person in particular Luke at the concierge was extremely helpful with dinner reservations and getting us transportation It s a tad bit more expensive than a lot of hotels in London but absolutely worth every penny
100594,Mondrian London, They charge 100 p per night as a collateral you ll get it back though , Great hotel Amazing design friendly stuff great location cool and young atmosphere We loved it I would definitely come back
100595,Mondrian London, The location is not the best Although it is not far from Westminter Palace some 2 km or so and near London Eye it is very far from Oxford Street or Buckingham for example , The staff was very nice and friendly but no bonuses they will give no courtesies only exactly what you paid for so do not go thinking that you will get upgrades or breakfast for example The hotel is great and look wonderful the suite is fantastic but the hotel is far from almost everything The croissant is delicious But it is perfect if you do not mind going everywhere with a taxi or car where parking is available not that easy in London The concierge is great and helpful Would not stay again only because of the distance from the attractions shopping and so 
100596,Mondrian London, The riverside entrance seemed to have unfriendly guy on the door was told to use other entrance which was right around the front no explaination, Location ease of check in and out room was excellent comfy all the essentials Great shower
100597,Mondrian London,No Negative, Lovely check in staff made very welcome as we were 2 very tired travellers they phoned us when our room was ready allowing us a very early check in without a problem to let us recover from our journey Can t thank them enough Rooms are quirky and huge great heating air conditioning system
100598,Mondrian London, A couple of small issues like the deposit of 100 pounds per night very old school no one does it anymore the absence of slippers in the room for a hotel of this level you would expect these to find kind of comfort accessories , Loved the rooftop bar the cocktail bar and the interieur design furniture of the hotel 
100599,Mondrian London, Nothing , The hotel was excellent quality while maintaining a less formal ethos I found the staff very friendly and welcoming and the room was excellent Next time I need to stay in London I will look here first 
100600,Mondrian London, Staff acting as factory workers for a 5 star accommodation the sophistication and the full hearted presence missing, The refreshing design and the lamb to share at the restaurant 
100601,Mondrian London, The parking was very expensive in the hotel We were quoted 40 day but did get alternative parking nearby much cheaper online , We were traveling with our family who have a baby everything was supplied cot bedding etc and he even got his own little welcome pack which was a lovely little touch Reception were very accommodating and had our rooms ready even though we arrived early they let us check in Very high quality extras in room Huge television beautiful crystal glasses comfy bedding An enjoyable stay 
100602,Mondrian London,No Negative, Comfy room fantastic restaurant service was amazing we frequently stay at Morgan s Hotels this was our first time at Mondrian and it did not disappoint Highly recommend 
100603,Mondrian London, Nothing perfect , Really comfortable bed quiet room excellent quality toiletries and extras The cocktails nibbles atmosphere and views in The Rumpus Room are amazing 
100604,Mondrian London, Would be better if they had bikes to rent or even included with the room , Excellent rooms roomy with wide windows Very comfy bed Location is top notch 
100605,Mondrian London,No Negative, Shout out to Jessica on reception she did everything in her power to make our stay extra special including upgrading our room from standard to river view deluxe for free
100606,Mondrian London, The standard rooms aren t huge for the price minibar fees are greedy lifts slightly bizarre where everyone has to card swipe , This place was everything I d hoped having walked past it so many times Great lively ambiance at weekends aimed at well off twenty somethings Lots of cool extras in the room like crystal glasses huge fluffy towels etc Perfect location Sculptures in the public areas are intriguing My standard room had a view of the OXO and the modernist architecture but I d be tempted to upgrade to a Thames view next time 
100607,Mondrian London, The water pipe made a rather loud noise when turning on the hot water tap , Nice hotel very comfortable bed Our room was quite big and clean We enjoyed the water boiler and the tea bags provided 
100608,Mondrian London, 2 for a kit kat is pushing your luck It ruined her birthday when i said no , The ledge that supports the mattress is handy for banging I like the cheetah being faster Dandelyan too 
100609,Mondrian London, We were dissapointed by the spa only steam bath and no sauna at all It was also separated between men and women so not very good experience if you are in couple My main dissatisfaction concerns the front desk I forgot my credit card and even if the room was payed in advance they refused to accept us in the room if we don t leave 100 per night as deposit I know by heart the number of my credit card the security code and had my phone for the 3D security connection the room was payed with the same card on my name and I had ID with me but they insist that I should show the plastic Finally I was accepted with only 100 deposit but if I didn t have friends in London to borrow some money it could be a very poor weekend Of course it was my fault to forget my card but if I know everything by heart it could be treated as an Internet purchase and anyway treated in more friendly way , The situation and the overall design of the hotel are very good The bed is very comfortable 
100610,Mondrian London, Hotel not too flexible on early check in A strict policy of checking in after 3 pm I called the day before to request an early check in and was told by the staff I would be accommodated At my arrival the staff had no recollection of my request and I was forced to change in the spa shower before my meeting Not the service I would have expected from such a posh hotel brand , The hotel bars are amazing My favourite is the Rumpus room which has an immaculate view of the city 
100611,Mondrian London, Room too hot and not possible to turn A c down below a supposed 19 degrees Very stuffy and airless Beds are comfortable but small so if you are used to a king size or above you need to book something other than their standard room , Excellent location for Southbank venues Staff friendly and welcoming Views of the river are great 
100612,Mondrian London,No Negative, The breakfast was a good spread but the USP of this property is the location You can step straight into the Queens Walk on the South Bank of river Thames 
100613,Mondrian London,No Negative, I stay at morgans hotels all the time It s pricey but worth every single cent I feel safe comfortable and it s also hip and trendy at the same time Have no fear of the staff stealing I leave money in my room lying around and no one touches a thing Love the Mondrian and if u can manage get a deluxe river view on a high floor if possible Great hotel
100614,Mondrian London,No Negative, Everything Amazing hotel and bars great location and views attention to details The staff in helpful and professional without being too much Worth to get the breakfast in the room best pancakes ever 
100615,Mondrian London, Great hotel friendly helpful staff The only minor criticism We had to ask for a kettle and tea coffee tray to be put into our our rooms However trays were delivered immediately , We had not ordered breakfast so I don t know 
100616,Mondrian London, Nothing really London is an expensive city and the hotel is commensurate price wise So not a criticism , Spotlessly clean hotel with really wonderful staff The hotel is in an ideal location for exploring London roughly equidistant between the London Eye and The Tate Modern a leisurely 10 minute stroll East or West along the Thames in an area alive with people We decided to try breakfast on the first morning and returned each morning of our stay Excellent buffet in a well proportioned comfortable dining room The Tube station Southwark Jubilee Line is circa 500 metres behind the hotel Also Waterloo train station is only 15 minutes away So for the intrepid traveller the hotel is ideally situated to explore wherever in London and environs by Tube bus or train Waterloo Station is the departure point for the train to Hampton Court Palace if you ve the time go there its only a 35 minute ride Overall a hotel with a busy and vibrant ambience in the dining and bar areas nice and quiet in the rooms a professionally run hotel Would stay again A final thanks for the complimentary Cava on arrival in recognition of my wife s 60th birthday the reason for the trip 
100617,Mondrian London, There was a member of staff in the bar restaurant who was not so attentive and quite rude This was rectified by the manager who offered us a complimentary drink in the bar and was very apologetic , The hotel was lovely and especially enjoyed the rooftop bar The staff were friendly and helpful Although fully booked the staff in the spa were also very friendly and helpful love the look and feel of this hotel in opinion it is a hidden gem i would definitely stay again 
100618,Mondrian London, No biscuits with the tea tray and there could be a few more teabags For the cost of a room I would have thought a couple of packs of complimentary biscuits would not be too much to expect , Superbly comfortable bed and the room was extremely quiet with no noise whatsoever from the corridor or adjoining rooms I had ordered a bottle of champagne and a celebration cake to be awaiting my husband in our room upon our arrival and the hotel did not disappoint The cake was beautiful both in appearance and taste and the champagne was wonderfully chilled Everything about this hotel is special The staff could not be more helpful and friendly without being in your face The styling is wonderful and the room was luxurious We can t wait to stay again 
100619,Mondrian London, Front desk appears understaffed very cheerfully works through this Queues at check in and check out in every occasion I ve stayed here , Room well appointed Very nice staff 
100620,Mondrian London, Irritating need to use your room key to activate the lift Understandable from a security point of view but if several people get in at once not so secure anyway , Designer look throughout the hotel especially the bedroom One of the most comfortable beds we ve slept in at a hotel Two great cocktail bars
100621,Mondrian London,No Negative, Apparently 3 bar in the world Dandy Lyon and rooftop supposed to be good but closed to a private function when we were there Neat decor and branding 
100622,Mondrian London, It would have been nice to have robes in the room , The customer service provided was personal yet professional The hotel is very modern and the rooms are very nice and spacious We were visiting to celebrate my boyfriends birthday when we arrived a birthday card was provided from the staff with a complimentary round of drinks in the exceptional cocktail bar 
100623,Mondrian London,No Negative, This is now our 4th visit since opening With another stay here booked in for October this will be our City honeymoon we will have just had our church wedding a few days prior We also will be booking for another trip this Summer So that in itself is a Statment of JUST how FANTASTIC this hotel is Every visit just gets better The front desk staff are a CREDIT to Mondrian So halpful friendly The Door crew porters are always so helpful always smiling The Positives SECURE PARKING VALET PARKING WE had driven across from Switzerland location location location next to the Tate Modern Millennium Bridge St Paul s Cathedral hop skip jump to the London Eye 15 minute scenic walk to Covent Garden close to Theatre district Lyceum Theatre Taxi to Oxford Street 11 00 The Hotel It is just breath taking The detail in design is just WOW from the minute you walk through the door you feel almost like you are on a luxury liner a majestic feature awaits you FRONT DESK THe Bow of a ship you just know your going to have a majestic voyage of a stay with MONDRIAN Incredible the design little finishing touches attention to detail Outstanding we had a scenic Thames river view upgrade wine check in was simple attentive staff Our room was superb INCREDIBLE COMFY BED WIFI Lovely Shower products will provide amenity kits if needed shower cap sew kit tooth brush etc The Bar Snack section was well stocked little OVERPRICED TV superb good array of channels complimentary use of Umbrella needed in London Iron Board Dressing robes slippers The lay out of the room was lovely Tom Dixon furnishings stunning SEA CONTAINERS Breakfast is always a pleasure nice to see the waiting staff more attentive this was a breath of fresh air 
100624,Mondrian London, Planned this trip around a proposal and the hotel did not follow communications despite an email highlighting timescales and requirements E g Bottle of champagne to be in the room after 10 30pm after I have taken my girlfriend out for a meal to propose Only to find it is in there at half 6 before I have even asked her This led to complications and difficult questions from my partner where I had to lie to her to avoid ruining the surprise , Location of hotel was ideal Rooms were clean and tidy Despite the error highlighted staff were friendly and helpful 
100625,Mondrian London, The bed was quite small and the bedroom overall was slightly disappointing Some extras would not go amiss Apparently we were upgraded to a superior room suite so I cannot imagine what the standard double would be like Also the roof bar was not exclusive enough There should be a bar in which hotel guests have priority We could not secure a table or seat at the roof bar for a night time cocktail , The location the staff the cleanliness 
100626,Mondrian London, We upgraded ourselves to a suite as it was a special occasion but was disappointed to find that the shower was so weak we couldn t use it and then had to run a bath resulting in us missing breakfast , Cocktail bar was fantastic amazing staff great location arty and modern 
100627,Mondrian London, The small beds the missing bathroom extras such as slippers or small attentions chocolate fruits hand lotion The breakfast should offer more choices and fresh fruit drinks for its costs , The view The bar in 12th floor 
100628,Mondrian London, The room was very unimpressive no character and I struggle to see what makes this a 5 star The shower gel was decent but when thats what you remember as being good about the room its obviously needs some improvement Didn t particularly like the girl at reception not a great first impression which is a shame as most of the staff were very helpful , The bar restaurant was nice maybe a little over priced but the atmosphere and drinks were good and the staff were great both for breakfast and behind the bar 
100629,Mondrian London,No Negative, Two things about this property I really liked easy late checkout 2pm was offered Also breakfast was served until 11 30am on the weekend this is key for their targeted age group Right on Thames and a lovely walk to where you want to be 
100630,Mondrian London, Tea and coffee facilities in the room a bit mean not enough milk and choice of drinks and no biscuits they just want you to purchase stuff I suppose, Comfy bed and nice shower
100631,Mondrian London, Most everything was good in the hotel accept for the front of house staff The girl who checked us in was absolutely fine but another girl tall blonde rotund had the attitude of the it s not my job variety when I asked for help She wasn t at all courteous she was judgemental listened in to our conversation with the other girl on reception and flashed a look of complete arrogance whenever we looked her way Not good for a hotel which prides itself on its attitudes to the arts and artists flamboyance and self expression Mostly the rest of the hotel staff from the bellboys bar staff and services were all absolutely fine and should be congratulated for their abilities at putting up with such an incongruous person as her But we also had to speak to the concierge and it took 3 times explaining what we wanted before he even managed to look away from his computer screen Then he was miles away and barely conveyed his answer , The hotel occupies a beautiful location on the riverside with easy access to central London and beyond Westminster tube isn t far away but I think the hotel is better suited to urban explorers and taxi riders We enjoyed the cocktail bar but it was a pity that the bar upstairs was closed for renovations The open spaces and decor give the hotel a wonderful ambience and the views can be wonderful from the front and sides of the hotel The room was clean and well presented and everything how one would expect in such a hotel The bathrooms were nice and the rainforest shower a pleasure The mini bar is fabulously well stocked with everything you might need from Crystal Head Vodka and cocktails to adult toys and hangover kits 
100632,Mondrian London, The rooftop terrace was shut , The room was really quirky we both loved it The bathroom was huge as well and everything was clean The bed was comfy and a good size Dandelyan was also amazing The staff were all friendly and really helpful 
100633,Mondrian London, I didn t like that receptionist or probably costumer manager messed up a congratulations card and gave it to me instead of my girlfriend But at least we got 2 vouchers for a cocktail which was nice We also didn t like the fact that for the 5 star hotel there were no slippers and bathrobes And no one really bothered to help us with our two luggages even thou it is a 5 star hotel , It was a great location and staff was friendly Room wasn t too big but it was ok as we were walking a lot and didn t spend too much time in the room it was clean stylish We went to a bar as well and cocktails were great Dispense barber was doing a great job he even did some cocktails out of the menu for us Overall great location and great views especially at night 
100634,Mondrian London, N A, The rooms were amazing and above expectations and the staff was out of this world first time experience and would 1million come back This was for a birthday treat and they went out there way to make it a great experience for us 
100635,Mondrian London, They advertise the SPA and it seems very appealing We didn t try any of the treatments but you get access to the relaxation area and steam rooms I was actually expecting a proper SPA with sauna and jacuzzi or at least the steam rooms to be in the shared space where you could relax with your partner but it wasn t like that , The position and views are wonderful as well as the hotel decorations and standard of the rooms I like Tom Dixon 
100636,Mondrian London,No Negative, Our room had cool furnishings which were as comfy as they were good looking and a great view both day and night Cocktails in the bar are brilliant Friendly helpful staff 
100637,Mondrian London, If I have to complain about something need to extend the spa hours to 11pm , well designed rooms warm without clutter Quiet too which is all too rarely the case Good restaurant options 
100638,Mondrian London, The tea at breakfast was shocking I was given a cup out of the big jug which tasted of nothing Then I asked for a fresh cup in a pot and the waitress kindly gave me this but this was not much better Sure your tea bags are stale What do you have to do to get a decent cup of tea at breakfast , Rest of breakfast was fine if a little pricey 
100639,Mondrian London, That there wasn t a swimming pool or a jacuzzi or steam room It s a big luxury hotel and I think it s a shame they didn t put that stuff in It would if made it perfect for me if that was in it, The place is beautiful and really well presented Great food and really good staff
100640,Mondrian London, Reception staff are clearly trained to use our first names this feels disingenuous when they ve never met us before, Decor of bedroom Comfy pillows
100641,Mondrian London, Walls a little thin as it seemed very noisy early on Sunday morning Perhaps a notice for guests to respect other guests late at night early morning , A smart modern hotel All staff have a good attitude and are very approachable Great location good room service 
100642,Mondrian London, Roof top bar could have been open it is closed on a Sunday and Monday , Fabulous location excellent customer service lovely room Also great value for money my partner and I stayed on a Sunday and considering the excellent location and standard of hotel I thought that the price was excellent 
100643,Mondrian London, is perfect there is nothing wrong, the location is amazing next to the river to the tate as any morgan hotel elsewhere details are everywhere and design is outstanding and the place is amazing day and night all restaurants and bar are great and staff is awsome many thanks to lovely Zaira that got me a complementary upgrade for me and my colleagues and free drinks as it was my birthday a morgans experience with an amazing view of london
100644,Mondrian London, Nothing we really enjoyed this stay Didn t have the breakfast so can t rate that but can definitely recommend the room service we had the burger and it was very tasty , Lovely hotel beautiful room and all the hotel team were friendly and so helpful Loved the location on the South Bank and easy to get to from trains 
100645,Mondrian London, I think you need a usher in the cinema 20 minutes into the film and people were still trying to find their seats , The friendliness of the staff and such a beautiful building inside and out 
100646,Mondrian London, Very late getting our room when checking in breakfast was expensive mini bar was also expensive We also ordered 4 bar meals which unfortunately did not all arrive together in fact one meal was a good 30 40 mins after the first meal came , The staff were very polite The location was excellent Rooms were very clean 
100647,Mondrian London, The acoustics and level of noise during dinner in the restaurant made it difficult to converse with the waiter or have a conversation with friends It wasn t a relaxing experience The dinner menu didn t suit us as we found it difficult to find side dishes that went well with the main courses The price of drinks was very high We expect cocktails to be pricey but not simple drinks like lager served in a can with an accompanying glass , The breakfast buffet was excellent It was very quiet in our room so we had undisturbed sleep We liked being able to see the river and surrounding area from our room and from the restaurant and bar People watching potential was brilliant 
100648,Mondrian London, 5 property no clue why I am given a room with shower Next I will go to IBIS First time I stayed tried the breakfast found inispiring I had to ask for a luggage rack No cotton buds in the bathroom The A C is noisy Bathroom floor not heated and when you go out of the shower you freeze I arrived on Valentine s day and I wanted to have some dinner No restaurant was serving non Valentines dinner I assume all the hotel guests were on romantic trips I ordered from the room service which appeared to be uncoordinated I asked for bread Bread did not arrive and when I asked the delivery lady she said she does not know as she came from outside The prawns were frozen not fresh and I say thank God I am alive as the chips were so salty my blood pressure hit the roof probably that night When I called to inform them that I had finished I was asked to take the trolley table outside the room yes Mam Sorry I thought I was a guest , For London standards the room size is comfortable the amenities are nice The location is convenient for three tube lines The concierge team is great 
100649,Mondrian London, It took 15 minutes to check in I asked for my invoice to be emailed to me it hasn t been The superior room which I stayed in was very ordinary and there are much better hotel rooms in similar areas for half the price Overall a very ordinary hotel for extraordinary prices , Nice decor
100650,Mondrian London, Overrated Cocktail bar wouldn t be that bothered if I never went back Nice views of a building site Totally ignored special requests Sanderson is far superior in terms of room the great purple room bar , Alcove bar in the rooms was a nice touch Shower room was great Clean Bed wasn t particularly comfortable though Pillows were too big so had to throw one off the bed in case I woke up with a sore neck 
100651,Mondrian London,No Negative, The Morgan Hotel has a great location 15 min walking to the Big Ben 30 min walking to the Tower Bridge 5 min walking to the Blackfriar station It has a modern design from the lobby area to the rooms The shower is great I absolutely love it I told Charlotte one of the reception staff that is our anniversary and we got a complementary card with a few free things from which we could ve choose 
100652,Mondrian London, Booked this for my partner for his birthday however the fire alarm went off and got evacuated from the hotel for two hours which resulted in us not being able to go to the restaurant I booked and the comedy club as we missed our time slot Very disappointed and lost my money, The hotel
100653,Mondrian London, The multi media didn t work in the bedroom and the shower in the room was quite poor , The steam which was within the spa was very good bed was comfortable and the room was very modern and clean
100654,Mondrian London,No Negative, We were staying for my partners birthday and the staff made sure that it was memorable and special in every way The hotel itself is perfectly placed on the South Bank to explore London or just take in the cultural side of London with the Tate Modern just a short walk away and the Shard also a 10 15 min walk I cannot fault this hotel in any way and would highly recommend it 
100655,Mondrian London, Expensive rooms upgraded on arrival as they said our room was not ready We were told it was 40 per night on top in total but they added vat onto that as well when we checked out , View over the river Loved the south bank area 
100656,Mondrian London, Requested twin beds which we were told is not possible After half hour of discussions we paid for an upgrade to a room with an additional bed When returned from our event at midnight we found we had not been given the upgraded room so then spent a further 45 mins at reception attempting to sort it only to be told the upgrade was 50 more expensive than we had been told in the afternoon All in all thoroughly disappointed with the service and attitude of staff , Location of the hotel
100657,Mondrian London, Breakfast and mini bar was very over priced, Bed was comfy tv was extremely impressive on a rotatable bracket glassware was lovely location was fantastic
100658,Mondrian London,No Negative, So funky The reception is a magnificent sculptural work in itself quite apart from the other great sculptures dotted around Location is fantastic with magnificent views even from the ground floor bar lounge Booked well in advance and got a really good deal 
100659,Mondrian London,No Negative, Unfortunately service isn t good at the Mondrian When I arrived the driver was about to drop me in front of the hotel when some guy supposedly from the hotel told him he volent stop there So he dropped me further away under the rain No one was there either to help me with my luggage There is no la carte breakfast but only a buffet that isn t very good No bathrobe slippers nor cotton buds or cotton pads in the bathroom A vulgar sticky plastic shower curtain in the Bathroom No turndown service either of course These are certainly not up to the 5 stars standards the hotel is supposed to be Though the view on the Thames from the restaurant is nice and it s close to the Tate modern 
100660,Mondrian London, Breakfast is not something we expected , Good location just by the Thames View is not good as expected but this might be because we stayed at a low level 
100661,Mondrian London, Unfortunately the roof top bar terrace was closed so did not see the lovely views everyone spoke about , Although room was small it was comfortable and very clean Shower was a bit noisy But bathroom was lovely The cocktail bar was fabulous Loved the ambience of the hotel 
100662,Mondrian London, Nothing I can think of 5 stars top to bottom , Staff was above and beyond from the maid service to the front desk to the Rumpus Room Overall best hotel I ve stayed at in the UK or US Everyone was very friendly and happy to help The Rumpus Room was incredible special shout outs to Bree and Stevie for being wonderful and charming The bartenders were outstanding two were particularly superb Brian and the Italian gentleman who had helpful advice on drinks and also excellent conversation Proximity to public transportation and location in general cannot be beat 
100663,Mondrian London, The only minor comments I have are as follows 1 there s no pool in the spa 2 my friend and I wanted breakfast on the last day which we didn t prepay for as we had brunch and other things planned so didn t need it both days When we got to the restaurant they said the only option was the pay 20 for a continental breakfast So that was annoying as I m sure last time I stayed there there were a la carte options Anyway we left and went elsewhere , Friendly and helpful staff food in the restaurant was excellent lovely room with comfy bed Loved my pedicure with Fiona my friend and I said it was the best manicure and pedicure we d had 
100664,Mondrian London, The hotel took 100 for each day we were there which was then refunded upon departure I would rather they didn t , The hotel aesthetic is striking the staff were helpful and the location is perfect The room was exceptionally clean with a modern design and the view was stunning 
100665,Mondrian London,No Negative, Fantastic service We were staying for part of our honeymoon and we received an upgraded room on the top floor and a free bottle of bubbly in the room Lovely 
100666,Mondrian London, Saturday night in the Rumpus Room unable to get a seat as the place was rammed full of youngsters enjoying the DJ and music etc Which is fine of course but could there not be an area for residents set aside as I m fairly certain not all of them were staying at the hotel , Amazing location on the bank of the Thames South Bank so near to the London Eye and a short stroll or tube journey away from other central London attractions like Westminster St Paul s Covent Garden etc Fantastic boutique hotel with excellent dining facilities and rooms Staff are great very friendly and helpful Tube stations close by Loved it and will be back to try their incredible looking afternoon tea 
100667,Mondrian London, After spending 450 for room we couldn t get to sit down in the bar and was ask to get up when we sat down You have to book seats but was misinformed when we emailed to ask about the seating We also had a opportunity to book upstairs bar but was again misinformed and we didn t book ahead Apart from that lovely location but not worth the money for room ,No Positive
100668,Mondrian London, The price for the new years room with the view exorbitant I thought , Loved the location The rooms were really luxurious Thank you mostly for the fully loaded grab and go breakfast 
100669,Mondrian London, Sadly the guests who frequent are loud and obnoxious types We did not sleep our first of 3 nights due to a hip hop party that led to many guests partying in the hallway we were on the top floor I went out of my room twice between 1 and 3am to tell them to be quiet no one answered at the front desk The 3rd night we didn t sleep as there was some constant machine noise that went on all night Again calls to the front desk went unanswered It was a pity because the rooms and the restaurant staff were amazing , Great decor Excellent service 
100670,Mondrian London,No Negative, Lovely hotel The staff were excellent very professional but friendly too Location first class so close to everything Definitely stay here again 
100671,Mondrian London, I have a walking disability and the staff were very helpful They did not have a wheelchair I could borrow Many European hotels offer this service for free I don t always require a wheelchair and find it useful not to have to travel with one if the hotel can provide one Cities where hotels offer this include Berlin Amsterdam Stockholm Alicante Brugge No hotel in London has ever offered it The only other capital is Copenhagen where I ve not been able to borrow a chair , Excellent location
100672,Mondrian London, as we got our stay at a great rate i shouldn t really complain but room service for brekky was very steep, My partner was sick so we made the most of the steam room male is separate from female but it was by far the best steam room i have been into infused with eucalyptus
100673,Mondrian London, Nothing to say here, Everything wasn t great views of London from room balcony service of staff cleanliness the whole experience was made easy and nothing was a hassle at all
100674,Mondrian London, i have no complaints, everthing the decore the staff the service most imprtantly the staff where happy to help and very accomidating I felt very taken care of and would happily return in the near future
100675,Mondrian London, Asked for bottle of Chardonnay 25 got sent Chablis 79 within 2 minutes of ordering this got prospected for dinner Intimacy kit opened before we stayed not by us and left all over the mini bar Staff a little unhelpful in some circumstances Didn t feel very cared about , Stylish clean amazing building and interior Good check out time Helpful with luggage 
100676,Mondrian London, Double charged for room as booking com had failed to cancel previous reservation and had not updated the hotel on current reservation, The staff were very friendly and helpful 
100677,Mondrian London,No Negative, The beds are fabulous and the bathroom items really premium The main public lounges and entrance lobby of the hotel are innovative and distinctive 
100678,Mondrian London, As with all London Hotels can be expensive no matter the time of year, Spectacular and arty reception riveted copper sheeting and art installations Rooms onto the Thames had spectacular views Cold snowy night but the hotel was toasty 5 minute walk to Southwark Jubilee Line 2 mins to Blackfriars Bridge Union St restaurants bars round the corner
100679,Mondrian London, The bar on night is very busy and even if you are staying at the hotel it might be difficult to get a table , Very nice location and very beautiful astmosphere and decoration The coctail bar is really nice and the coctail fantastic We really enjoyed the hotel The concierge service has been very hepfull and really charming 
100680,Mondrian London, The fact that the bar and meal tabs had an auto service charge of 12 5 applied to them plus space for adding an extra gratuity creates an opportunity for inadvertently over tipping , The perfect location for exploring and enjoying all that London s Southbank area has to offer The friendliness and professionalism of all the staff was evident throughout from those on reception to the bar restaurant staff and the ladies who serviced our room 
100681,Mondrian London, Breakfast for 23 I didn t even go there , Superb location just across from the Thames I walked to a meeting just about 1 8 miles away Great places nearby 
100682,Mondrian London, Offered a free drink at the bar in the restaurant All very awkward in there Staff questioned us on arrival accepted we just wanted a drink 4 30 in the afternoon so no diners there or expected as far as we could see Sat at the bar and ordered drinks free meant only house wine or Heineken not a lager drinker wine was fine but disappointed at limitation of offer Saw a table near window bar stools high for us 60 year olds and got off bar stool to go there immediately questioned by staff about what our plans were Did escort us to table another member of staff asked if we were eating Then half way through glass of wine another asked if we would like some desserts then cleared the table of cutlery etc All of this just made us slightly uncomfortable the plan was to think about what we were going to do as we had just arrived in London and at the hotel whilst we had a couple of drinks But the atmosphere didn t make us feel welcome so walked to another bar for cocktails and ate elsewhere Shame as in every other area of hotel the staff were extremely helpful Bar Restaurant staff were very polite in all their enquiries but made us feel like we shouldn t be there so free drinks we re not as pleasurable as hoped , Staff at reception and around hotel were extremely helpful welcoming and friendly but note staff in bar restaurant comment Good position on South bank 
100683,Mondrian London, Would have liked decaf tea bags in room when requested delivered at once , Lovely decor in room Staff could not have done more Atmosphere in hotel was amazing 
100684,Mondrian London, As much as I like the stylishness I am a bit of a classical fan and prefer in general more ornate settings having said that it s not going to stop me from staying here again , So much is great with this hotel where to start Staff are hugely accommodating helpful and friendly this is from interaction with reception restaurant both dinner and breakfast and the spa It s clean stylish roomy in a great location and very comfortable I upgraded to a Thames view room which I didn t regret and even left the curtains open so that when I nipped to the loo during the night and woke up in the morning I could see what was going on on the river you can dim all the lights and just have a lulling glow from outside come in if that doesn t put you off sleeping I also stayed in December when it s still quite dark on a morning and it wasn t invasive I couldn t hear anything either excellent soundproofing The spa is fantastic I m a big fan of spa hotels my favourite to date being the Corinthia in Budapest but this one comes in a very close second really appealing to all my senses It s wonderfully spacious beautifully decorated has very helpful staff and lovely treatments Food at the restaurant is innovative and delicious i m choosing more and more veggie options these days and decided on 3 small starters as a kind of tapas style meal fried brussel sprouts raw sliced mushrooms with truffle oil grated cheese and pine nuts yum and mac and cheese with truffle which was absolutely delicious The location is great on the river just next to Blackfriars bridge so really central for getting around 
100685,Mondrian London, I would prefer to put down a deposit to then use it to pay for any other services with the hotel e g spa and restaurant , I really like the theme of the hotel and I like how modern it is 
100686,Mondrian London, nothing love it have check the official website and will try the others in the future , not far from london eye by walking very stylish hotel upgrade to the revier view room and I think it s worth to pay housekeeping very good 
100687,Mondrian London, Cold water off milk in room and when complained reception still charged me 19 for half a lager and small glass of wine No good will gesture seems to be all about how much they can get from you once you re there Selling a different room for an extra 80 in front of my partner can feel a little uncomfortable and puts you in a position of being a cheap skate after paying 150 already for a room only , Bar on 12 floor
100688,Mondrian London, Room was a bit shabby hairs on chair sink was dirty Reception staff were not very helpful Guests in room opposite decided to have an all night party and had people coming and going all night An expensive stay for a view of a building site Would say it s a hotel for younger people who have lots of money and don t need much sleep , Good location Dandelyn bar was amazing x
100689,Mondrian London, The room was not great for money there are much nicer hotel in London for money they charge would not recommend, The staff were very friendly and the food was excellent
100690,Mondrian London, Kindly remove Mughal Chicken Curry and Spicy Buffalo Chicken Wings from the room service menu Those two dishes are inedible worst the pub food and worst than food court shopping centre food 5 Star hotels should not serve such meals Review your meals just because you have been serving them for years and no one complained does not mean they are actually satisfactory meals Or no one complained cause no one ordered them ever before From a Foodie June Enuj, I love the bed the 4 pillows Sea Container was delish Dandelyan was great Drinks at the Rumpus are fantastic And the views of the location is amazeballs 
100691,Mondrian London, A bit sparse Not a luxurious 5 star, Centrally located for the city Modern unusual staff approach Not a negative though Very good for business use
100692,Mondrian London, For the price the room was good but not exceptional Maybe it was it was a standard rather than any upgrade room, Location and Style of the overall hotel was excellent
100693,Mondrian London, some unpleasant staff with no savoir faire without sense of how to take care a guest just pushing to bill more , perfect location high standard on all services
100694,Mondrian London, I felt the bars lacked a little bit of atmosphere when we visited and the drinks seemed pricey but maybe that is London , Fantastic position well appointed Hotel very clean and smart as you would expect We had the Deluxe Double room with river view which had a wonderful panoramic view over the river and the city including St Pauls Cathedral We only ate in the hotel once the service was swift and the food was great and good value for money 
100695,Mondrian London, It s a five star hotel and well priced for that but you don t feel very special for the pampering you need to up the ante in London and the cost of course I thought the wine list prices were out of control in the restaurant where s the need in that We spent literally hundreds of pounds between the cocktail bar and the restaurant and I m not sure it was worth it To get their star rating they must have ticked all the right boxes but the room my room was quite compact there was no bath and it felt very spare and I don t accept this passes for minimalist design I doubt I would go back but would look for something else in the price range and see My score comes out at 8 3 and that was boosted by the good score for the staff who I thought were excellent here but which only impact my choice to return a little This means according to my own rules it s out of the running as I tend to go for 8 5 and above Does it deserve superb 9 1 not on my card , The location was great if you want the South bank Easy walk to Tate modern and Borough market to the East Southwark tube is fast and well connected and you can even walk to Waterloo station if you re travelling light The Rumpus cocktail bar on the 12th was fun one assumes the bill one runs up is par for the course in London Drinks come in around 10 a pop and a plate of finger bites were 25 which I thought a tad over priced There was a good spread for breakfast and a decent a la carte featuring eggs benedict et al though the price comes in pretty close 22 so it s probably worth including breakfast if you have a big appetite Sitting next to the windows on a wintry day with St Pauls across the water was a great way to start the day for sure The staff are all very good looking and debonair polite and on the ball and it has a bit of buzz to the place that reminds me of the days it all kicked off in L A in the nineties I m not sure anything in London has that buzz anymore and the Rumpus is not the Star Bar but they re having a go at making it feel like something is going on 
100696,Mondrian London, Breakfast was luke warm should have been included in price Hotel was certainty cashing in on price for location and New Year Mattress too hard, Location Ambience clean and modern interiors Staff very helpful and welcoming
100697,Mondrian London, Family visiting from abroad we decided to stay in this over priced hotel for one reason only the rooftop bar so that we could watch the new year fireworks When I booked the hotel there was no mention that we would need to buy tickets to be allowed in a bar in the very hotel we paid to stay This is a complete rip off I booked to stay in the hotel and never received an email informing of this otherwise I would have cancelled our stay and chose to stay somewhere much cheaper and bought separate tickets to the fireworks We were deprived of this once in a lifetime experience because we only found out the day we checked in and all tickets were sold out We were told it was advertised on their website after I had made my booking I had no reason to go on their website so I did not see the information about the rooftop bar Had we known this we would have stayed elsewhere Advertising the rooftop bar as a guest facility without informing every person who booked to stay on the 31st December that we would have to buy tickets for the event was false advertising We were not the only guests who felt robbed , Stunning rooms Beautiful hotel Lucia the receptionist was excellent The staff in the den were a bit frosty 
100698,Mondrian London, The fact we couldn t use the roof top bar was told had to have tickets to use but was sold out we wasn t informed on booking hotel we had to book tickets we really wanted to go there to bring New Year s Eve in so was very disappointed, The view from room was excellent and staff were fantastic very helpful 
100699,Mondrian London, Ordinarily the view would have been amazing however i felt we were over charged for a NYE stay and rooftop bar table considering from this hotel you cannot see the fireworks display at all , I love this hotel The rooms are really modern clean and classy i love the crystal glasses by the mini bar The minibar has everything that you would want not like your usual minibr it has chocolate bars breakfast bars red bull coke lemonade cocktails etc etc We visited Rumpus Rooms during our stay at it was a really good night table service was amazing even despite it being NYE 
100700,Mondrian London, There was a group of 4 of us We booked his beautiful hotel for a night to remember and it was certainly that It was hell We had booked it after viewing the beautiful bars but sadly they allowed non residents into the bad done at a 50 charge and they were all fully booked So despite being residents and spending a fortune we were not allowed entry The rude manager said we had the choice of sitting in our car or bedroom as our done wasnot until 9 15 and g bad were books from 4pm , Beautifully situated 
100701,Mondrian London, no complains , In the reception a guy from Romania was very kind and helpful quite different from the spanish guy Also the staff from the bar was very attentive 
100702,Mondrian London, See above Bad value for thames view very poor they said it was 100 extra but didn t say that this didn t include any the vat, Place was great upgraded from a standard to the next up to get a river view it was poor for wha you got We had the side of a building and the Thames Wouldn t have done this if I d known bad value for money Loved the hotel location though awesome place
100703,Mondrian London,No Negative, The room was spacious even for a standard it also included hair dryer and iron which was handy The staff are brilliant they could not do more for you All round great stay Hotel is a 5 min walk to a tube station and 10 min tube ride to city centre which was very handy The roof top bar was also amazing Loved our stay would book here again 
100704,Mondrian London, Nothing to dislike, Superbly decorated excellent collection of bars and restaurants first class friendly service a pleasure to stay here Worth every penny 
100705,Mondrian London, While having shower loud noise guests slammed doors at night can be heard in the room Air conditioning at night cuts off on its own became really stuffy hot so couldn t sleep well ,No Positive
100706,Mondrian London, the guests on the 5th floor who thought it was a good idea to keep in and out of the rooms all nightuntil the early hours of friday morning until security intervened Thanks for ruining a special occasion, Hotel and staff were really pleasant and helpful
100707,Mondrian London, The only amenity that would have made the stay more luxurious would have been an indoor pool to compliment the spa facilities but this is really reaching as the stay was incredible regardless , The restaurant cocktail bar and rumpus room were outstanding The location was to die for and the staff gave us a complimentary upgrade to a larger room with a stunning view 
100708,Mondrian London, See above, Loved everything except the Dandelyan Bar on the 19th Dec my birthday The service was shocking The poor new doorman tried his hardest to accommodate us but the bearded guy was so rude and dismissive Nonetheless we understood the bar was full so we walked away and got incredible service at OXO Returned to Dandelyan much later Lovely new doorman was so happy to see us back We got seated sat for over half an hour didn t get served even though it was no longer busy so we left Happy birthday me All the staff except new doorman in Dandelyan were rubbish Staff on the 20th Dec in the Rumpus room were amazing Reception housekeeping etc all great The Dandelyan lets you down massively 
100709,Mondrian London, River view only available if you re staying in the top tier of rooms Minor gripe as the view from the superior room was still excellent , Best bed I ve ever slept in Great facilities restaurant bar spa and cinema all on site Loved the style and decor 
100710,Mondrian London, View wasn t accurate to photo provided set further back from the river construction buildings in front of us No bathrobes supplied as requested, Lovely interior and comfy bed Good lighting arrangements Lovely staff
100711,Mondrian London, Said swimming pool on booking com this doesn t have a pool Spa is always overbooked Rooftop bar doesn t open Sunday Mondays and this was the day I booked and I wasn t informed this was the case , Friendly staff Nice modern rooms very clean 
100712,Mondrian London, Guests should have reserved area in Rumpus Room left to feel like 2nd class citizen when we were paying top dollar to stay in hotel, Bedroom excellent staff exceptional
100713,Mondrian London,No Negative, Check in staff v friendly Lovely toiletries in the bathroom Attention to detail excellent fluffy towels high quality bed linens and courtesy tablet was a welcome extra Restaurant great if a tad expensive 
100714,Mondrian London, Nothing not to like about the hotel but it was a bit hard to get to in the car due to the traffic problems in that area but once we d worked out a few back roads it was fine and there is a good priced car park nearby where we left the car overnight , Friendly staff really clean and comfortable spacious twin room with a double bed each modern without being sterile amazing view over the river good food in the restaurant 
100715,Mondrian London,No Negative, Lovely hotel We stayed here for our works xmas party and I would definitely stay here again when visiting London The roof top bar was an extra surprise Expensive but the views were worth it 
100716,Mondrian London, appalling service 2 rooms not ready by 5 15 pm even though check in was 3 00 pm upstairs bar not available in evening and downstairs bar heaving so no room check in itself took over 20 minutes steam room disgusting the worst council pool facility is better a true disgrace when raised gently with staff they simply said next time I book I should let them know in advance what planet are they from why would I ever book again , excellent food
100717,Mondrian London, A bit too expensive , The location ambience views rooms service the rooftop bar the Dandelyan bar the breakfast buffet the proximity to the city 
100718,Mondrian London, There was no room in either bar to sit for a pre dinner drink you need to book if you want a seat Food was average for the price not exceptional , Very attentive staff great location quiet rooms great attention to detail 
100719,Mondrian London, A shower cap , The bedroom with its modern interior was calming and comfortable Bed very comfy Fantastic shower in good sized bathroom Steam room and relaxation room an added bonus Great to unwind after a busy day Ambiance of public areas Location superb 
100720,Mondrian London, Our room was nice but there was a lot of building work opposite so was a little noisy , Breakfast was nice though a little overpriced for what is basically a continental 
100721,Mondrian London, We booked an outdoor terrace which made it much more expensive and found it quite bare to be honest with no lights or candles so we didn t really use it in the end, The hotel is beautiful and it smells amazing Food and cocktails were unreal in the Sea Containers and our waiter Alex could not have been more helpful he even filleted our fish for us Would highly recommend for a trip to London great location
100722,Mondrian London, I only didn t like the fact that the place is pretty far away from all major sports and then the when District and Circle Line is close you have to bestially take a taxi or walk It wasn t huge problem for me as I love to walk in London but with cold weather it might be annoying Still I understand that this is not the hotel downside The hotel itself is ideal , It s perfect in every inch The breakfast is just pure bliss and the restaurants and bars are just to die for Definitely one of the best in London 
100723,Mondrian London,No Negative, I cannot fault The Mondrian The staff were fantastic the room was amazing location is great and overall there is nothing bad I can say Thank you for making my stay such a memorable one I cannot wait to come back 
100724,Mondrian London, The view from the room was facing council houses , Staff were attentive and extremely polite and welcoming Bedrooms were spacious and had everything you needed 
100725,Mondrian London, should be able to walk into hotel bars without getting the grumpy have you booked discussion , staff very welcoming although less so at the top bar
100726,Mondrian London, Breakfast on the Sunday morning seemed like a bit of a zoo and affected overall service Not sure I would have been too thrilled to have paid 25 head for that, Great room decor overall a very stylish hotel with a great overall vibe Nice touch to add in 2 free cocktails for us the rooftop bar is fantastic Dining area and public areas very appealing and location on the river with view back over the Thames is great 
100727,Mondrian London, The service the hotel felt like a 4 star business impersonal at best hence very overpriced for what it offers, suprisingly comfy bed nd sheets great location
100728,Mondrian London, Slow checkout and bag drop at concierge but it was 12 noon checkout time so don t let that put you off, Stylish room not too small like some London standard rooms Generous sized tubes of Malin Goetz toiletries Beautifully designed open lounging spaces on ground floor all wood velvet and good lighting very relaxing Great location
100729,Mondrian London, I found the choice of food at the restaurant a little restricted , Excellent location The upstairs bar was great Staff was very professional and provided very good service 
100730,Mondrian London, The restaurant was very busy and very noisy a bit chaotic and service erratic but food very good We were disappointed not to get into the rooftop bar , The location was perfect we loved the river walk The room was great we booked a deluxe room with a river view as it was a special occasion We enjoyed the complimentary bottle of prosecco for celebratory b day 
100731,Mondrian London, My room is not facing the river of course it s because of price too popular maybe everywhere is quite busy, Design is incredible very nice view from the roof bar Excellent cocktail along the river Breakfast with a window seat is perfect Will definitely come back again 
100732,Mondrian London,No Negative, I have stayed at The Mondrian on many occasions each time it s areal pleasure to return It really is a first class hotel cocktails at Dandelion are highly recommended 
100733,Mondrian London, There was no water for shower at night The concierge said they were fixing it and she sounded like it was normal The concierge is also rather unprofessional and refused to show me the bars and rooms there were closed in the day stating that they were booked It is only when i insisted that she asked the sales manager to show me around The tour took only 10mins and the rooms were all unoccupied I am surprised the service quality is this poor , Cool interior design 
100734,Mondrian London, well the design is dated by 10 years at least the ubiquitous Tom Dixon , the smell of my usual hotel in Miami Delano and a lovely brand of toiletries Malin Goetz and one of the best benedict eggs
100735,Mondrian London, Disappointed that the bar areas were hard to access seating was left empty for reserved parties even though there was no notice we were asked to move to the bar which was not possible as that too was overcrowded So went to local public house , Wonderful location and smart interior
100736,Mondrian London, Had to call housekeeping as we didn t have any robes or slippers in our room but they brought them up very quickly once informed , Great welcome room was ready before official check in time which was very handy Informed them when booking that we were celebrating a special birthday came back from a trip to the bar to find a complimentary bottle of wine in our room We had a great view towards the city and river on the east side 
100737,Mondrian London, A little over priced but we had a good deal at Booking com The room was a little small but we didn t spend much time in there But the d cor and cleanliness was great Bar prices are hefty but many alternatives are close by , The staff were extremely friendly and helpful We had a small problem checking in as the computer could not initially find the reservation Stephan soon rectified the problem and we were given a free drink each as an apology A very nice touch The location of the hotel is excellent
100738,Mondrian London, Breakfast was almost finished 11 15 so not so good Probably should have gone earlier or waited for brunch at 12 noon , All the extra luxury touches in the room great staff
100739,Mondrian London, Expensive overall Breakfast was too much additional that we didn t bother , Modern rooms very luxurious bed and bathroom Quiet despite central location 
100740,Mondrian London,No Negative, Really friendly and attentive staff Loved the beautiful decor and the view of the Thames from our room The cocktails at the Dandelyan were great the food at Sea containers really nice and they catered to all my dietary requests without any issues The view from the rooftop bar was stunning as well All in all we had an amazing stay 
100741,Mondrian London, We were going to meet friends in the rumpus room but we re told on arrival it was shut so we arranged to meet in the dandelion bar but had trouble getting in so went out for the evening on returning we tried to get in the dandelion again only to be told they had called last orders 1 30 on a Saturday night bit disappointed all round , Lovely hotel
100742,Mondrian London, Didn t like anything it was five stars all the wall Thames view deluxe room, Hotel was fantastic Location was fab right on the Thames if you want luxury and five star luxury this is the hotel
100743,Mondrian London, Didn t book first 3 nights in London in this place , Ambience of place Rooms very comfortable with good lighting Modern hip hotel with great restaurant for breakfast lunch and dinner must do Sunday roast Great trendy bar with amazing cocktails as well Worth shopping around to get a good rate 
100744,Mondrian London, I wish the rooms were a little cheaper so I could stay more often but worth every penny , I ve walked past this hotel hundreds of times and always wanted to stay Had the best 21st birthday and it completely lived up to my expectations and exceeded them Room view and standards were excellent and staff were so lovely The food was GREAT Possibly the best hotel experience I ve had 
100745,Mondrian London,No Negative, Decor comfy bed style of room and facilities Staff were efficient a friendly Also treated us to two complimentary cocktails as it was my fiances birthday Couldnt recommend highly enough
100746,Mondrian London, I don t actually think there was anything we complained about or any niggling factor We just wished we had stayed longer , The concierge were lovely helpful and very apologetic when our room wasn t ready We were given a better room than expected and a complimentary drink to boot The room was perfect Many hotels have beautiful rooms that just aren t that functional This was was so homely and we personally were taking note for our own home redesign The view is amazing over the river Products in the bathroom were grade A Overall great experience and loved the location 
100747,Mondrian London, Cost of breakfast but it does seem to be in the same region as other hotels the prices do nothing to encourage people to eat at the Hotels , Really comfortable well equipt room
100748,Mondrian London, High on design low on substance Room had not been cleaned properly and the toileteries had been opened No tea or coffee making Frankly go to a premier Inn much better rooms and better staff training , The location suited us as we were meeting friends The staff were friendly enough but someone obviously thinks casuall scruff is hip it is not They need to smarten up 
100749,Mondrian London, STAFF AT RECEPTION SEEM TO BE FULL OF TRAINEES IT SEEMS THEY HAVE A CONCIERGE SERVICE NOBODY INFORMED ME ABOUT IT NO INFORMATION IS PROVIDED BY STAFF ABOUT THE FACILITIES THE HOTEL HAS I HAD TO WAIT A LONG TIME TO GET MY ROOM AND IT THEN TURNED OUT THAT THE ROOM WOULDN T BE AVAILABLE SO THEY HAD TO GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE UNTIL LATER WRONG INFORMATION PROVIDED BY RECEPTION STAFF I HAD THE WINDOW CLEANERS APPEARING IN THE WINDOW IN THE MORNING WHILE DRESSING UP, LOCATION
100750,Mondrian London, Not allowed to park the car yourself and no parking really close hotel guests have no priority at all on the restaurants and bars and on the top bar we were asked to move from sofas even when they were empty as they take them all as reserved but restaurant and bar of the hotel are still very nice No real spa or swimming pool as some internet pictures would suggest, Beautiful room view and room equipment
100751,Mondrian London,No Negative, Situated on the banks of River Thames with views of St Pauls Cathedral Great situation with good travel links to all the sights Very modern and trendy hotel 
100752,Mondrian London, Had an upgrade for city views at a price and wasn t worth it the extra Could just about sea a few building tops and a great big office block being built , Great location clean and tidy staff were top notch Wish I could of stopped longer to do more in the hotel 
100753,Mondrian London, Corridors are somewhat stark Long and grey with endless identical doors I know hotels are a bit like that but you would expect a little more effort to set the mood WiFi is terribly slow Presumably this is intentional because they sell a premium WiFi product Seems a bit cheap , Wonderful location next to the river Great area with fun places like the South Bank and Borough Market just five or ten minutes walk away The public spaces are stunning and bizarre I particularly like the yellow submarine in the restaurant Dandelyon the cocktail bar next door is just remarkable Sit at the bar and chat to the bartenders Masters of their art 
100754,Mondrian London, We booked specifically for a spa weekend but there was no pool and the steam room is separated for men and women so we didn t get to go in togather Disappointing , Overall experience was lovely 
100755,Mondrian London, Hot food at breakfast buffet wasn t hot and plates were cold which didn t help Only one complimentary bottle of water per room was rather mean in a double occupancy room , Style and decor fabulous Location wonderful especially a River View room Staff were helpful and friendly Enormous beds so comfy Great choice of good at buffet for breakfast and waitress could not have been more lovely 
100756,Mondrian London, Nothing major just a shame that at this level a bathrobe and slippers aren t already in the room and you have to ask for it This is just a tiny remark as our stay in this hotel was amazing, Great views Amazing bars Rumpus for views Dandelyan for the cocktails Decoration Room Cleanliness Friendly staff
100757,Mondrian London, Room service food service was poor Took 1hr 40minutes to arrive Rumpus room bar charging wrong price for champagne and then took 15 minutes to check this as we was leaving, Beds very comfy Atmosphere
100758,Mondrian London, Location for me was not great Being a solo woman traveller of more advanced years I found the hotel a bit too far out of central London and a little quirky and modern for my tastes but I m sure that younger people would love it , Room was very comfortable and quiet Staff were very friendly and helpful 
100759,Mondrian London,No Negative, The food was amazing Ordered roomservice every day The rooftop bar was so much fun too i celebrated my bday there the staff is so nice Can t wait to go back
100760,Mondrian London, It s a big hotel and was busy on a Saturday night so the staff were busy and the service was cold The room had some poor finishing to it radiator cover and light switches broken No bath robes or slippers Very expensive for what we got compared to other 5 star hotels, Great location on southbank The restaurant is also superb The room had some good touches and looked cool Comfy bed and good bathroom shower
100761,Mondrian London, Too much canned pop music everywhere why needed in lifts probably wrong age group for this Poor selection of teas other beveridges in room Probably aimed at a younger age bracket but as it is AI convenient for RFH NFI National Theatre and Tate Modern all in a short walk seems to be missing out on an older generation who tend to be heavy users of these places , Brilliant location Superb views Very comfortable Very convenient for South Bank
100762,Mondrian London, That my card had to be shown upon arrival as it was booked as a present and I was not going myself , Booked for my mums 50th couldn t have asked for better service 
100763,Mondrian London,No Negative, We wouldn t normally stay at the Mondrian but we were returning to town Saturday evening from visiting friends up North and figured we d pop into the nearby Tate Modern which is open late on Fridays and Saturdays The Mondrian public spaces were throbbing with music and very attractive hip people We found a quiet ish corner at the bar in the Sea Containers restaurant where everyone doted upon us We were eventually owned by Monika a fabulous bartender from Hungary Had a delicious meal and wonderful service 
100764,Mondrian London,No Negative, Lovely hotel Great location chic stylish decor Excellent accommodating staff Loved the handwritten note wishing my husband a happy birthday with a voucher for a round of drinks on the house 10 10 
100765,Mondrian London,No Negative, Concept style ambiance friendliness of staff especially Yulia super lux but also cool and edgy Walking distance to Tate modern which was great beautiful views
100766,Mondrian London, The lobby sometimes gets crowded with people who want to visit the rooftop bar and they are stumbling around and can be quite rood to residents of the hotel I think the bar should have a separate lift or it should be managed a bit better High speed internet was really expensive given how much I was already paying for staying here I think it should be complimentary at least with some rooms The remote controls were not working properly and although I asked for a new one it still kept playing up sometimes , Amazing location the rooms are elegant yet very relaxing the whole place has a very good vibe The staff is friendly and genuinely interested in making sure your stay is as good as possible The room was amazing really comfortable and had everything and more I needed Having a terrace looking out on the river made it special and it s a really nice touch and a really rare thing in London Although it s very central and the river gets really busy and the room looked out to Blackfriars Bridge the soundproofing was good enough so the room wasn t noisy at all The complimentary newspaper was a nice touch 
100767,Mondrian London,No Negative, The receptionist upgraded our room and sent up bubbly when told we were celebrating a special occasion We loved the room and the views of London s river side and St Paul s
100768,Mondrian London, Reception service was beyond poor for what you expect at a 5 hotel Both at check in and check out the large reception desk was attended by only two receptionists both serving the same client I had to wait for nearly 10 min which is not when you expect at a 5 hotel especially on a business trip when you have colleagues and a car waiting outside When one of the floor staff pointed me to one of the receptionists who would attend to me the receptionist told me she was busy attending another customer also attended by his her colleague And when at check out I commented on the subpar reception service I was offered a free drink from the bar next time I frequently travel on business and have never come across such service Separately the hallways are endless and lit so dimly that it s impossible to see the room numbers given they are written on the side of the wall and not on the doors Won t be staying there again despite the fancy furniture , Remarkable interior design and obviously very new Good choice of various hotel bars 
100769,Mondrian London,No Negative, The location is perfect and it is a pleasant walk along the south bank to the London Eye and Big Ben The rooms are comfortable clean and spacious and the breakfast is delicious 
100770,Mondrian London,No Negative, Everything was on point the decor the staff the cocktails The location is fabulous we could easily walk to Covent Garden Borough Market the City and there is a great vibe in South Bank 
100771,Mondrian London, The fact I couldn t have more time there, The fact that as soon as you pull up at the hotel the hotel staff came out and took your car and luggage just made it stess free
100772,Mondrian London, Mini bar was too expensive , Excellent hotel very modern fantastic bar and atmosphere top attention to detail The hotel even gives a mobile device with wifi Although we didn t have the chance to use it in the one night we were there for when you travel around 
100773,Mondrian London,No Negative, lovely room but no view bigger than average as we were given an accessible room the reception area smells gorgeous i notice that you can buy the scent Got a really good deal thru bookings com second visit for us
100774,Mondrian London, There was no pool The bar on 12 was so packed and drinks very expensive Sometimes our room wasn t cleaned properly and dirty glasses left where they were , The concierges were awesome Two young guys Jordan and I ve for the other ones name They were incredibly helpful with directions trains shops things we needed in our room etc and they were so pleasant and friendly 
100775,Mondrian London,No Negative, Nice tidy clean room great location to explore london from also was welcomed with a free bottle of wine and upgraded room as was for a 30th birthday
100776,Mondrian London, We told the hotel before we were going that it was our first trip away since we had our baby and asked for robes if they weren t already supplied Because of this it would have been nice of them to acknowledge that , Excellent location Very close to the London Eye especially Beautiful hotel Room was clean and comfortable but for the amount of time we spent in it as tourists we don t use the room a lot we could have got a travel lodge type hotel for about 50 cheaper Absolutely no view we didn t ask to be moved there are rooms with a view so be sure to ask for one Also no bath robes Despite this the visit was great and the bed was SUPER comfortable 
100777,Mondrian London, Poor service in the roof top bar in the evening waited so long for a drink that we left The manger did find out and came down to the downstairs bar to apologies and offer us a free drink , Location is excellent the reception bar areas and restaurant all beautifully designed 
100778,Mondrian London, 12 5 percent fee added on additional when ordering food or drinks is a little bit annoying to have when you are already paying so much during your stay Or needing to make booking for the rumpus room to have a drink or not being able to go even though you are a guest at the hotel Most staffi dealt with were great although some need better people skills and to smile , It s clean comfy and spacious room the location is great as close to main train and underground lines as well as borough markets just down the road some of the staff are really great and helpful 
100779,Mondrian London, Nothing really this is a true 5 star hotel , As we are big Tom Dixon fans we truly enjoyed the design of the room as well as the whole interior of the hotel Not just beautiful but also feel good and with the right touches from decor to housekeeping Been in London few times now and the location of Mondrian London is excellent being on South bank and with the Blackfriars station few steps away it s easy access and what is more great starting point for exploring the city The hotel is truly amazing Our room on 15th floor was exqusite spotlessly clean comfortable and with a gorgeous view on Thames St Pauls and the City The customer service is examplary like we ve never experienced before our big thanks goes to the staff who arranged the special birthday surprise and welcome gift we will never forget that all in all it was absolute delight staying in this beautiful design hotel 
100780,Mondrian London, Hotel bar is recommended best cocktail menu in the world however we did not like the somewhat exotic mixture of drinks too little drink for money , Great location with very good distances to tourist spots Tate Modern London Eye and Underground Station Blackfriars right across the bridge Hotel offers a pre installed Android phone to be used within London including a large variety of useful apps 
100781,Mondrian London, There is nothing to dislike, Fabulous in every way this hotel is a real find Location design amenities and the best service from the staff the Mondrian offers the the finest of everything The restaurant was superb too Highly recommended 
100782,Mondrian London, High fees for extras took a long time to hear back from emails about the booking and the room service food was terrible, Very convenient location and nice restaurant for breakfast
100783,Mondrian London, Nothing that I disliked but was a little disappointed there wasn t a pool in the spa as on the images it looks like there is Having said that the spa area is actually fantastic , Everything fantastic As was my birthday we received a round of free cocktails which was great The look of the place is amazing and rooms very comfortable and clean Everyone very very friendly and helpful Will definitely come again 
100784,Mondrian London,No Negative, Enjoyed being in a different for me part of London especially being so close to the National Theatre and being able to walk to the National Gallery and West End Thought the movie theatre was a treat Great bar 
100785,Mondrian London, Shower over bath and the bath had a very wide rim so it was quite difficult to get out of and there was no rail to assist but otherwise a really good shower,No Positive
100786,Mondrian London, Service at breakfast was atrocious Waiters were always short staffed so rushing around and bumping into customers without saying sorry Very chaotic and poor compared to everything else in the hotel Even the coffee was poorly made so presumably the barista station was undermanned The cocktail bar and reception staff were awesome by comparison , Location vibe views and quality of the rooms all first class Cocktail bars were superb as well Would definitely go back 
100787,Mondrian London, Rooms are a little small We stayed in a superior room and barely had enough space for our 2 suitcases They do still manage to squeeze in all the essentials though Biggest disappoinment was the distance from public transport Having never been to London before I didn t think this would be an issue It is a good 10 minute walk from Southwark underground station or 10 15 minutes over the river to Blackfriar s station This can become very tedious after a few days It is worth noting I had broken my foot a few weeks prior to the holiday so having to wear a moonboot all the time wasn t helping There are also no small grocery stores or ATM s within a 10 minute walk These are not the hotel s issues but worth considering if these are services you value when holidaying The hotel itself is an amazing place with a great atmosphere , Very trendy hotel in the busy Southbank area Very convenient if you just want to chill out at a hip restaurant and people watch Staff are all very pleasant and accommodating Breakfast is delicious a great selection to choose from but a little pricey for what it is but the whole of London is expensive so it shouldn t be a shock 
100788,Mondrian London, Shame they don t have a pool and that the gym is in the basement would have been great to be on a running machine overlooking the Thames Staff were nice and service levels were adequate if I were paying the rate I paid However the price per night is more than double 2 weeks after my visit and for that price I would expect a higher level of professionalism than I experienced and for them to go the extra mile , Steam room was excellent
100789,Mondrian London, Did not eat here so could not comment on eating facilities No negatives at all Even the weather was superb , We stayed here sadly for only one night to celebrate our wedding anniversary Amazing location right on the River Thames with outstanding views Our room was quiet very comfortable bed and an amazing bathroom with huge shower What really made this stay special was the staff without fault every member of staff was courteous and interested in you The playlist in the bar was enough to encourage you to stay longer just in case the cocktails did nt encourage you Lovely touch of free round of drinks for our anniversary Will certainly stay again 
100790,Mondrian London,No Negative, My preferred hotel when staying in London Location is great on the river bank design is super rooms are nicely decorated and spacious and beds are super comfortable The spa facilities are great especially after running along the Thames 
100791,Mondrian London, The view we were meant to have a city view but we didn t receive , It was in the perfect location and just a very beautiful hotel would definitely go back 
100792,Mondrian London, No faults Would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and also would stay again , The staff were really friendly and helpful We arrived earlier than check in time and a little hot and flustered from 2 hours walk The front desk happily offered us bottled water while we were waiting to check in Also happy to accommodate our early check in and lock our bags after we checked out Great that we could use the spa facilities after checkout on the same day room was well equipped and toiletries and sheets towels were all swapped out every day Hotel was spotless 
100793,Mondrian London, There was a mix up on room availability but this was rectified soon enough , An all round perfect place to stay Welcoming staff luxury without the fuss and a great vibe 
100794,Mondrian London, Sea Containers Restaurant i had booked a special table by the window for our lovely weekend away our table was near the open terrace but next to the staff s work station we could have been a little closer to the river view and away from this station The menu was unusual sharing meat main courses The double pork chop wasn t a chop it was squared off slices off what looked like a pork loaf and the crackling was missing Not a good experience , Staff view from room Stylish bedroom The Den Rumpus Room Dandelyan Bar Cinema
100795,Mondrian London, The room could ve been a bit bigger as we had a cot in there Always could be cheaper but hey , Loved it Very cool hotel trendy not stuffy Excellent decor staff restaurant location and bars were perfect We d definitely recommend it and we ll definitely stay there again 
100796,Mondrian London, Requested a room with a river view wast given one Phoned manager was told it was busy Poor on their behalf , Location was good rooftop bar was nice on the day because it was very hot we got great views of London 
100797,Mondrian London, Rompus bar was closed and we were not informed before booking Duty manager was useless We booked this hotel to spend time with friends while taking in the views of London but this did not happen and spoiled the stay Shame on you Mondrian,No Positive
100798,Mondrian London, Nothing this hotel offered everything you want from a London hotel , The service from staff in the entire hotel was fab Bed was beyond comfy Location was perfect 
100799,Mondrian London, Would have liked the Rumpus room to been less busy Couldn t find a seat but it was Friday night , We loved the Mondrian Great location Room was fabulous and staff very helpful and friendly 
100800,Mondrian London, The only problem if it could be called a problem was that the music in the lifts was rather loud and did not seem to fit with the otherwise quiet ambience of the hotel s reception and room areas , The room was very spacious and bed comfortable The room which had originally been booked had a bathtub shower and I had some difficulty in getting in and out Therefore I made a request to reception for a room with walk in shower and this was provided quickly and efficiently with help being given in moving our luggage to the other allocated room 
100801,Mondrian London, My bath had a leak which over the course of a week the hotel just couldn t fix It was very frustrating but they did their best to compensate me for my troubles The AC seemed to struggle to maintain a cool temperature in the room I needed to keep it on 19 just to keep the room at a temperature that I wanted this had been experienced in other rooms so I did not complain , The hotel is perfectly located to central london There is a DLR and tube station within easy reach The staff were very responsive to any issues that were experienced during the stay 
100802,Mondrian London,No Negative, We were very disappointed that we could not access the roof top bar due to a private function the night we were staying This was the main reason I had booked the hotel and it was sad that the hotel were not flexible enough to allow us to see the famous view from the roof However the rest of the facilities did not disapoint 
100803,Mondrian London, Only complaint was I could hear people in the corridor outside the door and in the bathroom of the room upstairs in the morning , Fantastic stay Great price in comparison to other 5 star hotels nearby 
100804,Mondrian London, Don t get the buckwheat pancakes, Location right on the Thames is close to much of what you would want to see and do Walking distance to London Eye Tate Museum Borough Market theaters as well as multiple Underground stations Staff could not be more friendly or helpful at every turn Room was a decent size for London and was absolutely spotless Bed was very comfortable Can t imagine a nicer place to stay in London 
100805,Mondrian London, Wish i was able to stay longer , Amazing private patio great mini bar and fabulous food with a great view in the restaurant 1st class staff who couldn t do enough to help Can t wait to go back already 
100806,Mondrian London, The hotel took a 300 deposit from my card for my 3 night stay even though I paid the whole booking in advance and even though I asked if it was necessary because I would pay cash for anything extra the front desk gentleman told me it was necessary The deposit was unexpected and really not appreciated when we were on a budget for the trip after converting money from a foreign currency and the money wasn t returned for a week , The room was very clean and the location next to the river was perfect for a nightime walk 
100807,Mondrian London, The cocktails The bars have fantastic d cor and atmosphere The staff are really nice What spoils it is the poor choice of cocktails There are no creamy or tropical type cocktails I feel that cocktails should be flamboyant and over the top They way they are presented is a bit dull , This was my 3rd stay I returned for the excellent location You just have to walk out of the door and you are on the south bank of the river Many incredible things to see if you turn right or left It s a river path so you don t even have to worry about traffic Wonderful view of St Paul s from restaurant Hotel clean and spacious Great lobby seating 
100808,Mondrian London, For some reason I could not connect to your wi fi from my tablet My son on the other hand had no trouble connecting with his phone No idea why but I was told this has happened before Hopefully whatever glitch there is will be resolved so others don t experience similar problems , The staff was wonderful The food was excellent And the response time of everyone involved was exceptional I would highly recommend your hotel to anyone traveling to London 
100809,Mondrian London, The dinner menu was too obscure and trendy for us with no plainer options The location was brilliant right on the river in view of St Pauls but a little far to walk to other sights , Staff couldn t be bettered very friendly and helpful Breakfast was excellent except that there weren t as many options as the menu showed Only streaky bacon only scrambled eggs 
100810,Mondrian London, Meal in restaurant was just ok had the lamb which was quite dry Also my partner left his designer jacket on back of chair in restaurant when we come down next morning they said nothing had been handed in which was dissapointing , The decor of hotel was beautiful loved the bar in room very comfortable bed Rooftop bar was fab was given free drink each as we were celebrating Ate meal in sea containers restaurant location is good 
100811,Mondrian London,No Negative, Location on the river was magic After a long day walking throughout London we could always make our back to the river walk and find our way home The restaurant that opens right onto the walk was beautiful as well 
100812,Mondrian London, The private garden was pleasant but noisy due to nearby construction works In any case I believe the noise should be temporary and it is a nice place to smoke a cigarette and to finish some work What I didn t really like are some architectural inconveniences I asked where the stairs from my floor 5th to the reception are located and the answer was something like It is difficult to use the stairs from this floor You will get lost because they pass through the offices They never saw me where the stairs are While most people don t use stairs I believe that it is a matter of principle for a quality hotel to provide it s guests with easily accessed stairs , The room was clean and when the windows were closed very quiet It had everything I needed Good sleep very good mattress Very good room service I stayed in a room with garden terrace which was very pleasant 
100813,Mondrian London, Swimming pool a big miss I wools have assumed there would have been one We don t get to go away often and a pool is a must Prices on the website didn t include VAT Not many sites in uk list VAT exclusive prices so felt slightly aggrieved when checking in Tax excluded is US thing get rid , All great very expensive room though Everyone was great especially our waitress who took care of us in the sea containers restaurant
100814,Mondrian London, Was told there was not enough room to accommodate us for a drink at the Rumpus room even though we were hotel guests, Beds were really comfy Had bars at the hotel Great location
100815,Mondrian London, Service charge included on all transactions even room service which has it s own delivery charge No hot drinks facilities available in the room tea coffee Shower drain blocked hair on arrival causing flood in bathroom area requiring attention by maintenance team No shower door latch mechanism to stop it creeping open causing water to migrate outside the shower area , Large airy room Very comfortable bed
100816,Mondrian London, Very expensive Very poor coffee making facilities within the room Nasty packet coffee would have expected something a little nicer Silly prices for mini bar It seemed that everything had a price tag Even to listen to music in your room , Beautiful hotel with a stunning reception amazing bar areas with Wonderful cocktails Efficient and fast room service 
100817,Mondrian London, Reception person was not friendly not much eye contact definitely some training needed Lots of good places near by for breakfast don t pay their rates if not included in the room rate , The location of this hotel is excellent On South Bank short walk from the Tate Modern easy walk to tube station The cinema at the hotel is great with a bar and snacks to take into the screening 
100818,Mondrian London,No Negative, The Staff were very informative and helpful It was my duaghters 21st birthday and she recevied a complimentary bottle of fizz Very Nice touch The rooms were very modern and clean and the bed was extra comfortable 
100819,Mondrian London, No priority for hotel guests on the 12th floor bar We couldn t get a place and were warned even if we did the service would be slow, Staff friendly
100820,Mondrian London,No Negative, We travelled to London for our anniversary and chose the Mondrian as it was highly rated On arrival at the hotel we had a small problem with the initial room The manager on duty Shahnawaz Khan was very quick to remedy the problem and provided us with exceptional service making this one of the most memorable hotel experiences we had Our room was changed and we were also treated to cocktails and champaign to apologize for the initial problem The Mondrian has certainly exceeded our expectations 
100821,Mondrian London, There were 2 Restaurant bills over 300 GBP was added to room charge which wasn t mine The hotel staff removed the charge after told them it was not mine I noticed there wasn t any signature on the bill I don t know how they let someone ate at the restaurant and just gave a room number without given first last name or sign the bill A day later I received another charge on credit card related to room I emailed the hotel but no replied Since this charge wasn t that much about 40 dollars so I decided to let it go It is a nice hotel But I wouldn t not rated a 5 stars hotel It was 4 stars amenities So don t expected slippers or robs Also be aware of all the charges to the bill , I liked the location was superb very close to the London Eyes and London bridge We explored the city by foot A lot restaurants and bars near by The hotel has a nice rooftop bar 
100822,Mondrian London, Rooftop bar was fun and comfortable music got too loud as night went on to talk without yelling in each other s ears Not good when you are two couples trying to catch up Tasting platters were nice but a little more than just two choices would be appreciated Champagne shed blocked the view and light in the little lounge area which would have provided a really good people watching area , Quiet where you want quiet and lively in the restaurant and bar Great location nice view of the Eye from our room floor 15 Room was very comfortable and well appointed and very clean Housekeeping responsive and pleasant Reception staff and concierge service excellent 
100823,Mondrian London, nothing, simply amazing All in all very satisfied I loved everything offered by this hotel Room size is good was provided with two baby cots no nice view but I m fine with that since we are all day out We loved the handy mobile provided in the room where we used it when we go out as GPS and entertain my toddlers with YouTube nursery songs as it includes 3G connection you feel like home in this hotel I will sure come back again to this hotel and will recommend to others location cannot be better close to london eye and big ben Southwark festival just 5 minutes walk restaurants cafes nice Street Life atmosphere is just 2 minute walk cleanliness I m very picky when it comes to cleanliness and I cannot rate it to be 11 out of 10 staff friendly helpful whenever you request anything you will get in less than 5 minutes 
100824,Mondrian London, When I booked I was informed I d be given priority early check in and priority late check out I didn t need the late check out but wanted an early check in When I called the hotel directly to organise this they were very unhelpful and unwilling to give me early check in I even got staff at booking com to call them directly and even then they were unable to help with this request which was very disappointing and started my experience with Mondrian negatively , The location is in beautiful Southbank and close to restaurants and bars The hotel itself is amazing clean and modern 
100825,Mondrian London, The room service food wasn t as good as i d hoped Pizza base seemed frozen rather than made fresh Breakfast wasn t included More cocktail choice in the rooftop bar , The rooftop bar was beautiful Rooms were comfortable and very clean Beautiful smell throughout the hotel Great location 
100826,Mondrian London, Parking could have more options could not book it limited spaces only valet parking but it s London and in a sat we got a space last one but still sorted without fuss , Location perfect for everything we planned The attention of the door staff attentive and dealt with everything for me before I even got to the desk helpful and sorted everything nothing too much of a problem that s how it should be Top chaps Check out was fine and no fuss to stay and have a late check out also holding out bags All part of the service while we went and did our sight seeing on Sunday 
100827,Mondrian London, For this price there should be a complimentary breakfast The beds are definitely on the small side and the rooms are in my view very plain and ugly in comparison to how the hotel markets itself , The location is great for all tourist attractions and anyone who wants to enjoy the perks of central London Staff is friendly and helpful Rooms are clean and fitness area well maintained 
100828,Mondrian London, Location was inconvenient Would have preferred to be on the other side of the river The walk along the river to the bridges was nice though weather permitting , Spacious room 
100829,Mondrian London, Would be great to have complimentary tea coffee making facility in the bedrooms, Great location very comfortable clean well designed rooms helpful staff and a surprise bottle of bubbly for my husbands 50th
100830,Mondrian London,No Negative, Very comfortable beds Great air con Very clean good toiletries Well stocked mini bar Shower was amazing Super fast check in and we were able to check in 3 hours earlier than the set time as we were lucky that they had a room ready Staff were really friendly and professional Great location next to the oxo tower and Royal festival hall and the river Thames
100831,Mondrian London,No Negative, Staff were amazing couldn t do enough for you hotel is stunning rooms very comfortable with great views of the river and St Pauls Highly Recommend 
100832,Mondrian London, The checkout process could be quicker with self checkout But the staff were still attentive and polite , The size of the room and the breakfast was divine 
100833,Mondrian London, There were no parking spaces left at the hotel this is the second time this has happened whilst staying here The staff were not helpful regarding this matter , Great bar
100834,Mondrian London,No Negative, I treated my mum to a weekend in London after a serious operation I let the staff know before my visit and they treated us so well From the beginning of making this booking right throughout our stay the staff at the Mondrian could not have been nicer The room was beautiful I am sure we were upgraded because of the circumstances of our visit We had the best view of the Thames and southbank We were even treated to a complementary bottle of cava The restaurant is amazing and the staff there brilliant The same with the spa which is paradise I d like to thank all the staff that helped make our stay from beginning to end an amazing experience 
100835,Mondrian London, Nothing I ve stayed in top 5 star names in London and The Mondrian beats them hands down , Exceptional staff Made us feel really special The hotel is stylish yet comfortable and perfectly located for business or leisure I d definitely return
100836,Mondrian London, The server in the dinning room was very bad always busy elsewhere but the restaurant was not at all busy didn t listen food was very salty and I really like salt but otherwise just ok fish great the rest very unimpressive Cesar a throwaway literally I suspect that it was the time of day I was there about 16 00 so probably got the busboy learning to cook and not the main chef Next morning tried to eat the bfast OMG eggs bacon from hours before OJ in a bottle i d guess frozen bakery at those prices I would have expected way more ended up at the pub 50 mts away for 1 4 the and everything made fresh how is it not possible in a great hotel Fire the the F B mgr scold the GM fast , The room and hotel staff where great prefer the surroundings of SOHO but this location is ok too
100837,Mondrian London, Guests should be able to get a seat in the rumpus room Large groups reserved them all that night Drinks are expensive plus tips make an average 15 for us but we expected that , Liked the bars especially the rumpus room Liked the friendly staff and mega comfy bed We didn t make breakfast as we d had too much fun at the rumpus room 
100838,Mondrian London,No Negative, Very lovely hotel Rooms were clean and comfy and the shower was great Staff were friendly and helpful We ordered room service and the breakfast was fantastic Wished we could have stayed for longer 
100839,Mondrian London, All top notch Really wonderful , Mondrian at Sea Containers is a beautiful modern hotel with all the facilities that make a great home away from home and stunning design features abound just check out the Reception s ship s hull for an incredible first impression but what really makes it stand out are the staff the service here is quite simply amazing We encountered a smile on every face a great atmosphere in all the public rooms plus free cocktails in the Dandelyon bar on our return from the theatre just wonderful A really first rate experience one which I wish other hotels could live up to With great views of London the Thames there s a fabulous rooftop bar and in a FAB location with trendy Southbank restaurants shopping and Shakespeare s Globe nearby the Mondrian is pretty much the perfect place to stay in London I ll definitely be staying here again 
100840,Mondrian London, Maid service was inconsistent Great on arrival did turn down service Was not done on remainder of days as told they would do Room service was very slow Entrance way and corridors too dark Lighting was very low , Cleanliness room size comfortable bed excellent bathroom and large shower Cell phone supplied by hotel for convenience to get around and site seeing
100841,Mondrian London, When we went to the bar on the top we realised that we have to book because it was crowded and it was impossible stay there, Location and the garden to smoke the helpful staff
100842,Mondrian London, Nothing, I arrived very late after midnight and was stressed out after delayed flights and delayed trains Was welcomed by a lovely friendly lady at reception and was immediately de stressed when she informed me that her manager had upgraded me to a riverside balcony suite She also agreed to kindly give me a late check out which really made my stay as I could chill the next morning after arriving so late these little things like late check out where possible and upgrades where possible make all the difference and make a guest feel like they are being spoiled Also the leisure facilities were top class Didnt have a chance to check out the bar and restaurant this time but I m already looking forward to next time I stay thanks guys 
100843,Mondrian London, It can be a little bit too cool for school On a couple of occasions the staff behind the front desk were more intent on their own conversation perhaps work related I m not judging than helping the people standing in front of them , The look and feel of this hotel is amazing This is the second time I ve stayed and it really is impeccably designed The rooms are cozy and stylish at the same time the beds are comfy and the noise from other rooms is minimal Breakfast selection is excellent too 
100844,Mondrian London, Sometimes bathrobe towels and milk for tea sometimes missed after cleaning so I needed to leave a message to cleaner what we needed next morning , Nice location nice staff tasty breakfast and nice bathroom 
100845,Mondrian London, At first I asked at the concierge if it was possible to book a shuttle service from and to the hotel Got a very friendly response with the prices Unfortunatly they were much more expensive than when I booked it myself thru a London based company The beds are 1 6meters wide I think I have a 1 8meter wide bed at home This is just a small note No big issue They do not have a swimming pool I saw beautiful pictures of a Spa so I thought they had a pool aswel but this was not the case We did not go to the spa because of this I should of looked better when I booked so my fault This is the reason this hotel does not get a 10 10 We wanted to go for a drink at the roof top bar on Saturday but it was completely full Looks like they also have a lot of external guests attending This is pity because as a hotel guest who is already paying quite a lot of money at that hotel you should be able to have a little drink This is also the reason this hotel is not getting a full 10 10 , As a genius member I was allowed to ask for a free early check in and a free late check out I asked both because we had an early incoming flight on friday and a late outgoing flight on sunday It could not be booked I would have to see on the day of check in and check out I understand because you never know which guests come in at what time etc so fine We arrived between 11am and 12 and asked if it was possible to check in The miss at the desk Jessica very friendly and helpful told us to cross our fingers because on a friday this was going to be difficult After she double checked on her computer there was a room for us available Fantastic Doorman helped my girlfriend with her bags and was very kind Room is extremely clean and well maintained I did not see or find anything broken etc The breakfast is not cheap but as I mentioned in an other review at an other hotels at least you get something Quality quantity and service Great We had roomservice after a long day of walking in London unbelievable Fish chips was to lick your fingers And yes it was still very hot The ice scream was Ice cold Well done Concierge helped us with the Cabrio busses Everything was booked to the room Very easy friendly and helpful staff 
100846,Mondrian London, Nothing negative stood out for me , Restaurant good and right on the riverwalk so opens out nicely in the sun Staff very helpful Spacious cocktail bar very comfortable Good wine list 
100847,Mondrian London, Nothing everything was perfect, Beautiful hotel staff extremely welcoming and friendly The breakfast was fantastic and reasonably priced The cocktail bar had amazing views over the Thames 
100848,Mondrian London, Rumpus room worth trip up to see the views but not to drink as expensive very poor effort into cocktails , Great location lots to do see within walking distance 
100849,Mondrian London, expensive but hey it central London , location if youre visiting south bank carnt get much better Despite being busy room was really quiet Room modern and comfortable Rumpus room great views and location for a cocktail Staff friendly and helpful
100850,Mondrian London, We had booked for early check in but the rooms were not available very inconvenient as my mother had a broken leg and we needed the rooms to get ready for my sisters hen do celebration , Amazing spa and stunning room
100851,Mondrian London, Despite the fact I had pre paid for the room they requested a pre auth of 200 2 days later this money is still not returned to my card which they say is the error of the card company but I will pay as I go from now on there will be no pre auth of my card, Rumpus room bar
100852,Mondrian London, Wasn t mad about the loud cool music in the foyer area , Great location to black Friars station On Thames riverbank V trendy interior Standard Room v comfortable 
100853,Mondrian London, Nothing really I couldn t fault the hotel at all, Really cool design Super modern feel and very comfortable stay Staff were great and facilities were really nice
100854,Mondrian London, Breakfast was not included in the package and it was rated as additional cost with high price , The hotel is well equipped and having a great location by the river
100855,Mondrian London, The room and hotel in general was very hot I put the air con down to the minimum and it was still very warm It was also very warm in reception which surprised me as it is shaded and no direct sunlight , Overall this was a very enjoyable stay I stayed here as I met friends in the evening and the location was ideal for that as well as getting to the office the next day I liked the room layout the bathroom was spacious with everything you could need The quality of the toiletries is impressive The bed was very comfortable There is a mini bar which had the best variety I have seen It was refreshing that the items were free standing and not locked down like other hotels The crystal glasses were a nice touch The hotel had thought of everything Even a spare phone charger The room was quiet The staff were friendly and it was a very enjoyable stay 
100856,Mondrian London,No Negative, Staff were incredibly friendly yet cool on check in and went the extra mile with a handwritten note hoping my stay is enjoyable I am not ostentatious and do not expect this but it shows how focused they are on their customers The property has a real ambience about it and in a location which really added to the excitement of the weekend 
100857,Mondrian London,No Negative, Staff was very helpful and kind Andre Camilo the people at the reception were very helpful The location of the hotel was excellent We have a wonderful time with my daughter and we will return again The room was nice and clean 
100858,Mondrian London, Location was great , Nowhere on any of the booking details did it say breakfast was included and no one told us Also we paid for a superior room We got what we felt was very much a standard room The kettle didn t work and the milk was off thick like yoghurt 
100859,Mondrian London, The booking of an extra night as I split this between booking com and the hotel was difficult The hotel had difficulty combining the bookings so the room was not valeted on the changeover day until requested , The room was really comfy and views from our room were good The staff really kindly provided a bottle of bubbly to help celebrate my husband s 60th birthday
100860,Mondrian London, drinks very pricey, lovely room with large private terrace with lanterns lit for you each evening Would recommend to people who like a quiet outdoor space and to smokers 
100861,Mondrian London, Got charged one day for 2 breakfasts but staff sorted straight away at reception Would have liked a Thames view but would have had to pay extra for a room smaller than a Studio room, Nice bathroom in Studio room Attentive staff at breakfast Modern and clean Would highly recommend
100862,Mondrian London, Dining experience was disappointing particularly the mains, Location was great Dinner was a little underwhelming Smoked salmon was excellent at breakfast 
100863,Mondrian London, Prices for food drink are expensive with an automatic 12 5 surcharge 2 buffet breakfasts very ordinary over 51 There was also an extra 30 put on my bill I am still trying to find out why , Very comfortable rooms location could not be better Lots of nice walks along the south Bank of the river 
100864,Mondrian London, Nothing , Fantastic room we had a garden patio and the spa should definitely not be missed The staff were extremely friendly and couldn t be more helpful The relaxed style didn t impact the professional customer services The cocktail bar is a must too 
100865,Mondrian London, Excellent accommodation value but can be expensive for food and beverage That is London though Rooms are a bit small but once again that is London , Really cool and trendy property on the South Bank with excellent access to River Walk and bars restaurants Great staff particularly Jenny in downstairs bar and the brunch team SkyBar has great views and is a really hot spot 
100866,Mondrian London, I can t actually say there was anything I didn t like , I thought the room was beautiful with so much character really comfy and cosy also Excellent location close to Waterloo station and many attractions also walking distance The facilities were also brilliant The staff were very helpful I had forgotten my phone charger and someone was straight up to bring me one 
100867,Mondrian London, Our view wasn t great but we got a good rate so didn t expect too much really , The room was wonderful very different compared to your usual hotel room Great facilities good shower The Dandylyan bar is great for people watching 
100868,Mondrian London, Nothing really The menu in the restaurant didn t float my boat but that s a personal opinion however the quality was good Perhaps a good house wine at around 30 Small niggles everything else was excellent , Only had a Standard Room but it was well equipped thoughtfully designed and very comfortable and quiet 
100869,Mondrian London, Nothing major slight issue with an overflowing shower and the guests next door but all dealt with swiftly by staff, Large rooms well designed and full of nice touches Attentive knowledgable staff Lovely bar
100870,Mondrian London, Standard room bed size is too small 2 persons slim can barely toss and turn Uncomfortable and key reason for not coming back to the hotel Also when the shift changes the service was poor We asked for water 3times and it finally arrived after 40 minutes Over priced , Modeen arty hotel good location and impressive reception area
100871,Mondrian London, Absolutely nothing , Absolutely everything they do in the Mondrain makes you feel like a celebrity and the customer service levels are on a different level Not only are the rooms well designed the attention to detail is also spot on The emergency kits and mini bar are particularly impressive Cannot fault this hotel and they are definitely giving The Shard a run for there money as location is stunning in the evening especially if you have drinks in the award winning cocktail bar Overall it definitely sits in my top 3 hotels I have ever stayed in and i ve stayed in a few for sure Highly recommended and will definitely return for those special occasions in London 
100872,Mondrian London, Staff was an issue Not very professional from all angles from dress code to manners Gave impression of great view when it was limited to the high end to access the expensive brands , Extremely disappointed with perceived value from advertising it s overrated and over charged on what is a limited river view Inconsistent staff service at front desk reception and poor service dress code of staff really made a huge difference Certainly not the image this high price hotel should project a bit unprofessional to say the lest and certainly will not be back in to this hotel again
100873,Mondrian London, Not everyone might agree with the decor but it has been interior designed to a high standard , Cocktail bar is highly regarded given its take on natural ingredients Outside terrace location spa Modern hotel with good size standard rooms and represents value for money in London Standard rooms are well sized compared to NY 
100874,Mondrian London, The only thing I didn t like is that breakfast is not included and for the price of the room I would normally expect that However I knew this before I booked so my choice , Excellent location staff were great we got upgraded and given a bottle of champagne as we were on our mini moon having got married the weekend before Room was great and just a nice hotel 
100875,Mondrian London,No Negative, Love the roof top bar You won t be disappointed Also I left something at the hotel and the staff were very helpful in returning it to me Thank you 
100876,Mondrian London, Not being able to open a window for air Don t like sleeping with air condition and the room got very stuffy A better supply and presentation of tea and coffee in the room Something to put used teabags on , Wonderfully comfortable beds linen Fabulous showers good water pressure 
100877,Mondrian London, we booked a double double room thought was extra double so no spacing and we had to pay extra for a bigger room which was very nicely , The assistance front office manager Daniel was very helpful and understanding to our problem 
100878,Mondrian London,No Negative, The views are amazing from both the ground floor restaurant which is directly on the waters edge and from the rooftop bar Our lunch was delicious and the staff very attentive In the evening we had drinks in th Rumpus room which is very luxurious I would recommend booking a table though as it was very busy Our bedroom was spotless and very comfortable 
100879,Mondrian London, If we had stayed longer we might be able to think of something but for one night it was just fine , Quirky comfort and the little extravagant details 
100880,Mondrian London, Music in the bars is aimed at a younger clientele Not a bad thing but it drove us out , Excellent staff everything geared to guests comfort and convenience 
100881,Mondrian London, Buffet breakfast was expensive as were the drinks in the bar , The location is perfect for visiting London within walking distance Waterloo station 8 mins 3 mins by taxi or the Embankment underground for the Bakerloo line 5 mins walk over the bridge Piccadilly circus 3 stops and Oxford street circus 4 stops Well presented room with fantastic shower and plenty of towels The rooms are quiet the bed and pillow are very comfortable resulting in a great nights sleep The buffet breakfast was just the start needed for the day ahead and the evening meal was well presented very tasty and good value 
100882,Mondrian London, Very difficult for someone with claustrophobia small lifts and no guest stairs had to get help every time to use a scruffy staircase through back corridors not pleasant ,No Positive
100883,Mondrian London, Nothing it was such a pleasure to stay there , It was my 50th bday and they were so lovely sent a complimentary bottle of champagne to me and a bottle of red wine to my friends in another room Excellent Breakfast extremely good and proper creamy smooth scrambled eggs Just a lovely lovely stay 
100884,Mondrian London, Asked for a room over the Thames but got the back of the hotel no view thought we would splash out for a 5 star hotel for our anniversary as a special treat thought a room with a view would have been prefect no bath in the room was offered another room with a bath for an extra 60 We declined The shower was cold in the morning We was given a free drinks voucher which was posted under our door in the early hours of the morning not much use when booking out at 11am, Very contemporary situated on Thames for lovely view from the restaurant
100885,Mondrian London, Overall my 4 night stay was very good and I liked the hotel a lot 2 things could have been improved and if they were fixed I wouldn t hesitate to stay at the hotel again 1 I stayed in Room 1101 a studio and while the room was nice it s biggest drawback was that it was not possible to open any of the windows for fresh air Staying in a hotel for 4 nights without the ability to do that is very off putting I appreciate the need to minimise risks etc but most hotels these days allow you to open windows even if only to tilt them open I can t stand a c on at night so having to turn it off and not having fresh air was a big downside for me and would put me off using the hotel again 2 For a 5 Star hotel superfast Wifi should be standard Hotels never seem to understand that one of the worse things they can do to guests is charge them for wifi In these days when we all need internet connections charging for a useable fast wifi service is equivalent to charging to go to the toilet It would be great if the hotel group made a stand and said Our guests deserve the best and to provide this as standard instead of seeing it as a separate profit centre It really is a no brainer It does not cost the hotel anything to do it and leaves guests feeling they had a good hotel experience and wanting to come back For clarity there is complimentary wifi in the rooms however it is not very fast at all and if you need to do anything quickly or stream media etc it struggles to cope Let s face it there are hundreds of hotels like this in London people vote with their feet Make them want to stay by including details to the small things and you will have loyal customers for a long time Two small further points There needed to be a foot rest to use with the armchair This should be a given in a Studio room The TV on the wall was offset considerably to the left of the bed it needed to be square on to the bed ,No Positive
100886,Mondrian London, nothing , The whole stay was a nice experience great location great staff and a great hotel I can recommend the rooftop bar and the Sea Containers restaurant excellent service in both
100887,Mondrian London,No Negative, Just loved the style Really appreciated the cool factor So many bog standard perfectly acceptable hotel rooms around But this was something special Loved it 
100888,Mondrian London, Hefty premium attached to river view room Room quite hot as couldn t open windows yes we could have run the air con but no matter how hard engineers try there is yet to be installed a totally silent system any where in the world , Facilities in a standard room very good Design well thought out eg shower control not behind shower head and some nice touches in the room eg selection of cut glasse to suit all choices from the mini bar which was extensive and expensive and therefore avoided Bed very comfortable good pillows and feather duvet made for a good nights sleep 
100889,Mondrian London, Breakfast was very expensive and standard rooms are small , Complimentary champagne to help us celebrate our special birthdays Rooms together and ready for us when we checked in Wonderful location on the south bank Definitely worth getting s river view room 
100890,Mondrian London,No Negative, The location was amazing right on the Thames so loads to see and do breakfast was great get variety The staff were great very friendly Rooms a great size and very comfortable 
100891,Mondrian London,No Negative, Location is perfect for exploring London The South Bank is a vibrant cool place with loads to do as well Also great cocktail bar within the hotel and staff were excellent and friendly 
100892,Mondrian London, N , I arrived in London earlier than expected and my room wasn t due to be ready until 3pm however upon getting to the hotel mid morning to check my bag in I was advised that my room was indeed ready This was a fantastic start to my stay and the level of service was better than expected I met friends also in London for the weekend who were staying at other hotels and took them to the Dandelyan bar in the evening Well to say they were impressed would be an understatement the views over the Thames were a delight I will definitely be coming back and will highly recommend to other people The Malin Goetz products in the bathrooms the fortune cookie in the bedrooms details details details love it 
100893,Mondrian London, Drinks were a little too expensive I understand this is a top hotel but thought they were a bit pricey , The staff were very attentive especially the front desk and waiting staff in the Dandelyan Also crystal glasses in the room nice touch 
100894,Mondrian London, The restaurant Noisy and busy Limited choice and regular food salad burger in fact it s the same menu proposed for room service Nothing fancy, Quality of the Service decoration of room large bathroom and very good bed 
100895,Mondrian London, Didn t like the music so loud in both restaurants while we was trying to eat and have a conversation, Staff very friendly couldn t do enough for you
100896,Mondrian London, The food could be of higher quality at the restaurant to match the great service atmosphere the noise of the corridors the traffic around the hotel, The comfort of the room the bed the tv the general atmosphere and feel of the hotel The service and the great views of the restaurant
100897,Mondrian London, Hotel bar very noisy with DJ and maybe better suited for younger guests Nowhere to relax quietly at the end of the day before going up to one s room Extras very very expensive , Room decent size and Thames view excellent Bed very comfortable Location excellent 
100898,Mondrian London, Unable to reserve a table to have drinks on the same day so No preference to hotel guests , Very welcoming staff on front desk They couldn t have done anymore to make sure we had a good experience
100899,Mondrian London, The rooms without a river view had a pretty poor view of dull buildings , We loved this hotel exceptional service without being uptight Great bars food staff rooms and location We ll definitely return 
100900,Mondrian London, Breakfast was not good value for money Price tags on items in the room such as the alarm clock seemed a bit tacky, Rooms were quiet and very comfortable service was very good including provision of non allergenic bedding and facility to delay departure until 2pm without charge
100901,Mondrian London, As residents it would have been good to get access to The Rumpus Room bar and not be asked to wait with everyone else trying to get in It was only when we were leaving that we saw in very small print in our room info pack a recommendation to reserve a table But no matter this is still a very good hotel , Fabulous location great views very friendly staff Surprisingly good value for such a position in London
100902,Mondrian London, No pool but I was well aware of that when I booked so not an issue for me but might deter some prospective guests , A modern clean and luxurious hotel Friendly helpful staff clean well appointed rooms and excellent value for money 
100903,Mondrian London, Service in the sea containers restaurant wasn t of standard expected and we couldn t get served in the bar even though it wasn t busy , Location was excellent reception staff friendly room clean comfortable 
100904,Mondrian London,No Negative, After a few language barriers at breakfast 3rd time lucky the staff finally understood I liked my poached eggs extra done We were on a time scale which did get disturbed I did try and cancel the order all together however was almost pushed into staying Extremely clean and tidy which is the most important to me The bar staff were lovely and we did overall enjoy our stay and would still come and stay again 
100905,Mondrian London,No Negative, Everything is great about this Hotel The location the rooftop bar overlooking the city centre of London and their fantastic restaurant If you want to have and all you can wish for experience thats the place to be 
100906,Mondrian London, Very difficult to find when arriving by car but having found it the front lobby staff were excellent, Very sociable hotel with great atmosphere in all the public areas and very good staff who knew their job
100907,Mondrian London, The water pipe was a little noisy but other than that everything was great , Loved the room spacious and beautiful d cor Bathroom was also spacious and clean 
100908,Mondrian London, Beware the upgrade offer that came up on my mobile phone a couple of days before my stay clearly indicated that the upgrade would be to a room with a river view This was NOT the case The non negotiable upgraded room had a very poor view but two double beds and a bath neither of which I wanted or needed When I mentioned this they said that they already knew that there was a fault on the system and that they were not in fact offering a river view at all They did not offer a refund for this anomaly even though I didn t get what I had paid for a room with a river view That view would now have cost me a further 65 VAT on top of the upgrade price already paid Also do not believe the prices on the breakfast menu they slap on an automatic service charge but it is labelled as VAT well that s how the staff member explained it and they then make provision on the bill for an additional tip on top of that Charges are not transparent beware of hidden extras , Great location Liked the cinema on Level 1 Enjoyed the view of St Paul s Cathedral from the breakfast table 
100909,Mondrian London, There wasn t anything we didn t like , Love the extras in the room the view of the London Eye and thames crystal glasses fortune cookie complimentary drinks for fiance birthday Polite staff and excellent service Lovely entrance 
100910,Mondrian London, Perfume smell in lobby a bit overwhelming Would be great if you could open windows in room as it gets stuffy , Very stylish hotel Love the concept and the restaurants and bars Rooms are a good size and tastefully decorated Location is perfect and close to lots of great restaurants the Tate modern and the BFI 
100911,Mondrian London, A phone charging system should be available in room I know there are devices available for all types of phone which do not have to be plugged in I ve seen a cute device which I think is called gizgo or gizmo used before and it takes the hassle out of the situation when you forget your charger , Lovely front of house staff Miguel went out of his way to accommodate me regarding my enquiry about what sort of music was going to be played in Rumpus Room later that night My friends and I were delayed at dinner and were nearly an hour late for our drinks reservation but the adorable staff were so accommodating and saved our table 
100912,Mondrian London, Check in said 3 o clock we arrived at 2 45 and were told the room would be ready by 3 30 as the River view deluxe rooms were a popular choice At 4 o clock we were still waiting having asked again and we did not make it into the room until 4 30 Having paid so much for the location and experience this was not the welcome and arrival we were hoping for at all and made the rest of our evening plans rushed and late , We stayed here for one night for my boyfriend s birthday the location is great and the views from the deluxe rooms are amazing The rooms are spacious and modern it s got a really great feel I emailed in advance to say it was his birthday and upon arrival they wished him a Happy Birthday and gave us a voucher for free cocktails to use in their bar which was a really nice touch 
100913,Mondrian London, The shower made disturbing noises Had expected a 5 star hotel to have slippers and bathrobes in the room , The welcoming the views the comfortable bed nice lightening and design Very clean Great location next to the lively river 
100914,Mondrian London,No Negative, Liked the funky but classy decor The front line staff were terrific seemed to enjoy interactions not always the case in hospitality Neighbourhood super busy but less stressful than Covent Garden area I highly recommended this hotel 
100915,Mondrian London, For me this hotel would have been a 10 10 experience of the spa had a pool Also my partner and I treated ourselves to a massage in the spa While the massages were tremendous it was a shame the women s steam room wasn t working when we visited I can say as a young professional the prices are a bit steep if you re looking for a deal We easily spent over 100 on drinks in one night in the Rumpus and room service breakfast for two was almost 50 But we were looking to indulge and for an experience And that s exactly what we got The pampering was well worth the extra cost , I booked one night in a standard room for my partners 29th birthday I was beyond satisfied with the room which featured the comfiest hotel bed I ve ever slept in and pillows with a bit of stiffness like I enjoy The view wasn t spectacular but I knew I would only get a river view with a deluxe room The room and the whole hotel was mondernly furnished which is so hard to come by for this rate with a lovely walkin shower and deliciously smelling toiletries Cocktails and vibes in both the Rumpus Room and Dandelyan while contrasting like day and night were great Both get very busy so definitely worth booking a table It s worth keep in mind the hotel is in a residential area so sadly the outdoor rooftop patio closes at 10pm which we didn t realise They hotel staff were very hospitable providing me with feminine products in an emergency delivery delicious and prompt room service being super cheery when we arrived and when we left Before we arrived I was put I touch with an experience manager who made our celebration that much more special by surprising us with a hand written birthday card a birthday dessert during our stay in the spa and a round of drinks on the hotel We ll definitely be recommending to my international family and friends when they come to visit 
100916,Mondrian London, We only had one night , Extremely clean stylish room Staff very friendly and helpful Great bars especially the rooftop Really cool and trendy hotel
100917,Mondrian London, The mini bar was a bit misleading think you should go out there to make customers know it s not complimentary , Great location staff were friendly hotel was clean and food was great Special thanks to Asha who done amazing to make the experience memorable 
100918,Mondrian London,No Negative, Great vibe and location perfect for St Paul s Tate Modern the Globe Southwark and the rest of the Southbank Excellent staff especially in the Sea Containers restaurant 
100919,Mondrian London, The media system in the room did not allow my Android phone to connect via Bluetooth, Great design and attention to detail which made the room a very enjoyable and confortable space to be in 
100920,Mondrian London, No slippers in the room but these were promptly provided when requested , The bed was very comfortable The in room bar was very well stocked and something for everyone s taste Love the quirky design of the reception area depicting the hull of a ship and bright choice of modern colours throughout hotel 
100921,Mondrian London, Bed was small double not the comfiest I ve ever slept in No turn down service Didn t like the 12th floor bar Music far too loud only open at night , Liked the decor Loved walking out of the hotel straight onto the Thames Would stay here again
100922,Mondrian London, the staff could be more helpful more benefits could be give to Morgan s Hotel loyalty members the curtains in the room don t block the daylight, The location the room the nearest area
100923,Mondrian London, Breakfast a la carte this time was not up to the standard we normally get so I guess it was a one off slip in the kitchen The Buffet looked great as always , Try Aqua Spa The most lovely knowledgeable ladies Bliss Room service Pizza is one of the best pizza in the city The top floor bar has stunning views and great cocktails 
100924,Mondrian London,No Negative, Location wise the Mondrian is perfect Easily walkable from Southwark Tube Station and located right on the Southbank next to Blackfriars Bridge we had a great view of the Thames and St Pauls The bar on the ground floor was voted the Observer s top London bar in 2015 and you can see why the decor is amazing the staff incredibly knowledgable and the cocktails are a real experience try the 13th Century Boy if you re a Gin drinker We didn t check out the cinema or the roof top bar this time but will probably do so on our next visit Our room was large and spotlessly clean the in room services were all as you d expect from a good hotel particularly liked having pre made cocktails from the afore mentioned bar available and a proper internet connection which worked reliably and at a good speed 
100925,Mondrian London, Room didn t have hot water Had to get the engineers in before getting everything sorted after half an hour Bar staff at the Dandelion was rude an obnoxious especially while trying to buy a drink Kept pushing past us after they told us to move to another part of the bar Extremely unacceptable when you re working in a supposedly 5 star hotel Waiters at the breakfast weren t pleasant either giving a rude look when we mentioned we needed a while to decide what we wanted Took 15 minutes to pay the bill having had to ask the maitre d for service, The place was beautiful and well decorated Check in was swift and we were in ahead of check in time Beds and facilities were excellent 
100926,Mondrian London, Nothing , Fantastic hotel Staff were amazing and so helpful even gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne as it was my husband s birthday We were in a standard room and this was perfect Everything very clean 
100927,Mondrian London, I do hate hotels where you can t open any windows so they re either stuffy or noisy with the air con on , Generally the interior design is great A pleasingly aesthetic environment to be in 
100928,Mondrian London, I couldn t find a shower cap The beds aren t as comfortable as those in the Premier Inns , The foyer was beautifully designed And the lifts had fabulous design panels at the back 
100929,Mondrian London, Overcrowded bar without flexibility for hotel guest you have not booked your table no option to enjoy your pre dinner drink , Location boutique Hotel with nice room and lobby great breakfast and bar
100930,Mondrian London, You can t improve on perfect , Every member of the staff was efficient polite and helpful a brilliant team Food was delicious and ambiance in the cocktail bar buzzy but relaxed 
100931,Mondrian London, The weather but hey , Fantastic staff who go the extra mile Comfortable beds and great rooms Good bars with loads of atmosphere Excellent food Our favourite London hotel have stayed many times and never disappointed Can t wait to visit again 
100932,Mondrian London, Breakfast for the price charged could be improved lacking in places chipped and stained milk jug cold plates for hot buffet fruit salad is a cheap route for a quality hotel and in my opinion the breakfast is a weak link in the quality of the hotel , Location and quality of room Excellent reception staff
100933,Mondrian London, The only thing I would say is our view wasnt overlooking the thames which would have been nice however I am aware I didnt request this at the time of my booking , The staff were extremely friendly we was allowed to check in earlier than expected which was a bonus The rooms were very clean and the rooftop bar had a lovely atmosphere at night 
100934,Mondrian London, The cover charge was high and took us by surprise We are young and having to part with 200 for the mini bar dented our weekend money for eating out etc , Lovely comfy bed and good breakfast
100935,Mondrian London, Booking com and the hotel need to state that breakfast is not included in the rates , Luxurious hotel with a fantastic bar overlooking the Thames Bargain rates but surely due to increase once the hotel is established 
100936,Mondrian London, We had a private patio superior room on the 3rd floor But were woken up before 07 00hrs by very noisy building works on the Sat morning , We liked almost everything about the Mondrian The staff facilities rooms location and cocktails 
100937,Mondrian London, One of the reasons for choosing the hotel was the bar on the 12th floor pity no one told us that it was closed on Sunday night very disappointed we were looking forward to enjoying the view out at night pity the room had no view, Lovely comfortable clean room Reception staff very friendly Spa facilities excellent
100938,Mondrian London, The pizza we ordered for room service was very sloppy Minor detail though as everything else was so perfect , The style of the hotel and the art inside was lovely Very stylish and comfortable Lovely bathroom Staff were friendly and amazing location We ll be back 
100939,Mondrian London, No business centre Concierge was not very knowledgeable , Lighting in the room was excellent Really good bar and service Reception and the staff on the desk were very good 
100940,Mondrian London, Drinks were very expensive 50 for 3 There is a building site next to the hotel so in the day it is noisy , Great design features and great bar on the top floor 
100941,Mondrian London, We came back late after a concert and dinner and wanted to drink in the bar but it was closed We thought all hotel bars stayed open for their guests , Great location and slept really well in the bed 
100942,Mondrian London, Room too hot Windows wouldn t open Roof bar overlooking Thames closed Pretentious description of hotel and its services , Location Bathroom Very comfortable bed 
100943,Mondrian London, Fresh milk in mini bar for tea in room , All staff were excellent great vibe and good team spirit and pride in their hotel Loved the rumpus great cocktails yoga was fantastic Hotel surroundings and decor amazing beds so comfy deep carpets meant no noise
100944,Mondrian London, Nothing , Lovely modern hotel Surprised us with a bottle of Proscecco when we told them it was my 60th and upgraded room Good location and even though in a busy area was very quiet at night The Rumpus and Dandelyon bars were great

100946,Mondrian London,No Negative, Service was superb excellent comfy bed and a spacious room considering we were in London Fab location could walk to Borough Market Piccadilly Charing Cross easily Bar was excellent did not try the breakfast so cannot comment 
100947,Mondrian London, Very posh Felt judged by whoever checked me and my girlfriend in lgbt Everyone and everything else was lovely Pillows weren t that comfortable , The food was excellent both in restaurants and room service Features in the room and tv were great I liked how a cable was provided so we could listen to our own music from phone or laptop Beautiful views out the back of hotel over the river 
100948,Mondrian London, Only thing I could fault was no free water in the room understand you need a mini bar with chargeable items but a couple of free bottles of water wouldn t go a miss , Hotel was clean comfortable very well designed and finished trendy with a nice vibe
100949,Mondrian London,No Negative, Great hotel right on the river Had a glass of prosseco spilled on me by a waiter An accident but it covered both shirt and trousers A testament to the quality of the hotel was how they delt with the problem The meal was free the clothes were laundered for the morning and i was even lent a shirt to continue my night out Many thanks to the management for the prompt and professional way they rectified this incident We well be staying again 
100950,Mondrian London, would have liked dressing gowns , the BEST location in the city right on the river but beautifully quiet inside The room was modern and clean wonderful bathroom The rooftop bath is lively and energetic brilliant vibe with good pumping music 
100951,Mondrian London, The breakfast was not brilliant kept having to ask for more tea and thought was overpriced for the quality , Special occasion and we were given complimentary champagne and drinks 
100952,Mondrian London, Shower could be more powerful One small complimentarry bottle of water between two people is a bit stingy , Great location right on the banks of the Thames A warm welcome on arrival with minimal fuss at check in Rooms are modern and very comfortable Good selection of in house bars and restaurants Cocktails at Dandelion and Rumpus Room worthy of a mention 
100953,Mondrian London, When we went for breakfast it was 10 minutes before breakfast was to end The hostess was very rude to us After we ordered just at the end of breakfast what appeared to be a very important customer was seated beside us We were completely ignored for the whole of our time in the restaurant as this table was fawned over We weren t offered coffee top ups water or any form of service you would expect from a five star establishment My food was burned and did not taste very good To be ignored is one thing But when a table is seated next to you and plates upon plates of food is being brought to them whether they wanted it or not adorned with Juices coffees teas and fresh fruit while we are being completely ignored is incredibly unpleasant and left us with a very poor view of the restaurant and hotel Then we were charged a lot of money for a very poor breakfast , Upon check in everyone was very helpful the bar staff were very helpful and friendly too The bar snacks were also tasty 
100954,Mondrian London, Didn t like the black washbasins in bathroom as they showed every mark very little if anywhere to hang towels, Comfy hotel bedroom was quiet staff were helpful 
100955,Mondrian London,No Negative, Amy the events manager was so helpful She really made the experience a million times better the room was amazing we even got a little welcome message from the hotel which was lovely Thanks Amy 
100956,Mondrian London, From a location point of view it was a cab journey each time as our evening events took place in Mayfair However it is not a deterrent to staying with you again but the St Martins Lane hotel would be a better location for us , The hotel was lovely and the staff were very welcoming and friendly It was my birthday on the arrival day and i was given a complimentary drink voucher The room was lovely and although we did not have a river view we were still able to look over some of the skyline of London 
100957,Mondrian London, We were not told that we had to pay for car park just told first come first serve So was a little shocked when we saw it on the bill Wanted to chill on Sunday and use the cinema but it was closed Would like to have known this as was looking forward to using it We did have people come to our room a few too many times After having our room cleaned and hour later the lady was back asking if we needed anything Also a couple of times another lady came round knocked the door and mentioned if we needed anything I was feeling a bit poorly and wanted to sleep Maybe this is why I didn t like it and staff where just being helpful , The staff were very happy helpful and friendly Me both had a massage and I also had a facial They were both amazing and well worth the money 
100958,Mondrian London, No towel railing in the bathroom , The super friendly staff the beds were extremely comfty and the room super clean I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in a luxury hotel 
100959,Mondrian London, It is a bit pricey but I guess you get what you pay for , Everything The hotel is in the perfect location the staff is extremely friendly and the room was super comfortable 
100960,Mondrian London, Public areas and corridors too dark and gloomy for me Also the trendy design of furniture fittings etc in bedroom make for very impractical facilities , Good breakfast but pricey I m bemused by the pricing policy for rooms I used booking com to book a room a couple of months ago and paid 258 for one night last weekend Looked on line today for a room for tomorrow and its only 141 00 what s going on 
100961,Mondrian London, After 5 nights in s hotel you generally get to know some of the staff or get some acknowledgement Not here Quite bland service, Great location modern large hotel
100962,Mondrian London, Dinner room service menu were overpriced Other guests were rude made a lot of noise in the corridors throughout the night stole our room service from the tray outside our room before delivery to us not the hotel s fault we were immediately compensated but clearly popular with a party crowd clientele while we were looking for retreat and solace , The Spa Brunch Breakfast at Sea Containers
100963,Mondrian London, Had to wait for room to be cleaned advised 20mins and given drink in the bar Queued back at reception after 20mins and told would be another 15mins so given room on 12 floor instead of 14 although view would have been better on 14 floor which would have been lovely as celebrating husbands 40th birthday, Hotel design helpful reception and valet staff
100964,Mondrian London, Dirty towels skybar was closed until 20 30 and we were not advised either before hand or at checking This was very disappointing Lot of noise in the hotel from guests We upgraded the room and up graded the view to a building site , Location was excellent and the hotel staff were excellent 
100965,Mondrian London,No Negative, Staff kind and knowledgeable and helpful eager to assist with bag drop off and holding directions to theatres etc Room spacious and comfortable and room service prompt and efficient 
100966,Mondrian London, Nothing all ok , Fantastic relaxed atmosphere Superb service from the staff and a luxurious room Great restuarant serving interesting and delicious food 
100967,Mondrian London, Better gym and a pool would improve the place Breakfast is superb but expensive on top of the room rates , Location style staff facilities all great Love this hotel 
100968,Mondrian London, Hotel guests get no better treatment in the bars than someone who walks in off the street can t get a seat or table without a reservation people who pay to stay should always come first, Funky modern hotel good views good location nice staff very clean
100969,Mondrian London, the music played in the bar and the Rumpus Room was too loud for somewhere so stylish we did not drink there though we would have liked to the doorman at the Rumpus Room laughed when we walked out because it was so loud we thought that was rude and the place was pretty empty for late in the evening i wonder why ,No Positive
100970,Mondrian London, Nothing everything was great, Amazing hotel It was my boyfriends 22nd and they gave us some free cocktails and a little card to celebrate Room was gorgeous amazing view and facilities were great The sea containers brunch was the best I ve had The dandlyon bar was a great way to kick off our evening The spa was beautiful Everything was amazing thank you for such a special stay Will definitely be returning soon 
100971,Mondrian London, This is a very chic modern hotel so sometimes style seems more important than function Maybe thats why I go there though , Staff and service excellent as always
100972,Mondrian London, Building works next door started at 8am on the Saturday morning beyond the hotels control but no prior warning was give that building works were going on , The hotel bars were fantastic even down to the minibar The breakfast was superb especially the blueberry pancakes Good location for a stroll down the southbank 
100973,Mondrian London, In common with other reviewers we had booked through booking com and received an invitation to upgrade to a river view a few days beforehand for 35 This came from the Mondrian When we arrived we were told that 35 was for a city view and that a river view upgrade was over 80 At first we were told this couldn t be resolved but after an assistant manager got involved a room that fitted the description was found Incidentally the 35 was exclusive of VAT not made clear Also agree with other reviewers that the 100 pre authorisation isn t clear either and not something that is common practice in my experience So although it is a beautiful modern hotel there are issues that undermine the proposition they obviously don t trust their customers to pay their extras , Lovely room with great view Smart modern hotel in an ideal location for South Bank theatres and easy access to water bus to get to Westminster Tower of London and Greenwich Lively bars Pleasant staff 
100974,Mondrian London, Unfortunately as the room was located on the inside of the hotel there was no mobile phone reception This was a bit of a drawback as you had to leave the room to make or receive a call as a result ended up checking out earlier than planned , Ambience of hotel is terrific particularly in the public areas 
100975,Mondrian London, The cost of the KIT KAT from the mini bar , The size cleanliness and quality of fittings with respect to the room The comfort of the bed The provision of tea and coffee in the room The location of the hotel 
100976,Mondrian London, nothing, We spent our anniversary at the Mondrian and had a great time Especially appreciated the personal handwritten note to congratulate us thank you Amy and invite us for a cocktail at the rooftop bar Staff was overall very friendly Nice big rooms for London beautiful spa and really nice modern architecture mondrian 
100977,Mondrian London, Please pay your attention to this rule GBP 100 non refundable deposit will be collected upon arrival Actually staff tried to charge me for 100 GBP per every night in hotel Spa was fully booked during my stay and this fact only means that the hotel is really popular even if overpriced , Room wifi design everything s on the high level 
100978,Mondrian London, Too expensive 350 night Didn t deserve the money Although a 5star hotel the rooms too small Clean and quite new but the rooms have a small view to Thames mostly to sky skrapers and to under construction buildings The room had a window note a balcony The room had no bath robe and for sleepers we had to request for The comments on booking were very good and the photos showed the hotel on the river so you suppose all the rooms with river view have the good view of Thames but no I wouldn t recommend it In addition when we came back we discovered after 4 days bites from bed bugs in our body We have the suspicion that it is from the hotel but we are not 100 sure In the price the breakfast wasn t included for which we paid 19 pounds person It was good and from the restaurant we had a good view of Thames and the bridge , Fortunately it had free wi fi The staff was very polite and very helpful
100979,Mondrian London, No bath just a shower For the price paid this should be obligatory Also no towel rail heated or otherwise No explanation of how to operate the lifts which needed a swipe of your key card before pressing your floor number Took us a few goes to realise We only received one key card but when my husband left the room while I had a rest he had to leave this so I could have power but this meant he couldn t use the lifts and the stair doors were locked He had to go all the way down to the spa and ask them to let him out , Excellent bathroom lighting in a room with no window
100980,Mondrian London, One loo cistern in our room was very very slow to refill , Overall relaxed ambience friendly staff river view from room upper level terrace bar s stunning evening views over London interesting breakfast served in our room cool decor 
100981,Mondrian London, There is no jacuzzi sauna or indoor pool in the spa while we took that kind of hotel to benefit from those facilities Cheap coffee in the room no nespresso for that price Cheap shower gel nice packaging but bad quality a bit like the hotel Therefore the very high price is completely not justified We arrived late in the day and were told that they just had rooms for disabled available 1 Its is not very romantic to be in such a room and we had planned a romantic weekend 2 Not practical either as the shower and toilets are too low 3 We could move to another normal room the next day that we did but frankly who likes waisting time to do so when you just have one weekend the viennoiseries from the breakfast were dry and cheap the location of the hotel when its raining or cold or when you carry a suitcase walking to waterloo station or southwark is just too far Im very surprised that people give a good rating to the location of this hotel the surroundings are empty there is no closeby subway station On the map it looks close to Oxford street but practically it will take you 40 mn to get there we paid around 250 pounds per night to basically sleep in a bed in London If I had known I would have taken a standard hotel in the center another common practice I didn t like they charged without asking 200 pounds extra on top of the price of the room on the day of arrival to cover for the potential future expenses we may have during our stay For those abusive prepayments my bank is charging fees that is a percentage of the amount If they had asked me before I would have given a cash deposit instead Typically the kind of hotel who does not respect its customers assuming they are rich and don t care about money That fits well with the snobbish attitude from the reception and the fake high level of service when we arrived a valet took our suitcases , The bed The general aspect of the hotel beautiful and that s basically what you are paying for 
100982,Mondrian London, Waited over half an hour to book in We were turned away from your skybar cocktail lounge by your doorman as he thought my 20 year old daughter didn t look over 18 As you d provided us with complimentary cocktails it totally spoiled my wife s birthday night So we went to another nearby hotel who were quite happy to let us celebrate my wife s birthday in style ,No Positive
100983,Mondrian London, Parking prices were abit extreme at 35 pound per night When there Is a car park within walking distance that charges 10 pound a day, Hotel was clean Bed comfy all facilities we needed for are stay Hotel staff very pleasant and helpful
100984,Mondrian London, Air con was slightly noisy but it didn t affect our sleep , This hotel is in an ideal location for visiting the South Bank Being right by the river meant excellent views to various London Landmarks Being a fairly new hotel meant that everything felt fresh both in the public areas and our room We just had the standard double but it was a good size with plenty of places to put everything We had a very good night s sleep and enjoyed the crisp bed linen All the staff were very friendly and helpful 
100985,Mondrian London, No downside really Heating system slightly noisy But being very picky now , Good front desk service Nice room designs and lay out Good mini bar Can make tea in room Well placed for OXO Tower where we had lunch And Wanamaker Theatre where we saw a play 
100986,Mondrian London, The deposit that we have to pay 100 for every night the location is far from the shopping area ,No Positive
100987,Mondrian London, The prices of the food and drinks were high but we were aware of that before we arrived and there are many other options in the area , The hotel was beautiful with stunning details and exceptional finishes We witnessed it being cleaned with care each and every day The staff were very friendly and informative and the food was of great quality 
100988,Mondrian London, Minibar snacks on display a little too close to the bed in this room layout but nothing to be really bothered about , Had a few stays at the Mondrian now and happily returning given convenience to visit central London great location by the Thames and very good value for money Nice design and comfortable room friendly staff 
100989,Mondrian London, They take 100 from your credit card and 3 days later it is not back in my account I think this is disgraceful I understand taking an imprint for incidentals but I have never had money taken from my account before at check in The receptionist was borderline rude when o questioned this practice It would put me of staying here again , The location and comfortable well equipped rooms
100990,Mondrian London, It appears the area surrounding the hotel is being developed alot the moment although this didn t really affect us directly much and wont be a permanent problem , Staff were very helpful arranged several special requests without any hassle Bathroom was very nice with the marble tops and the simplicity of the room worked well and stayed within the modern theme throughout the hotel 
100991,Mondrian London, The bed was very firm and the spa needs a swimming pool, Lovely hotel clean tidy and super modern fantastic location easy to get to all the main attractions in London
100992,Mondrian London, Nothing at all, Can not fault the hotel one bit As soon as we arrived they took our suitcases off me and my girlfriend I planned this 2 night stay as a surprise for my girlfriends 30th As we arrived at our room there was a bottle of prosecco chilling in an ice bucket with a little note next to it wishing us a happy stay and birthday Very clean spacious and modern room Had everything you would need and more They even have their own cocktail bar on the 12th floor Would definitely return 
100993,Mondrian London, The price for the food and drinks were a bit much, Nice big bed pillows were really soft room was very clean went to the Dandelyan bar in the evening and the staff were lovely 
100994,Mondrian London, Mini bar prices and room service were a little high however it wasn t unexpected Our view was a building site which I m sure won t be like that forever we just kept the curtains closed I m not sure any standard rooms actually face the river however I did request one when booking , Me and my partner had a great stay at the Mondrian the standard room was still a decent size and it was super clean generous sized amenities beautiful walk in shower and good lighting throughout the room Staff were young bubbly and friendly and check in and check out were super quick and smooth Decor in entrance lift bathroom and room were beautiful unique and artsy Good buzz it just had a good feel to it as a whole walking in through the bar area etc We had very few if any complaints at all except not noticing being told we have to swipe our cards to operate the lift We were in and out multiple times before I noticed the sign and got us going It made for a good joke and all in all not a major issue for us We will both be back and intend on now staying there regularly Maybe in a superior room 
100995,Mondrian London, Beds were uncomfortable but that is personal preference Didn t like the fact the room had no wardrobe just a curtain and a curtain rail , Excellent rooms superb bar on top floor excellent staff 
100996,Mondrian London, Sea Containers restaurant music extremely loud pumping out like a club atmosphere Certainly not a place to recommend intimate dining for Valentine s Day or communal dining for good conversation Very poor overall dining experience although food was good our orders were wrong on two occasions probably because the staff couldn t hear us or concentrate properly due to the din we sat by the window which was lovely looking at the Thames until smokers stood in front of the window and the view was then backsides smoke I would recommend the hotel itself but not to eat there Not value for money , Beautiful hotel perfect location Friendly reception staff exquisite interior design 
100997,Mondrian London,No Negative, Was a great stay were made to feel very welcome Was known that we were staying to celebrate our anniversary and we were given complementary cocktails 
100998,Mondrian London, I ve booked in with my wife and my 10 month old son I requested a baby travel cot the court did not have a mattress and had a folded up blanket which was very very uncomfortable you can literally feel the wood the bed that we were sleeping with in me and my wife was very uncomfortable and the room temperature was an adjustable call reception No 1 turned up what s the weather,No Positive
100999,Mondrian London, Not the hotels fault could be booking com s fault or mine but I never saw anything about this bit the hotel take 100 extra when checking in incase you order something or use the minibar and they refund the 100 or what s left then you check out bit I wasn t told about this Minibar was quite expensive but what hotel has a cheap minibar, Lovely staff rooms look amazing and the private patio is great when we arrived there was petals on the bed in the shape of a heart and complementary roses and candles it was perfect for a weekend away for valentines Will definitely be going back my favourite hotel I ve started in and it ll be hard to top this one
101000,Mondrian London, Paid 654 for a river view suite We were given no special valentines treatment No breakfast Had to park 10 minutes away Place was cold and didn t warm up until we fell asleep Balcony very small It seems as they use the location to completely rip the socks off of you as you had to pay like 5 to listen to half an hour worth of entertainment on the tv Surprised I didn t get charged extra to take a sh t , Nice view comfortable
101001,Mondrian London, Undertrained and clueless staff Staff feel so important they forget we pay for the rooms and their wages Don t ask staff they simply don t know how to help , Overall design Room Location
101002,Mondrian London,No Negative, Absolutley everything our stay was utter perfection from the excellent service and staff to the most fabulously located accommodation Thank you Mondrian
101003,Mondrian London, The only qualm is that we had breakfast at Sea Containers which was quite expensive but tasty, The rooms and facilities at the hotel were second to none we will definitely be returning This was a gift for my partners birthday and we were especially surprised to be given a voucher for a free cocktail for his birthday 
101004,Mondrian London, Nothing, Luke and the team at Mondrain London couldn t do enough to make sure my wife and I had the best experience ever at the hotel Great customer service is still alive and well at this hotel Thanks again to all for making our weekend so memorable Ronan Clare
101005,Mondrian London, The tv kept cutting out 20minutes into it being on Didn t bother us too much as it was just on for background noise whilst getting ready or when we was having a cup of tea in the morning Mini bar was a bit pricey as to be expected 1 night cost us 300 plus 100 refundable deposit which i didn t know about until arriving checking in hence the slight mark down We had the private patio however it didnt feel very private I felt like people above us could see us which made me feel a bit uncomfortable, Location was a perfect distance between where we wanted to visit Theatre borough market underground The staff were very attentive Gave us brilliant recommendations and phoned ahead to check borough market was open for us also took our bags in the Sunday so we could still look round London without pulling suitcases The bed was the most so comfy Room temperature was perfect and the little touches throughout the room were lovely 
101006,Mondrian London, Noise volume in the bar TV failed the whole four days we were there volume no room to sit in the rumpus room snack menu is a little pretentious and overpriced , It was so peaceful in our room and central for what we wanted to see 
101007,Mondrian London, Couldnt turn lights out at night may have been damaged and it was very warm in the room despite having air con on full blast , Decor quality style pretty much everything 
101008,Mondrian London, In the bar downstairs I received a fantastic Old Fashioned cocktail It tasted exactly as it should and was brought over to our table I expected the hotel s other bar would be the same I was wrong I ordered another Old Fashioned from the bartender upstairs His lack of communication was one of the clear indicators that he didn t want to be there His lack of any positivity was another Possibly the most miserable bartender I have been served by His low levels of enthusiasm really showed in the drink too Not only did it taste completely different but it was truly one of the worst drinks I have had Tasting of watery whisky with a hint of something vile my favourite drink had been turned into the worst Considering a round of 2 drinks cost 30 I couldn t even finish mine making it terrible value for money Before heading back to our room I thought I would make use of the facilities That was a mistake Upon opening the door I was greeted with a slippery patch of vomit which was a perfect was to ruin my brand new bought that day suede boots After trying to keep the remaining boot vomit free I realised there were puddles all around the room accompanied by puddles of water from the sink it looked like someone had been having a water fight and plenty of paper towels thrown around the room I returned to the bar and informed my cheery bartender who didn t say a word and walked away I sincerely hope he informed someone but he didn t return for a little bit We returned to our room having had a perfect night celebrating our anniversary really brought down a notch or 10 , The room was lovely and extremely comfortable 
101009,Mondrian London, Where do I start I had high expection of this hotel after reading previous reviews 2 weeks prior to staying at the mondrian I had stayed at M by montcalm shoreditch Based on reviews and pricing I went with mondrian for my anniversary in which my partner was displeased I had to admit for the pricing we did not get a fraction of the facilities or service Considering we was upgraded to a superior room at mondrian which normally 240 a night in the region our stay at M cost 135 for the night The deluxe room at M was much bigger than mondrian superior the TV was much bigger also the in room facilities I could not fault Mondrian around a 28 inch TV in an akward position for watching a computer desk and side chair with mini bar M 37 inch TV all controlled from the side of your bed mood lighting under floor heating Queen bed electric curtains M even provides you with elemis products in the bathroom Beautiful bars nicely priced food And a luxury spa on the ground floor provided free detox drinks robes jacuzzi swimming pool and shared gender steam rooms and sauna Fantastic On the mondrian advertisement I saw a swimming pool picture but upon arrival no swimming pool I was then told it might be at there miami base but I did not search mondrian miami I put in London but was showed apparently a mixture of pictures some of London some of other locations So mondrian did not have a pool or jacuzzi they did have a steam room but in the changing room so separate gender my fiance was dissapointed No additional touches they had a relaxation room that looked luxurious but all you do is lie there and relax A spa needs to offer me much more than a relaxation room Also there was no luxurious products given in the bathroom no elemis no sanctuary nothing like that basic product Was it bad no was I expecting more yes M by montcalm are currently doing stays for 100 if I were you especially in terms of a younger couple I am 32 my partner 27 , The hotel looks very expensive so when you enter the building you feel a real sense of luxury good start to a hotel experience Staff will cater to your needs concierge service very friendly I stayed here for my anniversary so was upgraded free of charge from a standard deluxe room to a superior Also the hotel gave my partner and I free drinks in which we could have in the rumpus bar which by the way is a beautiful low lighting atmospheric bar at the top of the hotel over looking the Thames very plush very nice The room had decent floor space and bath room was clean with basic bathroom stock 
101010,Mondrian London, Expensive for this size of room Too little room Superior room , Hotel is nice Superior room is clean but too small for this price 350 240 Pounds Swiss france per night Parking for your car cost in the hotel 45pounds day Very good location 
101011,Mondrian London, Just how expensive room service was One morning I had breakfast it came to 100 Crazy room service prices , The superb service from staff how on point they was with everything So professional 
101012,Mondrian London, We didn t like the rooftop bar All tables were reserved so we couldn t even sit to have our drink and had to stand at the bar being jostled Staff here weren t so friendly No mention in room literature that tables were likely to be reserved Really disappointed as this was one of the main features why we chose this hotel , The room had a lovely view of the river the room itself was comfortable and well designed the shower was excellent Hotel was conveniently located for the sights we wanted to see Staff were friendly and helpful at all times We had breakfast in the Den which was lovely if expensive but had a nice view of St Paul s while we ate 
101013,Mondrian London, We only used the hotel as a base and did not use any of the facilities so I cant comment on these There was no parking available so we had to park elsewhere at an additional cost of 60 00 We stayed at the hotel from 27 12 2015 for 3 nights and there was not a single xmas decoration in sight which was disappointing We paid 432 for 3 nights through booking com which was great value , The location was fantastic The room was good very comfortable bed and excellent views of the Thames and the city 
101014,Mondrian London, The Skybar is too crowded and too expensive I propose that hotelguests should get priority for reservations and that they are notified at the reception during check in , Location location location The service comfort and especially the alertness of the staff is superb Moreover the flexibility is great I got to check in at arrival 11 00 AM 
101015,Mondrian London, Roof top bar was closed over xmas this was the main reason I had booked the hotel , Very new contemporary design hotel Very clean Excellent location Friendly staff 
101016,Mondrian London, I really don t like the Rumpus Room at all been there for drinks before and find it soul less odd crowd and surly staff Dandelyan is SO much better great staff and incredible drinks , The room even though standard was delightful Great decor throughout the hotel Great gym overall very very good 
101017,Mondrian London, Bell boy lost our bag took nearly 2 hours for hotel manager to find my bag as it was taken to an incorrect room , Liked the style of the hotel very clean and comfortable stay
101018,Mondrian London, Not told the full story about a room upgrade had to ask for tea and coffee room not particularly clean Spa very poor and everything very over priced , Location
101019,Mondrian London, There is nothing we didn t like , The hotel was unbelievable and the staff were so helpful with everything The rooms were really nice and and all the facilities were good 
101020,Mondrian London, It s was a Shame that the roof top bar was darkened hip half full with empty reserved tables with loud bass music making it impossible to have a non shouted conversation We left without spending It was more akin to a basement windowless disco than an elegant terrace to meet take in the view and relax with a drink and a conversation The even greater shame was that it was not open during the daytime to take a coffee or drink and do that same thing Just seemed a bit of a waste of that special location , Rooms decor great staff at check in 
101021,Mondrian London, Nothing , Friendly helpful staff modern hotel great location with good views over the Thames Did not eat at hotel restaurants but bar on 12th floor was amazing Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough 
101022,Mondrian London, The buffet breakfast was disappointing for the price won t choose that again but go for the al la carte menu , location was brilliant the design was fantastic loved the Rumpus Bar love the free toiletries 
101023,Mondrian London, No complaints It s difficult to have a drink or breakfast there without paying a lot so except for one drink in the bar we chose to eat and drink elsewhere , This hotel is very nice and normally above our price range but perhaps due to low season we stayed there for app 130 pounds night for which it was excellent value in this location The room was very nice and the Rumpus Room bar on the 12th floor also excellent including the unparalleled view Also after I accidentally forgot my wedding ring in the room after departure the staff was very helpful over the phone and posted it to me 
101024,Mondrian London, The bar staff in the Rumpus room were a little abrupt, The Dandilyan bar was cool with great cocktails Great service free upgrade to top floor and late checkout Lovely dining experience in the Sea Containers restaurant Great location 
101025,Mondrian London,No Negative, This Hotel is in great central location right next to the south bank of the Thames and has easy access to lots of central london attractions The staff were really friendly and helpful The rooms and common areas are well designed and and the bar and restaurant served great food and really creative cocktails Overall a very enjoyable stay Would recommend 
101026,Mondrian London,No Negative, Check in was super and the staff made a fuss of me as it was my birthday View from the room was awesome and when the OXO tower light up at night in the foreground of the city lights it looked uber cool 
101027,Mondrian London, Did not like that breakfast was not included Did not like that their was only one small bottle of water left in the room , Liked the receptionist who checked us in Liked all the staff that we spoke with Liked the room Enjoyed our stay
101028,Mondrian London, Overpriced drinks we were also asked if we had booked when going into hotel bar , Good value for the price paid and a cracking location on the Southbank handy for the Arts facilities as well as Borough Market Loved the mix of modern art with container ships I m in the Marine Industry 
101029,Mondrian London, Nothing at all perfect, Staff great wonderful room wonderful views Lovely spa with great staff there too Couldn t have helped more with us and the children Restaurant lovely and even sneaked a trip to the Rumpus Room bar without the children one night when we got a babysitter 
101030,Mondrian London, Nothing although would love a jacuzzi or pool in their spa gym , room decor beautiful very quiet room very friendly staff Dandelyan is an amazing cocktail bar room service great in room toiletries superb
101031,Mondrian London, I would advice dog owners to check their dog policy before booking it is extremely expensive and unmanageable this is not despite their claim a dog friendly hotel , This hotel offers superb customer service the welcome and staff are second to none the room was very comfortable and extremely quiet delicious food Luxurious bed 
101032,Mondrian London,No Negative, Great location this new modern hotel provides clean spacious rooms with large clean bathrooms Valet parking is limited but car park was only 10 minutes walk away and we were able to unload load our luggage Breakfast reasonably priced for city hotel and nice lounge area for a casual drink Would highly recommend for special occasion 
101033,Mondrian London, Staff could be a bit more on top of things most of them seemed fairly young , Hotel very nice and trendy Great location you can do most of the tourist stuff by foot Rooms are nice functional and well sized for a city like London 
101034,Mondrian London, There s nothing bad to say , Everything We stayed here on NYE and it was wonderful and stress free despite the busy time of the year Room was spotless spacious modern light and perfect 
101035,Mondrian London, Very poor communication on meal and then rooftop bar package terrible value for money Promised seating in the bar area as we paid 199 00 for 1 bottle of Champagne and table and seats On the night there was no table and no seats They advised that they had miss sold the package No compensation offered Also pre authorise your credit card but then take the money but was told nothing would be taken They now have 200 00 of my money that they say will be paid back Would not recommend due to the poor ability to sell correctly and also a very curt attitude from the female restaurant manager on New Years Eve All in all a massive disappointment having spent over 1500 00 for two night stay Not to be recommended , Hotel was clean and most staff friendly
101036,Mondrian London, Felt it was overpriced nearly 400 for one night and that doesn t even include a cup of coffee, Great location lovely decor bright modern and clean hotel Friendly staff
101037,Mondrian London, the service level is not 5 star Over a stay of a single night we were given the wrong room Then I left my bag to be placed in the room when it is ready been asked not to take a tag have not found the bag in the room and after calling someone brought it but insisted for a while that I show the tag that I wasn t given When I said I expressly asked about this the guy said Oh I believe you WERE given one Then a few minutes later I got a call from someone else asking if the luggage was in the room This is only over the course of one day Ths SPA is pretty but only has a steam room a nice one No Sauna or pool , The hotel design is amazing Nice room but we had the upgraded one 
101038,Mondrian London, Didn t understand why the rumpus rooftop bar was over 21 which was very disappointing , Impressive artwork around the hotel well layed out room with unique features with a gorgeous private patio 
101039,Mondrian London, Delivery charge for room service and no gluten free options , A free upgrade for our minimoon and champagne Nice modern room with a fantastic view of the river It was also very clean 
101040,Mondrian London, tv remote stopped working Once we called for help this issue was solved very quickly and with minimum fuss , We knew we were in for a good experience as we walked into the modern hotel reception Greeted by friendly staff who soon had us settled in our room and were quick to help with any requests we had throughout our stay Simple but stylish modern room was well recieved by my other half comfortable easy chairs bed etc we ate at the OXO tower which is a two minute if that walk so made for very relaxing night Nice chilled atmosphere during the evening and cool surroundings in downstairs bar breakout area Sitting watching people strolling along southbank late in the evening was nice touch All topped with fantastic central location for our Christmas break Will be staying again I hope 
101041,Mondrian London, Could not get into the bars as they were all full would not expect to have to book a time slot when staying at the hotel, The room was very good with plenty of room on the terrace Bogdan the waiter made us feel like the most important gests Thanks for a great stay
101042,Mondrian London, Although parking at the hotel was not advertised and therefore we parked elsewhere when we arrived at the hotel it was offered and by then it was too late Staff were dressed very casually and at first thought they were guests We wanted to drink in the bar in the evening as a family and the bar was one of the main reasons to stay at the hotel but to our suprise they asked us to leave because our son was 17 and not 18 Although I understand the reason for this we were not informed at time of booking about this and felt embarrassed when we were asked to leave We were guests at the hotel and my son was accompanied by us , Loved the location and the rooms The hotel put us into interconnecting rooms which was really convenient 
101043,Mondrian London, Wd have been useful to park outside for 20 mins and mDe us late for wedding as had to negotiate car park And car park fees etc otherwise apart from some staff not having a clue as to how and when to order breakfast room Service and bar closing at 12 30 everything was first class Ps why can t you book cAr park in advance it s such a hassle , Excellent location very helpful staff Good quality facilities very good Atmosphere 
101044,Mondrian London, The breakfast was a rip off 18 pounds for the buffet and does not even have beans There is a nice place called The Table just down the road which is better and a more fair as another option Does not have a very British vibe about it also Some staff a bit distant and whatever ish hipsters , Good Location Cool Place Rooms are Nice Nice bathroom products Big Steam room
101045,Mondrian London, We had breakfast at 10am we put the unit outside our door just like the last time we stayed at 11am but it was still there at half 12 so wasn t happy with that, The staff were excellent the concierge decorated our room for my partners birthday with rose petals on floor and bed with less than 24hrs notice absolutely brilliant
101046,Mondrian London,No Negative, Stayed for my partners birthday surprise The hotel treated us to a free room upgrade and a free bottle of champagne To top it off a free round of complimentary cocktails to welcome us to the hotel Lovely people amazing hotel had a great time 
101047,Mondrian London, Poor choice of cocktails in the Rumpus Bar On the menu there was a list of so called Classic Cocktails However I hadn t heard of any of them so they can t be that classic We tried a few but we wouldn t try them again Presentation was a bit dull Cocktails should be a bit of fun over the top and colourful Perhaps that s why they keep the lighting so low A Pina Colada would have been nice At breakfast there were only cold plates to put our hot breakfast on , Fantastic location You walk out of the front door straight onto the riverside with wonderful views of St Paul s and many other landmarks Because the front door lead you onto the riverside pathway you have a fantastic walk weather you turn right or turn left Lovely roof bar with spectacular views over London 
101048,Mondrian London, Breakfast staff were quite sloppy and forgot our order Tea should have been served in pots Went cold quickly Bath robes should be available It was not clear to us that there was no pool in the spa We tried to book a treatment 5 days in advance and were told it was too busy Hotel guests should take priority perhaps Breakfast is very overpriced Most hotels include continental in the price of the stay , The location The modern design The fab mini bar range The Eco friendly approach Mock tails available I m pregnant and couldn t drink 
101049,Mondrian London, The room service pizza was terrible Actually was the worst pizza I ve ever eaten , The room with patio was the reason I chose this hotel Ideal for a smoker
101050,Mondrian London, The shower pressure could have been a little better , Staff could not do enough for us always greeted with a smile and were helpful throughout our stay The room was excellent very clean 
101051,Mondrian London, Had to ask for slippers robes No access to outside terrace of Rumpus bar after 10pm too noisy for neighbours apparently Cosmopolitan cocktails a little measly for the price tag , Friendly helpful staff Cool interior Great room service burger Stunning view from Rumpus bar Close to Waterloo Big Ben Millenium Wheel
101052,Mondrian London, Perhaps because it is so new or so expensive the Mondrian had a slightly cold unhomely feel to it There was also not much complimentary included The horticulture on the terrace was v poor ivy mostly dead things in pots , I liked the location and views of the Thames I liked the art installations I liked the Bar Rumpus room views were amazing I liked the spa 
101053,Mondrian London, Just the sleeping night 1 the emergency exit light in the room is REALLY bright so I kept waking up Then the alarm went off which we didn t set at 7am Maybe we should ve checked it The final night we were woke up by hammering in the hotel it was 9am on a Monday so I understand people have started work at this time but being our last lie in day before starting work again on Tuesday it was a bit of a disappointing way to be woken , Staff were lovely and so keen to help no matter what Hotel was so so clean and tidy and very modern and the rooftop bar was just stunning 
101054,Mondrian London, Room service Food Good choice but food was cold could not eat burger too greasy chips over cooked may have been refried , Staff all very friendly especially concierge nothing was too much trouble 
101055,Mondrian London,No Negative, Superb in every way I also told them it was my boyfriends 30th birthday and when we arrived we received a voucher for a complimentary round of cocktails which was a lovely touch 
101056,Mondrian London, Didn t get the river view we were expecting but the staff got us the best room they could for seeing the river The expense of the breakfast 20 for full english When you ve already paid a high price for the room i think the breakfast should be better priced the cost of the drinks in the Den 8 for a white wine and soda , Friendly staff good location modern trendy Great Spa 
101057,Mondrian London,No Negative, River view suite with balcony could not get much better Brilliant views and brilliant service received from all staff Dandelyan bar great atmosphere and comfortable place for a drink
101058,Mondrian London, As we were celebrating our son s 30th birthday for which we had booked three double rooms I was told he would find a complimentary bottle of prosecco in his room on arrival Unfortunately this did not materialise even though I had spoken to the concierge in advance who told me he might even be able to substitute with proper champagne Yes the reception staff made a reduction on the breakfast bill the next morning which was an acceptable gesture but I would still have preferred my son to enjoy the birthday gift from Mondrian Things like this let the side down in my opinion , The location rooms and service were very good and the breakfast was excellent 
101059,Mondrian London, Charged 100 a night deposit 300 Deducted straight away still waiting to be returned into my account allegedly 48 hours Service at the bar atrocious and booking in referred to my partner as she not very polite at all , Room view location 
101060,Mondrian London,No Negative, Had a lovely time at this hotel It was for my sister birthday and they upgraded our room and when arriving into our room there was a bottle of champagne from the hotel staff was very friendly and in a good location Def will be back very soon 
101061,Mondrian London, Inefficient check in process No up front warning about closed access road No valet parking Small poorly equipped room no bath smallish bed poor view for the price , Great location

101066,Mondrian London,No Negative, The hotel room was amazing it s designed and gorgeous with the perfect bed and shower The staff were fantastic and went above and beyond Allowing us to check our bags in and check out later Roof top bar and downstairs cocktail bar were so good Loved the views Overall the hotel is in a ideal location designed well and fantastic staff Can t wait to come back 
101067,Mondrian London, Nothing , This was our 2nd visit and following the problems the 1st time had been offered various incentives to tempt me back Wow wow wow it was a 150 improvement no problems at check in or out and service from staff was what I expect from this establishment level 
101068,Mondrian London, Drafty seating in restaurant on first night We sat next to the doors which kept opening for the smokers , Design features of all hotel made it a pleasant stay Room comfortable lovely spacious bathroom air con a little noisy but otherwise perfect 
101069,Mondrian London, One barman in the roof top bar was very miserable otherwise I would have rated the staff as excellent such a shame as it was a beautiful bar , Reception staff and concierges were excellent and the bar staff in the downstairs cocktail bar were great too Cocktails were amazing 
101070,Mondrian London, Spa had limited facilities Meal in restaurant food cold returned and reheated and still cold plus kept getting knocked by staff running through Manager dealt with this excellently though , Rooms amazing staff friendly location awesome breakfast divine
101071,Mondrian London, Check in procedure was very slow Despite arriving at 3pm where rooms are guaranteed to be ready we had to wait a further hour to have a room which was disappointing There was also work being carried out in the carrier on the hotel so were woken to loud drilling noises For the money paid very dissapointing, Beautiful modern hotel in great location Rooms are amazing with a great view of the river and the city 
101072,Mondrian London, Small hiccup about our late checkout had to prove to the staff we weren t being dishonest A glitch and a one off though on the few good stays we had there , Have stayed there a few times now great value location is excellent room looks good and comfortable Altogether a perfect base for a weekend in London
101073,Mondrian London, Pressure low on shower well not a power shower Hotel residents get no preferential treatment when request a seat at the bar , Amazing location and spectacular hotel fit out The rumpus room has one of the best views in London and the cocktails are amazing in the botany bar Staff were very helpful 
101074,Mondrian London, Only a double bed in room Poor complimentary drinks section mini bar prices were extortionate even by 5 standards , Brilliant location nice surrounding area Decor was great Staff were very friendly helpful 
101075,Mondrian London, There was some construction going on on the floor above us with noise from 8am The hotel had no control over this unfortunately, Our suite was fantastic
101076,Mondrian London, Everything in this hotel costs money I paid 600 euros for 2 nights and still had to leave a 200 pound deposit this did not include breakfast it is super expensive and you are no even guaranteed a place at the bar as a guest for drinks you need to reserve somewhere to sit beforehand So in essence as a guest you do not get any special treatment for your money , the interiors we really nice and the location was amazing Barely over 100 meters to the London Eye and right on the Thames 
101077,Mondrian London, Drinks in rooftop bar bit overpriced Would rather drink champagne from a flute and not a babycham glass , Great river view from our delux room Room was clean spacious and lovely shower Roof top bar very trendy and not too over crowded Great location Lovely reception area and friendly staff 
101078,Mondrian London, Long queue at checkout , Super location right next to the river and only a 20 minute strolll into the hustle and bustle of both Borough Market and Covent Garden Very swish reception areas Super comfy room Good vibes around the bar Best Bloody Mary ever Didn t eat but what I saw being delivered to the tables looked more than decent

101082,Mondrian London,No Negative, Hotel is excellent the staff make you feel like nothing is too much trouble for them Room is well designed spacious and clean free wi fi 24hour room service It would be difficult to criticise 
101083,Mondrian London, Upon entering the room only 1 bath robe was provided The bathroom comes without a drying rack too I headed to the front desk and made requests pertaining to housekeeping and room service departments Despite the front desk staff s confirmation of my requests housekeeping staff which came 10 15mins later had an item missing Also the room service staff never came And after waiting more than 30mins I called to verify if I could order ice as I have been waiting It took a total of 45mins before I finally got them , I appreciate that the hotel provides a 24hour gym Within the room ironing supplies were furnished and air conditioning functioned well 
101084,Mondrian London, I wasn t told that I had been assigned a room accessible for disabled user Being tall meant I had to bend quite low to use the bathroom amenities This is quite a large hotel and it s easy to get a bit disorientated at times , Good location on the South Bank Good looking hotel quite swanky Friendly check in staff Great room service Comfortable room 
101085,Mondrian London,No Negative, They staff was extremely friendly and helpful and very accomodating when we had an issue with the temp or our room They upgraded us to a balcony suite for free so we could have an opening to the outside

101089,Mondrian London, Liked it all although more beer selection would be better, Lovely presented modern hotel Great location food and nightlife You will love the views from the restaurant and bar St Pauls cathedral at night is stunning Try the spatchcock chicken in the restaurant amazing 
101090,Mondrian London, I thought some of the photos on the website were misleading For example the room looked massive on the website but was fairly standard in reality Also the photos showed a pool in the spa but there isn t a pool there is a projection of a pool from a projector located in the ceiling projecting rippling water onto the floor Hugely disappointing , The location was absolutely stunning The decor within the hotel was funky and classy I loved it There is a lot of space in the main areas of the hotel and you are encouraged to sit and chill Doesn t feel like you re in central London at all very relaxing 
101091,Mondrian London, The rumpus bar at a function on every night i was there and it was on the same floor as my room which was not ideal I wanted to take mates to rumbus bar but it was not possible during this time ,No Positive

101096,Mondrian London, The chefs cannot cook poached eggs for love nor money We had to send my wife s breakfast back twice and the 3rd time we just gave up , The hotel was lovely and the staff were so helpful nothing was too much trouble 
101097,Mondrian London, The hotel uses a fragrance through the hotel and rooms The fragrance caused a bad allergic reaction for my wife The staff showed a lack of sensitivity to it and the hotel says they wont change it So if you are allergic to fragrances don t stay here , Location and cleanliness
101098,Mondrian London, Tried to book over the phone but a very unhelpful woman wanted to charge me 20 than I could book via Booking com After lots of e mails where she wanted me to jump through hoops I booked by Booking com and saved myself 20 Terrible service from the people taking bookings Will not ring them again ,No Positive
101099,Mondrian London, For a relatively high end London hotel I was disappointed that the staff weren t that attentive particularly on reception and the concierge The bar on the ground floor was much more relaxed than the Rumpus Room , Nice location on the river and with interesting features and decor 
101100,Mondrian London, Some points to optimize in the Sea Container restaurant , Price Quality Location probably the best hotel in London And than the rooftop bar was even closed Definitely come back

101103,Mondrian London,No Negative, Mondrian is in my opinion one of the best hotels in London Location is stunning with the view for a river that you can access straight from the bar The design in hotel is Just stunning everything is very artsy and creative Hotel focuses on bringing creative people there so you can see many celebrities fashion and music peoole every day Bar and its stuff is very nice and serves amazing drinks Loved my stay 
101104,Mondrian London, Of course you pay high prices for the location, Location is excellent Food good if overpriced Area good for eating out and theatre Liked having the cinema in the building
101105,Mondrian London, Very large busy hotel used to smaller boutique hotels in London Made the experience a little corporate for us For the money there were a few things in our room that could have been updated easily ie No coffee machine which is pretty standard now in good hotels in London phone was broken which made room service inconvenient cheap toilet paper There are other hotels that we have stayed in nearby that have paid a little more attention to detail which I feel counts when paying 350 500 per room , Good location great views friendly staff great choice of bath products in room 
101106,Mondrian London, check in took us 35 as there was a big group checking in prior to us I have seen this in other hotels but they always manage to allocate at least one desk for non group check ins Really a painful waste of time if you are in London for one Sunday afternoon, Great Bar and Drinks in the Groundfloor

101111,Mondrian London, Nothing Rooms slightly small but it is London , This hotel is in a great location on the river opposite St Pauls and within 10 minutes walk from Waterloo and Southbank The rooms are well thought out spotless and nicely decorated funky nautical theme Lovely bathroom with good walk in shower The bed was very comfortable Breakfast on the riverside in the morning was very pleasant 
101112,Mondrian London, Neither bars allowed kids past 5pm Understandably so but it would be good to have other nice restaurant bar facilities that catered for kids too Complementary internet was very slow , Beautiful river views from our suite Very spacious apartment living Well located on the beautiful South Bank One of the bellmen Adam was very friendly and helpful

101117,Mondrian London, Except for the staff at reception people were not acting professional Playing bell boys concierges that directs you to others that lead to nothing waiters that are complain to each other about the small pay they receive clearly only interested in the tips they get and not too much on the clients Clearly strong leadership is missing to direct the staff For the first time ever we lived more than 20 years in and out hotels my wife and I were addressed more of the cases as Hi Guys Maybe this is ok for others but for us we like to be addressed differently , Very nice rooms with fancy trendy high quality decoration Nice lobby bars and other accommodation 
101118,Mondrian London,No Negative, The private patio room was amazing so hard to get a room with some outside space in London the staff were so helpful and always smiling joking with us The hotel location was perfect as it was so close to everything

101125,Mondrian London,No Negative, Hotel staff were friendly and helpful The hotel itself is lovely and in a perfect central location We never had breakfast so can t comment on that but we had a lovely time
101126,Mondrian London, Room was quite basic no bath only 1 robe very expensive minibar We were in London for Proms in the Park dressed down accordingly which didn t seem to go down well Got the impression that this hotel is really only for very young trendy people could not get a drink in the Rumpus Rooms at night as the place was packed with non residents so nipped round to the Oxo Tower secured seats cocktails immediately, Location

101130,Mondrian London, Parking a joke Access poor by road albeit there were roadworks in place Check in and Check out experience took way too long and was not provided with a folio to check charges Room was not ready when we arrived at 14 45 Hugely inconvenient as we had to get to an event and could not freshen up , Public spaces very well done River views from room Good room service and toiletries 
101131,Mondrian London,No Negative, We stayed there as a mini moon before our main honeymoon the hotel left us a free bottle of prosecco in our room when we were out to celebrate which was very kind of them

101133,Mondrian London, Spa was lovely but missing Jacuzzi and or swimming pool d cor in the room was a little too clinical for my taste Paid for all food drinks as I went but then was asked to pay again at check out easily resolved but had to prove payment which was a little unnerving , Service was great all staff were really pleasant helpful and went above beyond to make our stay special Food at Sea Containers restaurant was superb bathroom room facilities were excellent Rumpus Room bar was gorgeous with amazing views 
101134,Mondrian London, Asked for poached eggs they took some time to come my husband had eaten his breakfast by then The eggs when they arrived were almost boiled eggs rather than the poached disappointed especially with the 42 00 I payed , The whole experience it was a special treat for my fortieth wedding anniversary

101138,Mondrian London, Staff at the Rumpus room were a little rude and patronising I am being kind This seems to be a trend judging by other on line reviews Possibly the management s method for positioning the venue in the market Although I doubt it , Convenient location for our weekend programme of events 
101139,Mondrian London,No Negative, spent 5 nights at Mondrian Hotel slept very well each night clean and comfortable bed specially like the location at south bank can walk along Thames rivers super Nice desk with sufficient natural light that i was able to work with my documents 
101140,Mondrian London, Staff very arrogant didn t like the fact we had kids insisted we have a room other than the one we had booked as we would be more comfortable won t let kids and we are talking babies not loud school kids into the bar on rooftop even in daytime, Common areas nice good location south bank has come a long way
101141,Mondrian London, We were upsold to apartment room for our stay but at a cost of extra 150 pounds per night which we were happy to do We thought breakfast would be included after already paying a huge amount for the initial room and it wasn t and staff weren t very helpful or would offer a discount for breakfast , Room was amazing great views of the city Location excellent

101146,Mondrian London, It s a bit disappointed the facilities in bath is insufficient Perphaps hand rail install would be safety especially for the elderly would prevent slippery , During our stay for 7 nights it s very comfortable staffs are nice room is clean and tidy We liked the river view much even some visitors came to visit us We will arrange another reservation of booking for next holiday 
101147,Mondrian London, Rooftop bar closed Sunday and Monday when we where there Complained but did not seem bothered and didn t offer anything in return ie A free drink in the other bar One of the the main reasons we booked this hotel was the rooftop bar Also stingy with tea bags in room, Room was good location good
101148,Mondrian London, A small gripe about The Morning duty restaurant staff at Breakfast time again This was the same at Christmas time when we stayed here Every request seems a chore a hassle asking for a pot of tea or more milk or even the bill you see the sighs as they walk away You even see them avoiding your gaze as they know you are needing perhaps ketchup or more butter etc this is a BIG let down Customer Service is vital in the hotel industry The Front Desk staff not all but some could do with just a little more cheer Greet with smiles It would go along way especially when you ve travelled a day to get to the hotel For most people London is Leisure the holiday begins at The hotel Check in A smile goes a long long way after a long long journey , The Mondrian is just fabulous The Hotel is Aesthetically pleasing to the artistic eye in everyway The rooms are super With a bed you do not want to get out of Fantastic shower you could stand under for hours Bathroom wash beauty products are divine wifi is super great choice of T V channels nice little bar well stocked with good munchies The porter staff are just fantastic running up to the high street to grab a cab for you if one is not available outside hotel nothing is too much trouble for these guys

101154,Mondrian London, Construction activity restricted taxi access Booked on line Not clear that view was not of the Thames Had to upgrade to get Thames view, Central location 
101155,Mondrian London, Not a bad experience however the hotel was a treat for us which we had to save for When paying on arrival we weren t aware that a deposit of 100 would be taken also for extras We had to hand over out spending money Probably out fault as we are not experienced in staying in top end hotels , Brilliant location Cool decor nice staff

101158,Mondrian London, Guard dude at the roof bar and the fact that you had to book seat just to pay for pricy drinks , Brittany at the reception The smell stuff in the entrance and the design 
101159,Mondrian London, Not a 5 star 4 would be more appropriate No newspapers No good lounge areas Very plain and sterile hotel Would be devastated to pay full rate , Location
101160,Mondrian London, The design edge was lost on us both Once again designers who probably have not travelled extensively allowed to run riot Try simple improvements like towel rails in the bathrooms , Excellent location and very friendly staff 
101161,Mondrian London, Wardrobe space a little too small No room for a large case TV could be larger , Location and super clean View of the Thames and friendly staff who realise the importance of the customer

101168,Mondrian London,No Negative, Amazing on every level staff was fantastic accommodating and generous We loved the Thames walk The Jubilee walk and took it every day all the way up to Trafalgar past Westminster Parliament Big Ben The Room was impeccable large comfortable and seemed brand new One of the best Hotel experiences we have ever had 
101169,Mondrian London, Only one slight downside was the location in London itself which was slightly out of the way if wanting to walk everywhere but tube stations nearby so not a big issue , Well furnished Clean Friendly staff Well designed Great service Location on the Thames was amazing especially the views from the riverside rooms 
101170,Mondrian London, Extremely disappointed that the roof bar was closed for a private venue with no prior warning as it s what We were most looking forward to A light switch for the mirror fell off , Staff treated everybody exactly the same Staff extremely friendly and helpful I liked the high quality finish to the hotel Location very close London Eye
101171,Mondrian London,No Negative, I booked this for my parents to stay for the wkd they were looked after by the amazing staff and they couldn t have wished for a better stay in London Great cocktails and food too 
101172,Mondrian London,No Negative, Me and my partner loved the fact that we were with in walking distance of most things he is a black cab driver so he knows all the little slip roads also it was lovely that the hotel is based on the southbank it was an amazing atmosphere night and day and the cocktail bar was based downstairs over looking the river and also over looking St Pauls It was also perfect for us as we had booked a reservation to eat at the OXO Tower which was literally a 2 minute walk we had a fantastic stay in such a modern hotel

101175,Mondrian London, Nothing , Great location on the south bank Loved the roof top bar with fabulous view over the Thames and city and the drinks were not over priced Very bright comfortable spacious room bed very comfortable lovely size marble bathroom with wonderful shower and gorgeous large tubes of malin goetz shower gel shampoo condition and moisturiser Very friendly staff 
101176,Mondrian London, Everything was great apart from my drinks bill , Fabulous location ideal for both the lively Royal a Festival side of the Southbank and the wonderful Borough Market Staff were superb going out of their way to upgrade us for a special birthday and supplying free drinks at the bar as we waited Whilst not cheap the Dandelyan bar is a fantastic place to be in the day and the Rumpas a Room is a fabulous trendy night spot I d advise booking a table if you want to drink there into the night Great hotel great location and pleasantly funky
101177,Mondrian London, I really didn t like the staff uniforms at the front desk The reception staff didn t look smart and it didnt fit with the hotel style By all means be contemporary but there must ne nicer design out there , loved the curzon cinema facility and calmness of hotel
101178,Mondrian London, Apart from our room not being ready As guests we weren t told there was a dress code for the rooftop bar I booked it as thought it a perfect place to propose to her My partner had flip flops We were barred from entry yet other people were going in flip flops and shorts We were eventually told we would be allowed in for one drink by the stuck up bar manager We said no because we would feel uncomfortable as wouldbe watched like a hawk considering we were booked in for 2 hours We complained to the concierge who was as helpful as a bout of haemorrhoids We left the hotel for dinner and I sent a complaint email to the hotel and they responded that evening offering us either a free drink in their downstairs bar I said no as they had already ruined the opportunity for me to propose to my partner They offered us free breakfast which we took up with them , The room
101179,Mondrian London, a bit away from city center breakfast expensive for content but alternatives in surroundings unpractical to watch tv from bed no master switch for bedroom lights from bed , decent sized room comfortable proximity of Blackfriars railway with direct connection to Gatwick

101181,Mondrian London, The fact that when you put a Debit Card down on the room in case you have anything from the mini bar etc that they insist on taking 100 out of the account then will refund it when you leave Did not like that the Standard rooms did not have a bath when the price was 188 you would expect this, Very stylish modern and the staff were extremely helpful Loved that they looked after our luggage the day we booked out for the whole day even though our stay was over
