41831,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, Nothing I didn t like , Room smelled so good always clean perfect size cozy and comfortable Bathroom also good size great water pressure Extremely nice staff 
41832,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, Room is very small for a double room Felt a bit stuffy We have to find space to put our luggage , I picked this hotel because when i was checking booking com deal of the day offer is this hotel The hotel is currently renovating the upper floor that is why they couldn t give us a room on that side So they gave us a room on the ground floor The receptionist is friendly and helpful There s a few steps of stairs to go to the bathroom Wifi is good connection Restaurants are just nearby 
41833,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, there was a scaffold on the building so safety was a concern it was dusty out there no rebate was offered in any form Entrance to the room pretty narrow , Concierge was always attentive
41834,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe,No Negative, The excellent service of the guy at breakfast he was so helpfull and nice he knew what my grandaughter liked to eat so he was always waiting for her with a big smile and a plate of prosciutto and nutella 
41835,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, The hotel was having work done on it so the windows were covered in plastic so couldn t see out of the views that was a big selling point for booking the hotel Disappointed, The room was on two floors which is great for a family atmosphere
41836,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, If you are tall and or wide you may have trouble in this hotel I am 5 2 and the showerhead was not very far from the top of my head when I was in the bathroom it was very short And the elevator It s small even for for me My partner and I had two small luggages two backpacks and an additional bag this is about as much as that elevator could hold The internet was strange It worked fine until a certain point during the night I think and then our devices would have trouble connecting due to some kind of failed IP configuration The shower is a little odd I m not quite sure if there s a way to not get water on the floor The little glass divider pivots on a hinge so do not lean on it I would have preferred to have a warmer room oddly enough the first night seemed very warm and every subsequent night seemed very cold , The staff were always very polite We especially enjoyed the company of a very kind man who ran breakfast while we were there I think the location of this hotel is great There s a grocery store just next door which was incredibly convenient when we arrived since we were exhausted from traveling Just down the street is the Arc de Triomphe and from there you can just turn onto the Champs Elys es Public transportation is a super viable option here because there s a metro station just around the block The room was pleasantly small and cozy Soft sheets and towels good toiletries provided The safe was spacious enough for us to store two laptops and a few more items 
41837,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, The elevator is very tight Barely can fit two persons with their luggage The room is also very tight as well as the bathroom The internet connection is very good till midnight It never worked after 12 00 am which was very strange my room was in the 6th floor , The bed is big and very comfy The shower is good I liked the espresso machine Very near from Wagram metro station Recommended for couples in case you just need big comfy bed and excellent location in Paris 
41838,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, There were at least 3 electricity power failures The elevator was out of order our room was on the 5th floor 3 times up down Initially no forks available for breakfast ,No Positive
41839,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe,No Negative, For staying in a nice district like that in Paris the price was quite fair Although the same type of rooms according to their reception are very much different Plus the receptionists need to be more professional with the issueing of invoices 
41840,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, breakfast was without great selection and variety fruits only in a small water glass as fruit salad not exactly fresh and there was exactly one portion only better use one of the bistros or cafes around for a better value , very central location perfect to a walk to arc de triomphe champs elysees eiffel tower a tiny elevator but sufficient free coffee and tea on the room the bed was large and quite comfortable downstairs is a little supermarket to get eveything needed 
41841,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, This is a very old hotel Elevator is very narrow you can barely use two people Rooms are small and furnitures are old , Location of the hotel was close to my office 
41842,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, Well you shouldn t expect a luxurious hotel at this price but the service I got wasn t less than luxurious , Very friendly and helpful staff Very good free wifi Close to Wagram metro station Very clean rooms and bathroom and they look recently refurbished Warm atmosphere in rooms and lobby I didn t face any unexpected issue or problem like when you book a hotel with good offers and you go there find hassles 
41843,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, Bathroom facilities were not quite up to the standard of the room Breakfast tea making was not as good as we would have liked but the French don t do tea all that well , Location was good staff very helpful the room was comfortable and not too noisy 
41844,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, Spa bath didn t appear to be working and when we asked night staff at reception he wasn t sure and just said to ask in the morning , Duplex suite was lovely Lots of space very comfortable loved the little balcony 
41845,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, noisy neighbours she was clearly having a good time , Location fab 20 min walk from arc de triumph nice restaurants nearby We stayed in a duplex suite with an amazing jacuzzi bath 
41846,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe,No Negative, The staff was very helpful and excellent always Better than most hotels by far The room was clean and very comfortable All very modern with AC portable fridge and bathroom The area was very convenient and close to Arc de Triomphe Great value We even left something behind in the room by mistake and they contacted us to work out a return 
41847,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, The building is an old structure and that means a very cramped and tiny lift I was also a lil concerned about fire safety , The deluxe suite was fantastic with a lovely duplex feel to it The location of the hotel close to Arc de Triumph and the Wagram metro is very convenient The staff was also very helpful and eager to make our stay in Paris happy and comfortable We got great discounts through booking com and that made it good value for money although the hotel s rack rates seem exhorbitant 
41848,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, The morning buffet was expensive at I believe 15 a person The shower was very small where I could barely turn in it Also the wifi was very weak and would frequently cut out , The staff were all very friendly and most spoke English The location was very good with a convenience store around the corner for snacks water toothpaste hair gel etc Restaurants were also within walking distance the bigger part around 15 20 minute walk away near the Arc The shower pressure and hot water were great 
41849,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, Room at high floor was too small Choose lower levels WiFi kept cutting off and 3g the same thing Administration have to solve this issue , Great neighborhood Close to the arch Quiet and calm Clean room Great staff Got upgraded for free 
41850,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, Breakfast is very basic not much to choose , Rooms are nicely decorated in modern Paris style Subway station located 100m away form the hotel entrance The hotel has no parking facility However a parking lot is close by Indigo parking lot cost approx 40 euro a day A good place to stay for a city trip to Paris 
41851,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, Wifi is dreadful, Great hotel friendly staff comfortable and great location for my work but if you want to explore Paris this is a great location too 
41852,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, The breakfast was far too expensive considering that once the food was gone it wasnt replaced meaning the earlier you awoke the better value of money you were getting Shower head fell off the shower on to my foot on the last night which could of been worse than it had and the refreshments in the mini bar are extremely expensive , The bed was extremely comfortable and we had a rather nice view Location was alright even though by the pictures on the website I thought it was going to be closer to the Arc but still close link to Metro 
41853,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, We already knew about it as a number of reviewers have already mentioned it the lift can barely accommodate 2 people It was not an an issue for us but I am mentioning it to remind anyone who might need the lift , We loved pretty much everything location staff and the facilities The hotel is just 20 min walk from Arc De Triomphe We were upgraded to a deluxe room They don t provide a kettle in the room but we asked for a kettle as I need my tea The staff was kind enough to provide one when we asked They do keep a Nespresso coffee machine in the room which is a nice touch 
41854,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, We only stayed for one night , All staff members were so welcoming and helpful Our room was beyond fantastic I won t stay anywhere else if we manage to return to Paris
41855,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, As usual in Paris you can always hear the guests in the next room , Hotel Lobby needs updating but the room was great Big room by Paris standards The location is good but if it is your first time to visit Paris I would not recommend it To get to most places you need to take the Metro and transfer at least once It is about a 15 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe 
41856,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, The extractor fan was not working in bathroom and caused a lot of condensation could do with better shower screen to protect floor getting wet , Ideally located for all the places of interest visited Quiet location with no outside noise Nice restaurants close by 
41857,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, Room is a bit small but alright as sits in very good location elevator is quite small could only fit in two people and 2 hand luggages but it doesn t matter At all , Great value for Central Paris Just few steps away from the Wagram metro station and a very good supermarket just next door 15 20mins walking distance from the Charles de Gaulle Etoile Bed is comfy and bathroom is quite nice Air con works quite well therefore really comfy Overall it s a nice hotel in Paris Would recommend it 
41858,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, The bath tub was a little slippery My partner fell down and was hurt , The location was perfect close to everything in Paris A good bakery near supermarket very near good friendly staff good working airco good beds 
41859,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, the bed was very big and felt like a long distance between us at night, the location in Paris was residential but was perfectly next to a metro station for ease of travel into Paris also with in walking distance too as we walked a few times
41860,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, The only thing we didn t like was not staying longer in the room , Very friendly staff Close to everything Lovely room great views they couldn t be more helpful carried our bags in and out Spa bath with mood lighting Couldn t get my daughter out Hehe Overall a really lovely friendly hotel with everything you need 
41861,Best Western Mercedes Arc de Triomphe, Not enough soundproof in hotel Paris is a wonderful city and people like to enjoy it all hours of the day coming and going from the bedrooms at all through the night with Doris banging not very nice for me Wifi not very strong had to use data roaming to access my emails ,No Positive
