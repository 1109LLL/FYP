374110,The Corner Hotel,No Negative, Central location for example Sagrada Familia is an easy walk away otherwise metro station 5 10min walk so giving you easy access to all places you want to visit Very kind staff Nice size rooms clean bathroom soft towels We had breakfast at the bar not buffet and was just what we needed Pool with a view so you must check it out 
374111,The Corner Hotel, Not much Metro could be closer and rooms could be bigger but very minor concerns for us , Stayed for a short city break for anniversary Staff very helpful and thoughtful enough to provide some complimentary bubbles that went down well Location good a short walk 10 min to all main sites Lots of good restaurants in the area We found the bus link from the property very good to Ramblas Barceloneta when we had enough of walking Roof terrace a lovely bonus Rooms very modern and well designed Hotel very adult oriented saw no children at all during the stay All in all a very good choice for us and would recommend 
374112,The Corner Hotel, More sunbeds around the pool on roof terrace , Absolutely fabulous hotel Everything from the interiors of the reception the staff the level of service the funky room and the rooftop pool terrace were wonderful A very enjoyable stay In the Eiaxample area of Barcelona so a walk to marina and old town yet benefits from a peaceful location Loved the in room music system which pumped through to the bathroom Very informative reception staff 
374113,The Corner Hotel, The toiletries shower gel soap provided had a bit of a foul odour other than that was a very pleasant stay with very friendly staff , Very new and modern hotel located in the L Eixample neighbourhood Hotel is furnished and styled nicely with access to a rooftop terrace and pool which was lovely Beautiful lounge and space to relax in and the bed was super comfy High attention to detail on room furnishings and everything was brand new 
374114,The Corner Hotel, Although the room was modern bright and nicely decorated we would have appreciated a little more space , Good location in a nice area not too close to the major tourist areas yet convenient and not too far from the Metro station Reception staff were helpful in identifying good tapas bars nearby Good bar and communal area near reception It was a comfortable location for an extended stay 
374115,The Corner Hotel, Didn t really have a view , The bar lounge is lovely to sit in and the food was incredible The Pool bar terrace is perfect for drinks and relaxing Staff were more than helpful 
374116,The Corner Hotel, We had a shower over a bath which was fine but I prefer a straight shower easier to manoeuvre Also the hotel is missing a trick with the sunset bar service which is slow , The bed is really comfy and the TV is really good In fact all the tech is there s Bluetooth speakers in the room which are wired up to the hotel music or you can attach to your own 
374117,The Corner Hotel, The newness caused some odd problems Like if the wind rattled a window the air con would think the window had opened and cut off That made for a very hot and confusing evening, The hotel is new and nicely done The staff were extremely polite and professional
374118,The Corner Hotel, No iron or ironing board for this type of hotel was disappointing Had to pay 30 for a few items to be pressed so wasn t very happy as I had no other option Pool area was lovely but there were only 4 sunbeds and although there were deck chairs could have done with more beds Lovely double shower but would also be nice to have a bath , Great decor Comfortable Bed Clean bathroom with double shower Pool area was clean and well maintained Lots of bars and restaurants within a 5 minute walk 
374119,The Corner Hotel, Instead of adding some extra storage space in our smaller room 409 for unknown reasons the decorator placed two 6 high bookshelves filled with FAKE plastic books This has got to be the dumbest and most wasteful use of space I have seen in any hotel room ever , Rooms are VERY nice with very elegant and modern amenities Our room was one of the smaller ones on the floor 409 and could have used some extra storage space 
374120,The Corner Hotel, We recommend two things 1 Some shade umbrellas on the terrace The sun is fierce and with no shade or umbrellas there I didn t stay It s easy to fix 2 Our room was always made up at 5 00pm each day it s just an issue when returning from a full day of sightseeing But overall things were pretty perfect , Lovely staff particularly the front desk and also the breakfast team particularly Vanessa whose smile lit up the room Room was very comfortable beds pillows everything Loved the ambience in the foyer of the hotel with people busy on their laptops or sitting having coffee drinks etc There wasn t a lack of social interaction it was buzzy without being noisy 
374121,The Corner Hotel,No Negative, Great location once you know how to get into the centre of Barcelona But also great for exploring in the other direction where less commercial restaurants can be found If you re up for walking Sagradia familia isn t that far away either Roof top pool a welcome relaxation point together with bar later in the day Glad I returned for a second stay
374122,The Corner Hotel, Very small room for the money we paid 300 00 or more a night plus we had upgraded our room online and yet we could barely turn around in the room Super hot in the room but the staff finally turned on the hotel air system for our room , When we arrived the staff were helpful in directing us to their hotel it is difficult to find but after circling the block a few times they were able to give us better directions than our GPS gave us They brought us a bottle of champagne after we found that our room was sweltering and when we tried to turn it on in the room the staff admitted that it was not turned on in their main control room even though it was 85 degrees outside and super hot in our room The bed is super comfortable the softest bed in the 8 hotels we stayed in during our Spain Portugal trip They offered complimentary water and cokes in fridge and left coffee packets for the mornings The front desk staff were wonderful directing us to amazing places to eat in the neighborhood and giving us great directions on how to see specific sights and directions to the metro Location is excellent easy to get to all the sights in Barcelona with public transportation 
374123,The Corner Hotel, Only four sun beds around pool No shade from sun at all Plenty of chairs to sit on Feel this is more of an adult hotel and not really suitable for children , This is a lovely hotel very clean and comfortable The staff were friendly and helpful Rooms really comfortable 
374124,The Corner Hotel, Instructions on how to change the temperature and some of the other amenities properly laid out to foreign travelers , The rooms were extra clean chic and modern The staff were friendly and professional They also spoke English very well 
374125,The Corner Hotel, Room service menu is limited and portions are tiny Windows are not adequate so rooms get hot and street noise can be an issue, Nice design we liked the lobby and pool area
374126,The Corner Hotel, A bar at the rooftop would be an extra bonus , The bed was extra comfy the bedroom very confortable and the team very kind The rooftop is amazing The wi fi is very efficient everywhere in the hotel 
374127,The Corner Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is beautiful and the staff are very helpful A hand written note in my room to welcome me on the first night was a nice touch The location was very handy for getting around the city Very fast free wifi delicious breakfast and a stunning roof top terrace and pool Highly recommended 
374128,The Corner Hotel, Omelette fried eggs are prepared in small portions and at relatively big intervals which means that people have to hunt for them or they risk staying without their piece of omelette at all It might make sense considering using larger pans , Very stylish and beautifully decorated place while also extremely spacious unlike in many old Europe big cities Delicious and diversified breakfasts fresh juices and juicy water are gorgeous Located closely to Paseo de Gracia with all its boutiques and some of Gaudi buildings 
374129,The Corner Hotel, For the ladies I d recommend bringing your own shampoo soap conditioner They provide plenty but all have a more masculine smell Also sometimes the AC reverts to central so it cannot be controlled in the room I didn t mention anything to the staff because the weather during this time of year was fine I do think it s something that couldve been adjusted if we notified the front desk , The staff were super friendly and even let us keep our bags at the hotel when we took a 2 day trip to Ibiza during our stay The rooms were large bathrooms were gorgeous and we had a wonderful view 
374130,The Corner Hotel, Our room was in the front Windows opened to trees We are city people and the street noise did not bother us , No nickel diming here Room though small first rate good design fresh divine bed great lighting window treatments comfortable seating Room service surprisingly good reasonable and quick Loved my robe and slippers Shower WC more good design Staff eager to help us and able to book the tour we wanted Actually they were adorable Ambient music throughout Location best Sooo many restaurants cafes just around the corner Enjoyed hanging out in lobby Many nice touches

374132,The Corner Hotel, Nothing , The entire facility was top notch Everyone working there seemed to really care about their city and their Hotel They could not do enough to make your stay pleasant 
374133,The Corner Hotel, Room rate I paid was a little expensive to not include breakfast Felt a bit ripped off in hindsight No body lotion in the bathroom seemed an obvious thing to miss , A lovely stay at this hotel while back visiting old friends in Barcelona The rooftop pool is a plus and rooms all beautifully decorated with a great lobby also where the lack of breakfast included in top bracket room rate was made up for by cheap Desayuno deal at hotel bar Coffee Mini Sandwich for 3 50 Eur 
374134,The Corner Hotel, Nothing , I travelled in a group and I couldn t fault the hotel at all The staff couldn t do enough to help Lynn was especially helpful The rooms are lovely and the beds so comfortable The pool on the rooftop terrace was a bonus and so relaxing after a busy day I would definitely go back to this hotel on my next trip to Barcelona 
374135,The Corner Hotel, We had no view Our room looked out to the side of our hotel and the sides of two other buildings We had a direct view of a 20 wall At least we had a nice big window for natural light , Beautifully designed common areas and amenities as well as guest rooms Modern design with super comfortable beds Great Bluetooth integration to play your own music Staff were all amazing friendly very helpful The location is perfect Close to all major sight seeing locations but far enough away in a quiet area Would definitely stay here again 
374136,The Corner Hotel,No Negative, Very clean confortable modern nice hotel Rooms and common areas are carefully designed giving evidence on the materials used Natural wood is present everywere Rooms were very silent also the one with two windows on the main street Several products both salt and sweet are available for the breackfast quality is very good and the waiters kind and available to satisfy the requests Finally the hotel and rooms looks to be better than what can be understood from pictuers on Booking

374141,The Corner Hotel, Location is a little far from the center but at the right time of the year it would be fun to walk, The hotel is very new and the style is modern I loved the electronic advancement it has in each room where you hook you music with the room speakers
