464206,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The hotel is a bit dated Our bathroom needed a few repairs loose tiles on floor because grout had fallen out and the upholstery on the chairs and sofa could use some cleaning or replacement Other than that it s a great place to stay at a great price , This is a lovely little hotel in a great location The staff are beyond helpful and professional they went out of their way to accommodate any request We stayed in two rooms we asked to be moved because I wanted a room with a bathtub Both rooms were very spacious with a sitting area more like a junior suite than a standard room and both were well appointed The breakfast was quite good with a generous variety of foods It is an exceptional value for the money 
464207,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, Hotel located within a large building with other businesses You had to access the reception via a lift which was awkward with the luggage More information about this should be provided by the hotel so you are more aware of it when you book in , ideally situated for visiting all the sights The rooms were clean and comfortable 
464208,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, 1 Curt staff neither helpful or friendly 2 To shower in tub need to step over tall tub side Typical in Europe but in this case floor of tub very very slippery Very dangerous 3 Room cleaning substandard cleaner left crumbled papers used glasses etc 4 No late early morning shift so if you do not speak the language but need help in an emergency there is no staff on site 5 AC controls make it hard to get a steady temperature 6 TVs did not work in most of the rooms Good sound but no pictures , The building itself was old world charming 
464209,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The parking was very expensive at 28 and very very tight I asked the receptionist about the street Parking as there were lots of places she said that she didn t know anything about street parking We didn t want to get fined so we parked in the tiny hotel car park The room was really small The hotel is on the 2nd floor and the receptionist had to close the reception to go with you to move your car we were asked to move our car so that other guests could get out although they had the keys I wouldn t stay there again , The breakfast was good and the location too 
464210,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The 2 single beds were too close to each other, Good location near to the city center Great breakfast with large selection of food Sufficient internet connection Useful aircondition 
464211,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, You can not access the car park with a member of staff and they keep the car keys Room was tiny if you wanted to stand up the other person has to get on the bed Bathroom very clean and large We did not have breakfast as leaving early but looked really good The room was cheap and you got what you paid for, It s was in the old part of town
464212,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The facilities for breakfast are a bit cramped if too many guests appear at the same time There is also a problem finding and getting into reception on arrival as the hotel occupies the 2nd and 3rd floors of a large shared building I think the present signage should be reviewed and upgraded , Hotel is well located for exploring Vienna on foot and has a tram stop directly outside the entrance 
464213,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, There was no real window from my room The window actually looks out to an alley of other buildings which made the room a bit dull , The location was excellent very close to metro and easy to find The bedroom was warmly decorated with all necessary amenities The bathroom was rather small but fine for a single occupancy Breakfast was huge and of variety 
464214,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The hotel is quite subtly signposted The entrance is a typical shared residential business doorway and the hotel accommodation itself is accessed on the third floor using either the lifts or the stairs , Handy location just on the Inner Ring and close to the river walking west to Schwedenplatz it is simple to get into the central medieval streets We also left by City Airport Train the station is an easy walk from the hotel 
464215,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The litter bin had rubbish including a banana skin in it and the soap had been unwrapped and the wrapper left on wash hand when we arrived Our twin room appeared to be a single room with the addition of a put u up bed which moved and jammed against the sliding bathroom door The room had a view over a tiny ugly courtyard it was away from traffic noise though one cannot have everything in a busy city The hair dryer did not work and the staff were not able to rectify this or provide a replacement Cherries at breakfast one morning were fizzy , Helpful and friendly receptionists Excellent breakfast Quiet room away from traffic noise 
464216,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum,No Negative, Bed was a dream room authenic and very comfortable with lots of storage space and liked the lounge area of the room Great to sit on balcony in restaurant and drink coffe while watching the world go by 
464217,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, Booking com website was very misleading This is a small pension on 2 floors of a large building Reception is via a lift to the second floor entry to hotel is through a heavy iron gate at street level The terrace in the photos is a very narrow area of 6 chairs just outside the dining room our room had 1 chair table on adjoining balcony Note there are No flower boxes as in the website photos Due to the website photos and the only room the website indicated was available I was disappointed with the room provided as it was not what I was expecting for the price No tea coffee making facility in the room , Good location for trams buses and underground Easy walk from boat from Bratislava Restaurants cafes in local area Breakfast was good Staff were polite and helpful though I think we were overcharged for our 24 hour Vienna cards for travel around the area

464221,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The hotel is based on the second floor in what looks like a regular residencial property so no standard hotel entrance from outside Ater taking a lift to the floor where the hotel is based there is closed door to the hotel and we had to ring a few times before somebody opened the door a few minutes later Slightly odd arrangement if you got used to regular hotels , The location is great given that I needed to be near Wien Mitte which is a main statin connecting to the airport Amazing breakfast 
464222,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, No free parking at the hotel You must pay garage at about 30 eur per day because that is the cheapest option in hotel s neighbourhood Also cards used to open doors demagnetize frequently which may be a problem if you get back to hotel at night because reception is closed after 21 00 or 22 00 and you must call the staff and wait for a while untile they come to the hotel to open a door and fix your card , Style of the hotel and the room design Location is excellent and the food is great

464229,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The fact that the ground floor does not belong to the hotel you have to take the elevator to the reception the 2nd floor or to my room directly I was on the 3rd floor The parking in Vienna is very expensive , The breakfast was served in the reception area with access to to a balcony which I liked very much not to mention that the breakfast was very good

464250,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The first rooms I saw single were not great very small and largley uncomfortable Opt for an upgrade where possible , The staff were excellent many thanks to the young woman at the front desk reception and young man at breakfast Their professionalism made all the difference to my stay The Junior Suite was a truly excellent and comfortable room 
464251,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, My friend s iPad was stolen from the room and the hotel did nothing They got the police but in my view it was stolen by one of the staff Security in the place is high so how can anybody from outside come a nd steal Very disappointed , Breakfast was reasonable 
464252,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, We encountered very serious problems during our stay here regarding the water supply On the first morning there was no hot water in any of the rooms When we contacted reception we were given a variety of excuses only to find out at the end of that day the boiler was broken another morning one of the couple got up to no cold water and this was only found out when attempting to use the shower and getting really hot water as unbeknown to them the cold water supply was unavailable causing a serious scalding risk which was only narrowly averted by quickly getting out of the shower and slipping on the tiles in the process Even with this quick action some minor scalding did occur which really needed some immediate attention with cold water but there was none available Surely there should be some thermostatic control on the showers Due to the lack of cold water their toilet could not be flushed so they had to fill a waste bin and use that to flush it Apparantly the problem with the lack of cold water affected all the rooms to the front of the hotel We in the rooms at the rear did have cold water but again an issue with the hot water being only tepid this time The other friends in our party of six were given a room that was specified disabled which they are not However how this room was very spartan with an univiting appearance and it had no curtains at the window only nets and when they asked for some curtains were told it would be looked into by housekeeping but it never was As our friends like to sleep in a dark room this again was very unacceptable Also how it could be classed for a disabled person we do not know as to get into the shower you had to negotiate a high step How it could have been in the same price bracket as the other two of our rooms we do not know these problems severely affected all six of us and spoilt our holiday considarably , The buffet breakfast was very nice and the waiter Kristoff could not have been more helpful and he was very pleasant and polite
464253,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, could t get the radiator to turn down more all Viennese hotels seem to be rather over heated in my experience , Huge choice at breakfasts one of the best ever Quiet even though room at front on the Ring and comfy firm bed Very convenient location with access to trams around the Ring outside the door
464254,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, It s not a Hotel at all this word should be removed from the structure name There are 2 floors in an inhabited building The smell is terrible it smells like mold in the bathroom and room I woke up with a big head pain No ventilation no windows in the bathroom For heating you need to ask at the reception, Location is very good close to city center 
464255,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, No tea coffee facility in room but there was a machine in the restaurant that was free to use Didn t really cause a problem , Lovely breakfast good choice 20 min walk to the centre of Vienna 5 mins from hop on hop off bus Staff couldn t do enough for us Free room upgrade if you return Definitely recommend

464258,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The single bed room was extremely small literally had a single bed in it which I haven t encountered in a hotel ever before really there is no cable TV the WiFiis spotty at best the front desk hidden away on the second floor has a bit of an off putting attitude No way to control the temperature in the room with staff being unwilling to provide the remote for the AC or any way to heat the room If it s too cool it s too cool The room was very stuffy upon arrival so I opened the window to the central courtyard which lowered the room temperature to very cool levels Fresh air but too cold and no way to heat it The room itself has a view onto a featureless inner courtyard no way to see the sky and really nothing to see so keep the curtains closed , Breakfast buffet is excellent and other than the very convenient location it s the hotel s best feature The breakfast staff was excellent and attentive The single room is adequate IF and ONLY IF you intend only to sleep there 
464259,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, many things but to expose they needed aprox 10 min to open the door next morning they tried to charge us for additional bed 48eur although we asaked from the beginnig that we need additional bed for our child we wrote that the child is 13 years young and they put into the room a bed for 2 years young child they were very unplesant claiming they have right but you can check than they finally make a bed that was aprox 140 cm long picture attached it was immposible to sleep on that bed even for 13 years young child i have never complained in my live but this was to much the boss was next morning also verry arrogant i will also send a report to best western we make aprox 40 stays in a diffrent hotels per year allways hollidays i know what a am taking about and this is not a best western i know best regards, leaving that hotel
464260,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, Except for one Eastern European girl who was very nice the rest of the staff didn t speak any language besides German well enough for us to be able to communicate The safety box of our room had no key they had lost it My wife asked for them to turn on the heating and they didn t do it because they considered it was not cold enough They gave us an iron but had no ironing board The staff at the reception refused to receive packages sent in my name while I was there Two times they forgot to clean our room There was no mini bar in the rooms and there wasn t any hair dryer either though in the description it was mentioned as something that they had There is no reception 24hs The hotel works in the 2nd and 3rd floor of a common building When we go there the first day the person at the reception told us to wait TEN MINUTES without any explanation whatsoever ,No Positive
464261,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, When we arrive it was totally what we didn t expect for a standard room with twin beds We travelled Europe for the last few years and everywhere we been a twin beds is considered twin beds made into one king size not a two twin cots and a room a size of a closet for five days that cost use 1 300 00 can We did talked with the main desk and the next morning we were moved into a superior room with twin beds made into a king size and very uncomfortable I think the mattresses were as old as the hotel but the room was much bigger , Staff was very friendly they even got us a doctor since my wife got ill in Vienna Breakfast was excellent Everything from American to European spread 
464262,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, Almost everything must be looked at Specifically the name property business ethics and attitude of staff , Every thing was old Bathrooms not maintained and must be repaired Breakfast stale and not to par of international hotels 
464263,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The entrance is confusing and and overall hotel has a creepy feel to it When I arrived one of the lifts was dis functional wouldn t open unless the button was pressed a few times My room was small very low light and ventilation One of the nights the main door would not open after hours 9 pm onwards I was lucky since there was a couple coming in at the same time the third night the lights would not work in my room when complained the receptionist came looking for a key card wall slot there was none in my room and she was Surprised Then she went looking for the electricity boards and we had to spend 10 mins working out how to open the hidden electricity trip switch Normally I would have complained to the manager but after reading the reputation he has I didn t bother , Location is a plus walking distance from Swedenplatz metro station
464264,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, Entrance was dark and as reception is on first floor of building was not very welcoming Outlook from bedroom was dreadful but room itself was good and very quiet, Very plush hotel in a reasonable area
464265,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, We had to open some very heavy doors before getting to our room as the hotel is basically few apartment over two floors put together When we got there the room was so small it barely accommodated two people and their luggage, Location was great breakfast was ok Staff was very helpfull and pleasent to discuss with
464266,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, We had only one big problem with our room the shower was either burning hot or freezing There was absolutely no in between It was impossible for us to take a decent shower for the first 3 days The problem was a bit fixed when we explained it to the hotel for the second time However it was still very complicated to deal with the temperature of the shower , The location was great and the breakfast was really good Very gentle staff Cleaning was done everyday 
464267,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, In the 4 days we stayed there they only made the bed and gave us clean old towels Floor and bath were never cleaned I made a mistake when i did the booking 5 min later i tried to cancel but they absolutely refuse to cancel Way overpriced Breakfast is set up in the lobby not good no space to move It was a terrible experience , The Location
464268,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, Staff is friendly and tries to be friendly but can really use some skills training in customer service No tea at breakfast you have to ask for cooked water yourself several times on the 1st and 2nd morning 2nd morning we just received warm water which was not cooked also there are more people in the hotel than seating available for breakfast Staff bothered us in the room up till 4 times during the stay Guests need some privacy One night we forgot to buy bread so we asked for just two slices offered to pay as the stores where closed it was late and it was a national holiday Staff refused which made it awkward especially since we where told friendly to just ask if we needed something food it was not like we were asking for much , Location nice large rooms the beds are super comfy It s a small and cosy hotel 
464269,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, We got a very small room more like a closet We upgraded to a very nice room But late in the evening persons other guests entered our room while we were sleeping and we had locked the door How is that possible The next day we didn t have towels and Than they phoned us to tell our taxi was arrived but we didn t ask for a taxi The reception is very unorganized , Our second room was very nice Location of the hotel is perfect 
464270,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, Very noise place Room is small and dirty Mattress is terrible No AC Can you believe it Room extremely hot and bugs flying all around , Good location and breakfast 
464271,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, 1 no clear instruction to how to enter the hotel and where is reception It s on 2 3 floor but rang a few times downstairs no answer and no door open on reception How could you expect new guest to know all the tricks 2 the manager yelled at me when i tried to open the door to get into reception his attitude is the worst i ve never seen in a hotel First impression always important esp a bad one 3 they could not find my booking but i surely have a booking confirmation If i don t have a booking how can i make reviews now They just kept saying that s not their fault I was sure my booking confirmed as on 6 14 there was already a charge guarantee to my credit card for the full amount 4 i told them when checked in i need to spilit my bills into 2 They promised in check in when i checked out they could not provide and promised to send me by email they also could not provide a credit card receipt problem with their machine paper maybe they forgot to add on new paper as before my credit card has already been guaranteed i need the receipt to ensure no double charge Anyway they did not provide me card receipt the bill they sent me also not clearly mentioned the check in out dates as they promised I wrote email to them no feedback yet 5 When i kept my luggages in their storage room for 2 hours they marked the room number on my luggage with white pen Even it has been removed with water but my luggages look unneat Normally hotels whatever star will provide a badge As all above and a lot more details about their unprofessional service and bad attitude i will not stay in this place again It s a amazing city but this stay was really unpleasant , location 15mins wark to CAT 10mins walk to U1 U4 
464272,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The pictures and the description are terribly misleading As we walked into the building we realized that hotel was located on two floors The pictures featured on booking com do not match at all the conditions we met there Everything in the bedroom was falling apart the bathroom was ancient and had fungus on the wall the taps were extremely unpractical to use The hotel has no restaurant only a generous breakfast with very low quality food The manager treated his employees very bad yelling at them in front of guests which was quite embarrassing to watch It is a big surprise that this accommodation is awarded 4 stars because it doesn t have half of the things that a 4 star hotel should offer Big disappointment after staying at a very nice 4 star hotel in Ljubljana that is also part of Best Western Hotels , Close to the center of the town Has AC in the room

464276,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The hotel is located in the living house the reception is on the second floor and rooms are located on the other floors it is not comfortable and not cozy at all The breakfast is also on the second floor where reception is and very few tables the sometimes you even have to wait to take a sit The room was tiny and the window view was just horrible the WALL In general the hotel is very old and need to be renovated , The bed was really comfortable my sleep was very well The breakfast is quite variable and tasty Location is perfect close to the city center and in the same time in very quiet area express train station in the shopping mall to the airport is 10 min by walk 
464277,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, This hotel has one big problem the director is very unprofessional and really unkind With my family I had to stay twice in this hotel The first time We found long black hairs in the bathroom The second one We had problems with one bed sofa When I talked about these things with the director he said he do not wanna talk with the guests he used not just scream but also use very low style expressions as shut up I travelled all over the world and this is the first time I met a director who talk and act in this shame way ,No Positive

464279,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, Too many heavy doors to open to get to the room, Breakfast was great tasty and varied Room was comfortable and super quiet although a bit grim as windows faced a tiny inner courtyard we could see only a tiny bit of sky above 
464280,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The very first pic for this hotel on Booking com shows a big elegant looking building which we thought to be the hotel when in fact it is the building across the street Kind of misleading as we thought we were paying to stay in that nice building The hotel is in sort of an apartment block and ou have to take the elevator up to the 3rd floor for reception Also they won t give to the controller to the air conditioner unless you request it even then I was told we didn t need it as it gets cool in the evenings and we could leave our windows open I said it was too noisy with traffic and sirens but they replied that no it wasn t and it was quite quiet I felt like they were playing the Jedi mind trick on me these aren t the droids you re looking for , I found Jaro at the front desk very helpful and genuine He made the stay enjoyable for me The common areas were clean and nicely decorated The location was about a 5 minute walk to some nice restaurants which was good Breakfast was good with good coffee 
464281,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, TV offer only few channels no EuroSport EuroNews basically nothing useful for a tourist the sun shades could be more efficient darker , very good location right on the Ring 30 from airport 10 from city center little details like decorations and natural flowers in a small vase can make a difference and make you feel welcome very rich breakfast many fresh fruits seeds and cereals perfect start for a busy day
464282,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The bed was too small a queen size for two is not too comfortable The Room also a bit narrow everything was too small and tight to move around, Very good breakfast
464283,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, My room sucked granted it was the cheapest but that was not a room it was a cell with a tiny bathroom that I got into with difficulty That room should not exist, The breakfast was superb one of the best in any hotel that I have stayed at in the last ten years beyond superb
464284,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, DEFINITELY NOT A 4 STAR HOTEL Was expecting a luxurious and comfy hotel with good location and good service Non of my expectations were fulfilled So disappointing place First of all there was unfriendly and unheplfull staff the place is shabby so not were comfortable and did t feel like spending any extra time in the hotel Our room was old and nothing i had expected from the pictures of the hotel rooms I have nothing good to say about the hotel , OK breakfast but otherwise nothing good to say 
464285,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, Locating it mainly due to the complex one way street system dreamed up by the Vienna City Fathers The entrance doors both to the building and hotel reception are too strongly spring loaded , The scrambled eggs were superb The rooms were small but well designed and comfortably furnished 
464286,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The staff is so proud that they work in such a comfortable hotel so they do not even think to help When I asked if I may have a dental kit in my room they answered that they do not have it and their prices are so low so no dental kits I bought tooth brush in pharmacies store nearby and later other hotel team member said that I needed to buy it at the hotel s reception desk But nobody evee offer it a day before Sound isolation is terrible you hear everything happens in corridors next rooms and bathrooms I visit Vienna every half year for business and its the worst hotel I visited in glorious Vienna , Good location in old but clean and well mainted building Nice breakfast 
464287,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The Hotel represent two floors in old building and the access is not the best The parking is not within the building and is it not the most convenient to carry all luggage to the room Overall OK But not the typical Best Western Hotel , Breakfast generous Water should be included in room price at least 0 5L 
464288,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, was left outside late at night no code was sent to me with instruction to access the building The manager named Ecker is very impolite and does not deserve to be there serving guests , nothing
464289,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The room was little bid small for a 4 Hotel but really romantic and full of style There is no proper 24 7 reception You had to ring a bell each time you wanted to get in which was annoying The breakfast is served in the lobby of the hotel Parking in the hotel is extremely expensive 28 eurs day , The location was perfect you could easily get around either by tram or metro but if the weather is nice one could take a bike from the citybike station nearby Breakfast was nice and diverse Great view from the balcony The room was little bid small for a 4 Hotel but really romantic and full of style 
464290,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, Was not told up front that the Tv was not working and awaiting replacement aerial from Germany Wasted some time over two days fiddling with the monitor Sometimes appeared under staffed st reception , Good location to town centr Clean rooms and extensive choice for breakfast 
464291,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, 1 staff not overly friendly the boss yelling at his team from the backroom in a very unpleasant way so the whole lobby could listen to it 2 Rooms where not heated during the day which made it impossible to stay there in the afternoon , good location
464292,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, Not sure where to start I booked this hotel for one night as I was traveling from the airport the next day Firstly there is no lobby at the hotel You come in from the sidewalk into a scary foyer You know you are in the right place because of the signs and labels but other than that you have to figure out the spiral old stairways or elevator When you think you have come to the right place you ring a buzzer and hopefully someone clicks the door open for you Then you are in I had requested an early check in only an hour because of my genius status on Booking com which I learned was nothing or meant nothing In order to check in earlier I had the opportunity to upgrade to a superior room for 12 Euros Waste of time and money The room was small and simple Floor carpets and rugs very dirty Not happy at all with the place , The breakfast was outstanding 
464293,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, Please take in account hotel is located on the 4th 6th floors of the building not on the 2nd and 3rd as discribed on the web page Potential complexity with access to the hotel after 23 00 , Good location Goog breakfast 
464294,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, The staff s attitude I asked nicely for changing a double room to a twin room the manager made me felt like I shouldn t ask if I don t want to pay extra Plus the key card didn t work every single day I had to go down to the reception to change a new card every night at the 3rd night the manager said you must have done something to the card I kept my card in my wallet in my backpack FYI The bed was terrible when someone moved another person would be bounced didn t sleep well for nights, The location and the breakfast
464295,Best Western Hotel Pension Arenberg Wien Zentrum, I forgot my watch which was very expensive and important to me I know its my fault but it would be nice to have it back again Anyway they emailed me back saying there was no watch in the room Of course the one who took it might be happy now with it enjoy it and look after it and see you in hell for stealing instead of reporting the found item to the reception , Good breakfast many options which also suits muslims travellers Friendly staff and close to city centre very good location I did not like the main entrance it looks scary but anyway I would stay there again
