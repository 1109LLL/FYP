344085,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Arrived 12 45 pm were told room would not be available until 3 pm just take a seat in crowded waiting room off loungers This hotel is very popular with large groups Got emails sorted rang London friends and then at 1 30 pm requested our bags be stored as we were going to lunch Was informed our room was ready and was assisted by a receptionist with a very different approach to the original one who by now had disappeared We requested a very early wake up call on our last of 3 nights you guessed it we were told we never requested this after we appeared over 1 hour late which resulted in rushed and chaotic transport to the airport It was only when we arrived at Fort Canning Hotel Singapoe we noticed an email from the Reception Manager that our complaint was correct and they had a failure in their system which effected more than us There are better hotels in Craven Hill nearer Paddington where there are many more accessible eateries in a village atmosphere not on a major roundabout I would recommend that every person who works in reception at this Hotel take a holiday to Singapore and study the manners diligence and attitude of the staff at Fort Canning Hotel Maybe even Mamagement could use the stay as a refresher course , Not much
344086,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Gym needs better heat ventilation and updated equipment Certain areas need a new paintjob , Location was good bartender lady was cute staff was courteous bathtub was a plus too 
344087,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Tiny quibble but on floor signage to rooms uses pale colours on other pale colours not easily visible , Very good breakfast buffet attentive and friendly service in the bar Everyone very helpful 
344088,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The only thing I didn t like and I would like to point out this is just my own personal preference was the bed It was far to hard for me I need a bed with a little bit more give in than being as hard as a rock Also the pillows bascially did nothing you leant on them and it was like you weren t sleeping on any pillows at all Plus the walls between rooms were not very soundproof Saturday evening we were joined by a family in the adjoining room who had an over excitable child who couldn t didn t know how to keep his voice down , I liked how easy everything was to find in the hotel as soon as you walked in you were met by the concierge team who offered a friendly hello and goodbye when you arrived and left the building We were checked in straight away with no hassle and seen promptly All staff were happy friendly at all times 
344089,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, My bed was placed beside the bathroom wall and I was woken several times by flushing water noise from other rooms should of had my ear plugs , The check in was very welcoming and personal Great location and easy walking to Notting Hill Portobello Market Hyde Park Shopping Centre 
344090,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, House keeping horrible doesn t clean well Dirty They leave my cake crumbs for days on all sprinkled on the table Concierge on the evening don t have authority to do anything e g posting something on the guest behalf they ask you to wait till there boss comes in the morning What if I have a night flight Hmmmm, Room service food but breakdast was not nice didn t like the sausages and no other option of bacon for muslim only pork I like the overall comfort of the lobby 
344091,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Staff on the front desk need to listen to the problem and not go on the defensive straight away Sunday morning the reception was having a new carpet with the loudest machine ever it was terrible in breakfast bathroom is old and tired paint on paint if your 6ft you need to bend when you shower as ceiling isn t high enough , THE LOCATION IS SUPERB
344092,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, A bit pricey for my budget really A lovely hotel but clearly needing a bit of an update as looking a bit 90s and need of a lick of paint in places , Good location 
344093,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, There was no comfortable seating area Room I was in had terrible stains on the carpet Shower was too small Toiletries were cheap Room was very tired looking and the black paintwork was disgusting No sweets or juice in fridge and shop in foyer was pathetic,No Positive
344094,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Lack of breakfast variety , The major reason why I will go back to this hotel is because of a staff on the concierge desk Mr Tim I think I needed to make an extremely urgent phone call back home and he assisted me greatly I ll never forget this assistance 
344095,Hilton London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, The staff were excellent but we were in an executive room and the only information was given by the reception staff and it was hard to remember all the information A leaflet in the room explaining the use of the Executive Lounge would have been good We had a problem with the food order in the bar but were given our meal as recompense 
344096,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, rooms dated bath enamel all chipped rubbish shower had issues with payment being debited more than once before stay even though I had booked pay on arrival several phone calls later this was resolved , clean hotel friendly staff lovely breakfast plenty of choice
344097,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, There is no free Wifi in the room The room service gets sometimes confused and chaotic You need to call them repetitively In general it felt more like a regular 3 in terms of staff experience though the check in and check out were extremely efficient The rest of staff was ok but not extra helpful or cheerful You do not get that personalized feeling or warm welcoming face when coming back or going out One feels very anonymous , The hotel is conveniently positioned just outside of city centre but still close to any attractions and just next door to a large shopping mall The facilities are little bit old but they are kept in perfect shape The bed was really comfortable And breakfast had a good variety of choice and healthy options though it might get a little monotonous after few days It is a good compromise between location value and good transport connection The underground station is just 250 M from the property And there is a bus stop just opposite of hotel entrance which will take you to Notting Hill Hyde Park or Hammersmith directly The rooms are solidly equipped though one fights for a space a little The choice of TV programs is English only but with a good variety 
344098,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Bedrooms need updating and decorating , Quiet room view of the leafy street below security air conditioning in the room comfy bed fab breakfast clean 
344099,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Reception personal was very unfriendly and not helpfull There was a bad smell in the rooms and it was also very dark there were also only 2 plugs available but only 1 worked The bathroom was small and the showerhead was fixed to the wall and could not be moved NO FREE WIFI This hotel is not worth its price , Nothing 
344100,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The iron and ironing board were a bit dodgy The indicator on the shower had worn away Beds were too narrow for a regular single bed , The room met the purpose of our stay Good air conditioning 
344101,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Room was far to small and cramped Bathroom filthy with old mould around very cramped shower wardrobe stank of damp and mothballs not fit to hang clothes in Bed was very uncomfortable but mostly unsteady every single move made the whole bed wobble We had to leave early and return home very quickly but would of asked for a better room or checked out that day , Staff were all very pleasant and helpful
344102,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Car parking was expensive direct I found it 100 cheaper for our 4 day visit through parking dot com , Clean hotel freindly staff Great location at Shepherds Bush 
344103,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Slightly too far out of central London had to take a few different tube lines to get from LHR to hotel , Clean and tidy luggage storage was great as you can drop off when you arrive early and leave late 
344104,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, A little disappointed with the prices in the bar overpriced and the set up for breakfast people walking between table of 2 to get to the coffee means there is something wrong with the layout We had to move tables as it was ridiculous , Staff were friendly and location good for hyde park concert 
344105,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, I have stayed in many Hilton hotels and this was probably the worst I expected more from a Hilton Small room tiny bathroom Bedside lights didn t work Bathroom door didn t shut Room was in need of decorating and modernising Bathroom was dated I m tall and I didn t fit into the shower without having to crouch I ve had better breakfasts in other hiltons ,No Positive
344106,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The property show signs of being an older establishment It would certainly benefit greatly from a refurbishment however it was comfortable and convenient never the less , Great location easy to get to from the airport and a quick and easy trip into the city 
344107,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, More staff better standard of breakfast Sort the lifts out, Location The breakfast was very poor by Hilton Standard the cooked breakfast was tasteless better at the local caf Different types of breads non existence Staff very thin on the ground Example attempted to order Poached eggs 10 minutes to order and one morning gave up on the order after twenty minutes For the size of the place there wasn t sufficient staff The access lifts were a joke several minutes waiting for lift 
344108,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, NO EVENING MEAL AVAILABLE ONLY A LIMITED BAR MENU , HOTEL BEING ABLE TO PLACE US IN ADJACENT ROOMS EXCELLENT BREAKFAST WALK IN SHOWER FOR ANYONE WITH A HEALTH ISSUE THE HELPFULL CONCIERGE
344109,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Unfortunately the people in next room where very noisy eventually at 1am rang reception and was moved to a different room a spareroom Not up to standard The staff were good about our problem but had no other room Got our breakfast free on both days as compensation would stay intact hotel again, Location excellent breakfast excellent
344110,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The beds were very hard They did supply an extra topper which helped a little but not the best solution , Breakfast was very well supplied however no gluten free option on display 
344111,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Staff was unfriendly and not professional at all room too small and old We had a very dirty balcony we couldn t use because the door was locked it wasn t even possible to open the window , Nothing
344112,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, cons the rooms are old and in need of refurbishment for the price we paid it is definitely not worth it the toilet is terrible too with no draining system on the floor leaving the floor wet all the time after showering which could have been prevented if there is a proper draining system not to mention the shower head could not be place properly and have to hold it all the time during shower these are basics amenities that should not be overlook , pros near shepherd bush station and westfield shopping mall lovely neighbourhood surrounding the hotel 
344113,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Worst bed I ve ever slept in Hairs in the bath which was chipped no sockets next to the bed which made using my CPAP machine difficult I managed to find a single socket under the bed which saved the day Only one bathrobe when there were two of us and couldn t believe the room was labelled a luxury twin I felt I was in an old room designated for those of us who used a booking site The light shade over the bed was stained and the whole room looked tired Won t be back , Location
344114,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The location was not as central as described The wifi in the bedrooms was not free The rooms very basic and too hot The shower leaked flooding the bathroom , The staff were helpful and friendly
344115,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The decor and furnishings in room 3042 were tired and in need of refurbishment The shower room was pretty tatty and deffo needs refreshed The shower had a sliding door and larger people might have difficulty getting through the space The glass screen was well past its best The room was too hot despite having the air con on at its lowest setting throughout my stay but the temperature outside was 32 degrees , The location was good for my purposes check in was efficient and because it was so hot staff gave out free bottled water and had a large container of iced water with fruit in available in reception There was an ice machine on my floor which was welcome There was also a small fridge in the room The bed was comfortable as were the pillows There were towelling robes and slippers in the room The room was on the small side but adequate with plenty of storage space There was an iron and ironing board in the wardrobe and enough clothes hangers 
344116,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Room we were given was small and had a three quarter bed However they were able to find us another room Room was missed for cleanup after the first night the front desk sent us the necessary towels TC To get us through , Hop on hop off bus had a pickup point right across the street very convenient
344117,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The shower didn t have a cold option the lowest temperature was very very hot The air conditioning wasn t very powerful so the room was too warm in summer, Perfect location for a shopping trip to westfield The shower pressure was brilliant
344118,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Unfortunately due to the weather 32 degrees in London this weekend the air conditioning could not cope in the room therefore it was very hot and stuffy but the rest of the hotel was very cool , Friendly staff great location and close to tourist attractions Checking in was so easy and the staff were very friendly and helpful Parking is secure but be careful as it is a steep slope going into and out of the car park and tight turns but apart from that it was excellent to know your car is safe and secure and reasonably priced Will definitely be using this hotel again 
344119,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Small tired rooms awful even smaller bathroom with broken tap fixings that looked to have not been cleaned properly for some time Tired old shower and bath Virtually no sound insulation so loads of road noise , Great location easy for the tube Helpful and friendly staff 
344120,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The bathroom was a little on the small side but otherwise very clean and functional , Arriving after a long haul flight from Australia I found the check in staff most helpful I chose to stay at this hotel because my friend and I were joining a Trafalgar Tour which left from there We found it easy to get around London public transport was very close The Hotel itself was very clean and welcoming After a long day tripping around London it was really nice to sit in the bar downstairs before dinner and enjoy the ambiance 
344121,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The location was good however the room was extremely below the standard one expects from the Hilton and even though a room change upgrade was granted the standard of room decor cleanliness was extremely poor and I can honestly say I and my colleagues were disappointed especially at the 150 plus price tag per night , The location was good however the room was extremely below the standard one expects from the Hilton and even though a room change upgrade was granted the standard of room decor cleanliness was extremely poor and I can honestly say I and my colleagues were disappointed especially at the 150 plus price tag per night 
344122,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, House keeping should improve their standards and control expesially what comes to bathrooms , Friendly staff and good location Especially if you like to use tube or buses because there s a tube and bus station right next to it Shepherd Bush It was quiet and peaceful and executive room with the lounge access made our stay very pleasant 
344123,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Under Hotel Car parking is convenient but a number of the spaces are small and access is not easy The restaurant is only available for breakfast Dining is in the bar we had to work hard to get a space set for us to eat We were not warned in advance and certainly when I questioned reception about booking into the restaurant they did not advised me it was bar only meals , Hotel is well placed buses stopping to all central locations just outside of the door There is overground and underground train stations close by and an excellent shopping facility in Westfield just next door Tips if you can afford it upgrade to an executive room and this provides you with access to the executive lounge which is great place to relax have a drink or a snack in comfort You also get a really comfortable bed 
344124,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Check in at 3pm this is very late for travellers who arrive on early flights from abroad , Very good breakfast location near Tube Station readily taxi available outside
344125,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Shower in bath Sheets not changed in five nights Rushed room cleaning Many bus trip tours cluttering foyer and facilities , Quiet easy going staff Reasonable but small rooms 
344126,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Not enough power points near the bed Not enough complimentary toiletries Bed was too firm for my liking The room was to hot as well and air conditioning was not adequate, Room service was excellent
344127,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, hotel needs a revamp for the carpets and the paintwork in the corridor and the room bathroom but otherwise ok, the staff were very friendly the breakfast for quality and quantity was the best I have ever seen in a hotel and I have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years and its well positioned for the westfield shopping centre 
344128,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, We were located by the lift and asked to be moved because of the noise of the lift The room we were given was worse as it was on the busy Main Street right outside a bus stop Not very thoughtful considering we asked to be moved regarding the noise Also have to comment how mean it is that only 1 bottle of shower gel and soap for 2 people same with all toiletries only 1 very small bottle not enough for 2 people also same with tea bags and milk ,No Positive
344129,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, No free wifi in the room A bit dated and not as plush as I thought Hiltons were We usually stay in a Premier and will continue to do so , Bed was really comfortable clean and tidy 
344130,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The wallpaper was coming off the wall the bed linen was stained the restaurant offering evening meals was very pricey and the hotel pre authorised double the amount they were suppose to pushing me over my Overdraft Plus there was a lack of communication I originally paid for the room when I booked but wasn t contacted to say my payment had been declined no reason why so it was a good job I checked before travelling, Great selection for breakfast
344131,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Bathroom ceiling was black shower rail was rusty shower head didn t fit properly and was not easy to use water came out in a single stream Toilet dripped Air conditioning was noisy and inefficient Beds are very hard Hotel bedrooms are very old and in need of some money being spent on them would not stay again Drinks in the bar very expensive 16 for a double gin and tonic , The location was good easy to get around Luggage staff were extremely helpful and friendly Good breakfast 
344132,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Sorry There was nothing to dislike , We always stay at this hotel We have family close by and it is convenient for the whole of London Besides that the staff are very friendly and always happy to help Love the place Was not there long enough to use fitness center but have done in the past and would again Will be staying there again in the near future Many thanks to all for an enjoyable stay 
344133,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The air conditioning in the room was very poor with limited cool air on a very hot night Room wardrobe smelt of damp so much so had to hang clothes outside in room,No Positive
344134,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The room was small although this was expected in London The shower flooded the bathroom every time it was used although we were able to use towels to stop this it was a small annoyance The ice machine on our level did not work It was advised that there was a menu in the room for room service there was not The room was cold even the heating was cold The second night I ended up using a towel as an extra layer in bed The duvet didn t stretch over the two of us and my partner slept with the sheet as the duvet didn t completely fill the bedding The bed felt cheap but was okay Our main complaint is with dinner We entered the more relaxed bar for dinner and sat down and noticed everyone around us not too busy was receiving table service We waited and waited for someone to take our drink order no one even said hello After waiting 10 minutes my partner went to the bar and ordered our drinks and also requested a menu and advised the staff that we eating Our drinks were brought over to us while we decided what to eat Again we waited and waited and no one came to take our order even though we had been told that they would My partner again got up and tried to order a few moments later the supervisor came and took our order We ordered two pricey steaks I thought after this we would be taken more seriously We were warned of the 35 minute wait on food and this was fine When our food was brought to us I don t think that the waiter could have got away even faster if he tried We were offered no condiments at all My partner again had to get up and ask for salt I had ordered my steak medium rare I know this offends some people but I hate blood in my food This apparently offended the chef as my steak was more Medium Rare No one came to check if everything was okay with our food and by this point we had just given up on the service , The location is convenient for the tube The room was clean on arrival Breakfast was lovely with a good variety We were able to store our luggage at the hotel the day we checked out 
344135,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The double bed was awful It could creaked every time which woke my sister up every time I got up I could feel the springs on my back The spacing between the bed and the wall where the tv is mounted was a lot smaller than we were expecting and made it difficult for both of us to go to and fro The room was cold although was told that the entire heating system was turned off because everyone felt hot I don t think our heat fan was throwing out cold air An extra blanket was provided on the second night The cleaners made such a racket in the morning waking us up abruptly There was lots of slamming and door bashing had to literally shout out loud to stop the banging Our mugs with leftover tea from the night before were left just covered with the paper lid had to call reception twice to get a set of new mugs Overall we were a little disappointed I wish we said something about the bed in the room If this would have been better I would consider staying again since the location was brilliant , Friendly welcome the gentleman at concierge was delightful and very helpful
344136,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Bathroom was a bit on the small size , I requested a large double bed on my booking form my request was facilitated The bed was very comfortable Reception staff were extremely efficient at check in out Bar staff were very friendly and courteous I would recommend this hotel and look forward to staying there again 
344137,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The room smelt was very dirty the shower left a pool of water in the room and when we complained to reception they done very little if anything to help Worst stay I ve ever had in a hotel,No Positive
344138,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Room was a bit outdated and could do with a bit of modernisation for the money , Location is great for those who want somewhere close to shops Westfield Also close to the Tube station 
344139,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The facilities are seriously in need of a refurbishment as they are outdated and grubby in areas The room size wasn t great The bath had peeling tape in the bathtub and a plug hole which wasn t clean , There was a large queue at check in on arrival and a lady opened up another desk to speed up the process Breakfast was fine with a good selection of food fruits pastries cereals and hot food 
344140,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, as above really the rest was great, the breakfast choice superb modern warm and excellent food in the bar just our room was adequate with a good level of comfort but just on the slightly small side there was an additional table and chair but by the time we laid out the suitcase rack it was limited
344141,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Very small bed in the single room , Location was good bus stop directly opposite the hotel The breakfast was very good All porters extremely helpful and very friendly 
344142,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The co ed fitness center was not so good At least there should be gender specific changing rooms It would be hugely improved with a swimming pool although the Kensington Fitness Center is an easy walk away and a lovely facility , The concierge service was amazing We were steered to wonderful restaurants always with extra attention we felt very well cared for The location is fabulous convenient to the train or bus within walking distance to many great areas and activities It s a beautiful neighborhood and unexpectedly very quiet and peaceful in a big city 
344143,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The sofas in the lobby Far too low for people who are tall back pain or other pains On the day I left I was at the reception at around 01 40 5 people were sitting in the bar drunk loud and effing and blinding Didn t like that at all , The hotel served its purpose for a short stay The staff were courteous friendly and attentive Location is excellent Love the space in the lobby The staff are smartly dressed My room was a nice room with many facilities 
344144,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The bed was so uncomfortable both me and my partner had hardly any sleep The Air conditioning in the room made this horrendous noise when it was on like a lawn mower you either had to have that on or the window open I m not sure what was worse as the hotel was built on a busy main road so you either heard sirens or cars buses outside There was no breakfast included in our hotel so it was a further 15 per person PER day and we stayed for 2 nights in total so would have totaled to 60 , How close the hotel was to Westfield and the Underground over ground 
344145,Hilton London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, The bed was super comfy and the shower was possibly one of the best I ve ever experienced The breakfast was lovely and the hotel was peaceful all night Not only that but less than 10 minutes away are the shops and restaurants would highly recommend

344149,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Might be a bit picky but the long curtains in our room didn t reach the floor after a lateish night the sun came in to early , Friendly staff free bottled water on arrival was a nice touch lovely restaurant menu tube stations close by good price for the location 
344150,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, There was a strong ever present smell of damp water damage in the room I really don t think rooms with this issue should be in service for 165 00 Surely whoever clean and checks the rooms would be aware of such a strong odour , Good facilities friendly staff 
344151,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Old beat up furniture Old rooms Nothing modern Business lounge was really terrible Lack of electricity outlets in the room Not well suited for professionals on travel , This property is not to Hilton standards Very old Needs a complete makeover Not returning 
344152,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The bathroom was unclean with hair from another person in the shower the mattress was lumpy and uncomfortable It was not upto usual Hilton standards , Location is very close to tube station and near London Olympia breakfast had a choice 
344153,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The iron burnt my partners top which the staff were great about provided a new iron and refunded 30 for the top Once home I was left without money as your hotel had pre authorised my payment for the room and then charged on a separate invoice 4 days later I could not travel to work as I had no funds available so had loss of earning s very poor service email for a 4 hotel , The shower was great and large TV 
344154,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, the rooms are in need of a bit or modernisation compared to the reception area and dining room, Nothing really although we did ask for a quiet room and they gave us a room right next to the the lift 
344155,Hilton London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, It was nice to have a glass table and an easy chair also a table for writing The lighting was particularly good all the staff we encountered were very helpful we didn t have the breakfast but next time we might do so I asked a staff member to let me see the breakfast and thought it was very good if a bit expensive
344156,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Need to give your email address to get free Wifi Otherwise they will charge you for Wifi which was unfriendly free service You start to receive unnecessary promotion emails because of this No parking space in front of hotel for check in although you are a guest Noisy at night as the hotel faces a busy street , Close from bus stop and subway to enjoy city trip Good breakfast Nice staff 
344157,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The shower head was flimsy and could not be tightened The bed was creaky and springy The room was very small compared to the cost of the accommodation ,No Positive
344158,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The room standard was poor for a Hilton the first room I was allocated was unusable as the bathroom door didn t open sliding door the second room was small and lacked the feel of quality I expect from a Hilton it was more like a travel lodge quality room The room overall felt in need of refurbishment it was just a bit grubby ,No Positive
344159,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, the cramped gym location in the dark basement is not particularly inviting the low ceilings in the corridors are also depressing I booked through booking com as the Hilton honors site was more expensive I find it unsatisfactory that I do not get credit for my Hilton honours account as I am a repeated and true business customer , room was ok bed was good 
344160,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Room was a bit small and the bed was creaky Bar was overpriced and it took forever to get served , The room was nice and quiet the staff were polite the location was very handy

344164,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Entrance to room was pretty narrow which included the tea making area No complaints beyond that , Hotel staff were efficient and polite Hotel was clean and appealing 
344165,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The facilities are shockingly stale worn tired and definitely overrated given the reviews this place gets and the cost Definitely do not stay on level 1 which is mildewy and decrepit The double deluxe room was pokey cramped and unclean the toilet bowel stained The fridge was barely colder than the outside air the room service poor Having stayed at a number of Hiltons such as Sydney George St and a number of Art Series Hotels I can say this hotel is definitely sub par , The only saving grace for this hotel are that the staff are friendly The facilities are shockingly stale worn tired and definitely overrated given the reviews this place gets and the cost 
344166,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The shower head appeared to be broken as it wouldn t stay up I had to ask twice for extra pillows We had a connecting room and the noise from whoever was staying next door was excessive I only got free wifi in the room because I singed up for Hilton Honours , A great breakfast The room and bathroom were nice and clean 
344167,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Hotel a little old and jaded in terms of d cor etc Ready for some refurbishment Bathroom door wouldn t close shower very small Fridge didn t work neither did the nearby ice maker for two of the three days of our stay , Comfortable bed Good location Relaxed atmosphere 
344168,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The staff where very rude very rush rush the temperature control was outrageous bed was too firm breakfast litteraly made me ill messed up my bill and added extra onto it which was extremely stressful at check out when you have a train to catch I m honestly not a person who moans about things like this but seriously there is no value for money my back is still sore from the bed Will not be going back to any Hilton again Rob you of your money for a rotten stay room was dusty and seen staff bullying a new start in the bar we had the do not disturb sign up and the clearer STILL came into our room the room was a very long walk from the lift also Just really ruined my trip , Not much the shower was ok the toilet roll was soft and was within walking distance of tube
344169,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The aircon was very noisy and not very efficient, Wifi in the bedroom was a real bonus and really useful as we needed to research where we were going each day
344170,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, When I arrived they couldn t find my booking even though I showed my confirmation email Very worrying 5 minutes as I was travelling with my 12yr old Grandson who got quite worried At the concierge desk there is writing on mirrors with coloured markers which I thought was quite tasteless tacky to be honest didn t think it gave a good impression of the image reputation expected of the Hilton TV in bedroom didn t have a signal but to be honest I didn t report this as by time we got in from sight seeing shopping my grandson was too tired anyway , Bed was very comfy room spotless concierge very helpful Breakfast was great a good selection 
344171,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The finishes need updating The carpet was old and worn pealing wall paper and dirty paint in areas , The staff was friendly and helpful and the breakfast was great

344175,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, For the Hilton poor attention to detail in room facilities gaps in ceiling tiles fridge was noisy switching itself on and off Bar food was over priced for a plain sandwich it was 10 it s not the staff s fault they are great , Late night food option bar was a plus 
344176,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Trouble reaching room service TV not functioning due to a plug not being all the way in and that s where room service menu is located Maintenance was quick and very cheery to fix our broken tv the very best employee interaction of our entire visit Then room service wouldn t pick up the phone Had to ring through front desk to get them Our room had wood panels replacing marble in the bathroom The bath was in need of an overhaul and the maids kept it very clean but it was noticeably shabby The concierge who serviced our bags while we were out was rude and abrupt both times we engaged with him Not a good fit for a concierge position He was on a personal call when we first approached When we returned he couldn t find our bags and we had to go hunt for them I m usually very charitable on employee reviews but we had mediocre restaurant service with a very long wait for the food and downright rude concierge assistance , The meal we had was very nice for hotel food Prices were a bit high but it was well prepared The beds were very comfortable great pillows Love the shampoo etc Location near the mall provided a wide variety of restaurants and there were even more down the road in the opposite direction Very close to the tube station The a c worked extremely well and the room was quite comfortable 
344177,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The hotel was very filthy I stayed for an overall 8 nights the coffee I poured myself in the room on the first day of check in was still sitting in my room 4 days later not cleaned After complaining to the manager I was promised increased diligence will be taken the following day on cleaning Guess what I found in my room the next evening same cup of coffee This happened an additional time during my short 8 night stay The carpet was filthy with hair from previous guests I presume The rooms are very small particularly if your are targeting customers coming to shop as there s barely enough room to place your bags and still manage to manoever around the room However small rooms are manageable but cleanliness for the amount of money paid is a non negotiable I picked up bites on my legs that are now very easy to attribute to the levels of unhygienic rooms , The hotel is in a very very good location particularly for overseas clients coming in for shopping and general business in London 
344178,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The room was small Needed maintenance to fix the safe new battery The bathroom door difficult to close and lock The inside of door had no handle, The light breakfast was good
344179,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Gluten free breakfast consisted of nothing more than two small slices of white toast Some cereal or pancakes would have been nice Also the coffee wasn t very warm I ll have to take my own food next time , very comfortable room although small Staff friendly 
344180,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Very poor service as receptionist didnt do as i requested and the manager was far short of useless, Breakfasts were very good The gentleman who i returned the key to was excellent the only one who understood my frustrations 
344181,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, A very large family group who had spread themselves across several bedrooms were incredibly noisy slamming bedroom doors 40 to 50 times through the evening management seemed oblivious , Executive Lounge very good facility to beat the crowds and find some calm

344188,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Room was given wrong When given the right room the double bed had a wooden plank underneath which was visible and made extremely horrible noises when moving around Did not like the cleanliness of the bed or room in general very disappointed to quality, Breakfast and staff at breakfast very helpful and friendly
344189,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The hotel advertises free Wifi but conveniently forgets to leave out the fact that the wifi in the rooms is not free What is the point as i booked the hotel based on free wifi for work purposes The gym is very old and outdated and not very clean I chose this hotel because it had a gym The lifts sometimes did not work as it was not registering room cards , Modern hotel Great location

344194,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Overpriced paid for upgraded larger room which was tiny and bathroom miniscule Was credited back the upgrade cost but 17 00 for glass of wine and a pint and 19 00 pp for breakfast Taxi and tube fares meant it would have been worth paying more for staying in Zone 1 as we did on previous visit If you are visiting theatres expect 30 for taxis, Hotel was up to standard but nothing special and rooms were tiny
344195,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The room was so disappointing very small the shower was filthy dirty and the bed was rock hard with an improvised piece of wood under the mattress because the bed had broken We we re welcomed with 1 complimentary tea bag per person in the room which we could enjoy with 1 biscuit All of this luxury comes at about 180 a night Thanks Hilton you money grubbing mean spirited cheapskates Thanks for nothing , The location of the hotel was excellent for public transport to central London attractions and theatres

344198,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Checking in was only disappointment only told room was on the left in fact it was on fifth floor Not told times or where breakfast was being served Also not happy had to use key car in lift and when came in late via front door as key card never worked Bar staff very helpful and friendly but need to know how to make a proper pina colada , The comfort of hotel and breakfast was great Good location near tube stations I

344206,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Beds could be more comfortable Find it peculiar that a choice of whether to have breakfast from one day where it costs 19 to the following day where it costs 28 No mention of wifi whether it was free or not and how to access it Building is dated from the outside with a modern interior , Location is ideal for visiting the Westfield Shopping Centre or Kensington itself

344211,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Bathroom was for disabled person which was not a problem to us the only slight issue the disabled taller toilet meant your legs wouldn t fit under the lowered sink which made it a bit awkward, Bed very comfy room clean and tidy breakfast very good selection and taste 
344212,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, I have never slept in such an uncomfortable bed I woke up with a terrible back ache an I m only young The room was double the amount iv paid at other hiltons yet the room was half the size Upon arrival we requested an iron to be brought to out room an whilst walking round the room with no clothes on the staff member chose to let himself in the room without knocking , The breakfast was really lovely an the hotel was very clean and grand

344227,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The price of the breakfast was 14 per person therefore we had to use a local cafe around the corner who were charging 5 pp for the same service I know the hotel is first class but it didn t justify that price , The comfort and quietness of the room The pleasantness of the staff 
344228,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Executive room smallest ever stayed in with very basic facilities Single beds and virtually no room to walk around them Bathroom very small equivalent to a very poor quality hotel , Staff excellent
344229,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The times the rooms were getting cleaned I found that it was way too early I had a knock on the door Sunday morning at 9a m while I was getting for breakfast and on my arrival day after just getting into the room they were knocking to come in to clean after it had already been cleaned for check in , The room was amazing and the breakfast was a fabulous buffet great for the money and lots to choose from 
344230,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The room was in poor condidtion for the money payed the bathroom door didn t lock and wasn t attached at the bottom there was what looked like tea stains on the light fittings the shower was cold and the general feel to the room was poor in comparison to our stay previously in an executive suite, The room was made daily and the location was ideal for westfields and out event location within walking distance

344239,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The hairdryer in our room did not work which I didn t find out until I had washed my hair It took three phone calls and 30 minutes past and by this time I had managed to dry my hair with a towel and my straighteners Not a good start to the day The bacon for breakfast is tasteless and like cardboard even when it came fresh out of the kitchen, The reception staff were so welcoming I work in customer service and I would definitely employ them The hotel is just across the roundabout from the tube Large variety at breakfast you would never be hungry

344244,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The bed was small and extremely uncomfortable the door into the bathroom made a large noise when opened or closed this waking up the other person if used late at night the size of the room was small To be fair I have used Hilton brand when I have travelled with work abroad and even the double tree brand in America and the Kensington hotel was a poor hotel rooms are tired feels like they are using the brand name but forgot what their values are, The location of the hotel and the variety available at breakfast
344245,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Noise railway station atmosphere messy out of date rooms stained room carpets disappointing overall quality for such a high name hotel chain Expensive on site car parking , Not very much but great breakfast 
344246,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Didn t have any toilet roll weren t any bin bags in my bins there were coat hangers all over the wardrobe and the previous tenants shampoo was still in the shower felt like it was cleaned in a hurry so the housekeeping could have been better , Professional and helpful staff beautiful layout nice rooms

344249,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The tea coffee wasn t restocked in the room bins in room weren t emptied Bathroom was a bit small There was an extra 50 charge taken at booking for any extras this wasn t explained when booking was made on line However this was taken off final payment at check out if no extras taken , Concierge was very helpful especially liked that we could leave the case in safety at the hotel after we checked out so we benefitted from another day sightseeing without the hassle of carrying a case
344250,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The bed was awful too small for two too hard Very tiny bathroom, Breakfast was very good with a big selection for everyone but you have to come early to get a seat fast shopping mall near to the hotel

344252,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Dim lighting heating giving out cold air and cleanliness in the toilet was poor in the room we were given however moved is to a better one after we conplained to reception , Lovely welcoming staff and very helpful
344253,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, First room was so much smaller than advertised Eventually was moved to the room I booked So many little things were wrong No robe wrong paper delivered salad not as advertised safe in room didn t work room wasn t cleaned properly and on and on it went , Rooms were quiet Guest relations manager was helpful and apologetic 
344254,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The bathroom was not equipped with the shower gel and had one shower towel The shower had not been properly cleaned as the base of shower has soap residue which I have taken photos of The sauna area had a strong smell of urine and the steam room had a terrible smell at which point my mother left as she was so disappointed The following morning we went down to order breakfast but was left standing for 25 minutes before deciding to go and question this at reception The receptionist just looked at us with a blank look and then looked at her collegue who was dealing with a customer of her own The showers were cold throughout we even ran the water for up for 5 minutes before attempting to take a shower with NO luck , Nothing I was a terrible experience I took my mother as she had flown from America for her birthday Upon arrival the receptionist was very sad looking and booked us in on a very unpleasant manner 
344255,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Room advertised as double but was a small double and the room itself was extremely cramped If I was aware of the room size on ordering I would have gone for another option The walls were paper thin and we could hear everything from all four adjoining rooms left right above and below I mean hear everything The proposed cost for guest WIFI was ridiculous basic internet should be included as standard Disappointed there was not a bath and while the shower was a good enough size the aging seals in the shower door were black and quite unseemly The bathroom door did not close properly Breakfast the food itself was lovely Good selection and plenty on display However while there was a large number of staff working the breakfast there was quite a delay in any of the ordered options The coffee machines coffee was Luke warm at best that could have been bad luck with one of the three machines available Dinner Service was very slow during dinner in the bar restaurant Had an issue with the food we ordered which was addressed at the time by the manager on duty however I wouldn t chose to eat there again nor would I recommend it Dinner issues V Slow service poor wait staff food was dropped into my lap on arrival Starter overdone to the point of being rubbery Burger was so greasy that it leaked a significant pool onto the table to the point that it totally soaked my napkin when I cleaned it up , Bed was comfy and breakfast was ample The staff were very helpful during breakfast service 
344256,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Wifi code only valid for limited amount of time, Lovely clean hotel Right across from overground underground station Westfield shopping centre

344258,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Nothing comes to mind, The staff within the bar area were very attentive The gym was an ok size and luckily quiet otherwise would be too crowded Rooms were an ok size but we only slept in it 
344259,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, When we arrived and got to the hotel we walked into a room with musty smell and stains in the floors The air was very bad and we tried to fix it by opening the window We went out for a tour off the city and went right to sleep when we got back I woke up a couple of times due to the neighbaurs were going in and out of their rooms It s really loud In the morning I took a shower and discoverd why the room had such a musty smell THERE WAS A MOLD IN THE SHOWER My boyfriend went downstairs to talk to some one and they said they would have a look at it and fix it By fix it they put some spray on it And that was it I really was not happy about it and went back downstairs to complain again and we were moved to another room If I haden t already payed for the stay I would have walked right out but it was my boyfriends birthday just a lovely way to spend your birthday That room was O K but I noticed when the cleaners clean your room they don t change your mug they just was it in the room not sure where or with what But it had a lipstick mark for the two last days of our stay not mine so don t use the mugs If there would be a puking smiley to descripe the stay I would propably use that one TLDR Mold in the shower Musty smell They do not change the mugs when new guest go in the room , Location 
344260,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Unimpressed with the bed considering this was Hilton hotel Hardly any staff working so waited a good while to get checked in room service took 15 mins to answer the phone then over 45 mins to deliver very poor attempt of pea soup and a terribly salad I never moan usually but I stay in hotels every single week all over the uk and this wasn t great not for Hilton and the cost per night, Location Friendly staff
344261,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The room was very warm even when we had the heating air conditioning I m not sure which one was it was in the room on the cooler settings the light on the coolest setting of the heating air conditioning didn t light up blue as the light on the second coolest did so it was difficult to know if the heating air conditioning was on and there was a stain on the carpet by the table where the window was it looked like a tea or coffee stain and the chair at the table that you sat on with the mirror in front of you had a red nail varnish stain on it but other than that I can t fault the room the two stains are small details which is why I gave the hotel a 4 for cleanliness I also gave the hotel a 4 for comfort because our room was very warm even when we had the heating air conditioning on and the light on the coolest setting of the heating air conditioning didn t work as previously stated , The professionalism of the staff especially at breakfast was impeccable as was the breakfast the idea of infusing water with fresh fruits spices and leaves is very creative and I throughly enjoyed drinking it I work in catering and hold a management level food Hygiene certificate so I know my legislation and everything was in order I would like to also praise the breakfast assistant with the ginger hair for his faultless service and for the F B assistant who collected my plate at breakfast on Tuesday morning who dropped the knife on the floor by mistake I picked it up for him and stuck it on my plate because he was carrying my plate and a few others in his hands he was so apologetic and grateful for my help I didn t read the staff members name tag with the ginger hair and the only two things I remember was he had ginger hair and he also worked on the Monday at breakfast and delivered the same standard of service then so if anyone could pass on my message tell him it s from the gentleman who was with his blonde girlfriend partner that asked if the waffle came with maple syrup on Tuesday morning at about 10 40 and the gentleman myself was also carrying a glass of water and orange juice as well as a plate of breakfast he was doing something nearby at the time and being in the catering industry I knew certain tasks and the display of breakfast had to be kept in the right I didn t want to disturb him out of courtesy once he d finished what he was doing he could see what I was carrying could well have ended up on the floor and followed me and said very politely I take that for you sir and took the glass of water from my hand and took it to our table I would ve given him at least a 10 tip if he was our waiter breakfast assistant if we had been in a restaurant I didn t have any money on me at breakfast had I done I d have certainly given him some money to say thank you because the standard of his service was perfect and was 
344262,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, No free Wifi The bathroom was a little out of date along with the old carpet in the room , The bed in the room was very comfortable and the breakfast was good lots to chose from The location itself was good 5 minute walk from Westfield Shopping

344266,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, That there was no option for stairs I believe You can only get the rooms by lift I did ask a member of staff where the stairs were but they didn t understand and after a few minutes they just walked off and ignored me , The breakfast was one of the best I have had at a chain hotel in the UK 
344267,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Very small breakfast room service was 25 for one person Arrived after 45 minutes cold with cold tea and missing two items Would expect better service and quality for that money , Great location with parking Nice hotel and good value accommodation 
344268,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The bed was lumpy and uncomfortable The varnish was coming of the wood which made it look run down , The location was good and the shower in the bathroom was amazing
344269,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The room was very small and cramped so much so the bathroom door was a sliding one There was a rather large damp patch outside the bathroom door and the wallpaper out in the corridor that the bathroom was next to was pealing off indicating that this issue has been ongoing for sometime Minimum supply of tea and coffee for the room All in all overpriced , Comfortable bed
344270,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, All good could not fault our stay, Very good value for money all good but breakfast was excellent asked for a quiet room but was booked in first floor by road asked if they had a quieter room then put on 3rd floor didn t hear a thing 
344271,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The room was soo tiny and dusty i think they gave us a double single use because when we arrived the vanity set was only for 1 person and even the bed was just a little bit bigger then a single one We found cobwebs near radiator at our arrival really big i didnt sleep at all because of the dust hitch i have dust allergies and because of cobwebs we arrived late so we made a complain only the following day Reception staff was very nice they wanted to set up another room for us but only for one night i didnt want moove so they clean the room better and exept for the tiny bed i could sleep the second night , The best thing was absolutely breakfast lots of choice and you could order your pancakes waffles homelettes directly from the table Staff as well very nice and helpfull Close to Shepherd Bush tube just 5 minutes walking central line 
344272,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Wifi was unreliable and patchy at cost an additional 30 00GBP, Great hotel for a short weekend trip to London Close to underground and other transport options Easy walk to a broad selection on restaurants and bars Room was a good size clean and the staff were very accommodating and helpful I arrive early in the morning and they enabled me to check in 5 hours early Great customer service 
344273,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The hotel is very dated and needs an urgent upgrade Lobby reception and bar area are just about OK still but the rooms are very dated and are not very clean The bathroom as well was not up to standard and cleanliness in this hotel is really a problem The carpets are dirty all over wall paper coming loose everywhere and the floor we stayed on smelled terrible , The staff were great and went out of they way to accommodate any request one might have Great location and close to Westfield Shopping Centre where there are quite a few restaurants 
344274,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The room was very small very dirty carpet and armchair outdated bathroom In our 2nd day there no one came to clean our room we had to buy our own shower gel which I think is unacceptable for a 4 hotel On the 3rd day we have asked for shower gel and toilet paper They came to clean the room around 3 30pm Not to mention that we had no cover for the bed no extra blankets One of the days the cleaning service knocked the door once at 9am and entered the room without even waiting for an answer or anything Well we were sleeping and it was really unpleasant, I did like the breakfast and the breakfast staff were very friendly
344275,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Hilton had not mentioned my special request at the time of booking reception staff didn t have any idea of the occasion , It was my 37th year Anniversary and I had mentioned it in my special requirement space but once we got to reception they had no clue and didn t know anything about the occasion I just thought what a shame that Hilton Media didn t pass on the message to staff is not everyday you have a couple to stay for weekend to celebrate their 37th marriage Thank you Floria Nadershahi
344276,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The double room was relatively small especially had we been two all days and there was no space to place luggage , Wonderful breakfast The wifi in the room worked very well The room was very clean cleaned daily The hotel is just 5 mins from Shepherd s Bush tube station 
344277,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Was quite expensive but was well worth it, Straight away when I walked in to the reception I was greated with a warm smile and was given amazing service I was early so was made sure my bags were stored away and were later placed in my room for me when it was ready The rooms are so spacious and the bed is incredibly comfortable One of the best hotels I have stayed in 
344278,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The rooms for a Hilton where a bit worn The shower in the morning was like warm and pressure was not good, The hotel was quiet but offered a lounge bar and restaurant Staff where helpful Very handy for shepherds bush tube and the westgaite shopping mall tons of options for eating

344282,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Small room compared to a premier inn and not enough gluten free items choice for breakfast Gf toast was standard and limited other choice Cleanliness could have bettter, Quickness of checking in
344283,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Room was disgusting plug sockets falling off the wall Tap on the sink was falling off and no hot water in the shower Just had to sit on the bed for it to make a noise and the heating didn t work and just made a banging sound all threw the night The paper thin walls also means you are awake at 6am , Hotel was in a convenient location
344284,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Uncomfortable bed and we asked for an extra bed that never was received Heather didnt work properly and was not fixed even when reported , Kindness of Concierge and bell boys
344285,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, While this hotel may technically just scrape into the geographical bounds of Kensington no Londoner would dare call it anything other than Shepherd s Bush , The staff were very courteous and the buffet breakfast was comprehensive

344288,Hilton London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, The check out time being 12 noon meant we were able to have a leisurely Sunday breakfast With breakfast service stopping at 11 00 it fitted in nicely As we sat having a coffee in the breakfast room the staff made no noise that we were in the way allowing us to relax You certainly don t get that it other hotels 
344289,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The room was dated bathroom door was hard to open and shut also didn t close all the way The bathroom was not clean we had to wash the shower out Not value for money the bed was quite hard and the fridge was not very cold and it was dirty Also my reservation confirmation said I had breakfast but when checking in I was told it didn t include breakfast , The staff were very friendly the hotel was easy to get around The shower was very good apart from there being no actual door so water went outside the cubicle The air con heating was very good 
344290,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Housekeeping could have been better we had to ask for towels at reception as they hadn t been put in our room on the first day no bottled water on the first day either , Great breakfast to set us up for the day Great location only a few stops form Oxford Street on the tube 
344291,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Buffet breakfast good idea but on both mornings the food was cold Toast was hardly browned could not adjust settings not a good start to the day, room was good bed very comfy breakfast cold not good
344292,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, It could have been cleaner The shower room smelt damp the carpet was dirty and the corner location of the room did not provide a very nice outlook for the cost Parking was extortionate too There is no need to add so much to park for 24 hours , I didn t like much about this hotel The staff were mostly very nice and the location OK

344296,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The funds were taken out of my account twice which caused me an inconvenience plus I had to pay a 50 deposit that I felt was unnecessary due to them already having my bank details I also asked to move rooms as the first room was nothing like the picture and there was mould in the bathroom To be fair they moved our room without issue, Nice area good access to transport and shops
344297,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Room was fairly basic for a Hilton Very small bathroom and shower Nothing explained on check in just handed keys Had to wait to hand over and collect luggage on arrival and departure as there was no concierge available , Great location Nice bar area and friendly staff Fabulous breakfast 
344298,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The pathetic front office personnel who would need to be more courteous and needs proper training Lack of manpower in the front office making guests stand in queue for long The housekeeping personnel are equally pathetic with little or zero knowledge of English and working in a hotel in London Hardly takes care of the cleanliness of rooms and toilets bathrooms Atleast train them to speak English which is the least one can expect in a hotel in London , The location The coffee shop 
344299,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The house keeping because all the time they will wake me up early thinking I m about to leave but I was not at all I was asleep, Some staff member but the cleaners kept knocking on the door everything when I was asleep

344303,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Internet wifi poor Small room size , Central Location Easy to move about The Hop On Hop Off tour picks you directly in front of the hotel Huge shopping mall just 5mins walk 
344304,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, There are no staircases and I found this very strange and rather annoying When a bus tour came in the lift wait was at least 10 minutes or more , The fact that it was so close to the tourist attractions but far enough away for it not to be in your face 24 7 
344305,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The staff was extremely unfriendly Quite arrogant to be honest The housekeeping was very late all three days of our stay They came at 5pm so we were already back at the hotel We had to call the staff four times in order to get the slippers and bathrobe that were to be included in our order Very unsatisfying ,No Positive

344312,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The room was small but ok The breakfast was a little disappointing Had to wait for ten minutes to be seated The continental choice was limited and the coffee and orange juice from the machines was poor , The reception and bar area was very welcoming 
344313,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Sofa beds are really not good at all, I had a terrible first night sofa bed experience in the junior suite But the next day the manager was amazing and compensated us with a beautiful executive suite and 20 off the bill I thank his name was Cameron if I still remember Thank you for saving the rest of our holiday 
344314,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Allowing customers to play the piano in the lounge particularly when they were poor players Disrupted the ambience of the seating area , Very friendly and helpful staff

344334,Hilton London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, The location was great about a 10 minute walk to the bars restaurants and shops of Holland Park Notting Hill is only around 20 minutes walk away easy access to the tube station of Holland Park central line making it easy to travel around London bus stop outside the hotel for even easier access for travel around London 
344335,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, no complaints though hotel maybe a little too far away from centre of London for some people advised to obtain oyster card as this makes for easier travel around London, the hotel well positioned near underground services has large shopping mall within easy walking distance with plenty of restaurants available there and in the local area so no need to travel into centre of London if you just want quite night out check in very quick and easy staff welcoming room very clean and beds very comfortable comfortable large fluffy towels plenty of toiletries available quite hotel no noise at night

344345,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, My room smelt of cigarettes The carpet was very stained needs pulling up Not of a standard I d expect of a 200 a night hotel Bed was not that comfortable Maybe my expectations of staying at a Hilton Hotel were in unrealistic for the price but I expected better quality , Location was excellent for public transportation Staff very friendly

344350,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, I chose the most expensive Executive Suite on Booking com to make sure the quality of the room for my boss I went there before to try to have a look but were refused which I could understand that the room was occupied by other guests I didn t go to the hotel again and insist to check the suite before because I trust Hilton But when I checked in I found it s not a real suite at all The suite is composed by two single rooms actually And the most ridiculous thing is that I got the room key from the bedroom which becasue it is nearer to the lift The bedroom is really small as others the space between the large bed and the TV is too narrow to turn around for a normal size adult And the door inside to the living room is too small to be recognised at first glance Therefore you can imagin when we opened the door and 7 people wanted to walk in the room followed my boss how embarrassed and upset and uncomfortable we were at that moment Obviously there is no enough space for us at all And there is no chance for us to sit down and to have a causal chat with my boss during his trip because we should pass by his private bedroom There is another door from the living room can be used only I knew it when I checked out three days later But the living room s door is far more away to the lift which you could not want to use it anymore It s the first time my boss went to London for a business trip after 10 hours direct flight I don t want to mention how disappointed and sad I was and how unsatisfied my boss was again Generally Hilton Hotel is what we trust and use all over the world But I will certainly not choose it in London next time ,No Positive

344474,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Showers over the bath a BIG NO NO Disabled elderly or person with leg or balance issue how do they shower Lengh of time to take orders at the Bar cafe was excessive Time for orders to arrive more than an hour and then 3 meals came which had nearly been finished before the last one arrived This made us walk to Westfeild Restuarant area to eat from then on Breakfast over price and coffee from machine terrible ,No Positive
344475,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, A long queue to check in and check out at reception , Bedroom very comfortable including bed Bathroom modern clean well stocked Buffet breakfast excellent service excellent with friendly helpful staff Restaurant evening food in The Avenue restaurant excellent service excellent good value for money A lovely overall experience 
344476,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Our room was located at the very far end of the floor in the building which meant we had a long walk back to our room from the lift especially after walking from the station It would have been nice if the front desk staff arranged for a room closer to the lift, Excellent customer service when we checked in early we were told our room was ready Also rang to advise the air condition was playing up and reception send the maintenance guys who came in 10 minutes and fix the problem The hotel is walking distance to Shepherds bush station Nice to shop Westfield Breakfast was very good had a good variety and good service
344477,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Room was smaller than expected Bed also quite small for a double bed Shower was tiny and roof very low Bathroom door was unhinged with no lock Shower didn t drain properly and kept overflowing onto floor Was also told different prices for breakfast by hotel staff which resulted in us having to go elsewhere for breakfast as wasn t happy with being charged more than had been told at check in Not what you would expect from a 4star Hilton hotel I might aswell have been in a Travel lodge Definately wouldn t return Sorry ,No Positive
344478,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, wifi connection can be free rooms can be cleaner larger and newer, location and friendliness of staff at reception ease of check in out breakfast drinks area at ground floor

344480,Hilton London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, Once we had gone to the room it was so small that I had difficulty sleeping in it Spent the night walking around the hotel after speaking with the night manager he arranged for us to upgrade to a larger room at no extra cost and had our luggage placed in the room so that we could go out and enjoy the day
344481,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Staff too keen to remove breakfast when not finished one day we got juice then went to get breakfast the juice had been cleared away Noisey air con in room and milk for tea and coffee was off Staff also removed my own wine glass from room , Breakfast amazing
344482,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The bathroom was awful so old for a Hilton Hotel it was a real let down For breakfast all i needed was coffee and pastry but wasnt allowed in the dining room for that , The room was fine the location was great and the door men were very helpful
344483,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Free Coffee Tea counter can be much better maintained When informed staff member that person didn t appear too interested in attending to the concern nor was it resolved , Most everything was very nice 
344484,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Gym sauna facilities well below par Also a lot of street noise due to location of the room , Breakfast and bar lounge area Location was perfect

344487,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, I booked a double room and was given a sort of single one That has been extremelly disappointing since the hotel is not cheap , Bar and breakfast are just great
344488,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, I left my very expensive shampoo i the bathroom of our room and when i called up to ask for them tp send via post but the lady on the phone told me it was not there My shampoo is 36 00 20 00 conditioner I was very shock a high end hotel staff would steel my products I will not stay again as i feel the company could of made more of a effort to find my products , Breakfast
344489,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, would be nice if the rooms were up dated , staff were great breakfast was great our room was always really clean they have a great cleaning staff would stay again 
344490,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, As A BRANDED hotel free wifi is basic services to provides for house guest As now many hotel even budget hotel or sevices apartment also provides free wifi,No Positive
344491,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Sadly this was a major let down as far as a Hilton hotel is concerned and I have stayed in many so to say I was shocked is an understatement The carpet hadn t been hoovered there were stains everywhere including in the curtains The bathroom had rust and the air vent was covered in dust and had clearly not been cleaned prior to our arrival Not to mention I was locked out of the hotel and not allowed in as I did not know my room number despite me advising the staff member via intercom that I had not looked at the door number due to me arriving at checking literally putting our bags in and immediately leaving as it was nothing hill carnival He then went on to argue with me until another hotel guest kindly stated their door number and only then were we able to gain access this was gone 2am so he could have potentially placed me and my friend as females in a vulnerable position as were were locked out onto the street that we were not familiar with baring in mind we paid for this hotel This review could go on but I think I have made my point I am disgusted , Maybe the ice machine on the landing and the other guests I met during my ordeal Apart from that it is a major negative and I will not be staying again 
344492,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Rooms are small with old furniture Some room ammunities were missing Restaurant staff was not as friendly and helpful as front desk staff and we have to insist for a good sitting location for the entire family and despite of this we did not get while other gusts did Car park is small and exiting car park is bit confusing and tedious , Location and provided price were excellent front desk staff was very friendly and helpful breakfast was as per the expectation 
344493,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Pillows too soft so didn t sleep great and by the end of my stay had a site neck, The staff were excellent attentive and when there was an issue it was dealt with superbly
344494,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, location is good for moving arround London but there is not nothing interseting in the area nothing to do at walking distance , convenient relationship price quality Good facilities and guarantee all is good enought as all Hilton s usually 
344495,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Disappointed our room wasn t ready until 4pm which then upset our plans for the evening in the city centre Small bedroom with a VERY small bathroom Although the bed was comfortable it had very sharp corners and because the room was small we often hurt our legs walking round the bed , Comfy bed 
344496,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The toilet door would not close The bathroom shower was hard to get in and out bothroom not very clean, Breakfast was great Position of hotel wad great Bus stop right outside Staff were great 
344497,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, No warning of 50 deposit and u held 288 of mine I was confused about this as I wasn t told u would do this I telephoned the hotel for an explanation, Cleanliness and breakfast excellent
344498,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Massively disappointing stay First booked two rooms second room didn t get the key for until 1900 in the evening despite on booking form saying it would be ready at 1500 No apology given Wife had to collect the key as I needed to go out for the evening given hard time as was booked in my name Bar restaurant in the evening over hour wait for sharing platter 20 minutes to wait for a table despite being almost empty 40 minute wait to be seated for breakfast hot buffet constantly running out of food Maids knocking on door first thing in morning to see if we were leaving so they could get in to sort room felt pushed out of the hotel , Beds ok
344499,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The bedroom is in urgent need of a refurb The bathroom again is in need of a refurb but it gets worst the shower tray and screen we re discusting and we decided not to have a shower This needs sorting out asap Not happy, Great location
344500,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, We booked 3 family rooms for 4 nights well in advance On the day of arrival we had to wait 30mins to check in because the hotel did not prepare our rooms in advance They managed to mess thing up again on the 2nd night One of the rooms aircon was broken what we got was a fan not impressed , Nothing
344501,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The entire hotel is just old old old and dirty And it is way too busy we had to queue everywhere check in luggage storage breakfast concierge , They collected our mail well
344502,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Bathroom door was quite stiff so was hard to open and shut properly , Happy for us to drop bags and begin the check in process earlier in the day than the stated time Room was spacious and clean Breakfast great Less than 5 mins walk from Shepherd s Bush tube station which takes you directly into the city centre so perfect for going to the theatre without having to stay in the centre of London
344503,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Staff at breakfast were rude I felt unwell they had run out of water so asked for water and for if to be brought to the table Staff member said I ll get some it will be up there pointing to its counter position I thought a four star and above hotel has to give you table service if you request it even if they offer a buffet style breakfast When I went to get the water using its wine cooler stand a staff member came over wipped away the cooler leaving the bottle on the table without saying a word rude Reception staff were brilliant the gentlemen that checked us in on arrival went above and beyond allocating our rooms together for my friends 60th celebration stay and he remembered us when we checked out asking us about our weekend he was the hotel s saving grace , Beds were really comfortable good variety of fresh food at breakfast and liked having bottled water Position of hotel great for public transport links Bus stops picks up right outside the hotel takes you to all the main attractions Tip buy your all day travel card day before so you can hop straight on the bus in the morning when you start your day of sightseeing 
344504,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, I had to get the key redone EVERY SINGLE TIME I left the room Last night I had to make THREE trips to reception The first time she said it was because I had kept it next to an Oyster card After that I had simply held it in my hand but it still failed , Decent facilities in the room iron etc 
344505,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Lots of problems check in was a nightmare our friends didn t get a room until after 12 15 am and the bar staff either didn t know what they we doing or were very rude , Breakfast and Jakob the night manager after sorting out our problems 
344506,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, A lengthy wait to check in on a rainy day with tickets booked for the evening made for a rush to get ready for the evening Plus we were not given the room we booked , Corner room with two windows was light and airy if a little small 
344507,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Hotel Restaurant massive let down food was expensive and very poor quality E g The nachos was just chips and canned salsa pizza not even cut to eat , Location was amazing close to tube shopping and dinner scene 
344508,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Can t think of anything , The breakfast was lovely and there was a very good choice Also considering the location and the facilities the price was very reasonable The staff were extremely efficient and friendly and would definately stay again 
344509,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Room was pokey in size dirty well used Bed was squeky and uncomfortable Had a sore back in the morning TV placed badly Kept hitting my head off of it Room very small Myself and my wife had to strategically place outselves just to get past each other NO FREE WIFI in a hotel in 2016 Go figure , Friendly staff and location
344510,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The room was very dated and could do with refurbishing as the furnishings looked tired and the carpet was quite stained We were disappointed to find that the room also had a lingering smell of cigarette smoke This wasn t too bad once the aircon had been on for a while Also the mini bar fridge was not working , The bed was very comfortable and the room clean Breakfast was satisfactory but could have been better they kept running out of bread for toast and there did not appear to be enough staff on duty to cope with the number of people in the restaurant The food was good and there was a wide choice of different things to eat 
344511,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The service was shocking Twenty minute wait for drinks 30 minute wait for checkin to be told we will ring you in half an hour which didn t happen Returned to check in an hour and a half later and again had to queue for 30 minutes Breakfast next morning queued for forty minutes for a table at breakfast, Lication was good and liked the hotel but won t be returning due to shocking service
344512,Hilton London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, Bed very bad Shower not working and to top it all they took a random some out of my account which i didnt agreed to This is not the card that was used to pay for our stay Have emailed them but no answer
344513,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, would have liked use of the fridge but was afraid to even open the door in case we disturbed the bar , the fact that we could actually open a window it is not always possible in modern large chain hotels 
344514,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The room was looking a little tired In the bathroom the door looked like it had had a flood and was damaged Trying to work out where the lights switched on was interesting , the bed was lovely and big and comfy and with the lovely thick curtains the room was nice and dark to enable us a good nights sleep 
344515,Hilton London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, Excellent staff Breakfast really good The only problem I had was the bed I did complain and receved an excellent and prompt solution Would deffinatly stay here again

344517,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Bit unclear about parking costs We were sure we d paid online but they said we hadn t then gave it us complimentary I m sure we paid for it ago me of booking, Fab room service great parking and location was perfect
344518,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The bathrooms in the room were extremely small The cleaning staff were not very keen on the cleanliness of the room, The wifi was strong and very convenient Spacious elevators Rooms were spacious compared to London hotels and the beds were comfortable The area was very calm and quiet minimum noise And close to Londons well known parks Conveniently bus stop located in front of the hotel 
344519,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The ladies serving food and drink in the executive lounge were the rudest people I have ever come across in my life, Bed was comfy Ian on the check in desk was amazing gym was good executive lounge was lovely breakfast was so nice great location from the airports and the city right across from westfield shopping centre
344520,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The fridge in the room did not work Pillows were very uncomfortable , Room was clean Great Location we took the 94 bus from right outside the hotel to oxford street 
344521,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The toilet fittings were not working properly water temp broken fixtures etc the bedside phone was down during my entire stay and not fixed even when I reported it in , The staff were friendly and tried to help which is appreciated 
344522,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The air conditioning did not work complaint to front desk went unanswered until I fronted up next morning The fridge did not work In house dining outrageously expensive Stayed in many Hilton Hotels and this was by far the worst ever , Breakfast was excellent
344523,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, everything, beds were squeaky dust in few places heating didn t work 14wifi shower no door floor got really wet could of broke out neck bathroom was wet everywhere 
344524,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The carpet had the odd stain on it , Bed very comfy especially the pillows Very friendly reception staff Noise wise I only heard the odd siren Clean bathroom 
344525,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Reception staff were so nice could not do enough for us but we asked for the duvet and pillows to be changed and house keeping sent a young lad up with a duvet and pillow with no covers on them We asked for two pillows and he said that s all we have and offered no help But reception were able to get us more,No Positive
344526,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The room was too small Carpets were dirty Walls were two thin and placed next to the lift so constant noise No free wifi in the rooms and not freely available required to request the passcode at the front desk , The location was perfect Close to various train stations 
344527,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The hotel is not at the level of the other hotels of Hilton Group The lights in the room are very poor and insufficient and in general the level of the main hall living point at groundfloor and the room, The staff is friendly and prompt but the reception is not available to put at ease foreign customers and makes understanding difficult
344528,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, A lot of the fancier hotels Hilton Sheraton seemed to charge extra for everything internet was 20 00 per day , The room was pleasant enough the bathroom clean and the hotel had good access to the underground and the bus 
344529,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, That we put 50 pound bond down the staff member said it would be returned next day Never received it so called hotel for them to tell us it can take 7 14 days disgusting never heard anything like it , Breakfast was great
344530,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, service at bar was very slow only used once gave up waiting in the end went to a bar down the road , Good comfortable rooms friendly and helpful staff breakfast buffet was very good plenty of choice 
344531,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Rooms quite small Bathroom fittings need TLC shower exterior needed cleaning Loo got blocked Bar service very slow waited 20 minutes at one point at least a free round was offered as compensation 12 99 day for wifi is plain ridiculous , Staff friendly breakfast very good reception effective quick check out great
344532,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, I didn t like that free wifi in room was not available to guests if the hotel was booked through Booking com even though I am a Hilton Honours member I was shocked and certainly not about to pay almost 13 a day for it That s total robbery Also no points would be attributed to my membership for the stay again because I booked through Booking com instead of the hotel website The rooms of this particular Hilton had a somewhat dated feel there were cracks around my doorway the bathroom was tiny and it just didn t feel as nice as other Hilton s I ve stayed at in London There were no bathrobes or slippers available in my room something I have come to expect from hotels of this standard , Hilton generally has good sized rooms compared to most London hotels and large very comfortable beds Room service options were tasty albeit a bit limited especially for breakfast Staff were very friendly and personable and the location was excellent for me as I was staying there for Notting Hill Carnival I liked that tea coffee are available in the room and the minibar is now available for use by guests as a mini fridge I wish I knew that ahead of time as I intended to walk with some meal items and thought I wouldn t have had access to a fridge Though the bathroom was small there was a decent amount of counter space to place my toiletries etc something you don t often get I liked the blackout curtains as well as that allowed me to sleep in a bit It was easy to travel from this location as it s between two main tube stations and there were ample black cabs available out front I used Uber a lot as well and it was always easy for them to find the hotel 
344533,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Nothing other than if I could get a better deal I will be back more often than not , Amazingly comfortable bed maybe a bit noisy but who cares Had a wonderful nights sleep 
344534,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, No free wifi in the rooms after getting it conection was poor carpet in the room was dirty bath room abit old and could be more clean, Location is great close to Westfield mall and the underground station bus stop right in front of the hotel friendly staff complementary coffee and tea in the room and lobby Will recommend it to friends rate was convenient got it on booking com very good deal hop in hop off bus stops In front of the hotel which is very conviniant all in all was a pleasant stay
344535,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The room was cramped booked for 2 people dust everywhere on the remote desk kettle Room didn t smell great serious refurbishment needed as carpet looked old and dated Walls hard marks on them not what I would call a 4 star quality hotel Disappointing , Good location breakfast was good if included in booking 15 per day charge for breakfast pricey Nice big tv
344536,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The little bug in my bathroom, Extremely helpful staf especially Dutch speaking girl at the front desk Good food and wine for light diner Excellent choice for breakfast 
344537,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Bath full of hair on our arrival Bar prices ridiculous Room very dated in need of a refurb Location deceiving as shepherds bush not Kensington, Staff very pleasant
344538,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The Hotel itself is very tired and could do with a complete revamp considering it has the Hilton name The fridge in our room was DIRTY very old not cold and had a disgusting smell we rang the reception and we were given a replacement fridge in our room it was cold very old and made a terrible noise and was just placed in the room near the desk which took up space in our room The door would not close to our room when leaving unless you had your keycard inserted in the slot and slammed it There were two phones in the room the one that was by the bed was old antiquated and not working and should have been removed when they installed a more modern phone on the desk , The location of the Hotel was convenient for us being near a tube station the staff on check in and leaving were very efficient we were pleased that there was no charge for an extra person staying in our room for one of the nights of our stay Breakfast was very good with a good selection on the menu to choose from 
344539,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Bar prices too high and mix up when a restaurant and bar bill that wasn t ours was charged to our room Problem sorted on check out, Excellent breakfast Great choice and good quality The breakfast manager on Sunday 28th August was first class attentive professional and efficient Will definitely visit again
344540,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Unfortunately I had a garment taken from my room and this is currently under investigation , The room was clean spacious and in a location I was happy with 
344541,Hilton London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, Well upon arrival was greeted and felt really welcome looked lovely inside and seemed tho we would have a lovely weekend Paid the fee upfront aswel as a deposit incase I wanted to use any other facilities Had a lovely weekend however upon arrival asked to pay again but told I would only be charged the first time I paid and the second was just as a security measure 2 days later arriving home I have now been put overdrawn in my bank after being charged the full amount deposit amount can you get your breath twice When I phoned the Hilton to confront them was shouted at down the phone spoken to innapropriatly and then cut off the phone To which I obviously phoned back and they did not answer my call twice I then used a different phone and would you believe it they answered when I spoke cut me off again Finally got through and was just repeatedly shouted at and spoken to like what I can only describe as a piece of muck on someone s shoe and that was lying when I had proof Absolutely disgusting how do they suppose everybody has enough money to be charged twice and put into their overdraft and then called a liar when confronted I have since phoned my bank who refunded me one amount of money which will take 3 days to clear so I am now skint until 3 days time Such a shame because the stay and hotel was lovely Shame about the money situation and more importantly the attitude of the customer service staff at the Hilton Kensington 
344542,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, That an extra 50 was charged incase we occurred any room charges Which we were not informed about before going to the hotel Now having to wait for a refund of the 50 , The cleanliness of the hotel and the overall appearance 
344543,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Water leaking from light fitting Not being able to close bathroom door Being asked to pay 50 00 in case we incurred extra charges and then being told on checking out that our money would take a few days to be returned to our account , Breakfast had a good variety of choice although 1 toaster was insufficient for number of guests 
344544,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Nothing , We spent our honeoon here it was fantastic Great service from everyone very friendly great location for tube and a lovely walk to Notting Hill 
344545,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Air Conditioning poor needed to open window to cool room down overnight , The cost of the room for London was very good No cost for leaving luggage at Hotel before booking in time Good transport links into London Buses Shepherds Bush Underground etc 
344546,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Very expensive bar restaurant and no restaurants in the near vicinity Also a fair distance to walk to nearest Tube Stas , Staff friendly and helpful room and bed excellent 
344547,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Thought i lost my mobile to cancel sim with provider i got a 24 phone bill from hotel dont use there phone , This was a great hotel on the central line so 24hours service fri sat also the tour bus picks up outside we used both means of transport Shopping center across the road with places to eat ect room was nice and they gave my 11yr old chocolate strawberries for her birthday as this was day of arrival Would definitely go back 
344548,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, We checked in pretty late and would have loved a hot meal but no pizza was left as it was Carnival hotel was very busy but I feel because of that they should have extra as we were all coming from Carnival also after a long day at Carnival was disappointed that sauna closed at 10pm an extension on that night would have been brilliant could not get to hotel earlier because by the time we had packed away equipment we did not arrive at hotel until 11pm and we all need the steam suana to relax after a long day , Staff very friendly and professional they made us feel extremely welcome
344549,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Bathroom wasn t up to standard sink way to close to the toilet couldn t sit on toilet properly To close to main road all can here is people talking and cars plus surrounded by trees so view was rubbish and room was very dark,No Positive

344552,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Slow reception Leaking air conditioning in room Badly corroded bathroom tap Small hard bed room 6040 Awkward wardrobe door Service charge at bar Stained shower tiles, Bar and restaurant Service Water cooling points in hot weather Large soft bath towels
344553,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, If there was anything I d improve I d say the bathroom could prob do with updating and also I felt the aircon in the lobby was much better than the hotel room, Extra comfy bed and great location to connect with London Underground and also no congestion charge
344554,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Rooms are not much different to a travelodge except they are smaller They took the payment out of the wrong account I rang up 3 times and was told that they would contact me back they didn t so i was then told to send an email I did and no reply So disappointed with the customer service after leaving A member of staff walked into my room whilst i was changing At the time i didnt mind but this along with the poor customer service has made me not want to stay again , Lovely breakfast helpful concierge
344555,Hilton London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, Everything was awesome Have to say that service was amazing everywhere in the hotel Thank you so much making my mum and I the best stay in London ever We shall return

344563,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, check in was poor i booked for early check in to meet a meeting but no arrangements made to have me in , good bed and very good access to central London
344564,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The bathroom door did not close very easily and the hair dryer wiring was unsafe but it was change as soon as l reported it, There was nothing we didn t like all very good would defiantly stay again
344565,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, I used the phone charger behind the main lounge as my Android charger failed lost 4 as it was so user unfriendly complicated and inefficient A change here would be good Everything else was brilliant , Yes indeed the eggs were fluffy and the beds lovely and soft We LOVE the Executive lounge and the charming staff who serve us there We stay for 4 nights 4 or 5 times a year to visit family Have tried other hotels in Richmond and in Putney but this is always our favourite buzzing with exotic people and so cosmopolitan

344569,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, First one of rooms was not ready for over an hour after the promised time and the hotel had fully charged our credit card a month before the trip Then one room had water damage from the bathroom that is clearly visible on the carpet The other room didn t not have a working refrigerator I told the staff about it but they did nothing about it nor did they offer a solution or get back to me about the issue Finally we paid for two double rooms and one room was smaller than the other as well as the bed, The location of the hotel is close to both Metro lines and bus lines Lots of restaurants and shopping

344593,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, behind the reception the hotel old and this shows in the hallways and rooms Standard room is small and in our opinion has the wrong furniture In stead of the chair and coffee table a stand for a suitcase would be welcome, reception area and number of staff Location is good busses stop in front of hotel and tube close by Parking available at the hotel high cost but in central Londen and just outside the congestion zone

344596,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The hotel is getting a bit dated the rooms on the 1st floor that we had were old 80 s style dark wood fitted wardrobes but still solid enough Once again the hotel is a trade off against price and location The gym is small but functional though there isn t a pool Staffing levels appear to be a bit of an issue with queues for breakfast being quite long often waiting for tables to be cleared after diners have left The bar food service is also an issue pizzas ordered just after the kitchen closed took almost an hour not the 15 minutes we were told when we ordered , A pleasant hotel almost half way between Shepherds Bush and Holland Park tube stations Everything in London is only a short ride away which makes a good trade off against location and price Breakfast is an all you can eat buffet with veggie and continental options we didn t eat in the restaurant choosing instead the local food places within walking distance towards Holland Park tube stop

344602,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, See above, We hated everything about the hotel Your breakfast staff member on sat morning was the only best staff you had on your team Your night porter was a nice man but it wasnt fair that he was working on the night on his own hence delays on us getting basic essentials Your consiair staff was kind But overall your management team didnt run that hotel well that weekend It was one of my worst stays ever at the hilton We liked nothing 
344603,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Our bathroom door didn t shut and also the shower head needed changing as it dos cause our bathroom to slightly flood as the water went in all directions but the maintenance team came and fixed this very quickly, The rooms were very clean and staff very friendly the options available for breakfast was also very impressive The location is perfect for shopping at Westfields Shepherds Bush but you would have to get a taxi into central which took between 10 15 minutes 
344604,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The bed was pretty creaky and the room wasn t really what I d consider a deluxe price was reasonable but not particularly great and didn t like having to pay for the water in the room either , Superb bar and staff clean and tidy hotel and room
344605,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Neighbour was so loud talking throughout the whole night I managed to sleep through it but my partner didn t Our room was also a connecting room with a door between and throughout the night kept trying to get in I assume he was an older fella as whoever kept coming in and out of his room all night kept telling him to leave the door alone Luckily they checked out after the first night , Staff were all very nice and welcoming
344606,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Room a little disappointing quite small and basic for a Hilton wasn t any better than a premier inn to be honest Shower head was broken corridors had an overpowering smell of damp and rotten fruit Obviously whatever carpet cleaner was being used , Staff very friendly and welcoming lovely reception area and restaurant Good location

344617,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The staff are a little bit rude and abrupt We asked for a bowl and they were very hesitant It took ages for them to decide whether they could give us a bowl to take to the room When they decided to eventually give us a bowl it was the smallest bowl you could think of I then didn t even bother requesting a spoon and just drank my cereal , Such a lovely hotel and a great location Walking distance from Westfield shopping mall and also Holland Park which is beautiful lovely area with great transports links plus you can utilise Westfield s car park for only 8 the whole day much cheaper than the hotel

344623,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, No free WIFI I won t be staying in a Hilton again not when plenty of other well known hotels offer this within your room price It was very disappointing Also the concierge was very grumpy and unpleasant His attitude has put me off this hotel , Very clean Cleaning staff very helpful 
344624,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Noisy guest next door as they were on a different time zone , Excellent location easy to reach and even has a car park which was very convenient as the four of us saved on transport getting to London in the first place Buffet breakfast was one of the best we ve had Would happily stay again

344631,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Nothing to dislike everything was great , All the staff were extremely polite and helpful great location for Westfield and not too far for the City centre Excellent Hotel we will definitely stay again 
344632,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, I think they could be a bit more generous with the tea facilities with fresh milk on the fridge for drinks Although I am guessing if we had asked I am sure this would have been accommodated There was not enough shower gel for two people if we wanted two showers one on arrival after a long journey and thenthe following morning Nor was there bath foam for our use Again if we had asked I am sure it would have been given to us, The breakfast was exceptional with such a lot of choice tasty and fresh The staff were approachable and friendly Rooms are spotless with pure white linen lovely A very relaxed atmosphere throughout the hotel We didn t have time to try the gym facilities so maybe next time

344638,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Sicky smell in the bathroom which became more apparent as time passed Presumably as the effect of any air freshener diminished , Lovely big comfy bed and comfy pillows Staff were lovely polite and helpful

344642,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, little things like the bin was broken tap kept falling off the bath shower head was dirty shower curtain was also dirty things you wouldn t really be bothered about but when its a 4 star hotel you would expect things to be cleaner, I liked the location right next to a tube station the staff were good help entrance was really inviting

344649,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would recommend this hotel, The staff were the friendliest I have ever come across Nothing was too much trouble for them Always smiling The nearby shopping centre was very useful and gave a wide choice of restaurants which meant that you could have lots of different dining experiences within a few minutes walk and access to the tube and overground trains was really easy making travel throughout london very simple 
344650,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The bed was extremely itchy leaving my wife struggling to sleep I informed two hotel staff of this in the morning who barely even acknowledged what I was saying The lounge acess was very limited with very basic cheap spirits and quite stringent staff pouring your drinks it had the feel of school , The location was good and the feel of the hotel was quite plush and upmarket

344659,Hilton London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, The bathroom was cleaned every single day and well Decent linen Room a bit small perhaps but there was a storage area where our suitcases could be kept The only fly in the ointment was an attendant in the Exexcutive dining room who was consistently rude to me not to all guests And that our safe seemed to be tampered with when an error message came up and we could not open it We had used it successfully up to then the on duty engineer had to sort it out Later on when we checked out we discovered that an envelope with 300GBP was missing We did not report it as we did not think that there was anything which could be done at that point But we thoroughly enjoyed our stay there and the big favor they did by having my hat delivered to me which I had forgotten in my haste to leave for our son s wedding on Saturday 28th May
344660,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, My minibar was not stocked apparently I should have asked for this when I booked which I was not aware Not a huge problem but I had to ask for room service just to have a glass of wine whilst getting ready for the evening, Staff were very attentive and looked after our every need bed was very comfortable too This a great location for anyone seeing a show at the Royal Albert Hall as only 8 mins in a taxi

344677,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, They need to work on their food Some good but don t ask for a fruit salad unless you want just apple and orange cut up in a bowl And the lime dressing mentioned in the menu was forgotten Better to eat out with a good selection of restaurants nearby, Despite being a modern hotel it didn t seem impersonal Staff were very good

344798,Hilton London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, The Hotel was lovely and would recommenced this hotel to any couple over the age of 25 It was worth it s money for everything we had and it is in an area easy to get too 
344799,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Would prefer coffee and tea brought to table rather than machine in a good hotel Furnishings looking rather tired No bottled water in room or robes Bathroom shower curtain was either underfoot in bath or flooded the bathroom if outside one of the bar staff was quite rude Service charge on bar drinks charged haven t come across this before , Location Most staff were friendly and efficient Breakfast good 
344800,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, we arrived at the hotel early great they had a room for myself and husband but I had booked two twin rooms also so there was quite a bit of confusion to say the least as to the other two booked rooms why I don t seem to understand They seemed to say it was booking coms fault we finally got the two rooms which took quite a while and put a damper on the stay I am so glad that I had my paper work with me , the hotel was very near to the family party we were attending 
344801,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Over priced room which was very small All the plumbing under sink can be seen from the bath and the room s d cor was a bit dated, Room was clean bed was very comfortable staff were friendly and the venue for me personally was ideal
344802,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Our room smelt like it had been flooded and left to dry we spent one night in there and had to ask to be moved as we got no sleep due to the smell and we were moved to a more basic room, That it was close to the tube shepherds bush its cheaper to park in the westfield over the road 9 30 approx per day 
344803,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, We had to queue for a long time to check on and then again at breakfast which was a bit annoying as we were in a rush , Lovely hotel in walking distance from train and tube station and bus stop Staff were very helpful especially Abid Khan They had a special area at breakfast for vegetarians 
344804,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The room was on the small side and would be good to be told in advance that a 50 deposit would be needed to cover room service etc , The breakfast was fantastic and staff were very helpful and friendly

344806,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Shower was awful rooms need updating Asked for glasses which never arrived Bathroom smelled of drains as did our friends bathroom , Great location Good breakfast quick check in polite staff
344807,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, That the security didn t deal with a problem correct and that I didn t get compensation eg a better room, I like the facilities a lot they was really nice and the rooms were comftable
344808,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Room lacked a few staples Such as soap and a pen and paper Bathroom door was clearly slapped together by some random handyman with poor painting skills Aircon didn t really cool the room which had stale air on first entry no power near bed for phone charger, Nice staff great location quick service 
344809,Hilton London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, Convenient location Hotel ambience Bar and lounge area near entrance exceptionally good view of guests arriving which was good as we were waiting to welcome someone from Australia 
344810,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Aircon struggled to keep the room cool Bathroom looking particularly tired and the hotel starting to look dated , The staff were very friendly and efficient Restaurant food was good and the service fast 
344811,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Very unreliable wifi breakfast was mediocre limited hot food especially in the executive lounge cleaning is slow extends right up to late evening , Welcoming and accommodating staff very clean hotel with nice ambience
344812,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, No free wifi in the rooms Battle to get connected after payment , Enjoyed my stay in this hotel Will most certainly consider this hotel on my next trip Good value for money Easy access to Twickenham
344813,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The bathroom door was rotting thus the bedroom always smelt Fridges are an option in your room this is the Hilton in London not a cave in the Middle Ages London Hotels are not up to the standard of most hotels in the world and are overpriced , The location was excellent The staff at the front desk were excellent Especially the Kiwi guy and the Vietnamese lady 
344814,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Bathroom could do with an update or some care to quality of finish such as door frame cracks and seals Breakfast needs attention Staff good but let down by the coffee machines which dispensed luke warm coffee Maybe they are overworked at peak times Also breakfast was cold on buffet but tasty all the same time to upgrade the hot lamps , Reception nice and friendly and service in bar good comfortable bed and usual amenity 
344815,Hilton London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, Very comfortable rooms Good reception area The staff were attentive and helpful The nearest tube Underground station is Shepherds Bush and only 2 3 minutes walk with a direct line Central Line into Central London Great variety for breakfast
344816,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, side small room wallpaper peeling off in places bathroom tiny furniture cheap looking not what i expect from a Hilton Hotel Chosen for close proximity to Albert Hall which turned out to be 2 mile walk or expensive taxi fare , breakfast bar and food
344817,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, There were no outlets in the bathroom This seems to be pretty typical in London hotels , The location made it accessible to the Tube and trains The shopping center was right down the street The staff was very friendly and helpful The breakfast was great The room was very quiet 
344818,Hilton London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, Close to Westfield at Shepherds Bush If you need to go to central London on bus route and close to tube station staff friendly with nice clean quiet room Would stay again
344819,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Had to move rooms as first room had a leak clear musty smell from wet carpet which should have been picked up by housekeeper Hit and miss with facilities in new room missing tea cups and bathroom toiletries minor things , Location
344820,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, But felt the room was basically a single room with a double bed in it also on check out I noticed that I got charged for simple things like the bottles of water in the fridge these should be complementary , Tidy overall and friendly staff comfortable rooms 
344821,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Our room was on the roadside and was very noisy throughout the night The room was also cold with no heating , Good location for shopping We were there for cricket at Lords Tube station very close 
344822,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, , Loved the gentleman on reception called Ian Hamilton what a lovely friendly guy a real customer focused person who was a joy to have as the first interaction we had at the Hilton 
344823,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Rooms were very very small i ve changed my room twice and the changed rooms were even worse Bed was very noisy and old The bath room was rubbish Honestly I would give this hotel 2 stars I was shocked when I entered my room and I doubt that it was one of HILTON hotels , Location as it is near to Westfield shopping centre ans also on direct bus route to hyde park 
344824,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, I arrived to check in at 4pm The room was not ready and i had to wait until 6 10 for the room The room I was given was for a disabled person and everything was low line the sink in the bathroom was so low it resembled a bidea When I booked I was told the car park was 2mts high when in fact it s 5 8 and my Vito van would not fit , Breakfast was fab 
344825,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Tiny room minibar fridge was nort guest friendly , The whole of the employees were always smiling polite and helpful Very friendly made us feel welcome 
344826,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Rooms are very small and the batroom and the furnitue is old minibar was empty carpet didn t look clean, Location is great wonderfull and friedly front desk personel good breakfast
344827,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, No dislikes just a comment that the rooms are in dire need of an upgrade in particular the bathroom, Thought that the location was very convenient to both shops and West End Access to a car park is very useful
344828,Hilton London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, Very comfortable accommodations we are Hilton Honours members so we received free wi fi in our room Great location close to public transportation The included breakfast was fantastic 
344829,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, No wifi in bedrooms only in lobby The printer was not working in business centre a long delay because everything had to be sent to the front desk The staff seemed to struggle with the outdated computer system and it took forever to get a correct bill completed The hotel is very tired looking and over priced , Very good location with a bus stop just out side the front door and train station within a five minute walk Excellent breakfast and a very comfortable bed Easy to get to hotel by car and has onsite parking 
344830,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Evening concierge was quite rude challenged us when returning to the hotel late Room was tired and needed a refurb peeling decor chipped paint , Room was comfortable spacious bathroom and it had a bath rather than a shower which was nice Breakfast was good with a wide selection available Location is good very close to Shepherd s Bush 
344831,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The washroom has strong smoke smell and so do the towels There is no ventilation system in the washroom so the hot air or smell stays in the room after shower which is quite uncomfortable Tried to call housekeeping for shampoo but no one was picking up phone calls after 9pm including the operator housekeeping and the reception , Location It is one of the stop for Bicester shuttle bus 
344832,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, The housekeeping in our room was poor only left two containers of milk did not leave enough coffee and did not empty glass of water This is minor but for a 4 star hotel was not really very good , the location suited us but might be a bit far our for some good tube links nevertheless very good bedding excellent comfort and quality
344833,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Would of liked to order food from the bar missed it by 5 minutes was told to order room service the food was very quick in coming but standard very poor not worth the value , The beds were comfortable and the reception staff were excellent customer services at all times 
344834,Hilton London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, all staff were fantastic friendly polite and always smiling outstanding customer service which i couldn t fault The food in the cafe was fantastic and only a 5 min stroll to the underground and Westfield 
344835,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Terrible concierge Just one bald guy wouldn t help me to get a taxi to send my little sister to get the last train Told me to go outside then when one came he called some girls from down the street and put them in He said i was out of order for asking why he did that Another member of staff gave me a number and my sister just made her last train No need An apology and i would ve forgot and forgave him , Like the location all but 1 of the staff and everything else about this hotel 
344836,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, We went to London as a special treat for my sister s 40th Birthday I chose the Hilton over other hotels and spent the extra cost to have a luxury stay at a reputable hotel compared to a budget hotel What we experienced was below the standard of even that The room had obviously previously been subject to a bathroom flood the carpet was stained from this and the room smelt mouldy The fridge was dirty the sink cracked and brown stains around the bath taps There was only enough milk for one person and had to ring for more There was tape residue left on the bottom of the bath where a mat had obviously previously been stuck and the decorating was of poor quality and was filthy around the skirting boards and door frames , It was just across the road from the Westfield Shopping Centre perfect after a hard days shopping 
344837,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, I booked 8 nights with the knowledge that my flight arrives in London at 6am I got into the hotel at 10am and was kept at the reception for nearly 3 hours Nobody seemed to give us an answer to why we were not being given our rooms The management could clearly see that my wife had a broken arm and my daughter was tired The manager Joseph smart was not helpful in any way shape or form I am totally disappointed as we ended up checking in at 1pm for a room I had paid for from the previous day at 3pm I had booked an executive suite the list he could offer was us using the executive lounge while we await for the keys but he declined to do that Its managers like him who give the HILTON a very poor name , Location and business centre was good 
344838,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, I was travelled with my old father and we were given a twin room with facilities intended for the disabled WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE The setting and facilities of the room kept reminding my father of one in a home for the elderly i could not use wifi in my room but the staff said that it was the problem of iPhones but not theirs ,No Positive

344840,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Paid for useless WiFi in room Did not like the packed dinning room and the slack attitude to cleaning eg Flicking crumbs of mats when you are eating near bye , My second room Bright and comfortable
344841,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Free wifi is actually bad and kept on disconnecting , The staffs were very helpful and polite The room is a little bit small but considering the location I would think it is very good and money for value 
344842,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, Wifi was rubbish I think these days it should at least be free in all rooms It was also very slow, Breakfast was tasty and a lot of choice Asked for a quiet room staff were happy to change room for us and indeed got a very quiet room I m a light sleeper and I slept well Beds comfy and bathroom was clean Lots of channels on TV Tea and coffee was kept well stocked

344853,Hilton London Kensington Hotel, On entering the room it smelt musty and as though it hadn t been used in a while not good When attempting to order some fresh milk for my tea in the room was told by housekeeping that it would cost 5 00 a little ridiculous Told there was no fridge in the room and there was On trying to order fresh milk from reception when booking in was not helped just told to call house keeping when it could have been sorted from reception which was a shame as the phone connection was breaking up Just think nothing should be too much trouble it wasn t rocket science after all , The location The car park
