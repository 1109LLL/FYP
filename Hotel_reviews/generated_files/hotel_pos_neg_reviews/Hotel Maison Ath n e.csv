81746,Hotel Maison Ath n e, Bathroom sink would not drain housekeeper was way too early and kept coming back Sunday morning , Great atmosphere and design Exactly what you expect from a hotel near the Opera House Very Parisienne Staff very helpful 
81747,Hotel Maison Ath n e, I arrived after my husband so didn t check in myself but facilities seemed to be limited but that may not be an accurate representation , The room was small but luxuriously furnished The bed was exceptionally comfortable The street was very quiet but close to major attractions and loads of cafes and restaurants so an exceptional location 
81748,Hotel Maison Ath n e, The room is quite small as everywhere else in Paris People yelling in the street at 11 pm the hotel is in front of the Olympia s back door is not very pleasant even though it is out of the hotel s control The room service came twice in the afternoon and entered the room for no apparent reason and retreated immediately after realizing I was there It doesn t feel safe , The bed is very confortable Very pleasant stay 
81749,Hotel Maison Ath n e,No Negative, Perfect location for a visit to Paris Upon arrival we were greeted warmly and provided with a room upgrade due to us celebrating a special occasion The friendly hotel staff were very kind and thoughtful throughout our visit providing helpful advice on places to visit in the city and attending to our needs Breakfast was lovely with the option of an omelette made up to our desire and a perfect cappuccino We would highly recommend this hotel 
81750,Hotel Maison Ath n e, Our second bedroom decor for room 504 was a little overwhelming especially with the lower ceilingsand bright red pattern material on all walls , The bed was really comfy and a good power shower Fresh pastries for breakfast with a choice of continental breakfast and cooked eggs Hermes products for that touch of luxury 
81751,Hotel Maison Ath n e, A different power wall plug from what I m using in my country , Everything is good about this hotel Very well designed Plenty of restaurant in the area Close proximity to the station 
81752,Hotel Maison Ath n e,No Negative, The place is small and intimate Service is super personal with a note from the manager every time I stay Rooms are small but equipped with everything you need Hermes toiletries a big bonus the whole place smells delicious 
81753,Hotel Maison Ath n e, I couldn t figure out the heating cooling system in my room and literally woke up sweating a couple of nights But with the window open I was fine , Super comfortable bed amazing location near plenty of shops a few small grocery stores metro bus lines and tourist attractions I would definitely stay here again 
81754,Hotel Maison Ath n e, Room too small Perfect for 1 or 2 tiny persons not the bed but surrounding the bed and to move around , Excellent and lovely staff the decoration excellent bed linen and toiletries great location 
81755,Hotel Maison Ath n e, Had to cut my stay from a week to couple of days due to emergency But they still have charged me in full and were not willing to discuss any solution whatsoever So be prepared for poor and unprofessional treatment ,No Positive
81756,Hotel Maison Ath n e, The room was not comfortable as it was small We knew that hotel was a boutique hotel but common spaces were very small so we didn t feel comfortable to use them and stay after breakfast for a coffee or at the afternoon for a drink Breakfast was rather poor with no big variety although the polite staff made omelets especially for us, Hotel staff was very very polite and helpful to every request we had thank you all Very comfortable beds with nice pillows
81757,Hotel Maison Ath n e, It was bit overpriced the time I booked but that was all across Paris , Great location in a classy district of Paris very clean and comfortable staff are very helpful 
81758,Hotel Maison Ath n e, The commun area are not really large The breakfast area is tiny so is also the breakfast buffet as there is absolutely no room for a big large buffet everything is in miniature Tiny croissant tiny viennoiserie tiny cup of coffee So if you are looking for a gargantuesque breakfast this one is not for you But for a light good breakfast it is ok It is not expensive as it is 18euro per person But in comparaison with the normal rate of the room 470 a night the breakfast would for sure need to be improved and offer much more choice , The staff is pretty young and do their best to please the guest 
81759,Hotel Maison Ath n e, While the rooms are a bit small they are also very dark Even with the curtains open and all the lights on very dark Shower has plenty of room but the sink area is extremely small Please pass on the breakfast the presentation may have most of the items one would desire but the presentation is so skimpy one feel hesitant to take any food Kind of Like Tom Hanks and the caviar in Got Mail They need to up this area especially since they charge 18eu , Location was perfect for a Christmas visit to Paris Very close to all the best shopping Many places to relax dine in the immediate area Only Sorry I missed seeing Scarlet Johanson at the grand opening of a place close to us 
81760,Hotel Maison Ath n e, Booking com said breakfast was included and we had to pay at the end That was the only issue throughout the stay, The service as a whole brilliant service throughout our whole stay
81761,Hotel Maison Ath n e, Could not fault anything , Ideally situated in the heart of Paris Friendly polite happy staff The style is very romantic It is small but we wouldn t want anything more as we wanted to eat out and enjoy Paris at its best 
81762,Hotel Maison Ath n e, The room was too small toilet flush was a bit dodgy and the bathtub could really use a shower curtain , The lounge compact but cozy Fancy collection of toiletries and the fuzzy slippers 
81763,Hotel Maison Ath n e, The room is very small but we had full day shopping so when we came back home at night after dinner fallen asleep quickly with a comfy bed so still perfect , Secured 24 hours parking 38 at front of our hotel A few walk to Rue Cambon only 5 mins to walk Shampoo and soap were My favourite Hermes 
81764,Hotel Maison Ath n e, The bedroom was very small but we expected this and the room was dimly lit but this was consistent with the hotel style I ended up packing my bag near the wardrobe mini bar which had a brighter light , Beautiful room in a classically decorated classy hotel The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was amazing Lovely Hermes toiletries too and beautiful crystal glasses in the room The staff were exceptionally friendly polite and helpful We had a very early checkout and it was no problem This hotel is very conveniently located close to the Opera House department stores and CDG airport bus just a 5 min walk There is also a fabulous restaurant just around the corner Next time we will check out the very cool looking bar near reception This is a beautiful part of Paris and it was a treat to stay here 
81765,Hotel Maison Ath n e, small room and expensive I didnt get a receipt for the extras, excellent decoration super location very friendly stuff tasty and fresh breakfast and amusing music
81766,Hotel Maison Ath n e, There was a huge leak in the room it shut down the electricity and AC They had no technician the receptionist tried in vein to fix it with a screw driver He stopped the leak and restored half the power I ended up with no AC and no lights in the bathroom for the duration of my stay It was the hottest night of the year I had a very important meetingh in the morning and couldn t even comb my hair as the bathroom was blacked out NO replacement room or any compensation was offered I demand a refund I have used booking com many many times this is the first time I have requested a refund but I must insist or I will have to change to Agoda ,No Positive

81773,Hotel Maison Ath n e, The lighting in the room was atmospheric it suited the decor and created a lovely intimate feel but not very helpful when trying to put your make up on , The staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly They were so helpful when we had travel and pick pocketing problems Although a small hotel it really gave an intimate and boutique feel The decor was lovely the room wasn t a bad size for a city hotel Breakfast was continental type with nice little bar for a G T too I would return again
