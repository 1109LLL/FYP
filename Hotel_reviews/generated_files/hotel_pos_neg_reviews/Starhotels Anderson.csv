408905,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, The hotel facility and Ambience was good Room spacious Location next to central station and nearby restaurants The hotel offer a third party parking service for 25 RUR
408906,Starhotels Anderson, Breakfast was a bit basic but as it s included in the price this is acceptable They had increased the size of the breakfast room since we were there last which really helped , Very spacious rooms we booked a family room and were given 2 interconnecting rooms with huge beds Fab location right opposite the station plenty of cafes around plus a Spontini pizzeria 
408907,Starhotels Anderson, Everything was just fine , Excellent hotel opposite Stazione Centrale Very convenient for us coming via Malpensa in the evening and continuing by train next morning Very friendly and helpful staff despite the situation very quiet and nice view to the street Beautiful modern decoration good breakfast very nice room with excellent bed and bathroom with nice toiletries Within the walking distance of nice restaurants Good air conditioning 
408908,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, This hotel is 5 minutes walking distance from Milano Centrale station very convenient when you are traveling by train One of the advantages is a kettle in the room with tasty tea 
408909,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, The hotel is located conveniently right next to the central railway station So it as easy to get around The staff was very nice and helpful Wifi was superfast and worked perfectly Breakfast was good with good variety of choices 
408910,Starhotels Anderson, the noise, The hotel is located right across the main central station which was very convenient for us in terms of travelling However its location was annoying as you could hear the trains until 1am which made it hard for us to fall asleep The breakfast was not bad the eggs and croissants selection were tasty 
408911,Starhotels Anderson, The system of money recovery from the hotel waiting for money to be unblocked from my credit card more than 7 working day as I guaranteed with the card but O have paied cash, The facilities and staff
408912,Starhotels Anderson, The glass panel installed on the bathtub should be bigger to avoid wetting the bathroom floor , Very spacious and comfortable suite Very comfortable bed Good breakfast Although a bit far from the most touristic attractions the location is nevertheless very good The hotel is in front of the Milano Centrale station and it is easy to reach touristic sites by taking the subway 
408913,Starhotels Anderson, Horrible wifi Not enough outlets Staff gave us wrong and inaccurate information about the metro he said a metro is on strike and the only way to get to duomo is by taxi It wasn t true coz when we went to metro station metro was running and we had no problem taking it Hotel staff tried to sale an early check in for 20 euros but we declined It was our second stay at this hotel We were happy the first time but not this trip , Location was nice Super good breakfast comfortable bed nice bathroom 
408914,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, This is a great reasonably priced boutique hotel chain in Italy Milan was in a brilliant location next to Milano Centrale It was a pleasure to stay there Thank you
408915,Starhotels Anderson, I really love the hotel and take every opportunity to stay there as I simply love the stuff the location the beds this time we were given the room for the disabled which i did not quite like and I would say that also the room was prepared just for one person so ihad to call the reception to ask for additional pair of sleepers and then kept realising there were not enough bath products since the visit was quite brief visit i did not want to waste my time complaining or calling the front desk again However this is something I would want to avoid having during my next visit ,No Positive
408916,Starhotels Anderson, You need to walk down a flight of stairs to get to the lobby of the hotel When we arrived we were tired and sleepy and didn t realized you could press a button on the wall to call for the bellboy porter With a big luggage it was a struggle to carry it down the stairs Luckily the bellboy saw us and quickly came forward to carry our luggages Be careful when you shower in the toilet It gets wet everywhere as there is no shower curtain , Right across the Centrale Station Bed was firm and very much to my liking Breakfast area though small was cozy and has a relatively good spread tasty and quality food beverages I like that they placed a small table at the foot of the bed with 2 chairs It allowed my colleague and me to work facing one another almost like we were in a home office 
408917,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, Having stayed at star hotels previously we found starhotel Anderson to be as good in every way great friendly and helpful staff very comfortable room brilliant breakfast and for our stay a great location many thanks to all staff who made our stay enjoyable 
408918,Starhotels Anderson, There is no ventilation in the room the ventilation is with air conditioning meaning you have to turn on the AC to have some air in the room You cannot only turn on the ventilation And you have to set up a low temperature to turn it on making the room either very cold or very dry uncomfortable I stayed two nights and did not sleep well for both nights same for my mum traveling with me Apart from that one thing requiring improvement is the efficiency of the service I reserved 40 minutes for check out considering the train station is just near by but it took around 15 minutes for waiting for just 2 3 person in front of me When it was my turn the stuff took a LONG time to check our information in the system And then he asked help from another colleague who was handeling either another client almost taking another 10 mins to get to payment I consider myself a patient person but at last I kindly lost that if I don t claim sorry sir but our train is in 10 mins they wouldn t say something as sorry for keep you waiting and I would not know how much time will we still be waiting Luckily we sucesssfuly had the train in the last 5 minutes But generally a good hotel with excellent location with access to every transportation I would suggest the hotel improves its service and install a good ventilation system , Location Close to the train station putblic transport Room was clean and well Furnished this is a new hotel
408919,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, We wanted a convenient location from which to explore the city It provided that and because we were arriving by train it was perfectly situated The staff were friendly and helpful 
408920,Starhotels Anderson, The bed too soft It s time to replace The staff not so helpful We drove in Italy and could not find Avis to return the car before they closed The staff in front desk refused to make phone call for us to ask the exact location to return the car but just asked us to go to Avis office not the place for car return in Central Station , Big clean room Proximity to Central Station just a few minute walk 
408921,Starhotels Anderson, Nothing, The breakfast were way too good especially their croissant this is a definite plus if you are a breakfast person like us Located just less opposite to the Centrale Station which makes it extra convenient and many restaurant around to choose from from romantic dinner averages at EUR40 00 per person to cafeteria which you can get lovely pizza from as low as EUR5 00 The hotel and their rooms are very clean 
408922,Starhotels Anderson, Bigger gym earlier breakfast hours, I liked getting a robe and slippers of course And they had herbal tea and a heating pot in the room that was so handy since I left before breakfast hours Also the sheets and pillows were luxurious helpful for a deep comfortable sleep 
408923,Starhotels Anderson, i arrived in the morning my room not arranged yet so i wanna keep my luggage to my friend s room who had arrived last night but was told by the counter manager that it was forbidden or they would charge me some money ,No Positive
408924,Starhotels Anderson, The fan unit rattled all night long Next morning we requested a new room and the desk staff were clearly annoyed Francesco Never apologized or offered to help move our bags AC in the next room didn t work properly Too hot Many superior hotels in Milan , Relatively modern updated hotel 
408925,Starhotels Anderson, If I have to say something bad about this hotel is that from the entrance of the hotel in order to reach the reception there are few steps with no way to scroll the suitcase But there is a porter that helps you if you want , My overal opinion about his hotel is very good The room has enough space and has coffee tea facilities slippers and everything that you might need The Wi Fi was quick enough The decoration of the hotel was very nice and has class The reception people where polite and check in check out process was fast The breakfast was nice with not very big variety but sure bigger than most of the hotel in Italy and has good quality products 
408926,Starhotels Anderson, One gentleman at the front desk acted rather unprofessionally toward me at check out I stayed for 5 nights and upon check in I let them know a friend would join me for 2 of the 5 nights The woman who checked me into the hotel added my friend to the reservation informing me of the minor additional fee for a second guest for the two nights When I checked out the same woman who served me at check in was working she presented me with a separate invoice for the agreed upon up charge for my guest s two nights which I happily paid A short time later another male staff member from the front desk came into the lobby and hassled me about signing some type of documents relating to my refusal to pay for the extra 3 nights my guest stayed When I told him this wasn t the case he persisted and was very rude threatening to report me to the police I was shocked and dismayed I showed him my separate invoice with the extra fees for the agreed upon two nights as proof that the understanding at check in was always two nights only and reassured him this was indeed the length of her stay He continue to demand that because of an error in how it was logged into their reservation system I need to sign a refusal to pay form if I wasn t going to pay the extra fee for all five nights Despite the hotel being fantastic in all other regards I would strongly hesitate to stay with them again due to this incident and this specific employee This is a shame because all of my experiences with other front desk staff were excellent I m still shaking my head that this hotel employee was so obnoxious in trying to make me responsible for an error the hotel made in their reservation system , The hotel s proximity to the main train station was fantastic Also the front desk staff were very friendly and extremely helpful with directions and advice 
408927,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, I often go to this hotel when I come to Milano Lots of positives Great location directly facing the train station very professional service from the staff good breakfast 
408928,Starhotels Anderson, Free WI fi is only for one piece for the person per day Why Now everyone has at least one laptop and one mobile Not convenient at all The only one bad thing but spoils your mood , The staff was very friendly and helpful especially Lucia the best I believe She is a future administrator manager of the hotel She was always so really helpful giving us great train connections schedules recommendations I couldn t do better by myself though I am an experienced traveler and always do all preparations very thoroughly The hotel is located near the railway station which gives you the best connection around Milano as well as to other places if you have some time to travel within 1day Good breakfasts and cozy beds and tea coffee in the room is a great option 
408929,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, I like the artistic feel of the hotel very Milan Spacious room and bathroom clean and good to relax after a busy day Breakfast lounge had excellent service and had a good variety of food fruits cheese and good Italian coffee 
408930,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, One of the best hotels I ve ever been to great location very close to Milano Centrale The staff was super friendly and helpful me and my boyfriend were thrown out of another hotel because they had some technical difficulties and could not check us in we had to find an new place in a 10 minutes The staff at the Starhotels Anderson were very understanding and even gave us complimentary fast Wi Fi The room was beautiful big and clean The bathroom had a bathtub which was a big bonus for me stressed and tired from travelling Overall one of the best experiences I ve had definitely coming back 
408931,Starhotels Anderson, Taking a flight of steps to reception , It is very near the Centrale train station and Metro Very easy to get around The airport bus was also at the station 
408932,Starhotels Anderson, The restaurant was very attractive The menu was limited and the food only so so Hi, Everything was more than satisfactory Good value for money Great location Right across the street from the comfortable affordable airport bus And the bus s first departure is 2 45 AM for early flights
408933,Starhotels Anderson, There really isn t much to not like about it It is a boutique hotel so it is small But that isn t necessarily a bad thing , Decent location location is very important when you re traversing the city The hotel may be small but it is comfortable and clean 
408934,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, Convenient location close to the Centrale train station made this an ideal hotel for our recent 2 night stay Staff were very good and friendly Breakfast was not included with our room but we paid the extra as it was far cheaper than what nearby cafes offered We enjoyed a very good meal in the restaurant Room was a good size and bathroom was great 
408935,Starhotels Anderson, Guest rooms starting to show wear and tear, Great location by the main train station not loud at night however could hear feel trains or metro on occasion Clean hotel nice looking lobby bar but the rooms are starting to show their age Quick paint jobs to cover fixes holes in ceilings But overall great stay and would recommend for short city trips 
408936,Starhotels Anderson, There are no Power outlets on the sides of the bed You cannot charge your cellphone , Location was great next to Milan Central station staff very helpful friendly the room was great with a nice view 
408937,Starhotels Anderson, Shower couldn t decide if it wanted to be a bath of shower The lever was not closing off the bath tap properly and would fill the bath while showering Filling the bath would result in the shower running I expect it was just our room Hall way smelt of cigarettes The hotel still allows smoking in rooms However the rooms are cleaned afterwards and have no smell , Close to main station very easy location for day trips to other areas Staff were amazing Very polite and useful They even brought our bags to our room They answered all questions easily were able to check trains and when they were leaving Rooms were clean Triple glazed windows You can hear the rumble of the trains but its actually quite peaceful and wasn t loud 4 stops from the city centre by train cost 1 50 euros each way Tip Watch out for the helpful girls at the train station ticket machines If they try help avoid machines or tell them no 
408938,Starhotels Anderson, The only thing that I didn t like is You can feel the trains movements from the room It s not a huge disturbance It s slightly annoying Other than that everything was amazing , The hotel exmployess were really nice Always smiling always welcomes you with a smile StartHotel has two hotels next to each other s Same company but different hotels So make sure that you are going to the right one Hotel location is amazing near the Central station Also near to the bus stop that takes to Malpensa and linate airports Value of money was really good comparing to The good location 
408939,Starhotels Anderson, The cleaning must be improved Mold in the bathroom The towels are very worn and stink Broken hot water kettle The bed blanket is not inserted in sheet in the right way and thus you are in contact with the previous guests Very noisy from the metro trains underneath , Good pillows and sheets Comfortable bed Just outside of the central station Friendly staff 
408940,Starhotels Anderson, The breakfast is atrocious on several levels It is really a shame that an otherwise nice hotel has such a poor quality breakfast room which small and cramped and in the basement so has no natural light The quality of the food was dismal The hot food was cold and when they tried to reheat it the reconstituted scrambled eggs became greenish grey and clumped together just awful Adding freshly cooked eggs costs 6 7 euros extra PER EGG when most hotels provide omelette bars and fresh eggs as part of the breakfast When we arrived for breakfast it was just after 9AM and many items were already gone We were so disappointed after the first day we found our breakfasts outside the hotel even though we had prepaid at the hotel and were not expecting a refund Also the location near the main station is not so salubrious and its a bit scary around there at night time , The room and the bed were excellent even if the view was nothing special The lobby and bar were very nice as well Overall the hotel is very high quality Now if only you could say the same about the breakfast 
408941,Starhotels Anderson, We stayed at level 2 and heard noise from metro, Rooms are of decent size Very friendly staff Good breakfast Location very close to Central Station and 15 min ride to Duomo
408942,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, Really friendly and helpful staff thanks Marco Breakfast was wonderful perfect coffee Bed was super comfortable Only 150 metres from centrale station and metro Definitely stay here again 
408943,Starhotels Anderson, Mobile Phone reception in my room404 was terrible Only English newschannels on tv 4star should have water bottle Breakfast area little cramped and average , On doorsteps of Milano Centrale station Shower pressure excellent Nice Room comfy and clean 
408944,Starhotels Anderson, As Asian we like a bit of air con if the windows are no open some air to circulate will be good , I love the bed and pillows I asked for extra pillows and they were perfect Sleep is very essential to any traveler 
408945,Starhotels Anderson, I wasn t crazy about the steps that I had to walk down to the reception area from the street , So close to the train station Walking into the hotel was very welcoming and classy A bellman was right there to take my bags down the stairs to the reception desk I am grateful A bellman was right there to take my bags down the stairs to the reception desk I am grateful The staff were incredibly helpful and English was wonderful Much better than my Italian I would definitely come here again Having their sign on the top of their hotel was brilliant 
408946,Starhotels Anderson, The first bad surprise is the 25 per day parking But the biggest problem was the noise coming from the elevator it was like living next to a train station That was really annoying , bed is comfy for my taste You can get to the city easily it s near the metro line The staff is friendly and breakfast is ok 
408947,Starhotels Anderson, The heating was too high and we weren t able to fix it I would say that the hotel s design is casino like as it isn t natural light friendly The windows can t get opened there is no balcony at rooms and even though it was very sunny outside we took breakfast in a room that was artificially illuminated , The staff was very friendly and helpful The bed was really comfortable excellent wifi connection big room
408948,Starhotels Anderson, Breakfast room location no daylight as it is in the basement The room itself is comfortable the food selection is good service was fast and friendly , Friendly helpful staff Nice spacious room great location 
408949,Starhotels Anderson, Far too hot in the room Could not open window as on street level so we were so hot all night and didn t sleep well You need to ask for a higher room , Close to train and bus stop to airport It s a nice hotel but nothing special The sister hotel across the road looks more upmarket We ate there as the Anderson restaurant was closed on Sunday The food was nice 
408950,Starhotels Anderson, Key point Rooms kept extremely overhearted in room air con off forcing us to sleep with the window open which would be fine if the hotel was not located in a traffic heavy noisy area Upon raising the situation staff had no solution simply explained that the in room air con only works from April other points small room even if we stayed in Deluxe over priced probably due to our trip coinciding with fashion week no kitchen restaurant on Sunday location is convenient but not very nice, ok breakfast easy for commute next to main train station comfy beds polite staff
408951,Starhotels Anderson, A little expensive but tolerable considering the location and the quality of the hotel , Very convenient location Hotel staffs were kind The room was clean and sufficiently wide 
408952,Starhotels Anderson, Unpleasant noise and shaking during the night for every 3 5 min probably from the train or sub only one layer of the curtain not lightproof which make the room quite bright when you get to sleep several broken facilities kettle bulb not recommend for business travel,No Positive
408953,Starhotels Anderson, would like to see more attention to vegan vegetarian health conscious guests at breakfast more natural cereals rice or soy milk organic wholewheat bread etc , great room efficient and friendly staff 
408954,Starhotels Anderson, Well starting from the room our room was overheated and that mad our stay uncomfortable We spoke to the manager and promissed to fix the temperature but nothing was actually done The breakfast did not have much options and we asked for an omelette but the surprise was that we had to pay 7 euros extra to get that omelette Seriously One of the staff was looking at all guests dishes and stairng at anyone whos was filling up their dishes twice or more And finally the smelly towels , The staff in the reception were helpful and freindley The hotel s location is close to the Central train station which mad us catch the train so easily 
408955,Starhotels Anderson, The breakfast was very bad everything about it was awful You can t get a hot cup of tea We couldn t drink the coffee foul taste and cold The staff were standing around talking Bad quality breakfast definitely, Very spacious and comfortable quiet room
408956,Starhotels Anderson, The Shower need curtains to avoid the water dropping in the bathroom floor , The hotel location is really great 2 min walking from central station The hotel is nice and quite The staff were really helpful and cheerful
408957,Starhotels Anderson, The staffs are not friendly The subways really drive you crazy we stayed on the 7th floor but still hearing the running tracks till almost 1am and starting around 5 am The cleaning ladies do good job but the comfortable and pillow just smell Air conditioner in the room wasn t working feeling suffocated could not fall asleep , It is super close to the Milan Central 
408958,Starhotels Anderson, Everything was excellent there is however a flight of stairs leading down to the lobby Might be difficult for people with disabilities to navigate multiple times a day We were so happy with the staff EXCEPT the ones at breakfast They were rude hurried and generally seemed to be in a bad mood The breakfast itself was excellent but on all 3 mornings they made the experience a negative one This opinion was shared by sevreal people having breakfast those mornings , Hotel was larger than typical Italian hotels and very modern and clean
408959,Starhotels Anderson, I was charged during the night the whole amount of my booking with extras without my consent even when the hotel receptionist knew that i wanted to pay by cash the whole amount its been debited from my card and as a result it looks like i had pay the hotel two times never recieved from mr Bruno a confirmation that the money was going to be unblocked never had a proper explanation not happy about this tricky transaction when you book in bookings they say that no amount will be charged but at this point i have to say it isnt true,No Positive
408960,Starhotels Anderson, I was charged to my credit card the whole amount of the booking including extras during the night aldo i informed the receptionist my desire to pay by by cash At the time of check out i payed again for the whole amount by cash and after 3 days the amount debited by the hotel hasnt been unblocked as a result it looks like i have payed the hotel two times mr bruno from the reception wasnt able to reassure me and now i had to call the hotel to ask them to refund ASAP the whole amount charged to my card as pre authorization i was told by mr Davide by phone that it might take 3 to 10 days for the hotel to unblock the amount from my card im unhappy about this issue since mr bruno didnt even gave me a copy of the pre authorization costumers should be informed and during the booking here in bookings com the offer said that no amount was going to be charged to my credit card but it isnt true,No Positive
408961,Starhotels Anderson, Bad Wifi connection , Beautiful design of the hotel very friendly and professional staff rooms were very clean and comfortable Great breakfast and extremely convenient location close to Milano Centrale train station 
408962,Starhotels Anderson, Terribly slow free Internet connection probably a better one if you pay expensive though breakfast room is super tiny breakfast is good but not much choice of hot food, Close to Milano Centrale train station and fairly good price comfortable bed
408963,Starhotels Anderson, It was overall nice but nothing special, Perfect location for a Milan weekend since it s right next the central Train Station nice interior breakfast ok
408964,Starhotels Anderson, Breakfast could be good and there is only one pcs slipper and bathrobe The ventilation system ic very noisy , I liked bed and bathroom so the bed is very comfortable The location of the hotel was very good so near the milano train central The staff very was very interested 
408965,Starhotels Anderson, Breakfast was standard the breakfast room was small and crowded No fruits Many croissants and pastry good coffee but not the type of breakfast I like , The structure was elegant bedroom was spacious and beautiful Good taste everywhere
408966,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, Stunning chic hotel Gorgeous interior design Staff v nice Great value Thanks to v friendly bar man v friendly lady serving at breakfast for their excellent customer service 
408967,Starhotels Anderson, Noise from the train station and the staff could be more helpful , Super close to the Central Station what is very convenient Rooms are confortable and breakfast too 
408968,Starhotels Anderson, Acoustic not good You hear airplanes and trains , Not close to the Duomo or to the Scala but really convenient once is close to the main train and metro stations 
408969,Starhotels Anderson, Staff bellboy was the worst I have ever seen Arrived at the hotel with 2 huge luggages The bellboy stood at a distance watching us while we carried the luggages down a flight of stairs to the lobby Upon arriving at the lobby he suddenly came over and said sorry for not helping We didn t have a good impression of him and so we told him it was OK we would push our luggages to our room ourselves He insisted and snatched the 1 of the 2 luggages away from us and asked if we speak english in a degrading way When we reached our room he stood outside the room WAITING for us to tip him What We explicitly said we didn t want your help You snatched the luggage from us We tipped him anyway and he left After settling down we felt that the room was a little stuffy so we called the hotel frontdesk and asked if the a c could be turned on To our dismay they sent the same freaking bellboy up He came into the room and said you speak english you speak english ENGLISH Note all these while we replied him in perfect english Nothing less And btw his english wasn t even good to begin with He couldn t even understand when we said the room was stuffy He just kept asking IF WE KNEW ENGLISH We chased him out after a few minutes What a terrible start to our Milan trip Don t ever book this hotel unless you want a similar experience There are many other hotels in the same area if you are looking for accessibility , Location was good right in front of both the train and metro stations Direct metro line to the duomo and castello Airport shuttle was also located right in front of the hotel 
408970,Starhotels Anderson, Air conditioning is centrally controlled and far too hot for me I really dislike this aspect of many hotels Do not say you have air conditioning if this is not possible for the guest to actually control , Quiet room Good choice for breakfast 
408971,Starhotels Anderson, A little bit small saloon for breakfast and it could not accommodate all guests and was required to wait sometimes but not long , Our totally favourite place in Milano The location is good 2 minutes from shuttle to and from airport and 2 minutes from the metro station The room was modernly furnished clean and with all necessary facilities well conditioned The staff was friendly and helpful The breakfast was variety and delicious 
408972,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, You would not expect such a nice hotel in the rather dodgy main station area Once you are through the door you re leaving everything behind and can enjoy a nice and quiet stay Beds are very comfy 
408973,Starhotels Anderson, Breakfast is served in a basement room without windows which some guests may find off putting , The room was spacious with a large tiled bathroom and there was a good range of food for breakfast Tea and coffee facilities in the room were an added bonus 
408974,Starhotels Anderson, It didn t include breakfast although few hotels do for the price and it had some alternatives available at the bar I didn t found the pillows very comfortable , We liked the location and the easiness to check in and check out The mattress was very comfortable 
408975,Starhotels Anderson, The gym is a tiny basement room with some free weights and two ancient pieces of cardio equipment The location is good or bad depending on your needs see the other portion of this review , This hotel gets the most important thing right the room This deluxe superior room was great value for the money very reasonably priced The room was spacious with practical and pleasing modern streamlined furnishings leaving a good amount of open space for exercise luggage etc The bathroom was likewise large and spacious Wifi was good bed comfortable nice in room coffee service with extras Included breakfast was more than I was led to believe with good fruits veggies dairy and beautiful pastries for those who like a bit of sweet with their coffee The location has pluses and minuses It s right across the square from the central train station which is convenient for next day travel And on the down side it s next to the train station rather than in a fun urban neighborhood 
408976,Starhotels Anderson, Breakfast area a little small and crowded with small selection of cooked breakfast , Location was close to Central station staff were very helpful polite and customer focused The hotel is modern and not too large a boutique hotel with all the luxury of s grand hotel 
408977,Starhotels Anderson, For allergy and cleaning reasons I m not a big fan of carpets in hotel rooms but I guess that s not something that can be easily changed , The location is perfect for those travellers who need to be close to the train station The room was very big and the staff professional helpful and friendly Since me and my boyfriend have special needs for food they bought only for us extra products that we could eat for breakfast I really appreciated that 
408978,Starhotels Anderson, Price is a little bit high Breakfast room in the morning very busy and in the cellar, The hotel is perfectly located at the central station so that everything in the city can be perfectly reached Room functional equiped and all needed available
408979,Starhotels Anderson, I did not know how to turn on or off the heater and so at times I was a little too hot but not uncomfortable , The bed was extremely comfortable The check in associate was nice and upgraded my room without additional charge based on my request online The bathroom was bright clean and I enjoyed the nice hot water available that did not run out Breakfast was delicious 
408980,Starhotels Anderson, I don t like carpets in hotel rooms even if the room looked overall very clean you can never reach top hygienic level if the floor is covered in carpet , The proximity to the Central Station is a plus for quick trips the hotel is right outside the station 1 minute walk at most Breakfast level is quite high it s hard to find a real French croissant out there 
408981,Starhotels Anderson, Would have liked an Egg station for breakfast The entrance requires you walking up down a steep set of stairs to and from the lobby which is very difficult to navigate with luggage The hotel policy had no flexibility and charged me for an extra day even though I informed them that I need to check out a day early at the time of check in itself , The place was clean and the restaurant Eataly had some good choices for food 
408982,Starhotels Anderson, Rumbling sound from the trains but didnt bother at all Just think of it as a thunder every few minutes , Most comfy bed ever Clean rooms Friendly staff
408983,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, Rooms are great clean lit well nice designed well Staff was very cheerful Bathroom has everything one may need Very comfortable bed with huge long pillow Good mini bar should you need it Very nice restaurant with great food They call it Eataly 
408984,Starhotels Anderson, Expensive for my 2 night stay might be good if a better deal, Excellent location to move both milano and other cities of Italy very cooperative staff and neat and clean room
408985,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, Very good location clean quiet room amazing breakfast and the hotel staff very friendly and ready to attend to our needs metro station train station and aeroport busses just outside our door 
408986,Starhotels Anderson, We asked for a double beds and we had to beds put together without possibility to split them Bad coffee during the breakfast , Personel was very pleasant and helpful Very nice bath and comfortable bed 
408987,Starhotels Anderson, The room was good but felt a bit plain compared with the extravagant lobby You feel the rumble of the underground trains every few minutes even on the 4th floor it wasn t really a problem for us but could be an issue if you re noise sensitive Personally I found it rather calming like a distant thunder storm approaching , Good location next to the train station and stop for the airport buses Good restaurants and shopping with in a few blocks The bed was very comfy Tasty breakfast with good selection Very professional and attentive staff 
408988,Starhotels Anderson, We enjoy our stay so i can t say that they need to improve something, The hotel is very close to Milano Central Station so you have acces to taxi train metro which is a really good advantage Despite the amplacement the hotel is very quiet The room is not very large but quite enough for two adults and one child very clean and cozy Good and various breakfast Nice staff at the reception and at the breakfast room The hotel has also a small fitness room which made my husband very happy We had a very pleasant vacation 
408989,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, 80 credit for liking this hotel goes to its superb location Right opposite to the Milano centrale station But the hotel itself was quite good the rooms the view the comfort facilities 
408990,Starhotels Anderson, The need for porters due to entry stairwell as there was no elevator The management of the breakfast bar needs addressing as I had to bring the lack of certain foods on 2 out of 3 mornings and this seemed to be an issue for the person who appeared to be the manager , This hotel was well located with great reception staff and excellent rooms The facilities met our expectations and the assistance provided was excellent The front office did everything possible to make our stay wonderful and spoke excellent English Porters were great The wait staff at breakfast were excellent 
408991,Starhotels Anderson, Breakfast hall is very small we waited 25 mimutes to sit If you have early flight etc Just be careful no to wait Even we stayed at 8th floor you can feel the train vibrancy, Good location near to central trai station
408992,Starhotels Anderson, Personnel was more than mediocre except of one philippine lady at the breakfast area who was exceptional polite and made efforts for a better customer service Pretty good variety at breakfast buffet but quality was just okay and in general the presentation of the food was disappointing, Location is absolutely convenient right next to the central station trains metro and bus stop to Bergamo airport Room was clean bed was fantastic and the bathroom was spacious Security 24 hour reception and safe in the room
408993,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, Location location Across the street from Central Station which made it very easy to get around with limited Italian Excellent facilities and professional staff
408994,Starhotels Anderson, Had a problem with the sink that was not fixed immediately but was fixed, Location good right by the rail station Breakfast great choice Room a good size with everything you would want
408995,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, Fantastic location if you need to be close the Milan Central railway Station Excellent restaurants within walking distance Would definately stay again
408996,Starhotels Anderson, Explanation and understanding better on their behalf of my Money Travel card that I used even though we explained we were halving the final account both my card and my sisters card were debited which left me with no money even today the credit has not been accounted for in my account and I am back in Australia very disappointed I did not take my credit card as I did not want to get caught with extra charges but I was left with no money my money that I put into the account when saving for my trip , All staff members were very helpful and assisted with our problems from check in problems with my iPad to dietary requirements in the breakfast room
408997,Starhotels Anderson, The eggs at breakfast were not my cup of tea but the breakfast has lots of options and the staff is really nice and attentive , So close to Milano Centrale Very convenient when traveling by train to other parts of Italy Also close to the metro The rooms are comfortable and the staff was very helpful
408998,Starhotels Anderson, Breakfast was fine but could have been a little better croweded breakfast room for how many people were staying at the hotel, Location near the central train station was amazing
408999,Starhotels Anderson, The breakfast area with the low ceiling felt cramped even if there were still some empty tables, location across the train station is ideal if one would be making a lot of day trip travel and the room is very comfy after a long day of sightseeing 
409000,Starhotels Anderson, The room was ok but it was a bit noisy because I believe the windows do not isolate the sound too much The shower was ok although you had to be careful to not to spill all the water outside The edges of shower screen left the water spill out , Bed was super comfortable Good they had coffee and tea in the bedroom for free although the kettle didn t work and the cleaning service let us a couple of sweets every day wishing us good night And they had a Pillow menu Breakfast buffet was ok 
409001,Starhotels Anderson, The restaurant was not good Too many dishes on the menu were not available although we were early and just one table was full when we arrived The quality of two of the dishes was not good both veel which had too much fat in it not at all great We had to sign a disclaimer for possible damage to our car it being parked by the valet this did not insturen us at all and we were glad to see it back in one piece the next morning First time ever and we have used the valet service at many hotels without private parking , The rooms were very comfortable and quiet even though we were just accres the road from central station Check in went well The breakfast was good if a bit expensieve and the service was quick The taxi rank is just a three minute walk from the hotel This is the best way to het to the Duomo and the other sights in Milan All within walking distance of the Piazza 
409002,Starhotels Anderson, Checking in we really wondered if the desk clerk was going to let us stay She was offended that we had booked through booking com instead of directly with the hotel When I said it was too good a deal to pass up she looked at me like I was suggesting something foul I had to ask if there was a problem with the reservation before I could get her to move forward and give us our keys Shower door was weird we had 4 people 2 rooms and none of us were able to shower without getting the floor wet Felt sorry for housekeeping to have to deal with our soaked towels on the floor , Majority of staff was GREAT Responsive quick pleasant Helpful with our ridiculously bad attempts to speak Italian Beds were so comfortable Location was perfect 2 minute walk from the train station Breakfast was yummy Would definitely stay there again one rude desk clerk is not enough to cancel out all the positives 
409003,Starhotels Anderson, I reserved a specific bed room It was approved And when I got there the receptionist told me it wasn t I had to pitch a fit to get what I payed for Which means they lied or mislead me Or attempted to though I stuck to my moral guns Did not appreciate that insulting gesture ,No Positive
409004,Starhotels Anderson, The shower area is not enogh There some water splash out from the washing area during showering and I don t like the floor being wet , Location is super perfect 
409005,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, The staff where helpful in arranging for the porter to help us walk our luggage to the airport bus on the other side of the train station The breakfasts were terrific and the staff overall were very good 
409006,Starhotels Anderson, Breakfast was ok but its served in a small dingy room with no natural light Staff are very friendly though , Location is great easy walk from the train station Fantastic bed very comfy and a lovely room on 7th floor 
409007,Starhotels Anderson, Room soundproofing was not good you can hear sounds from outside and from the corridor , The reception staff were really helpful and professional Location next to Train station is great advantage 
409008,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, What I look for hotel with family is the location and the safety this is an Excellent hotel located right across Milan central station 24 hour reception with Bell boy many eating outlets around Shopping area Buones Areis is walking distance What else one can ask for very helpful staff room service was prompt kettle in the room with tea and coffee iron is provided when asked they even keep luggage for you if you are travelling for few days I would definitely recommend this lovely hotel as for me this will be my hotel for future visits 
409009,Starhotels Anderson, Breakfast adequate but not tasty No spa center, Location is excellent next to the station The room is comfortable spacious and clean Room amenities were great Excellent wifi Hotel staff very nice Price is reasonable
409010,Starhotels Anderson, Toilet water flush was not working properly all the time it was slightly discomforting Shower also wasn t draining particularly well while the glass cover could be wider I guess this was a single room case , Bed lining and pillows were very comfortable Beautiful and wide bathroom although on the expense of the room 
409011,Starhotels Anderson, One of girls works in pantry looks is angry with clients always never smile , The location services and cleaning are very good for me The worker helps me bring my baggage to the bus station Appreciate for that 
409012,Starhotels Anderson, We went on business to fairs and at the hotel They did not know anything about it The breakfast was awful not a 4 star hotel breakfast things like cheese and crossaints finish no fresh fruit by 9 30am and we had to pay 5 for an oranje juice because it was not included Did not like at all we do not recomende and won t stay again ,No Positive
409013,Starhotels Anderson, Wifi is a bit weird You get access to free WiFi but only up to a certain limit per day If you get above this limit you have to buy a business pass Although we didn t hit this limit this rule seems a bit offputting , The hotel is really well located next to the main train station 
409014,Starhotels Anderson, Nothing, Only stayed one night as we were catching a train from central station next morning and it was in an ideal location for our needs as across the square from station Staff polite and helpful and good breakfast 
409015,Starhotels Anderson, There was a problem with wi fi Just didn t work for 2 days out of 4 we stayed in the hotel Despite reporting it to the reception no action was taken that resulted in bringing back the internet connection mediocre breakfasts I was quite dissappointed by quality and variety of food available Beware of regular coffee It has intensity and colour of the light tea The other day I was smarter and I ordered a coup of cappuccino which was great problem with the drainig in the bathtub , great location Two subway lines near by make you are close to the most of sight points of Milan It is the most important advantage of the hotel fancy outfit Despite it is a chain hotel you may feel staying in the boutique hotel 
409016,Starhotels Anderson, Hotel Internet access was almost non existent but good mobile broadband signal available, Great location with easy metro tram access to almost anywhere in Milan comfortable rooms silent air con great breakfast buffet
409017,Starhotels Anderson, Extra cost for city taxes was not included in booking com reservation s price, Very happy with our choice friendly staff nice location and parking service not included in price 
409018,Starhotels Anderson, We missed breakfast for one day because they didn t open on time and we had an early appointment , The location was bery good as it was close to the central station and was easy to locate The hotel had good facilities also 
409019,Starhotels Anderson, il n y a pas de possibilit de dire do not disturb ou could you clean the room please donc les femme de m nages passent ,No Positive
409020,Starhotels Anderson, Very low quality breakfast Horrible wi fi complicate to connect often disconnect it needs personal authentication etc Broken bidet and small place for shower in the bathroom A man 24h at the entrance besides the reception staff who didn t you feel that privacy sensation which is good in a hotel , Location Room 
409021,Starhotels Anderson, felt some vibration and sound in the room when subway ran from Milan central station to the other , One of the nearest hotels from Milan central station Check out time until noon 
409022,Starhotels Anderson, There are some transient folks in the neighborhood who made me feel unsafe during the day especially when I was alone Not generalizing I had an unpleasant personal experience So I took a taxi door to door after especially at night problem solved , The hotel is beautiful and quiet Great views and big windows Rooms are big and clean with very comfortable beds and pillows plus all the amenities you d need I love a good comfy robe slippers and solid air condition Very enjoyable shower TV has English channels I was supposed to stay 2 nights I think I ended up staying 5 Breakfast is delish Good cappuccino Breakfast is also quiet and civil Who likes loud mornings Also coffee maker in room is a nice bonus for a late afternoon caffiene kick Staff is very accommodating and knowledgeable Davide in reception is very professional and kind he is a master customer service rep This hotel gets A for all their staff from reception housekeeping all the bell hops and bartenders Eliza sp as well as the breakfast staff Wifi worked as well Highly recommend this place 
409023,Starhotels Anderson, None, The comfortable bed lovely white sheets and really clean bedroom toilet and bath Bedroom smells so nice Also love the courtesy light in the bedroom Great location right across the central station 
409024,Starhotels Anderson, Right next to the station which is great for getting in out of the city but quite far away from all the sites All the plugs in my room were three prong ones but luckily there were adaptors on the kettle and TV I could use for my own plugs , Room was great bed really comfy and really good bath and shower and toiletries etc nice to have a kettle with tea and coffee in the room too and v spacious Lots of variety at breakfast Everywhere was clean and everything good quality 
409025,Starhotels Anderson, Nothing, We only stayed one night so very good location to train station Comfortable clean room Nice breakfast A fairly big walk into town Area around the station not that ppleasant A lot of homeless people in park But hotel is perfect and safe 
409026,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, I love this hotel so much I went there twice at Milan and we used the same hotel The location is very great staffs are all nice and the room is big and very clean I would definately recoomend my friends to visit here and come back 
409027,Starhotels Anderson, Actually the only problem I noticed was at the breakfast I m used to places where the breakfast end time is actually the time when they close the doors for customers to get into the breakfast room At StarHotels Anderson not only they did closed the door but they also started very quickly to remove the food that was available This is not that bad but assuming you got into 10 minutes before the end of the breakfast you will need to as greedy as your hungry asks you to be , The cleaning of the room the Wi fi service and other facilities But I must ackowledge that the best facility of Starhotels Anderson for me and my girlfriend was the fact that it is literally beside Milan Central Station allowing us to move easly from Milan to other cities by train or even by plane once there is a express train that takes you to the Malpensa Airport in 50 minutes departuring every hour from the Central Station for just 12 euros The price of the room was really fair it was a little bit above the cheapests hotels of Milan but for the comodity and the confort it worths a lot Paying 114 euros for that service that amazing double bed and all those facilities made Starhotels Anderson reach the top in our experience during our trip 
409028,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, Very friendly and helpful staff very clean throughout good facilities in room nice d cor Good location next to Milano Centrale train station 4 metro stops from the Duomo stop 
409029,Starhotels Anderson, There was some water damage in the bathroom to the MDF furniture which could have easily been repaired , The hotel was a very short walk directly across from the station The staff at the front desk were extremely pleasant and helpful The room was spacious and clean Checking in and out was efficient A pleasure staying there
409030,Starhotels Anderson, The toilet was flushing randomly throughout the night which was a little distracting , Literally right across Milan Centrale super accessible Very clean room and toilet and friendly staff 
409031,Starhotels Anderson, Breakfast needed more variety , Great location just across the street from Milan Central Station Very helpful staff Spacious clean room and bathroom Comfy bed 
409032,Starhotels Anderson, As the time goes the room cleaning started to be worse No much variety in the breakfast but not big issue , Location is excellent and very close to the Central Rail Station Clean and supportive and friendly staff 
409033,Starhotels Anderson, This time the room was not so nice Chipped furniture a towel rail that came away in my hand a shower that left you wading through water as it didn t go down the tap fast enough and when I and my friend whom I had recommended the hotel to asked to leave at 2pm was told that was fine it would be free for one room but 52 Euros for the 2 rooms Made me regret recommending the place as on my own I could have stayed the extra 2 hours for nothing We decided not to bother left on time and went and had lunch instead but as a relatively frequent customer it rankled a bit and next time I might try somewhere else , I have stayed at this hotel many times it is safe in a good location and many nice rooms and mostly the staff are very helpful The location is excellent 
409034,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, Beds were excellent very comfortable The room was ideal for our short stay Breakfast was varied and plentiful Staff were excellent helpful and happy 
409035,Starhotels Anderson, Nothing , I treasure the hot kettle and tea coffee packs especially after walking around the city centre for long hours The bed is very comfortable and breakfast is deloucious As it is very near railway station reseration for car parking is needed and the charge is acceptable 
409036,Starhotels Anderson, Tiny bedroom and smallest bathroom I have ever seen my kettle didn t work and the wifi was really poor I didn t feel very welcomed by the staff but I suppose we were only staying overnight The breakfast was also very mediocre and badly organised , It was close to the station and easy to find It had good air conditioning and although you could hear the trains rumbling past it was quite quiet 
409037,Starhotels Anderson, The breakfast area could have been a little larger as we were quite squashed in as there were a large number of people , The beds were very comfortable and the room was spacious and had all the comforts required when traveling The staff were great too and helpful 
409038,Starhotels Anderson, breakfast was good but thought could be better , location is fantastic if u need to stay near the central station staff are friendly and helpful the room we had was clean and fantastic too wifi is strong 
409039,Starhotels Anderson, Thin cotton curtains meant the room was very light very early Not great for a light sleeper like me Although these type of curtains are more and more common these days Water pressure not great in the shower but more than adequate to clean yourself , Couldn t be closer to Milano Centrale station without being inside it Very light quiet spacious and comfortable room Modern stylish furnishings Comfortable beds large bathroom with high quality toiletries included Exceptionally helpful and friendly staff Would definitely stay again 
409040,Starhotels Anderson, Breakfast too basic Breakfast room not great for strollers Staircase at entrance not great for strollers, Service Double rooms with comunicating doors for children room Rooms are nice Nice reception lobby and bar area
409041,Starhotels Anderson, I would suggest better breakfast options as the breakfast was small not much variety , The location is great its right at Centrale station easily accessible to the metro and the metro is easy to go around The hotel itself is good the room was clean and had everything one required the staff is nice 
409042,Starhotels Anderson, Had to wait for a short while for a breakfast table the room is too small , Booked a family room but were given 2 interconnecting rooms for the price lots of space and 2 bathrooms Location is excellent for Milan Central station and is very easy to find 
409043,Starhotels Anderson, While the hotel was great I would only stay in the area if I needed to be near to Central Station again in the future it s not the most attractive part of Milan , Staff were fabulous they bent over backwards for our baby A simple but lovely selection at breakfast and the restaurant dinner was delicious Thoroughly enjoyed our 3 night stay 
409044,Starhotels Anderson, I ordered a room with a bathtub but water didn t drain at all so I could not take a bath Also I found hair in bathroom was not nice to see , Friendly and kind stuff Cosy room Good wifi connection 
409045,Starhotels Anderson, Entry to the hotel was quite difficult as it was down a streep stair although there was always a porter on hand to assist with luggage , Staff were welcoming and helpful Room was well appointed and very peaceful despite the hotel s close proximity to Milan Central Station Very convenient for catching the train or Shuttle bus to Malpensa or Linate Airports 
409046,Starhotels Anderson, Breakfast not bad but just ok didn t match the excellent quality of the rest of the hotel , A great hotel right next to the train station which was perfect for our itinerary Note that Milan centre and the sights are a decent walk or a few Metro stops away but easy to get to Modern clean rooms and furnishings excellent Wifi comfortable bed Couldn t ask for much more We belatedly decided to extend our stay by a night and they were able to accommodate us which was very helpful Staff were in fact very polite and helpful Special mention for the bar who prepared some excellent cocktails 
409047,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, Well located hotel Right outside the Centrale train station Staff were helpful Average breakfast typical of Europe Reasonable rooms The double bed was a little small 
409048,Starhotels Anderson, Not really an annoyance but the tub shower was a bit awkward with the moveable glass partition Water drips onto the floor regardless of the position , My special requests were completely fulfilled There were no disappointments upon arrival We would choose this hotel again 
409049,Starhotels Anderson, It says that you would get free wifi when you do the booking but you are only allowed wifi for 48 hrs disappointing , The hotel was very clean and modern located just opposite the main train station but far away from tourist attractions 
409050,Starhotels Anderson, Wished there was a ramp or small lift going to the lobby reception is not parallel to the road entrance Flight of stairs going down was not bad but would be a bit of a hassle if you have a heavy luggage , By far the best hotel we stayed in during our 10 day tour of Italy Walking distance to the train station is a big plus Room size was decent and breakfast buffet was just right Excellent choice for a short stay in Milan 
409051,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, The room was very clean and pretty spacious The breakfast was very various The restaurant has a very high quality It s in a very good position 
409052,Starhotels Anderson, The lobby was not on the ground floor it needed to go downstairs to check in It was very inconvenient as my wife I had a heavy luggage , Just one minute from the Milan central station It has multiple plug transfers in the room Comfortable bed and clean bathroom Rich breakfast and friendly employees 
409053,Starhotels Anderson, Breakfast room was very small and I want to repeat Nothing to eat again I ll not buy breakfast in the future at any hotel in Europe , just accross the Milno Centrale Train station 
409054,Starhotels Anderson, Rooms are on the small side Breakfast ok but rather stuffy overcrowded breakfast room in the basement , Great location if you need to be as close as possible to the station If not you may want to go somewhere not the most charming area in town Stylish hotel with nicely appointed rooms and good services basic but good food served until midnight In my case I got good value for money 
409055,Starhotels Anderson, 1 The steps leading from the entrance to the lobby You can struggle to carry a large suitcase up and down the steps although the doormen were always willing to help 2 I didn t like the look of the lobby and the lounging area It was dark gloomy a little bit eerie and filled with naked pictures The corridoor leading to the hotel room was also very dark and uninviting , The room was comfortable and looked nice very unlike what you would expect from looking at the lobby and lounging area 
409056,Starhotels Anderson, It was close to the main station A lot of noise from the trains Didn t like the receptionists proposals on restarants Didn t like the view , It was close to the main station Useful when you arrive to the city 
409057,Starhotels Anderson, No elevator or ramp for the entrance Several steps down to enter the lobby Very inconvenient for travelers with luggage Specially mature travelers , Location
409058,Starhotels Anderson, The bed was not that comfortable and the breakfast food could have been a little better , The staff was super friendly and courteous The location is probably one of the best because they are within spitting distance of the main train station Stazione Centrale 
409059,Starhotels Anderson, The breakfast didnt have lot of choices and it needs improvement , Large spacious room with extra chairs to sit and relax Excellent location just next to the Milano Centrale Very easy to get to anywhere in Milan The staff professional The price of 100 per day was reasonable 
409060,Starhotels Anderson, Too small breakfast room Burnt bacon for breakfast Fresh orange juice only if you pay Not enough chocolate croissant for each guest only a few pieces each morning Rolls in poor quality Very dark floors Stairs on entrance very unusual for 4 stars hotel , Location Bed quality Clean bedlinen 
409061,Starhotels Anderson, Everything was completely satisfactory , Everything Really a good hotel and the location was excellent for proximity to transport Staff were always very helpful Room was clean and comfortable Breakfast was ample and very good 
409062,Starhotels Anderson, Ah yes I didn t like the coffee but then I m British and Italian coffee is too strong , Lovely hotel stylish nice rooms everything classy nothing not to like Great location too just next to the railway station with trains to Malpensa Airport 
409063,Starhotels Anderson, Room seemed a bit outdated Scuff marks on the walls Price and location made up for the appearance issue , The location was superb Walking distance to the train station which lead to access everywhere else in the city Staff was incredibly helpful too 
409064,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, The location cannot be beat for travel thru Milano Centrale The beds are very comfortable as are the pillows the breakfast very good It is quiet even tho so close to station and in good area that is safe it was my 2nd Starhotel this month as my first stay was so great
409065,Starhotels Anderson, The room we were originally assigned had a strong odour of cigarette smoke but to management s credit we were promptly and courteously shifted to another upgraded room which had no odour We really appreciated this being done without any fuss , All was great in the room we were shifted to Quiet well positioned room with opening windows tea and coffee facility very comfortable bed and choice of pillow types Good bath and plenty of good quality shampoo soaps etc Breakfast was plentiful and fresh and promptly replenished as needed All staff were efficient and courteous and the porters particularly so which was important given the stairs to the lobby from the street level 
409066,Starhotels Anderson, No threadmill in the fitness centre Simply maybe because the fitness centre is too small to accomodate one , Loved the decor of the hotel Lobby is very welcoming and cosy Loved the bar as well 
409067,Starhotels Anderson, Hmmmm nothing really , We are a group of 14 pax travelled from Rome to Milan and arrived early but the staff allowed us to check in without any fuss The check in was super smooth and friendly Location of the hotel is really superb only 30meters from the station The hotel allowed us to leave most of our baggage after check out just now and hence we can travel light for a night in Venice I would definately stay here if ever in Milan again 
409068,Starhotels Anderson, There is An issue with the temperature regulation in the room Impossible to stabilize at 17 degrees The fan was too strong and woke up from the cold temperature at night Did not sleep well The gym is minuscule and the machines there are old Breakfast room needs more natural light and breakfast needs more fresh fruits My room was very small , THE location near statione Centrale That I could come back later in the afternoon to work in lobby with wifi Very friendly staff very rare in Milan 
409069,Starhotels Anderson, The woman at reception was very offhand when I arrived Gloomy and un helpful When I left there was a much nicer person however, Great central location and lovely clean modern style with great taste and good bedroom in bed and sheets
409070,Starhotels Anderson, It was a little room Breakfast was very cheap and poor some people have had to wait in order for sit down to table , The mattress was very good A good choice for one night near railway station 
409071,Starhotels Anderson, Steep steps to enter , Convenience Comfortable room especially the premium double with separate luggage area Nice breakfast Also surprisingly good restaurant for a medium sized hotel 
409072,Starhotels Anderson, Bar staff preferred to play on phone than give good service , Location 30 seconds from central station was perfect for getting around Milan Clean comfortable room plenty of toiletries in bathroom Reception staff very friendly and helpful Maid and Doorman polite and helpful Lovely view of the beautiful central station building worth a visit even if you re not travelling Substantial breakfast even got Easter eggso 
409073,Starhotels Anderson, If you arrive by car the hotel provides parking however the time which lapsed between the call out and the deliver was sometimes too long , Absolutely everything the staff went out of their way to make my stay pleasant even providing coffee on the go the day I left the hotel is centrally located with easy access to the underground and the central train station 
409074,Starhotels Anderson, There was some confusion over the late check out even though we booked the family room they advised that we could only have one of the two rooms for the late check out it was sorted in the end Also the parking service they use was terrible we had to wait almost 30 mins to get the car back on check out and the reception were particularly unhelpful when trying to sort this out , The family room was made up of two rooms and the beds were very comfy although the double bed was in the smaller room The breakfast was great and loved the dining room Very good location right by the main station so great for sightseeing and shopping access 
409075,Starhotels Anderson, Breakfast is a weak point in the hotel small variety of food and the coffee is awfull , Great location near the central station and close to the underground Cosy rooms Friendly staff Fast internet 
409076,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, Yummy breakfast amazingly convenient location to main train station quiet rooms and comfortable beds Great hotel for a staycation in Milan if the weather is bad 
409077,Starhotels Anderson, Outside appearance is deceiving as it looks like an old and dingy hotel Once you get in it s a pleasant surprise Buffet breakfast has quite a bit of sweet things compared to salty I would suggest balancing that Also more bread variety and especially whole grain healthy choice would be nice Too much white bread for our taste , Inside decoration furniture and general appearance Welcoming staff and quick service Clean and tidy rooms bedding and bathroom Wifi and buffet breakfast included in the family room rate 
409078,Starhotels Anderson, More seating space between tables at breakfast would have been good and more variety with the freshly chopped fruit at breakfast , Beds very comfortable Staff friendly Fantastic location 
409079,Starhotels Anderson, Not perfect view from our room rooms starts to be a bit old fashioned, easy to catch when arriving from airport via central railway station also metro stop was very close to the hotel easy to buy travel cards from hotel receptions one day 4 5 lady waitress in breakfast was friendly efficient and polite 
409080,Starhotels Anderson, Not ideal for people visiting Milan not in the center You can easily get the metro in though Decor very outdated Area is dead late at night , Across from the train station so if you are using it for a short layover ideal location Rooms are large for Italy Breakfast was plentiful and staff friendly 
409081,Starhotels Anderson, Rooms were very hot even when we turned off the heater The staff told us they are working on this issue, Great location Helpful staff Comfortable room Very solid service as a whole Even got a complementary upgrade 
409082,Starhotels Anderson, Hardwood flooring clack clack of hard shoes from room above Often visitors do not appreciate the need to use slippers or soft soles , Location is excellent and the staff could not be better Bedding is very comfortable Bathroom with plenty of space and good lighting Soundproofing from outside noise is excellent but hardwood floor can be noisy 
409083,Starhotels Anderson, Heating didn t work in the first room we got Room was changed but the new one was smaller in the living area less decorated and doesn t has a carpet at the floor , Great hotel if you will be lucky with a room Breakfast served from 6 30 that was very convenient for us friendly staff and you can buy transport tickets right in the hotel
409084,Starhotels Anderson, The chairs in the room were not comfortable for working purpose It is really a pity The free internet was really slow so I had to pay business internet , Very friendly staff
409085,Starhotels Anderson, Maurizio the guy at the reception tends to be edgy and blunt , The room is comfortable We got upgraded Nicos at the reception is very helpful The hotel s location next to Milan Central Train station is very convenient 
409086,Starhotels Anderson, We had no water one night They kept saying it was going to come on at 8 or 9 the times came no water it was terrible We never got water until the next day Staff was not very helpful as to not honoring me the price I received from Booking Com There was a huge confusion with the reservation They would not speak English when it came to the price They advertised they did speak english and pretended they did not know much English I have to check my bill but I think I was overcharged Every day they charged my room Many times I went upstairs and could not get into my room and had to go to the desk for them to fix my key Everything was a hassle all the way around Very disappointing I will not stay here ever again , The bed was very comfy bathroom updated and clean Rooom was large much more so than other Italian hotel rooms 
409087,Starhotels Anderson, We noticed that the bed sheet was making our skin burn despite having the room made up daily I thought it was temporary due to the cold weather but 2 weeks later my elbows parts of my arms knees and thighs are still healing from the burns , We were happy with the room the cleanliness of the bathroom especially and the friendly hotel staff Breakfast was satisfying and the waiters were very accommodating Stayed from Jan 16 20 2016 
409088,Starhotels Anderson, They don t have ramp for luggage the luggage needs to be carried down as the location of the reception is downstairs they do have bell boy serivice however it will be easier if they include a ramp also they don t have iron board and iron in the room for business travellers iron board is a must , We liked the location it s closer to the central station so very convenient to move around the city and for inter city travel
409089,Starhotels Anderson, I had a very bad experience on the second night there was no water in the hotel could not take a shower or wash your hands it was awful My reservation was also messed up they kept charging me everyday a different price and I was very annoyed I was promised by my reservation on the computer a certain price and they did not honor the price I speak a little Italian but I was annoyed they would not speak English during the discussion of the price of the room They advertise we speak your language and it seemed like they were pulling something over on me but I won t know until I get my credit card bill , I liked the spacious comfort of the room delicious cappuccino by nescafe one could make and the bathroom was very modern 
409090,Starhotels Anderson, our bedroom smelt of cigarette smoke , the location next to the main railway station was very convenient large bedroom and bathroom god breakfast good value
409091,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, I chose this hotel for its location next to the station it was a nice surprise to have such a clean well designed hotel staff are most helpful and always with a smile on thier face bfast room is a bit small but very well managed decent bfast with good choice eat italy restaurant is very good as well Super impressed best value for money so far in Milan
409092,Starhotels Anderson, Supposed to be a four star hotel Better call a motel A DOUBLE BED Specifically selected during the booking God in 2016 NOT two twin beds put together with matress No water in the room only one towel in the bathroom And the charge Way over then all the other hotels in the same area Definitely NOT suggested , Elevators were fast enough 
409093,Starhotels Anderson, Room temperature control did not work way too warm I had to open the window over night rooms 911 and 711 to cool it down, Service and room arrangment spacy all worked
409094,Starhotels Anderson, Could be even better Entrance to the hotel is not so easy and no help for luggage outside , Very good hotel modern well furnished clean strategically located
409095,Starhotels Anderson, Breakfast place is a little crowded , Excellent location We re even better had the malpensa bus station bus station had not moved to the other side of central station Staff were helpful and friendly 
409096,Starhotels Anderson, Slow wifi The room felt stuffy a little too warm even though it was winter had keep the window open a ventilation problem perhaps , Near metro decent breakfast room was clean well furnished great bathroom helpful counter staff
409097,Starhotels Anderson, The queue for the breakfast, The staff were kindly and gave us good advices The room was nice Clean and quiet The location close to the train station is very strategic between the 2 airports and the center town
409098,Starhotels Anderson, One person in the breakfast room was unpleasant The bacon was a bit too greasy at breakfast The breakfast area could be more children friendly , Helpful staff nice rooms good location nice bar restaurant The pillows on offer 
409099,Starhotels Anderson, The breakfast room was small and felt crammed , Love the location right across the central station The room was small but well appointed clean and comfortable Breakfast is included in the room rate basic choices of fruit juice breads egg and yoghurt Great coffee

409101,Starhotels Anderson, The window was open in our room when we arrived early evening it was freezing We had to sleep with the heating on and both woke up with massive a headache No vegetarian option on restaurant menu ,No Positive
409102,Starhotels Anderson, WiFi is bad Breakfast room is very small Breakfast spread is not so good Rooms are very noise Staff fools you with the room you book and the room you get Same class of booking we got two different sizes on two occasions Last stay they told me I was up graded to deluxe but actually I was not My friend in other was also told about up grade he geniually got up graded it s stay they did not give me fast WiFi password too and next day when my friend checked in they gave him faster WiFi password and they told me they forgot to give me This happens when you over book and your staff is not trained enough or your systems are not in place No iron or ironed table and gave suit for iron at 9pm buy could not promise me delivery till 9 30 next morning , Room was clean Location was good 
409103,Starhotels Anderson, We booked a superior room and we got 2 different room kinds, Staff took euro 200 deposit and I gave them credit card next morning as guarantee but they refused to return the deposit 
409104,Starhotels Anderson, Fitness room was very basic needs a running machine , Location good bar area ok breakfast ok bed comfortable bathroom good for a city centre hotel

409106,Starhotels Anderson, Need to climb several steps from main entrance to hotel lobby , Located just next to main railway station Very friendly and helpful staff Nice and clean room
409107,Starhotels Anderson,No Negative, We booked this hotel at short notice when our travel plans went awry because of it s location near Milan Centrale Station The staff on the desk were very helpful the room was very comfortable and we would not hesitate to book again if we were in Milan 
409108,Starhotels Anderson, The bed was a bit too hard for me but it would not stop me from returning , Nice design good room facilities welcoming staff good selection for breakfast
409109,Starhotels Anderson, The wifi is OK but there is some room to improve the speed although you will have an option to upgrade to higher speed for 8 euro per day The breakfast need to be more variant Staying for 6 days I only eat the same meal everyday , The location is excellent 3 minutes walking to Milan Central Train Station The room is spacious clean and comfort 
409110,Starhotels Anderson, Breakfast room a little small but there were seats for everyone when I went so not a prpblem, Everything I needed was in the room plus bathrobe and slippers free wifi very friendly staff 
409111,Starhotels Anderson, Hot buffet breakfast food was cold and tasteless The breakfast restaurant was cramped and crowded and were charged an extra 6 Euros for eggs and even more for other cooked items which elsewhere would normally be part of the hotel breakfast cost , Most comfortable and most convenient place in the surrounding area 
409112,Starhotels Anderson, For the price charged the rooms are out dated the breakfast and breakfast room were as ordinary an experience we have ever encountered Crowded stuffy and very little choice I would not stay there again as a result , Location adjacent to the train station is convenient and front desk staff were extremely helpful
409113,Starhotels Anderson, No bad experiences The station has a lot of people hanging around but just be vigilant , The hotel is very clean and comfortable The location is right across from Milan Centrale station which has great shopping and access to trains and metro so you can get around easily within Milan and to Malpensa Aiport as well as links to other parts of the country The station itself is a fabulous building to visit Outside the station is not fantastic there s a lot of people hanging around but everything else makes up for it There are porters to help you with luggage if needed at the hotel The staff are very good 
409114,Starhotels Anderson, Try for an upper floor room if you need a quiet night the rooms on the first floor get a little street and subway niise , If you are traveling from Milan centrale station you can t beat this hotels location literally right across the parking lot Very clean and modern rooms friendly and helpful staff 
409115,Starhotels Anderson, Nothing , More than we are thinking everything was new clean and Eco green building fantastic location near Milano statione we propose this hotel absolutely 
409116,Starhotels Anderson, Only very basic free Wifi Ridiculous pricing for proper Wifi fit for skype or steaming Foul play Breakfast room is in the basement and you re likely to touch elbows with your neighbor as it s quite cramped Newspapers provided are Italian only which I manage to understand but unluckily they re just of one political stance right wing I d have used my phone to read the news but then there was the Wifi issue and my megabytes I had already used up Location is convenient for travelers to and from Milan main station yet we thought it was a rather seedy dreary setting around the hotel Not anything we d recommend for single travelers or children , Spacious beautifully decorated room Excellent multilingual staff Breakfast selection good excellent for Italy 
409117,Starhotels Anderson, Wifi is very very slow The breakfast has few options and the place is very small I had my breakfast out of the hotel once because they could not find me a table, The location is great The room was clean

409122,Starhotels Anderson, I was surprised that the man at the front desk when I checked in was rather rude He started by helping someone who arrived after me I didn t say anything because I try to be easy going when I travel Then he was explaining something to me in a confusing way and I didn t understand Even though I was politely asking him to repeat himself he got annoyed with me which I don t like if I am paying good money to stay somewhere and am being polite The truth is it is his job to be polite not mine The other man he helped first was rude Maybe if I was rude he would have helped me first and been more polite to me I know I might be the 25th person he s talked to that day but still we had been traveling all night on planes and shuttles and were really tired It made it kind of a bummer to be treated so rudely when we first got to Italy and after that I didn t want to ask for help with things like where is a good restaurant etc The other woman at the front desk was friendly enough as were the restaurant servers bell man etc But the damage had been done by our initial greet It s unfortunate I would like to stay at a place like that when I am in Milan because it is so nice and clean I just don t know if I will as a friendly front desk is so important to feeling good in a foreign country If customer service isn t important to you then definitely stay here , This hotel is literally across from the train station so its a great place to stay if you are in transit in Milan for the night The room was lovely super clean very nice bathroom bathrobes lovely property in general The breakfast was fine too nothing spectacular but decent food
