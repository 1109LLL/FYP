389873,Aloft London Excel, Changing rooms in pool are broken Disappointed I couldn t get a rare match for Booking com between when I booked and price on the day 70 cheaper Hotel couldn t help even tho they said I should ring their helpline, Great spacious comfortable rooms
389874,Aloft London Excel, Didn t think it would be that far from central london but oh well , I got a complimentary cocktail for my birthday weekend loved the gym and pool and steam room and sauna Amazing
389875,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, This is the third time now I have stayed at the aloft and requested twin beds Every time they have explain to me that they have no twin s available Im starting to wonder if they even have twin rooms 
389876,Aloft London Excel, No mobile phone reception and intermittent wi fi signal in my room Despite being disabled was on 4th floor which was wholly impractical when we had a fire alarm during our stay Room was cold , Very comfortable bed and practical bathroom Room was spacious Very handy for ExCell and the DLR
389877,Aloft London Excel, Hotel to this standard should have bath instead of shower only thing I missed after a long tiring day is taking bath , Very nice hotel and friendly staff excellent soundproof system and had a good night sleep 
389878,Aloft London Excel, We arrived for breakfast but someone has already had breakfast on us We still were allowed to eat Toiletries there is not enough for two people , Sauna great size beds interior exterior 
389879,Aloft London Excel, A little detail would be too consider how many people are in the room when it comes to teas and coffees etc We only had 1 bottle of water 1 each of the coffees and 3 each of the milks We wernt overly bothered as we were not in the room long A little tricky getting out of the shower as the door is level to the floor and as it is a walkin shower wetroom its difficult to put the shower mat down, Location to 02 perfect Great modern styled building with friendly and helpful staff 
389880,Aloft London Excel, I can t fault anything at all helpful staff great room The only thing was the hair dryer when I turned it on it sounded like it was going to explode I switched it off immediately and it had a burning smell and what felt like a little shock to my finger I informed reception and they were very apologetic , The room was great very comfy bed and lots of nice touches The bathroom was lovely especially the shower I contacted the hotel to ask if at all possible we could have an upper floor room as me and my partner were celebrating her birthday and our anniversary I am happy to say they delivered and we had a view as well so was delighted 
389881,Aloft London Excel, I didn t like the fact that I wasn t able to open a window in the room I like a window open especially at night The lifts made me feel a little queasy they could have been smoother I found the air heat in the lifts a bit overpowering , The bed was very comfortable my first night at the hotel I wasn t feeling so good because of the heat I think something I ate before I got to the hotel but with the air con in the rooms and in the hotel its self made the stay pleasurable The staff were easy to deal with nothing was too much trouble for them and everything was done as quickly as possible with a smile I would recommend this hotel to anybody visiting the excel as I was for the weekend 
389882,Aloft London Excel, The staff in the shop seemed to struggle to add up the prices correctly I was mischarged twice and had to correct them , Very nice hotel with modern design Clean and spacious room with comfortable bed Very convenient for the DLR and LCY airport Very quiet room 
389883,Aloft London Excel, Service was average Very small service check in desk for size of hotel The restaurant looked good on the website however we were advised that the menu does not reflect what is actually available The standard of food was only average , Comfortable bed and modern design 
389884,Aloft London Excel, It says in the description of the hotel it s near the O2 arena it takes 10 15 minutes by taxi to go from the hotel to the arena and 45 minutes to walk My definition on near is clearly a bit different then theirs , Great rooms and supergomfy beds 
389885,Aloft London Excel, Car parking is expensive and no signs to say that Reception can book this for you when you arrive The location is a little further out of the city than the hotel details lead you to believe but the DLR is a couple of minutes walk away it just takes a bit longer , Hotel and staff are great all very clean and all staff vry helpful 
389886,Aloft London Excel, Changing rooms at the pool poor bar closed too early travelling around London city was not worth wile coming home for 12pm went up to Ibis hotel for late drink every night the staff there very accommodating, Staff very friendly and extremely helpful really thought the outside speakers and music 24 hours playing was brilliant Music is very therapeutic brilliant idea
389887,Aloft London Excel, staff warm reception, The reception was not too friendly after a long flight It warmed up when my frustration was noticed overall on the second day we all warmed up to ourselves 
389888,Aloft London Excel, The minibar was empty the wireless mobile phone charging was not working the HDMI TV ports were not working also , The room was really big and the bed was very comfortable Internet connection was good The burgers were amazing 
389889,Aloft London Excel, The shower head was broken which meant the water just treacled out which was rubbish I also thought the breakfast selection was poor The only egg option was scrambled I also thought the restaurants on site didn t offer much The bar downstairs took ages to get a drink from I think I waited about 10 minutes for a drink due to only 1 staff member serving , I liked the location I liked that you were able to drop your luggage off before check in which meant I was able to attend the event at the Excel It s a really nice and modern hotel with some nice views 
389890,Aloft London Excel, Nothing , It was clean staff were very helpful friendly and polite The hotel was easy to travel to and from by road or rail with the DLR running right past the hotel although you would never know as you never heard it Very useful for London Excel travel to the City and Stratford International and Olympic Park 
389891,Aloft London Excel, There s no mirror over the dressing table to sit and get ready Yes plenty of mirrors in the sink area but not really practical for 2 ladies sharing ,No Positive
389892,Aloft London Excel, The shower need fixing the bar had run out of some beers there were no bar snacks available after 10pm some of the staff spoke little English , The beds are very comfortable 
389893,Aloft London Excel, smart TV system guide and remote are very slow and painful to navigate with some SW faults in logic other hotels have much friedlier tv guide and remote Breakfast canteen cannot accomodate all traffic at peak hour 7 30 9 am causing lack of free seats and occasionally missing products suggested to add seats hire part timer and provide some fresh greens to menu certainly suggested to provide AC socket adapter for euro travellers unable to use laptop, Lady on reception Karolina was very helpful and made overall impression from this accomodation much better thanks to nice view from room windows provided bed was splendid having USB port for charging devices is one of smartest hotel ideas ever noticed clearly compensating typical UK hotel disaster with AC socket mismatch
389894,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful start to finish The rooms were clean comfortable and the area was very pleasent to walk around Would highly recommend and will be stay here again 
389895,Aloft London Excel, well i booked a room with a bath online and after a really tired day out when i went to my room there was only a shower and not very clean either also i asked to have a room with a bath and was told there was none left not true as the hotel was half empty that night also when i called reception and asked for a charger for just half an hour i was told there would be a charge of 5 pounds plus 20 deposit ludicrous as i paid a lot to stay there i then later found out that there where free chargers in the bar why wernt we told this it was really bad service and lack of knowledge of staff not knowing whats available and zero customer service i would hope to have my money refunded back in full as i do not warrant the stay a very pleasant one , only the location which wasnt the best either 
389896,Aloft London Excel, Internet connection poor at the gym area , We stayed at Crowne Plaza Aloft and Moxy Aloft is by far the best Not only because it is right next to the station and Excel but also because the rooms are super big clean and modern Great coffee in the room Design that provides amazing view quick and friendly service Amazing restaurant inside the hotel do not miss Plus the pool and the gyms are an extra bonus It will be our first choice for London 
389897,Aloft London Excel, Terrible restaurant fly into City Airport if possible very difficult to get to from Heathrow or Gatwick, Great staff and nice rooms Very convenient to Excel center
389898,Aloft London Excel, We wanted to have some discussion prior to dinner downstairs in the sofas area behind the bar but were scared away by too loud music Conversation was nearly impossible without raising the voice so we had to retreat to the restaurant breakfast area where the volume was not so excessive Such a shame because the sofas area looked really cozy , Good selection at the breakfast buffet especially appreciated the vegetarian sausages Great and comfortable bed bathroom excellent as well Plus points for a power socket where I could use my European power lead without the need for an adapter 
389899,Aloft London Excel, between the toilet n shower was bit of a squeeze no choice of milk you only had full cream the hotel receptionists didnt tell us about the walk around the docks and all the resterants shops and bars just a stone thow along the stunning docks we stumbled on it our self, loved the extra large bed the large tv and all the sockets i e blue tooth great size room
389900,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, The location is good for the O2 and easy train transport to other places even though it is a bit far from central London Nice comfortable beds clean room good view quiet Good hotel bar and helpful staff 
389901,Aloft London Excel, I thought breakfast was a bit overpriced at 17 per person and didn t realise it wasn t included in the price of room, The bed was huge and very comfortable The room was quiet and peaceful
389902,Aloft London Excel, The changing facilities for the pool are quite bizarre The general changing cubicles are not lockable and are used to get into the pool area Otherwise great , The staff were very friendly and the hotel was very clean 
389903,Aloft London Excel, When i asjed about parking the reception offered to do it for me but what they failed to tell me was if i did it myself outside it was 16 but they charged me 25 ,No Positive
389904,Aloft London Excel, The bar It didn t open until 5pm which is unusual for a hotel Returned around midnight asked for a bottle of wine to be told they didn t have access to the wine Also only one choice of beer ,No Positive
389905,Aloft London Excel, Expensive food and parking was very expensive But I guess you expect that in the area, Nice modern Hotel very comfortable room Staff very helpful Very clean 
389906,Aloft London Excel, It is a bit difficult to regulate the bedroom s temperature , The staff was great really friendly and helpful I liked pool s temperature the fact the gym is open 24 hours as well the convenience shop the bedroom itself was big with all the requested things and the breakfast was really tasty and plenty for one even repeat I enjoyed the service they provided they catered for all my needs and I didn t need to leave the hotel to fulfil my day s plans 
389907,Aloft London Excel, Pricey paid parking Food very poor value especially evening grill bar No vegan choice even though requested , Convenient to ExCel Bed very comfortable
389908,Aloft London Excel, Very minor gripe swimming pool Pool itself was lovely but on Sunday was full of parents laying on loungers watching their kids doing swimming lessons Limited changing area Confusing route into out of pool via gym not clearly marked, Bed comfortable room very quiet good sound proofing all staff I had interactions with were very helpful daughter loved decor Baked beans at breakfast really tasty very happy daughter DLR very close easy access into central London 
389909,Aloft London Excel, They gave us the wrong room and tried to blame us until the produced confirmation but they were fully booked so we still had to have a different room Most of the staff were unhelpful thought the stay Parking was overpriced at 16 a day and there is no option to open windows in the room so just have to put up with recycled air , The property was right near the excel and the facilities were very good The room was clean bathroom nice and the beds were comfortable 
389910,Aloft London Excel, Restaurants around the area were limited and often busy Some felt very cheap and almost desperate for customers Would not be dining there again , Friendliness and approachability of the reception staff 24 7 shop in the lobby was very useful and well stocked Distance to nearby DLR station makes travelling very good 
389911,Aloft London Excel, Male toilets in the Bar needed some maintenance on the leaking urinals , Great spec contemporary hotel with friendly helpful staff A great place to stay if you don t want the hustle bushel of central London but still want to get into central London or the O2 quickly Very well served by the DLR and other public transport services Really love the Bar Would definitely stay again recommend to friends 
389912,Aloft London Excel, Just no shops around the hotel and in the sauna the wood seats are a bit too used Prices for the little shop at the reception too expensive, Next to the tube station very good room nice bed very calm quiet Good swimming Pool Discrete staff Good information at the reception
389913,Aloft London Excel, Price was pretty high and better organization with the event organizers would have been appreciated , The property was ideally right next to the Excel and the breakfast buffet was lovely
389914,Aloft London Excel, Firstly I had booked a twin room and when I arrived was allocated a double and as the hotel was full could not be changed not impressed Wasn t informed of where facilities were I asked about the pool and gym which was my main reason for choosing this hotel as the other person with me was attending the convention I had a look then asked about how I access the lockers was told they didn t work so would have to take my belongings with me and watch them myself so swimming was out not good for the price you pay wanted a relaxing week end not to be looking over my shoulder all the time Breakfast I had to ask for cutlery and orange juice on the first morning on the second I asked for orange juice again and was told that they had run out and no delivery till the next day very poor in my book for a hotel chain of this size and knowing you are fully booked come on Aloft get it right Overall don t think it was worth the money I paid not a patch on the intercontinental where we stayed last year only thing in favour of the aloft was the proximity to the excel , Most of the staff were friendly the proximity of the hotel to the Excel couldn t get any closer fantastic for the convention and the tube station hotel was clean 
389915,Aloft London Excel, when you book and pay they will still want you to pay a 25 refundable deposit for breakages will not be returned straight away on check out the staff are rude and far to casual for a 4 star hotel the menus are printed on a4 white paper with food stains max choice on food 3 items per starter main and dessert this gets to me because the first time we stayed it was incredible one member of staff gave me an old 5 note as change and refused to take it back even though they are not legal tender since the start of may it is overpriced food and drink, ok I write this review with a heavy heart because when I stayed here 3 years ago I gave the place a 9 6 in 3 years so much has gone wrong but lets talk about the good the rooms are amazing free bottled water the mini fridge has been converted in to a working fridge for storage air con works well and the bathroom is amazing with shower but that s where the good ends
389916,Aloft London Excel, The smell of the bleach heaving throughout the reception area My partner had a rash from the towels from the hotel she doesn t have sensitive skin or anything but i found that the towels detergent was probably too much Not very happy about that especially being a recognised hotel chain around the globe The bed mattress kept sliding as it didn t sit in the inside it was just flat Shower was ok no pressure on the hot water side have had better experiences of showers at other chains of hotels No need to pay for the upgrade on the river view its just not worth it despite being on the 8th floor it wasn t a pleasant sight Tv channels not a lot on to be honest better connecting your personal laptop via own hdmi and get netflix going Dust on the Nespresso coffee machine that put me of using it not knowing when the last time a service was done , Bed was comfortable plenty of pillows Heating and air con was spot on Reception is very cosy printing facilities and computers free of charge Good location however a little far out from central but easy to get to on the Prince Regent DLR didn t really stay out late but was still convenient No near by amenities so best of picking something on the way up closest amenities would probably be the co op canning town If you have a samsung luckily enough those that very patient have the chance to charge on the wirlessdock with connecting no wires to it i however had an iPhone and i couldn t stop hearing it from the partner i still prefer apple to samsung haha
389917,Aloft London Excel, I cannot fault this hotel, I was with my grandson 11yrs we were going to Bruno Mars the night we arrived staff were so helpful in the advice they gave us we used the Pool before we went and that was fab Breakfast was great and freshly cooked nothing wasnt a problem if you wanted something else I would defo use this hotel again We were on the 8th floor and the views were stunning even when planes went by it was like they were on our level 
389918,Aloft London Excel, The fact that my mother died recently and the hotel wouldn t even think of changing the dates of my trip A lot of family and friends travel to London and I will be telling them to stay away from this hotel,No Positive
389919,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, Good location for the O2 rooms are okay Definitely more a business hotel which is what I believe it is meant for Parking is an extra 16 00 on site so something I be aware of We upgraded for 20 00 on arrival and got given the Same room we booked on a higher floor 
389920,Aloft London Excel, This time May 2017 we paid double the price for the same room we paid 277 for 2 nights Oct 2016 and though we have booked yet again for October 2017 the same dates as last year again it is nearly twice the price We will check prices elsewhere throughout this year unless we are offered a good deal , This was our second visit to this hotel the layout and the comfort of the room is good 
389921,Aloft London Excel, Room temperatures were difficult to control Limited choices for bar and food in location, Great location for London City airport and also eXcel centre
389922,Aloft London Excel, Mix up from Bookings com on the reservation name sent to the hotel therefore took a long time to find the reservation and had to go back to reprint the receipts for the hotel, Good location with decent transport link Clean and bright decor with good size room and comfortable beds Overall very happy with the choice 
389923,Aloft London Excel, Only negative was I chose a sandwich and asked the grumpy gentleman at the fuel bar to heat it Within a second I changed my mind to a more appropriate selection Which he refused as he had opened the packaging , I liked the area The location was close to the station The hotel looked amazing The room was great I love coffee and it was great that they had a coffee machine in my room 
389924,Aloft London Excel, There is a lack of information on facilities in the reception or in the room The technology that the hotel attempts to use I e The tv service and online room service do not work well , I was able to store my bike easily and securely 
389925,Aloft London Excel, Room Service is actually a delivery from the restaurant The order was delivered 1 hour late and was totally wrong When new order was placed it arrived 25 minutes later but way too late to be eaten Dinner was refunded but the whole experience really did not help to have an enjoyable stay , Very practical in case of event in Excel Dynamic attitude from the employees Good for one night 
389926,Aloft London Excel, Open plan room and bathroom was OK but no hooks anywhere for washbag etc and no shelf or basket in the shower for shampoo soap etc Annoying , Nice room with modern d cor and a good and comfortable bed 
389927,Aloft London Excel, The amount of people trying to get into the station after the concert was crazy so we jumped in a taxi and as we were so close we got back in no time and missed the queues , My friend and I chose this hotel because it was close to the O2 Arena The location was fantastic and on the same site as the train station which made it so easy to get too 
389928,Aloft London Excel, It was only after paying that I was told that my request for 4 twin rooms could not be accommodated and that there was only 1 twin room and the other 3 would be doubles Aloft said that if I had booked direct with them they would guarantee to fulfil any requests but by booking through booking com they would NOT guarantee to fulfil any requests Problems on checking out as the reception staff decided that I had not paid but this was due to the way they had checked us in by allocating all the payment to 1 of the 4 rooms Not impressed with the reception staff and rooms were expensive Still waiting for my receipt , Comfy bed
389929,Aloft London Excel, the rooms are not very soundproof you could hear tv people talking in the next room very clearly and the room doors do not have any type of soft close function they are quite large and heavy doors and slam shut with the loudest of bangs Doors were constantly banging through the night and for that reason had the worst night sleep , The Hotel is nice and modern with a good bar and relaxing seating areas 
389930,Aloft London Excel, Can t really fault anything More milk for the room would have been nice but other than that I can t fault it, Bed was very comfortable all the room facilities where outstanding
389931,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, Lovely staff who were very happy friendly and helpful Very comfortable beds and extremely clean modern hotel room There was no outside noise and the room was very spacious Would definitely recommend Very convenient for getting into Central London 
389932,Aloft London Excel, Its not a cheap place to stay an you would only be there if you were going to the conference center , For the EXCEL exhibtion center the location is fantastic 2 mins to the DLR and 30 seconds to the exhibition center There is an excellent chinese restaurtant a few mintues away Great for DimSim 
389933,Aloft London Excel, The changing rooms at the pool weren t lockable the pool area could do with a bit of renovation as well dirty filters and surround , Altogether a good modern clean hotel really good value for money and very convienient for travel to the O2 particularly enjoyed the walk from the hotel on the river and the cable car to the arena
389934,Aloft London Excel, For rooms that are booked for 2 people there should be 2 x bottles of water at least Not 1 x small bottle Can be a bit dark in the room should have a main light The sauna swimming pool area should have lockers This I believe is critical especially for those who have young children etc The bar restaurant should be open earlier not just from 5pm For such a huge hotel which is always very busy Aloft are missing a trick Especially for not opening the bar until 5pm , I liked the space the design and the technology in some of the rooms The hotel itself is very modern with games area and chill out zones for those that don t have children and want some peace and quiet 
389935,Aloft London Excel, Shower in the room water pressure minor leaks , Friendly and helpful staff Effective and tasty room service Super near the DLR train link to the center Relaxing pool and sauna
389936,Aloft London Excel, In rooms with no Nespresso m c best to buy yourself a jar of coffee or get coffee from the breakfast room or lobby shop The high tech coffee sachets are too complicated to deal with first thing in the morning , On site washing drying facilities a real plus hotel shop and food service very useful Free safe in the room and fridge very welcome Blackout and sound proofing extremely effective notepad and pencil always useful and excellent charging material for all the gadgets Bathroom shower facilities very well thought out Lots of outside seating with a river view and does anyone ever tire of watching planes take off and land 
389937,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, The best part about the property is the location The hotel is literally connected to the local train service which is only 40 minutes from central London You can walk from the hotel lift to the train in roughly 2 minutes The amenities in the hotel itself were brilliant and exactly as they look in the pictures The gym is 24 hours along with a snack area and reception The pool doesn t shut to 11pm and the bar stays open till 12 What more could you want from a fantastic location and amazing property 
389938,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, The gotel is brand new and superbly comfortable Great rooms and extremely attentive staff I walked to the LCY airport this time 15 minutes and you are there very confortable and easy 
389939,Aloft London Excel, No designated smoking area outside the hotel so met by plumes of smoke from other guests , Superb hotel Very informal Little details like 24 hour snack bar very handy when coming back late So close to the light rail station Very well soundproofed Excellent breKfast buffet with lots of choice 
389940,Aloft London Excel, it was the worst stay ever made my girlfrieds bday the worst day ever the staff was ok i asked to do somthing for her on the bed but they didnt also the swiming pool was nasty and the steam room where soooo nasty uner the seats my girlfrind got and infection from the swiming pool it was the worst saty ever also called cuple of times to the main desk no one picked up for ages ,No Positive
389941,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, Modern hotel nice and comfortable in line with its category Very nice breakfast ideal for Excel London exhibition centre I would definitely suggest it 
389942,Aloft London Excel, Only whole milk no skimmed or semi skilled called said they would send some up and then got whole again phoned back and said they gone none not good enough for 125 i had to go out and buy a cup of tea also no biscuts and bit rude , Nice hotel
389943,Aloft London Excel, Nothing, Lovely modern hotel Very comfortable Helpful staff Lovely fresh croissants from the refuel Very convenient for O2 after a concert Definitely would return 
389944,Aloft London Excel, Bar prices a little high, Great location two mins from prince regent DLR and twenty mins from the city and five mins from LCY airport Excellent staff Good size rooms and amenities Clean hotel with good facilities
389945,Aloft London Excel, There was nothing about this hotel that I didn t like , The staff were really friendly and efficient the rooms were extremely clean large and really comfortable We had dinner in the restaurant the food and service were excellent I couldn t fault anything in this hotel just a pleasure to stay in 
389946,Aloft London Excel, We were placed in the disabled room which we thought would come with all the mod cons as per our previous visit Sadly it didn t Furthermore the TV couldn t connect to your phone so to stream Which was a disappointment as you were led to believe it could Sadly the bar wasn t 24hrs nor was the restaurant on the premises These didn t open until 5pm So a lot of potential business was lost especially for those who didn t want to go into Excel Centre , The d cor was welcoming and so were the staff The tech was a pleasant surprise especially in the bar area Reception was bright and cheerful Gym was simple however sufficient equipment to use The sauna was lovely too although sadly no lockers 
389947,Aloft London Excel, Rooms are a little small so no bath but compact and well thought out as well as stylish , Modern vibrant and very friendly with a relaxed feel Room was ready when we arrived and the views were amazing Beds are very comfortable 
389948,Aloft London Excel, The Bar staff were seriously sub standard took an age to get served and their knowledge of cocktails was terrible We ordered the same cocktail on 3 occasions and each time it had a different taste We were in company and didn t want to cause a stir so stayed quiet On reflection probably the wrong decision , Great location Lovely suite 
389949,Aloft London Excel, the breakfast is quite expensive but it is unlimited so make sure you re hungry , location it is a very cool hotel with good facilities and a great location for ExCel london the staff are very helpful and friendly
389950,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, Rooms are really confortable best place for Excel London Exhibition center direct access from the hotel very close to London City Airport perfect isolation so very quite even during take off and landing of the planes 
389951,Aloft London Excel, Car park could be better sign posted paying made easier not the hotels fault , Vibrating pillow alarm pager for our son who is profoundly deaf the first time ever this has been offered to us Rest of the hotel facilities breakfast rooms fantastic
389952,Aloft London Excel, I didnt like the parking system they have had although i had a valid badge displayed on my car they still issued parking ticket for me which is really disappointing of such a place , The room was good
389953,Aloft London Excel, Have to pay 16 per day for the car park , I will definitely stay here again the next time I attend an Excel event as it is right next to the convention centre Prince Regent DLR station is a two minute walk so it is easy to get to anywhere in London 40 minutes to West End The hotel is clean modern and has everything you need 
389954,Aloft London Excel, On the day we did not decline housekeeping they did tidy our room but did not top up supplies such as plastic beakers and did not change sheets which was a problem as I had a new colleague joining me for the last night The shower pressure is weak Drinks in the bar very expensive More than 20 for a gin and tonic campari and orange and a coke is excessive Coffee from machine rather pricey too for a small mug , The twin bedded room was very spacious and comfy The self service food hub open all hours was so useful when returning late from meetings and needing a quick but healthy meal and choices for breakfast good and affordable reception staff and some of the canteen staff were very very friendly and helpful The option to decline housekeeping and get a voucher off food was good 
389955,Aloft London Excel, Oddly i didnt have any spoons in the room You are given wooden sticks to stir your drink weird Also the air con is on all the time i realise why you cant open the windows but i personally find the humming of it annoying But thats me , Loved the design the spacious room with very well thought through arrangement of all sorts of plugs the bar and the massive bed 
389956,Aloft London Excel, Daily DLR train to city center Towerhill Gateway and back is a bit expensive, Cool place very quiet despite of the City airport very near London Excel is 50m so that was very good 
389957,Aloft London Excel, The inhouse tv system was a little bit of a nightmare to use but it did cover everything you needed to know about the hotel y , Bed was amazing Hotel in general was absolutely beautiful Definitely will be returning soon 
389958,Aloft London Excel, We didn t like the bar there wasn t a proper bar tender and the lady who served us didn t know what she was doing so we didn t get any cocktails , We loved the suite very spacious clean and extremely comfortable Swimming pool was lovely and warm The food was delicious and reasonably priced with a delicious buffet breakfast 
389959,Aloft London Excel, Drinks are expensive shame because its a commercial hotel by the Exhibition centre not in the middle of town Modest Pre dinner drinks and two meals 120 Standard Double room 1 night So 160 120 total bill 280 A bit steep , Excellent bed absolutely first class Good shower Funky design
389960,Aloft London Excel, The location On reviews and the description it s described as being close to the 02 we didn t find that to be true as the DLR was a fair walk from the hotel itself and a taxi was even further , The hotel was lovely as were the staff and the cocktails at the bar were amazing 
389961,Aloft London Excel, The dinner menu was very disappointing Too much salad dressing drowned salad fish I ordered I didn t realize came with head skin and 100 s of bones Service was pleasant though , It s looked great sounded great and felt great I was relaxed and never stressed or rushed 
389962,Aloft London Excel, Rooms too small lift didn t work steam room didn t work reception uniform jeans This is a contractors hotel for Excel not really a couples romantic weekend hotel, Bar staff were welcoming and kind with their bar snacks
389963,Aloft London Excel, Shower Pressure was a little low toilet needed to be flushed twice each time TV was too fussy and slow to respond Parking should be included at 300 a night , Pillow Bed Soap hangers iron room service food App idea great but needs polishing WIFI accessibility
389964,Aloft London Excel, VERY SMALL bath towels NEEDING BATH SHEETS BETTER SIZES IN PREMIER INN no hooks to put towels on when exiting the shower TV geared more to the foreign traveller and channels are all over the place , good room size comfortable bed 
389965,Aloft London Excel, Swimming pool occupied by water babies each morning , Location 10 min walk from LCY airport riverside with superb transport to Canary Wharf Greenwich etc and central London good breakfast nice gym washing facilities 
389966,Aloft London Excel, Breakfast charge of 17 50 was a bit ambitious a good breakfast but not worth 17 50 ever, Location good hotel good After initial problems with booking and being given a wrong room Alison Gubbins a manager organised and helped me very efficiently taking alot of stress out of the situation 
389967,Aloft London Excel, We would have liked to have had breakfast in the restaurant but the price of 15 each for us as small eaters was an unreasonable price Food in restaurant overpriced , All staff we had dealings with were extremely friendly and efficient The 24 7 food shop is an excellent facility we bought our breakfast pastries there

390016,Aloft London Excel, As a nit pick for anyone that is strongly allergic to mould they had some black mould in the nooks and crannies of the shower generally where only a very long scrubbing session of bleach or black mould remover would get rid of For anyone else however you probably wouldn t notice I only notice such occurrences because I have relatives that are allergic so I got into a habit of looking over such things with a fine tooth comb , Everything was completely seamless we checked in quickly and had everything that we needed to know explained to us by friendly staff as it was the first time using this particular chain We also asked to use their bag store before checking in on the first day as we were early and after checking our on the last day as we were leaving London long past our checkout time and they were happy to store them for the duration for free with tags to denote which were ours This was really handy for us as the alternative would have been to stay an extra night The room was kept nice and neat as you should expect from a hotel They had sachets of filter coffee complete with disposable filters which was a refreshing change from instant coffee along with some Twinings teas tea bags and a bottle of water These were a welcome change from instant coffee as we had early mornings and a lot of walking to do For the room itself they had a flat screen TV a wired Internet connection hotel wide free wi fi an alarm clock with Bluetooth and a mini fridge I didn t test the speed of the Internet but it did just fine for the browsing that I was doing Breakfast which came with my particular package was a nice variety There was a coffee machine for filtered coffee various juices English Breakfast bits cereals fresh breads fruits pretty much something for everyone The value for money would have been higher but we stayed on a weekend that is always more expensive than normal days due to an event at Excel which we went to and we picked a hotel that was physically linked to the building 
390017,Aloft London Excel, Did not like the need to have photo ID to check in Parking at an additional cost , Large Hotel room was very good and the bed was comfy All as it should would consider again 
390018,Aloft London Excel, One member of staff at the 24 7 recharge food area needs extensive customer service training She was surly disinterested and simply just unpleasant I don t normally comment like this but she let down the rest of the friendly professional and helpful staff I mentioned this at reception when we left , Very stylish Great large bed River view Clean and welcoming The nearby DLR gets you anywhere We really enjoyed the Cutty Sark Greenwich market Docklands museum Canary Wharf and the scenic cable car over the Thames Too much to do So little time

390020,Aloft London Excel, It is a shame the Bar is not open during the day for coffee tea light snacks The do it yourself light refreshment area is all very well but we found the food quality from there to be not very good Felt the restaurant could offer more choice it was really quite limited , Like the location very modern room was comfortable and staff accommodating
390021,Aloft London Excel, WiFi was like using dial up and the dinner service in the restaurant dockersiders was very slow , Room was nice alot of space and amble room for storing stuff Bathroom was nice and shower was good Room service good and the food was very nice 
390022,Aloft London Excel, No separate temperature in the bathroom which makes it relative cold Internet speed ok but not very steady on wifi, Specious room Great to have a tea cooker
390023,Aloft London Excel, I got a deal and I don t think I would have felt it was such good value if I had paid full price for over 800 for 3 nights I would at least expect a bath better blinds on the windows and extra storage space , The staff were lovely and the food was delicious
390024,Aloft London Excel, We were given a room with a view but the view was not that great , The hotel itself is lovely loved the interior Beds were super comfortable There was a great choice of foods for breakfast Overall a nice stay
390025,Aloft London Excel, Check out was quite slow as there were only 2 people working on reception at the checkout time But thats literally all I can think of , All staff were very friendly even when walking pass the room service lady we were met with cheerful conversation And all the facilities were so clean I was also extremely impressed with the importance that was placed upon recycling and being green as I feel more hotels should do this A recalling bin was provided in the room and you could opt out of having room service to save them re cleaning towels bedding Great idea 
390026,Aloft London Excel, The cost of the food and drink was high but possibly just London prices and we didn t find many restaurants close by Sadly the staff did not offer enough information e g The hotels facilities which were excellent checkout time needing a key card to activate the lift etc , A modern spacious room with good blackout blinds Tea and coffee making facilities in the room Our room Overlooked the Royal Victoria Dock so a lovely view and the opportunity for a pleasant walk DLR Station practically next door with the Cable Car to North Grenich just a short walk away Swimming pool and gym on site 
390027,Aloft London Excel, The alarm clock didn t work the phone charge included in the room didn t work well Also not being able to open the windows for fresh air Room service was extremely limited and cost to deliver to the room Wasn t allowed to bring food to the room , The bed the view the room was amazing and the staff were brilliant 
390028,Aloft London Excel, The mattress was very hard and didn t suit us which meant we had a poor night sleep There wasn t enough tea coffee etc and it was an inconvenience to go to reception to ask for it and then wait on someone bringing it Would have preferred proper glasses instead of plastic cups , Nice and modern hotel Staff very friendly Cleanliness was excellent and quality bedding 
390029,Aloft London Excel, There were rust marks in the shower In all honesty for the price of the room they should not be there , Loved the location could not beat this for Excel Everything was expected

390036,Aloft London Excel, The only thing we found was that the fried breakfast could have been warmer By the time we sat down to eat it it had gone cold, The room was great with a kingsized bed which was very comfortable My husband said it was one of the best he d slept in The hotel was very clean Lovely contemporary furnishings and decor 
390037,Aloft London Excel, I genuinley can t think of anything , I came for the MCM expo and as the hotel was litterally conected to he back end of the Excel center is was perfectly placed The hotel itself was stylish clean and the staff were all friendly and very helpful The resturant in the hotel served delicious food and the lounge was great Free gym and swimming pool were great too 
390038,Aloft London Excel, Chose venue as it s connected to excel but staff would not let us enter by that side of the centre despite us having tickets for comic con and wrist bands on day two and three We were forced to walk to the front entererance quite a long way each time and therefore other hotels were actually closer to the entrance Total walking distance just for excel was four miles , Nice big shower nice sized room good views
390039,Aloft London Excel, The only thing I pick about is that the bar is a little pricey but apart from that it was a lovely stay , The hotel is very modern and stylish Loved the pool and gym We went for the October MCM Comic Con and is literally next door It s perfect Very clean and tidy and staff are very polite and friendly Would definitely stay again

390042,Aloft London Excel, It was quite expensive for what it was to be quite honest The room was lovely but at 315 for 2 nights plus 60 in the restaurant with cocktails at 9 50 each it was very costly The restaurant menu was limited as was the TV guide on the TV Even buying a little tube of toothpaste cost me 2 50 The hotel also took a 25 refundable deposit in case we used the mini bar or anything which they took twice as we chose after the first night to extend our stay so they took another 25 which I have still not had returned even though we didn t use any of the extras , The bed was extremely comfortable and everything was lovely and clean We didn t use the pool even though it was free to use but it did look lovely and towels were provided for the pool The location was good if you were attending an event at The ExCel albeit you have to walk all the way around the ExCel to get to the entrance The food in the Docksider restaurant was lovely Service was fast Staff were very nice too It s located right next to the Prince Regent tube station and just across from the London City Airport which provides easy access to various forms of transport You re also right near a lot of small restaurants which are just the otherside of the ExCel The O2 arena and cable cars are fairly close too Despite being so close to the airport it was pretty quiet in the hotel room as the windows blocked out most of the noise Towels a hairdryer body wash shampoo conditioner soap coat hangers a kettle tea coffee iron and ironing board and a telephone were all provided There was also access to computers printers washing machine tumble dryer and a vending machine with all the essentials in the lobby 
390043,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, I booked this as a surprise for my parents Ruby wedding anniversary The staff couldn t have been more helpful and even gave them a free upgrade to a suite Thank you so much for making their weekend even more special

390047,Aloft London Excel, Not having breakfast as part of my booking deal Was a let down Redicilous price for breakfast without the deals , Second visit I like the modern feel to the property 
390048,Aloft London Excel, Missing an easy type chair in the bedroom Seating that was supplied was an office type chair and bench type sofa but was directly under the wall mounted tv therefore you couldn t sit and watch tv Lighting was too dim to apply make up However overall a lovely pleasant place to stay with a great location, The location right next to The excel Stadium and closeness for the railway 
390049,Aloft London Excel, Found a bug in my room could been a small cockroach you know the ones with a softer shell I was I was in a hurry and forgot my toothbrush asked for help they made me spend time getting downstairs to the lobby and get one my self from a vending machine I would pay for it obviously they just did not want to go up to the room with it Food was ok only ok, The design Ironing capabilities Big room 
390050,Aloft London Excel, They dont provide room service The phone to call reception didnt work so i had to call from my mobile to main desk , Accessible rooms are nice and spacious 
390051,Aloft London Excel, The only problem we had was that I had requested a twin room and was given a double due to no twin rooms being available If this is the case the hotel should notify you could have given us a discounted breakfast instead of the 17 50 that we refused to pay , On all we had a good stay at aloft excel The bed was super comfy the room was lovely and clean 
390052,Aloft London Excel, Not much at all Maybe a breakfast buffet included in the price, The hotel was beautiful inside and out The bed was heaven Everything was immaculate It was very easy to get to from central London Lovely location 
390053,Aloft London Excel, Quite a long way out of town Once you re back from a day s sightseeing you don t feel like popping in again We were there for a weekend and quite a bit of public transport was down for repairs this affected our ability to get around so easily Repairs apparently often happen at weekends , New new new comfy beds great TV excellent views of area high tech modern feel decor Right next to Docklands Light Railway to town good buses You get to see Docklands and some of the East from the DLR Good value for money Two bus stops from London City Airport and our flight from there moved quickly and efficiently Easy exit 
390054,Aloft London Excel, As the stay was work related I wanted to change the payment card to my business one which is in a different name I have often done this at other hotels but this was refused There was no hot water for a shower in the morning and I was advised that a boiler had broken down These things happen but a shower is an essential part of the service I think it would have been a courtesy to offer some compensation a free breakfast or credit of some kind without having to ask After asking they agreed to pay my parking Not really enough , The room was very spacious and the bed very comfortable I liked the little 24hr take away area selling snacks and drinks 
390055,Aloft London Excel, Dining and breakfast was subpar airco too cold Price quality a little lacking for the restaurant dinner 2x Soup very small no bread with pasta Little annoying details that spoiled a bit the total picture And acoustics are not great With plenty of guests it was cantine like , Location is perfect Direct lines to centre Close to airport and conference Excellent room Swimming pool great
390056,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, Staff very friendly helpful DLR Station Prince Regent just 2 minutes away wxyz Bar nice Place to drink something and take a snack I liked the Room with the modern touch and the size of the Room 
390057,Aloft London Excel, The distance from the center is a bit big so expect a long travel time and not so many shops by so if you need to buy something do it before going to the hotel otherwise you will have to use the facilities in the hotel , Hotel was in top shape and service was really good everything you need is there
390058,Aloft London Excel, The main front of house staff member was unfriendly and not very helpful The free wifi was good for Emails and quick google searches but anything besides that ie watching movies would not work The fire alarm was the loudest fire alarm I have ever heard and after putting my fingers into my ears for 5 minutes my head was still ringing Thought that this was more disorientating than helpful Also since the hotel is pet friendly the fire alarm would seriously damage a dogs hearing The shower head was not fixed properly and hit both me and my partner on the head bad enough to leave bruises Lastly the parking fee was 16 for a day and the machine doesn t accept cards only coins , The location is great as it is only 2 minutes walk from the DLR line station taking you to London in 20 minutes The standard double room is big and separated to a suite style standard The hotel is pet friendly The Excel building is a literally next door The whole hotel was clean and nicely decorated 
390059,Aloft London Excel, Maybe biscuits to go with coffee, well presented hotel large rooms excellent facilities especially like the proper coffee and bottle of water in room 
390060,Aloft London Excel, Unfortunately we were in a room next to a couple that shouted all night their child cried all night and they shouted more so it wasn t relaxing at all Got no sleep it literally felt like we shared a room with these people even though a wall and door was inbetween, The room was a lovely size huge comfy bed and nice facilities
390061,Aloft London Excel, Front desk people have bias on Booking s customers I put prefer a king bed room However we don t have the priority to have that Called the front desk for 20 mins no one answered the call Again On next day morning Someone didn t knock the door and entered my room When this person realize someone is in the room just shut the door without any apologize I am so regret I didn t spent 10 more to stay in crown plaza which is 100 meters away ,No Positive

390067,Aloft London Excel, bed mattress very hard if breakfast was included in price would visit more frequently food in bar was awful out of curry and drinks very expensive, food for breakfast excellent chef needs positive feedback best choice ever had in 30 years of hotels
390068,Aloft London Excel, Nothing all was good There were tea and coffee supplies missing from drinks tray in my room but the food shop in foyer replaced these without question immediately following my request , Staff apologised for putting me in the Disabled Access rooms on the Ground Floor but in fact I was very happy with my room as it was very spacious and had a huge bathroom and showers Food shop in foyer really helpful Location of hotel right next to DLR was superb Also the scheme whereby guests can save the planet and reduce wastage by opting for limited housekeeping visits in return for free food vouchers is an inspired idea and was very welcome 
390069,Aloft London Excel, No negative comments , Great Location 3 4 mins walk from Prince Regent DLR Good Comfortable Room and Shower Facilities including Pool excellent Price for overnight stay although this will be quite different when something is on locally or at Excel 
390070,Aloft London Excel, No handcream in the toilets , Everything was fantastic Staff were friendly and efficient Hotel layout was excellent and it was ideally situated Would definitely go there again 
390071,Aloft London Excel, Breakfast was 17 50 per person Looked like a nice Buffett but sorry that ridiculously over priced after all 10 minute walk up the road u have cafes costing 4 50 for a full English Too over priced for east London Really a down selling point for such a great hotel , Amazing modern hotel Lots to do in the hotel as well as surrounding areas Pool and gym area is top of the range and immaculate Steam room perfect to relax in after a gym session and swim Hotel bar nice vibe and feel to it Check in was quick and all info needed was given Room clean and spacious Super comfy beds too 
390072,Aloft London Excel, The showerheads are huge and heavy and twice slipped down and hit my partner on the head , Very clean staff where SO helpful the room was stylish and comfortable
390073,Aloft London Excel, Bed sheets should be changed often not only when prompted No room service and no coincerge for luggages, Very clean rooms and good facilities Closeness to the train station is a major plus
390074,Aloft London Excel, Breakfast is more expensive if you don t request it at check in for some strange reason Parking is quite expensive for a hotel , Very clean and modern room comfortable bed good level of technology in the room 
390075,Aloft London Excel, The fact I had called and asked to specifically have the highest room available with a river view yet on arrival one member of reception staff said to come back and check in at 3 so that the room would be ready then at 3 when I came back I was told actually no you can t have the room you have to take the room we first offered you , The bed and shower
390076,Aloft London Excel, We found our room to be a triumph of design over practicality There is no where to store anything more than a couple of shirts Not sure about the dressing area being in the bathroom let alone the tea making facilities The room is very dark , The building is funky and it s handy for the Excel and Dlr The staff were lovely The rooms are well sound proofed Also there is parking 
390077,Aloft London Excel, Unfortunately during my stay the closed the pool due to a leak so I wasn t able to enjoy the full facilities , The room was very clean The room is very Morden and stylish the staff always try to help and the breakfast is amazing 
390078,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, Walk in shower K size bed room facilities all excellent Being close to restaraunt at the same level was perfect for my disabled wife Thank you 
390079,Aloft London Excel, We had to upgrade to get a double bed because they said they were full and because we had booked through a third party and not direct with them they were not obliged to fulfill our request Staff were not friendly and I like to see front of desk staff in smart clothes not jeans and t shirts, It had a nice view of the docks 
390080,Aloft London Excel, Car park costs when quiet are unreasonable Food was very expensive Beer was too expensive even for london, Staff very friendly and helpful Girls on bar were very nice Gym and pool very good
390081,Aloft London Excel, Was either a very long walk from canning town station or a decent walk plus 3 50 from north Greenwich station and Emirates and still a long walk through or around the excel building Breakfast wasn t included either , Great value for the price and the pool was great Sauna and steam rooms were also a plus 
390082,Aloft London Excel, The window shades don t roll up straight thus letting in light One of ours was torn from being off its track , Aloft is very conveniently located the DLR and Emirates Air Cable Car are both very close The indoor pool is nice and stays open late enough to use after a long day in the city The room was very quiet well insulated against sounds from outside 
390083,Aloft London Excel, Massage and other spa options wasn t available Upon arrival and check in I should have been asked if I would prefer a view of the Thames or view of tube station that option should be given if both are available as I changed room because I was given the tube view and wanted a Thames view instead , Gym was clean room was large spacious and comfortable
390084,Aloft London Excel, Overall the place is amazing deccent location The staff are very friendly and helpful But The Internet connection is poor so your can t get the chrome cast too work The room air conditioning is hard to manage which made the room very cold , It s a nice size room Morden design Not hard to get to Staff are friendly 
390085,Aloft London Excel, Parking expensive limited restaurant menu for vegetarians Take away coffee etc too pricy, Bright rooms ample storage well equipped bath shower room professional reception staff 
390086,Aloft London Excel, The location is a bit far east of London city centre However I enjoyed a quite area and discovered a new place to stay , Very close to London city airport lovely staff welcoming friendly staff casual uniform gym smell of the place lovely atmosphere fantastic outdoor view Many many awesome thing to share in one place I just LOVE it 
390087,Aloft London Excel, Pool was out of order and staff are friendly but sometimes difficult to understand, The overall design style was very modern and contemporary food excellent and facilities great
390088,Aloft London Excel, Parking is expensive considering its not a very secure carpark no security barriers etc although it s looked over by the hotel rooms which provides a sense some security The range of food at the hotel restaurant and their snack bar is very limited so don t Really have much choice but to travel out for dinner each night Also the Main entrance to the hotel felt like it had been built on the wrong side of the building conflated to the car park as the car park entrance to the hotel outs the more heavily used yet less impressive compared to the one on the other side of the building, The staff were very helpfull although at times they seem a bit confused and rushed just a short 10 minuet walk away on the other side of the excel centre there are some of the best restaurants you could ask for which were reasonably priced and staff were fantastic Also has brillient access for the tube via the dlr line into the centre of London from the hotel
390089,Aloft London Excel, I could hear the woman in the adjacent room getting jiggy with it when I was trying to get to sleep so soundproofing between rooms could be improved , The bed was very comfortable windows were soundproof enough not to hear the planes landing at the airport nearby 
390090,Aloft London Excel, Nothing in particular , It was a lovely hotel a bit prices compared to nearby hotels but the services were just fabulous I was sad I didn t get to go swimming in the pool but then that was down to busy me not making time in my busy schedule during my stay All in all the hotel was lovely staff were helpful and pleasant and the facilities were lovely Would definitely book again if the price was just a bit lower to compete against the other hotels 
390091,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, excellent position straight off the dlr at prince regent all flat walking london excell 10 seconds away excellent views friendly and speedy welcome and reception
390092,Aloft London Excel, The lady serving in the panini snack area was incredibly rude and unhelpful it spoiled my whole weekend Shame because the rest of the staff were lovely, The reception staff the decor the lights in the corridor 
390093,Aloft London Excel, Check in was poor we were traveling with our company and although rooms were paid in full we could not check in until we had card made with booking I was made to wait four hours until all staff arrived as they also could not check in until everyone had there ID could not have one and not the other who would have the company card when your boss was not travelling or staying that day for this reason we would never book again , Location
390094,Aloft London Excel, There is a 75pound deposit that they didn t tell you about until you got there So just remember that , The staff were absolutely amazing The pool was lovely and everything was clean and the beds were so comfy The rooms were a perfect size 
390095,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, It was really clean and well presented with extras such as the gym and the pool and the bar etc It was in a great location as it was right next to the Excel centre but also Prince Regent 10 10 definitely would stay again and recommend 
390096,Aloft London Excel, This is NOT a hotel however there are places to eat nearby Accommodation also houses students some of whom were lost cofused drunk and noisily trying my door at 2 30am Apart from that great , This is NOT a hotel but self catering apartments All beds comfy Apartment was spotlessly clean 
390097,Aloft London Excel, More information about the public transport would be better No info given at check in and ended up paying a small fortune trying to get around , Most comfortable bed ever Air conditioning was brilliant considering it was 30degrees Modern and fresh decor 
390098,Aloft London Excel, There was no mirror in the main living space to do your hair with appliances The pool was beautiful however it was very confusing how to access retrieve towels etc Most had to ask other guests already in the pool Tea tray in room was really good however only 3 milk thimbles is not enough and when we asked downstairs for more and 1 extra camomile tea only 1 for 2 people we were told we would have to pay for the tea bag This made me feel very embarrassed as it is not common practice it most hotels , The bed was so comfy The hotel was beautifully designed with really modern decor A card operated lift was great so you could only get off at your own floor Great location right next to the station with great views enroute to hotel Although there was a few issues that could be improved slightly don t let this put you off I would certainly return to this hotel in a flash 
390099,Aloft London Excel, We are older couple so our eyesight is not like it was when we were young Why why why do designers insist on putting information in low contrast so it is difficult to decipher We see it time and again In the lifts at Aloft the floor information is engraved into the metal plates beside the numbers and slightly darker than surrounding so we had to bend over and peer closely to try and read Yes we have glasses The change rooms at the pool are unisex only two of them with obscure glass doors on two walls with no locking devices My wife was not impressed and said IF she went swimming again in the pool she would walk dripping wet back to her room and change there For a supposedly innovative hotel the breakfasts were anything but extremely ordinary bordering on tasteless The hotel is located in a new development area empty offices and no shops I had to walk 2k s to find a supermarket , Good size room great king size bed good shower toilet area I think the pricing is right 
390100,Aloft London Excel, Bathroom door impossible to close Swimming pool shut as we arrived for a number of days with no warning Breakfast was mediocre , Comfortable beds lovely room 
390101,Aloft London Excel, No complaints, Top marks for location cost closeness of public transport 15 min journey to central London restaurant bar in hotel and also those within 10 min walk Friendly and informative staff Will definitely return 
390102,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, Room was lovely modern Coffee Tea in room Very clean Good view from room looking on to River Room spacious Heard no noises from outside 
390103,Aloft London Excel, Check in not the most welcoming slick, Location for Excel for the Triathlon space and comport of the rooms Parking and accessibility to DLR to get into London
390104,Aloft London Excel, Water pressure in the shower was problematic , Just about everything This has to be the best value hotel in London Right on the DLR so easy to get anywhere 
390105,Aloft London Excel, Went to celebrate our wedding anniversary and got a disability friendly room Bathroom had a very unpleasant smell They charge for toothbrush and toothpaste 2 50each when other hotel provide these for free There s no room service for breakfast Asked for an upgrade with river view got a room with 2 small widows with limited view of the river Overall very disappointed with our stay Will not go back there again ,No Positive
390106,Aloft London Excel, The adjoining restaurant was lovely but service was a bit slow, Comfiest bed I think I ever had at a hotel and great location for London Excel Good view of the athletes competing from my bed 
390107,Aloft London Excel, Would have liked more choice of TV channels Water pressure in shower was a little lower than I d hoped , Brilliant location with the added bonus of being able to watch the triathlon outside the window The bed was really comfortable and the hotel itself was spotless 
390108,Aloft London Excel, We got trapped outside the 2nd floor bedrooms when the battery in the door card reader died Staff dealt with this minor niggle quickly and cheerfully can t really fault them , We stayed as we were taking part in the London Triathlon at the Excel Perfect location great shower we ll definitely stay here again next year 
390109,Aloft London Excel, Room could have been attend to before 6pm both days, Staff In particular Restaurant Management were extremely poor unhelpful gave staff a bollocking in front of the customers and she didn t react well to feedback 
390110,Aloft London Excel, The food and drinks took forever to serve in the restaurant and then was cold but as it was about 10pm when it finally came out we didn t have the time to send it back We were on the 8th floor and the drain in the shower smelt awful the whole night morning , This is the second time we have come here for the London triathlon and it s the perfect location
390111,Aloft London Excel, The swimming pool was closed during our three day stay The breakfast was terrible and cost 15 per head buffet style and poor quality The bedroom windows did not open and I personally like fresh air in a room , The rooms were very clean and well presented The bar area was very modern and comfortable
390112,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, Just a 20 minute walk from the airport Very close to public transport Nice building my room had a nice view on the river Nice little shop with some snacks 
390113,Aloft London Excel, The restaurant gave my partner mayonnaise in his burger even though we told them he has allergies so he spent the evening very sick There was a USED condom wrapper by the bed when we checked in The swimming pool was out of service which was disappointing as this is why we chose this hotel Front desk apparently didn t receive our late check out request No choice of lunchtime meal Restaurant far too expensive and menu too small Will NEVER return again , Breakfast buffet was a good variety Fridge in room 
390114,Aloft London Excel, The pillows the lack of towels when I went to swim in early morning the coffee pouches , The croissants the swimming pool the breakfast or snack bar the space and view from the room The location 
390115,Aloft London Excel, We had to queue for over half an hour to be seen on arrival then had to give a deposit of 25 after already pre paying for the room I was then told the swimming pool was closed due to maintenance and they were unsure if it would be reopened during our stay I also asked for a room on the bottom floor due to being claustrophobic and not being able to get in the elevator they refused so I had to carry my luggage up the stairs to the fifth floor once arriving to our room we had a twin room instead of a king sized bed that I paid extra for I was so disappointed as I had booked the hotel for my boyfriends birthday I spoke to a manager about the way I felt and he refused to do anything to help I was not refunded and I will not be using booking com again and will definitely not be returning to this awful hotel ,No Positive
390116,Aloft London Excel, The complimentary toiletries are a bit basic Molton Brown or similar quality would be better , Friendly welcoming staff Very comfortable room and bed Clean and well equipped Location 
390117,Aloft London Excel, Beds a little too soft for me but my daughter loved them, Excellent room and facilities very good all round and price very reasonable for the standard 
390118,Aloft London Excel, Food over priced and disappointing I ordered sea bass and I m sure it was microwaved It was minuscule too My partner s chicken was poor also Veg nice though , Location ideal of ExCel Value for money room Friendly reception staff Nice cold lager in the bar 
390119,Aloft London Excel, Staff was rude didn t try to help me at all I booked a suite the blinds where all torn holes all over them I don t ever leave bad reviews but it was just too bad not to say anything, Nothing really
390120,Aloft London Excel, Air con noisy and couldn t be turned off meant a night of broken sleep when I had to be up early for a sporting event I was taking part in , Great location 
390121,Aloft London Excel, Staff werent so nice this time around didnt like the way we have to warm up our food aswell for the snacks and etc but the man there was trying to be helpful on the other hand didnt like how i was treated in reception Also when we ordered food for our room they left it in the toilet instead of the actually room which is rude and un hygienic Also we left a note on booking for something nice to be done because we was there for a special ocasion nothing was done infact they gave us a room on 3rd floor not even high and with a bad view last time we was serviced way better than this time round They also didnt give us information of the wifi and their new system on ordering food online only So there is lack of information there, Its comfortable
390122,Aloft London Excel, Need to improve breakfast Bacon too fatty Eggs rubbery Most of all ned to get a decent coffee maker and ditch the acrid drip coffee , Stylish decor Comfortable bed Excellent facilities Loved the pool sauna and gym 
390123,Aloft London Excel, There wasn t always clean towels available in the pool area , A majority of the staff were very accommodating The beds are extra comfortable the pool was refreshing and the hotel is located on the waterfront which makes for a lovely walk The tube station is a 2 min walk very easily accessible 
390124,Aloft London Excel, We booked a double room and got a twin room Extra bin should be in bathroom and a mirror in the bedroom and proper changeling rooms in the pool area as they are see through , The swimming pool was Lovely and warm bedroom spotless Very quiet Modern 
390125,Aloft London Excel, That I couldn t stay an extra day , Proximity and ease of access to London Tasty food breakfast grills Modern and spacious rooms Cool bar even got pizza at 10 30pm
390126,Aloft London Excel, The water seal under the shower door was hanging off The chrome cast device in the room wasn t functioning and the 24 hour parking rate could be cheaper , The bed was extremely comfortable did not want to get out We also had a beautiful view from our room The building is of a modern design and this is reflected in the rooms 
390127,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, This might be the best hotel we ve stayed in to date Really modern and clean and the location was great if you re okay with staying a bit out of the centre of London We didn t really need maid service and we were fine to reuse our towels so you just hang a sign on the door and you receive a 5 food voucher The front desk staff were friendly and efficient and helped us out when we wanted to stay another night We stayed on the second floor and it leads out onto a terrace where you will find the entrance to the DLR so really convenient The pool is awesome and also has a sauna steam and a gym Don t even hesitate just book this hotel 
390128,Aloft London Excel, I liked everything but I did stay only one night , The bed was comfy very nice and clean hotel their focus on design really shows and it s a pleasant sight I enjoyed the sauna pool and the gym although the pool could have a slightly deeper end 
390129,Aloft London Excel, Staff were not very accommodating Request for twin room was not met and no alternative offered Service at bar was extremely slow , Very comfortable room with excellent facilities 
390130,Aloft London Excel, Staff behind the bar were lacking in customer service and took too long in serving few customers, Clean accommodating with having a pet and warm welcome 
390131,Aloft London Excel, The breakfast n drinks were so expensive 10 pound for cocktails 15 pound for breakfast where down in royal victoria dock cafes were giving full breakfasts for 5 piunds Also breakfast not tasty sausages were half raw n not nice , Hotel rooms very tidy and comfortable Nice clean shower Nice location if bit far from city 
390132,Aloft London Excel, Long way to go for any choice of restaurants in the evening Shower lacked pressure Work on DLR over the weekend made the journey take even longer , Grab and go cafe was very good beds were extremely comfortable Fair price for distance out of centre 
390133,Aloft London Excel, The bar prices are over the top kids swimming lessons in the pool for seemed like most of the weekend, The service received from management when I complained about there being no WiFi in our room with no hesitations we were transfered to a suit well done Christopher
390134,Aloft London Excel, For tourist travelling it is a bit far from the city centre and takes about 30 minutes from Trafalgar Square , It was a very luxurious room and that was the basic option I would definitely consider staying here again and will ask my company to book me in there when they send me to London for business 
390135,Aloft London Excel, The location is a little bit far from central london Yet the hotel is very close to the DLR line so it is still okay Going to leicester square it took us around 35 min Our room was next to another room and therefore there was a door connect two rooms Although there were 2 doors to prevent the residents in other room to enter the noise of the other room was quite obvious and annoying , The room was very tidy and clean The air conditioner was a real one but not something like a fan The design of the lobby was modern and staffs were helpful I definitely recommend people to stay in this hotel The room worths this price 
390136,Aloft London Excel, The only down side was you couldn t use the pool table during the day only when the bar opened at 5pm, A nice big room with everything you need and very comfortable A good buffet style breakfast 
390137,Aloft London Excel, We arrived around 2pm and the restaurant was not open It would have been nice to be able to have a late lunch to start our stay We got a sandwich from the Grab and Go shop instead Also we missed having a fridge in our room , Atmosphere was nice standards were high staff were friendly and helpful and location was great Our room was extremely comfortable and spacious Loved having the pool facility 
390138,Aloft London Excel, The use of the spa was a bit confusing check with reception to be clear regarding changing rooms No drinking water facility in the pool area but there was in gym , Location was easy for short commute on DLR into London Room was quiet clean and comfortable Dogs can stay FOC Enjoyed watching planes take off and land short walk from London City Airport runway 
390139,Aloft London Excel, I liked everything , I liked everything the hotel is probably one of the best I ve ever stayed at Loved every minute of it Nice stylish lavish room with nice showers and decent view King size bed with the softest sheets and speakers 
390140,Aloft London Excel, Layout of the breakfast buffet could be redesigned to improve efficiency with self service , Room had a view of city skyline There was onsite parking breakfast buffet had varied menu 
390141,Aloft London Excel, We asked for s double bed on arrival was told we had two singles but then they found us the disabled room with double bed which was fine but if hadn t had that my husband is 6ft 3 would have found impossible in single bed p, Staff very friendly
390142,Aloft London Excel, Didn t like the disco music in the elevator Toiletries very basic Most disappointing to book a hotel that has a swimming pool only to find it is ridiculously too hot to swim in Neighbourhood lacking culture Doors slam loudly , Comfortable well designed modern attractive room immediately next door to ICC 
390143,Aloft London Excel, More light in bedrooms and a bath would have been nice but the shower was great so only a little niggle , The bed was great and the service and staff amazing 
390144,Aloft London Excel, Would have liked more plug sockets in room though and tv a little difficult to figure out initially A little disappointed with the location as I didn t quite realise how far from central London it was but that was an error on my part If you were going for the ExCel centre it would be excellent Not a great deal to do in the surrounding area on an evening though , Bed very comfy Room a very good size and very clean Shower amazing Very modern and funky decor Nice and secure needed room key to access lift to the floor we stayed on 
390145,Aloft London Excel, Towels ran out both days at pool area as heavy usage in the evenings Perhaps conditioner in room Perhaps more tv channels , love the pool Clean Tranquil haven Love the room from in room fridge empty to chill own food and drinks Air con super efficient Bed v comfy Staff v welcoming Loved the courtesy car to canary wharf 
390146,Aloft London Excel, The room felt cold and the lighting was really poor The lights in the bathroom and shower were so dull I could hardly see things clearly and the lighting over the mirrors in the bathroom felt like strip lighting which is awful to get ready under it made the room feel cold The hotel was very modern which was great but lacked a comfortable and homely feeling which I think helps when people are working away from home The room service menu wasnt particularly extensive and could do with more choice , I loved the style of the hotel and cleanliness 
390147,Aloft London Excel, Location wise it is a little out of the way from the main attractions so I feel like it was a bit overpriced for where it is at You do have a DLR underground line right next to the hotel which helps you get wherever you want quickly though , Lovely luxury hotel I really enjoyed my stay there Very clean and the staff were very nice friendly and helpful Plenty of spaces in the car park too which was good I would come here again should I find a deal for my next dates 
390148,Aloft London Excel, Far from city and nice restaurants so not a good location if you want to see London as well 40 mins travel time to places of interest Hotel food is ordinary and it s a limited uninspiring dinner menu Breakfast the usual buffet fare but very ordinary quality staff slow to replenish stocks Hotel looks good but construction cheap trimmings fell off in shower for example , Very Convenient for conference location excel and DLR which is a vg service connecting with many tube lines and rail networks 
390149,Aloft London Excel, The TV Wanted to watch movies with my chrome cast but the wifi wasn t allowing the chrome cast to connect so I was just watching the same boring old channel If chrome cast was able to connect to the wifi like some other high end hotels I ve been too this will be a top 5 star hotel for me, The rooms are very clean spacious and stylish
390150,Aloft London Excel, A bit expensive as we overlooked the parking area but it is London , Vegan breakfast options was good There was freshly made sausages as part of the buffet 
390151,Aloft London Excel, When we arrived at 2pm we didn t expect the rooms to be ready but the bar wasn t open until 5pm which we found strange We had to go across the road to the other hotel or the pub It s not as close to the O2 as it describes It s a 25 mins taxi ride or and over ground and tube to get to it , Hotel and amenities were great very comfy room and lovely breakfast included Staff very polite 
390152,Aloft London Excel, Expensive parking and bed covers had blood stain on it which we forgot to mention to staff as we were only there for couple of nights , Good location excellent facilities friendly stay Lovely swimming pool and breakfast was nice 
390153,Aloft London Excel, They were away from anywhere No ships or amenities near by, The cleanliness was excellent the staff couldn t do enough Very welcoming And I had a problem with the booking They sorted it out straight away Will stay again 
390154,Aloft London Excel, Shower was a bit strange with the frosted glass panel separating it from the main bedroom part Pillows were too soft for my liking i wasnt enough but 2 were too much Pool was bit on the small side but still adequate Wasnt always a parking space available and it was cheaper to stay in the ExCel covered car park , plenty of space in the room for cases bags etc Beds very comfy Awesome views from the higher floors Staff were very friendly and helpful Loved the 24hour snack bar in the lobby Bar was a great place to sit and chill of an evening and Id recommend the pizzas as they were delicious Very close to the ExCel centre and the DLR which was perfect for us 
390155,Aloft London Excel, Nothing I didn t like if I was being picky I would have liked to have a few more tea bags in the room but I didn t ask for more and staff were so friendly I m sure they d have been more than happy to help , Great location a few minutes walk from Prince Regent station great size room room was well soundproofed to ensure a quiet night sleep and was a well designed space I didn t try out restaurants or pool but they look very nice 
390156,Aloft London Excel, Shower wasn t powerful enough Incomprehensible TV internet At these prices a completely self service buffet breakfast isn t really good enough , Friendly professional staff Nicely styled Free wi fi 
390157,Aloft London Excel, The shower was weak but perfectly functional My main gripe was that we opted not to have linen towels changed each day but this meant the tea and coffee facilities were not refreshed , I particularly enjoyed the coffee in the room and thought the facilities were a nice addition to our stay Being right on the DLR route was a bonus 
390158,Aloft London Excel, Not sure why we had to swipe our room cards to use the lift which we weren t told about so got a little confused by them not working the hair dryer was good but the cable was rediculously short The breakfast was ok But nothing special The tinned mushrooms where extremely salty , The staff where very welcoming The hotel and rooms spotless Nice and quiet Didn t hear one slamming door 
390159,Aloft London Excel, A bit pricey not alot around the area and not much information given Not told how to use the lift and room service is expensive we wasn t pleased with the size of our food for the price and wasn t on a plate it was in a cardboard box and didn t even get a spoon or folk with it , Some of the staff were very friendly especially a lady that only started last week works at the bar and the hotel room was very good We enjoyed our stay very much and would return

390179,Aloft London Excel, Receptionist insisted that she needed to swipe the same card as the one that was used to book not great when the booking has been made for someone else and they don t have the card How ridiculous Then told that although double beds requested they couldn t be guaranteed as we booked through a third party REALLY its a huge hotel I am sure they had double rooms Just wanted to treat us like third class citizens The bar was incredibly noisy due to music and waited 15 mins to be ignored We gave up went to the shop to hear a 10 minute sob story from the cashier about how she had not got her time off etc etc All in all staff were bolshy and unhelpful and unless you are a young trendy like really really loud music and don t care what type of bed you sleep in my advice would be not to bother Shame though as the location is perfect and it could be really really nice if they were prepared to cater to everyone s taste , clean and modern hotel 
390180,Aloft London Excel, Drinks and food cost was a little steep but not bad for location, Rooms are great and the location perfect for the excel centre really clean and smart hotel

390190,Aloft London Excel, We were car park side and on floor 6 and there was low level generator noise Not too intrusive but then I had been to see Iggy Pop so my ears were shot anyway Maybe that s why I didn t hear any aircraft in the morning either , Comfy bed well designed room layout so it feels less compact than it actually is Quiet room generator apart see what didn t you like No aircraft noise either there were no planes in the morning or the glazing is extra soundproof Didn t have breakfast as its 15 head so went to Canary Wharf instead 
390191,Aloft London Excel, As I was in a rush I asked them to bring my luggage to the room unfortunately they couldn t offer this service , Best hotel if you attend an event at the ExCeL

390193,Aloft London Excel, Would of liked to have had an ice dispenser in the reception shop area to allow us to gain ice for drinking water during the later hours We checked in fairly late and by the time we had finished dinner check in etc it seemed an inconvenience to ask the reception staff for ice from behind a closed bar Would of been good to have an ice dispenser that we could freely use as and when only a thought the rest of the overnight stay was fantastic , Great welcome from staff modern contemporary with good pool and gym facilities Love the room styling with one of the most comfiest beds i ve ever slept in 
390194,Aloft London Excel, Look above, The soap dispenser was broken so I had to open the top to use soap It was disgusting slimy and dirty The choice of tv channels was good Bed comfy No breakfast included despite paying over 70 quid Overall ok
390195,Aloft London Excel, The pool was in use for private baby swim club for some of the time which meant we had to wait to use the pool, the breakfast was great and the closeness to the DLR station was very handy

390198,Aloft London Excel, Hello I m sorry I had to rate the cleanliness a little lower It s just that one of the elevators carpet floor was rather disgusting as it was saturated with a nasty spillage stain of either cafe latte or hot chocolate I fortunately It didn t leave a good impression Even though the rooms were spotless , Every thing really except the very dirty stained elevator carpeted floor 
390199,Aloft London Excel, The view from our room wasn t amazing partly had the Excel Arena blocking some of the view of the river docklands Would have preferred a room on a higher level and maybe on the other side of the building Just would have preffered a better view but hey ho I m still happy , I liked all of the little neat touches in the room such as the coffee machine safe the charging dock adaptable for all phones etc D Even after checking out we were still allowed to use the pool which exceeded my expectations For a while it was just me my friend in the pool which was great as we enjoyed ourselves without being bothered

390202,Aloft London Excel, The room was too hot the aircon wasn t man enough to cool it down so I had to endure a sleepless night without any opening windows in a room that was 24 degrees The online room service was a massive faff the wifi dropped out several times whilst trying to make the order and when it was finally done there was no confirmation and the order was short of a couple of items when it arrived This was down to human error so rendered the whole online ordering pointless would have been MUCH easier quicker to just order over the phone The Pizza was tiny too , The staff were friendly and the facilities good the food was great and the room was clean spacious and modern Free wifi was a bonus and the location right next to the Excel is great for business This hotel is much better than the other hotels I ve stayed in at the Excel apart from a couple of little negatives

390206,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, The room we were give was large great window seats and a view of the river Even better was the closeness to the O2 and the DLR which made this idea for exploring the city Breakfast had a great variety and catered for people with different dietary needs including soya milk which my wife was impressed by as she normally has to bring her own 
390207,Aloft London Excel, Staff got slightly stressed and we re a bit grumpy on occasions, Fantastic location if going to the excel Hotel rooms amazing Extremely comfy beds Breakfast great 
390208,Aloft London Excel, The only thing was we got in one night and wanted to buy a snack from the 24 7 snack bar but there was only one man on and people were ordering pizza and he had to make them to order meaning he wasn t on the till to serve so we had to wait ages Also a few more tea bags and milks in the room would be good , The room was lovely it had everything you could want The bed was a good size and comfy with nice views of the ExCel area of London The facilities were good though we didn t use any of them The location couldn t be better practically with its own DLR station and the staff were so lovely

390210,Aloft London Excel, Door in bathroom wouldn t close rooms weren t ready at check in time dirty cleaning rag in bathroom no instant coffee no milk in room wasn t told how to activate lift outdoor area doors locked had to walk around to get outside No place to park near hotel so you have to pay 16 to park per day, Bed was very comfortable
390211,Aloft London Excel, My steak was terrible difficult being understood at times English was not a first language Odering room service was overly complicated with the lohgest e mail address ever , Decor Room 
390212,Aloft London Excel, The staff , Reception staff appeared bored and uninterested I was treated as though I was an inconvenience at both check in and check out The hotel is great but I do not expect Travelodge quality reception staff when paying almost 300 for a one night stay 
390213,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, The hotel is very clean and very modern which creates a very relaxing ambiance It is also great for visiting the Excel and Docklands Canary Wharf as it is right next door The DLR is also on the doorstep 
390214,Aloft London Excel, Prices higher than normal as our trip coincided with the London marathon which we didn t know when we arranged our trip , Good quality room Comfortable bed and arranged special request for non feather pillows etc 
390215,Aloft London Excel, Cost of breakfast drinks and Dinner were very high Main course 18 didn t even have vegetables , Location was excellent Plenty of food for breakfast 
390216,Aloft London Excel, I would like a bedroom window which can be opened I missed a shaving mirror , It is quite clean and comfortable I ve enjoyed the swimming pool very much 
390217,Aloft London Excel, The restaurant was just the worst based on our dinner experiences in the restaurant I would not use this hotel again see my trip advisor review for full details I was very shocked at some of the practice for such a hotel The breakfast was very average for what it cost Too far from other facilities places to eat at night , The staff were on the whole very friendly The room was very clean 
390218,Aloft London Excel, No cons, Room was clean modern and comfy The heated swim pool was lovely to use as with the Sauna and steam room My daughter and I had a lovely stay

390221,Aloft London Excel, Shower s water pressure wasn t very good , Literal 2 minute walk from the DLR station beautiful decor extensive facilities gym swimming pool Internet access 24x7 food shop etc spacious room etc for cheaper than a Travelodge 
390222,Aloft London Excel, Restaurant was lousy Sat evening the bar service was slow We asked to eat in the bar area because there weren t any tables in the restaurant A staff member said you can t the manager won t let you But didn t ask if we d like to book a table So we had to find another staff member to book They said I ll be back in 5 minutes but didn t re appear In the end we approached a woman who appeared to be the manager She said I ll be 5 minutes Finally we booked a table but several other people were seated before us even though they didn t appear to have waited as long When we finally got a table the service was slow and the food was poor for the price Breakfast was equally poor food anaemic looking fruit tasteless cooked breakfast Aloft is a contemporary hotel but the food really lets the hotel down Won t eat there next time , Room was great clean quiet spacious wifi easy to use good location of Excel Reception staff really helpful 
390223,Aloft London Excel, Slight mishap when ordering dinner we were told that we couldn t get a table for 4 women told we had to wait 30 mins we went away to consider booking table or order room service came back to restaurant to see if we can book table then saw the manager had offered a table for 3 people adult men straight away we then told assistant that we can wait for table but then told the restaurant was closing in 20 mins which contradicted what the manager feeling disgruntled we were then offered room service but had to order online through an app We ordered 3 small rissotos 1 soup and bread which came to 34 50 We got 3 very large portions of rissotos and 1 soup Which we couldn t eat and they forgot the bread Next morning when we checked out they had charge over 50 for the food and they had charged for large portions Apparently a new process that still needs tweaking customer service rectified quickly with no problem just bad service from restaurant side , beds were so comfortable very accommodating as we asked for adjoining rooms made the experience much more enjoyable Lianna at customer service desk was really helpful and nice 
390224,Aloft London Excel, I ve booked a double room upon arrival I was given a twin they said that s all they have available the manager was so rude to me in the end they gave me a king room the bathroom is part of the bedroom which is really strange also there wasn t a nice view, Bed was comfy and room was clean
390225,Aloft London Excel, The chromecast in our room was faulty and could not be mended during our stay The location was good but a taxi to and from the O2 was VERY expensive and the tube was impractical during an event at the location, The Staff were very helpful 
390226,Aloft London Excel, When we came off the train a small sign saying which direction the hotel was would have been useful We arrived in the day time and luckily when we got off the train on to the bridge walkway I recognized the hotel on the right of us and I noticed that you could access the hotel from that level It may not have been so easy in the dark, From the moment we arrived we were made very welcome the hotel was lovely and the pillows were so comfy Just wish we could have stayed longer and made use of the facilities 
390227,Aloft London Excel, Door to toilet and shower was sliding which was a bit weird and the shower went all over the floor which was a bit of a pain Breakfast was very disappointing and I wish we hadn t had it Tables were full of dirty pots and when we did find a table we had to lay it ourselves I can only describe the breakfast as being luke warm although it was tasty The cut fruit wasn t in refrigerated units neither was the fruit juice so these weren t cold , Great room very comfortable bed We went for a swim and the pool was Lovely and warm warm pool The location was great as we went to see muse at the o2 and everyone else was going in the opposite direction when we came out One stop on tube and three on DLR we would definitely stay here again but would not have breakfast 
390228,Aloft London Excel, How come that hotel soooo expensive don t use a pipe cleaner A hotel who increase the price to the double the year after for the same event without granting the breakfast like ALL the previuos years and increase even more for next year passing from 400 in 2014 WITH breakfast 630 a bit more in 2015 WITH breakfast 1 270 in 2016 WITHOUT breakfast and 1 665 in 2017 WITHOUT breakfast who i ask a quote and reservation for 2017 and apart increasing the price to a senseless amount without granting neither a breafast and non considering we are customers for years YOU ARE CRAZY Where is the customer care and a brain for these senseless prices , Position
390229,Aloft London Excel, N A, Rooms spacious and clean only slept for a few hours per night so didn t take full advantage of the facilities but plenty on offer and the staff were so helpful with every request Third time staying at the Aloft and I will return 
390230,Aloft London Excel, They seem slightly short staffed especially at the shop where the person also seems to be cooking for the bar , Location is superb if you are attending an event at the Excel 
390231,Aloft London Excel, Locks on the changing rooms in the swimming area more info on the lockers and a swimming costume spinner would have been a great touch as otherwise you have to travel home with a wet costume , The bed was very big and very comfy and the lay out of the room was very elegant The swimming pool and jacuzzi was a great touch 
390232,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, King size bed was perfect great shower room loved the view of the docks Staff were very friendly and helpful Loved the pool sauna and steam room used them both days we stayed Room was cleaned whilst we were out in the day to a very high standard Hotel was very easy to access on the DLR and we enjoyed exploring the area 
390233,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, A very modern hotel very clean and the staff were extremely helpful and welcoming The breakfast was perfect after our swim in the small pool too The 24hr fast food at reception was handy and the bar staff were were very professional and friendly All in all the hotel was perfect for out trip to the Excel center right outside the entrance and I know we will be staying again 
390234,Aloft London Excel, Not being able to use the pool cos of babies swimming session Being woken at 3am by some drunk talking at the top of his voice on his phone for 30 mins even after being asked to be quiet Vomit outside the main door the next morning , Facilities and staff
390235,Aloft London Excel, Not a great deal of variety for vegetarians at the restaurant , Lovely friendly professional staff I love your Green Choice Option to reduce your environmental footprint Super idea 
390236,Aloft London Excel, If you are on an birthday treat and looking forward to a cocktale and there is a list on the bar but no ice then it does fall a little flat No wories we have a Full English breakfast except the sausages and bacon were ugghh Little things can irritate i like to squeeze my tea bag with a spoon no spoon there is a wooden stick I hope i can still get my 25 deposit i paid , Fantastic designed hotel 
390237,Aloft London Excel, We were checked in by someone who I presume was a trainee as we weren t told useful information like needing your key card for the lift and what time check out was But I m being picky , Lovely hotel and staff Good location easy to get to O2 and central London and very close to the station and city airport We upgraded for a view of the river which was lovely Pool and gym areas were very clean with basic but good facilities We ll definitely be back 
390238,Aloft London Excel, no complimentary toothpaste and slipper Rang before midnight for a toothpaste and was ask to go down at the reception to buy and pay for it For the price that you pay per night a complimentary toiletries should had been included Also one of my pillow has no adequate support on my head and neck meaning one of my pillow needs to be bin The coffee and tea tray are dusty and the toilet bin has trash inside from previous occupants This arethe only tiny flaws that i found on Aloft Staff in the receptions and restaurants are nice We ve stayed in Sheraton and W hotel before and our stay was amazing and hopefully If we stay in Aloft the next time i can also say that my stay was , Has direct access to excel and staff are helpful
390239,Aloft London Excel, The extra s in the hotel were a tad over priced even considering that the area is within London I am mainly referring to the bar and restaurant for this comment One request was made for food either as a seperate purchase or substitute as chips are supplied with burger orders but not as an individual item my partner is a fussy eater and the restaurant was only operating a buffet on this day as opposed to its normal menu with the bar offering burgers and pizza but the staff declined the request which I thought was a bit harsh considering the limited options at the time The food was then delivered in two separate sittings as opposed to being brought together which you would expect at any dining establishment , The hotel was very clean and well maintained Overall the hotel staff were very polite and accommodating to requests The hotel is situated in a very convenient location for both travel by car and public transport The swimming pool sauna and steam room definitely add to the value of the hotel 
390240,Aloft London Excel, Nothing , Everything about the hotel was excellent the staff were lovely friendly and helpful the room was perfect spotlessly clean and very comfortable Breakfast was great self service so no delay I would highly recommend this hotel 
390241,Aloft London Excel, Breakfast was a complete shambles clearly not enough staff to cope with the number of guests when we arrived almost every table whilst no longer occupied was still full of dirty breakfast plates and debris The food selection was good and once replenished the cooked breakfast was very nice but cleanliness was really terrible , The room was spacious and comfortable Reception and bar staff were friendly and polite 
390242,Aloft London Excel, Its only provide paid tv service and no free tv channel , The location is very near to excel london where i had to attend an event there very convenient the gym and swimming pool also very nice and convenient as well 
390243,Aloft London Excel, Although the hotel is a little out of the way Central London is easily accessible via transport links We had no other concerns with the hotel or its amenities, Very modern hotel with a comfortable room and excellent amenities Hotel is extremely close to transport links into Central London Very enjoyable stay and we look forward to returning again in the near future 
390244,Aloft London Excel, Menu in the restaurant could do with a little more variety and some lower cost options for those travelling on a budget or within tight business expense limits , Extremely well planned out hotel very clean and reception was good the gym and pool are ideal for over night stays less than two minutes walk from the DLR platform as the concourse is attached to it 
390245,Aloft London Excel, English wasn t the first spoken language of the reception staff thus causing confusion in them explaining their policy with regards authorising your bank card for breakables This was not explained correctly at check in by the female member if staff at 10pm when I was tired ready to get to my room but the male member of staff tried to clarify upon check out however I am still unsure as to what amount has actually been authorised from my bank card this probably meaning I won t use this hotel again due to hidden charge amounts, Spotless rooms facilities
390246,Aloft London Excel, Sadly it didnt live up to its full promise because you are pretty much reliant on the restaurant for food in the evening as there is nothing else within walking distance After a full day working on a stand at Excel when I was tired and very hungry it was quite unbelievable to be told at 7 30pm that the dining room was fully booked and they wouldnt be serving anyone else that evening There were clearly tables available and a colleague who was in the restaurant at the time told me later that nobody sat at the tables either side of them all evening If another colleague had not had a car to drive me to a supermarket about five minutes drive away I would have been unable to have any food at all that evening apart from a limited stock of sandwiches in the hotel shop Such a shame but this really was unacceptable I also think to charge people 16 per 24hrs for parking is outrageous , It is in an excellent location for Excel East London and the hotel is beautiful with excellent rooms and lovely comfy beds A few more hooks in the room would have been helpful as there is nowhere to hang your towels In spite of the fact that the airport is a mere stones throw away the sound proofing in the hotel is incredibly effective no noise whatsoever 
390247,Aloft London Excel, Location is not good but if you planned to travel via DLR line to Canary Wharf or city center then it is ok, Wonderful bed and breakfast It was full English breakfast And quiet and beautiful view 
390248,Aloft London Excel, Don t forget to use your room card to use the lift , Location could not have been better Literally next to excel Very clean and amazing views of river Thames Bed and rooms were huge for London 
390249,Aloft London Excel, I d have liked a teaspoon in the room rather than a wooden stick stirrer , My standard bedroom was superb beautifully designed with the highest quality materials and equipment 
390250,Aloft London Excel, Little to gripe about except There was plenty of tea and coffee in room but only 3 tiny milk pods so not enough for 2 at night 2 the next morning I expect they would have provided more if we had asked so it s a very minor thing , Close to everything lovely staff clean and comfy room great shower If we had stayed for longer the gym and swimming pool looked amazing Good to have safe provided plus hairdryer and iron in room at such a good price 
390251,Aloft London Excel, Parking at 16 00 although private was more expensive than parking in the Excel Centre itself Given use of the Hotel bed only no breakfast the parking could have been complimentary or reduced , The closest facility to the Excel Centre

390259,Aloft London Excel, I specifically requested for a Riverview or Waterview over a month ahead of the Booking and when I got there I was booked into Suite 726 which has 10 Waterview I basically had to peep with my head slanted to see the river Very sad and when I complained about it I was told all the ones with the better Riverviews are gone those nights I really didn t like it Also for telephone reception it was the poorest room to be in My Phone was on but Dead No reception , I like the Room Suite Physical settings and furnishings Very clean and lovely

390267,Aloft London Excel, A sign at the DLR station to show how to get to the hotel would be useful , Beautiful modern design the hotel has considered what travellers need and supplied it for example a 24 hour mini cafe ample electrical points good desk and shelf space comfy bar very close proximity to public transport DLR buses taxis and City Airport was a few minutes on the 473 bus 
390268,Aloft London Excel, Location was very hard to find has the sat nav kept taking us to a diffrent car park so we had to call a friend who was already there and ask for directions they also had the same problem other than this our stay was brilliant, The hotel was really nice staff were pleasant and welcoming the room and facilities all clean we would defo recommend to others and will return real soon

390279,Aloft London Excel, Didn t have the best reception in my opinion Staff barely looked up from the desk when I stood at the counter awkwardly waiting Barely said hello and only said welcome after checking in Also the slider door for the toilet was very stiff and hard to open , The room was very smart boasting a queen size bed which was very comfortable ATM on site which was very convenient and was only a 15 minutes walk from the Emirates sky cable which took us straight to the O2 arena 
390280,Aloft London Excel, Not the Hotel s fault but unless you re going to the ExCel or London City Airport there s not a lot more around the area Having said that the DLR Transportation System is right outside the door so everything is accessible by public transport , The hotel was excellent and really well maintained The staff were really helpful and very attentive We asked for a change of room and received it straight away without fuss very handily located for London City Airport 
390281,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, The Grab n Go bar was very convenient for a late night snack We also enjoyed being able to use the gym sauna and pool whilst we were there The staff are always friendly and helpful and we found the hotel to be very clean We would stay here again 
390282,Aloft London Excel, The amount of time we waitied for food in the Restaurant on new years eve the Restaurant was not busy and it took them over 45 minutes to get an icecream together for my daughter,No Positive

390286,Aloft London Excel, 40 minute trip on average to London centre Sofa in suite was very uncomfortable to relax and watch TV , Perfect location for Excel centre and DLR Booked a suite which was very roomy 
390287,Aloft London Excel, Location was a little far out of where we needed to be but reflected in price and was still in a great location , Modern comfortable rooms amazing swimming pool and good restaurant with polite and helpful staff 
390288,Aloft London Excel, The only thing we would say is that check out should be 12 and not 11 the hotel is lovely and the faculties are also very enjoyable but if we was allowed that extra hour we would of been able to do more at the hotel , Me and my partner enjoyed our stay at the hotel we wasn t able to play a game of pool like we hoped to as the people playing hogged the table all night Drinks are very expensive there as well but we had a lovely stay 
390289,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, We have stayed in the hotel for only 1 night because we had an early flight from London City airport With the taxi it was only 5 minutes to the airport Hotel is very modern bed was really good and the shower as well If you visit London for leisure purposes it is not the best location although the train will bring you quite fast to the city center but it is not a vibrant area Staff is great very nice and pro active I like the atmosphere and I believe it is much better when staff is dressed like in this hotel informal but still representative 
390290,Aloft London Excel, Toilet separated from room with a sliding door Meant you could hear everything any one was doing in the toilet so no privacy Also the shower made of glass you could only access by walking through the toilet Not nice if sharing room with anyone who isn t partner Also wanted double bed and got twin beds Thought I d have a view of river but got room without view that overlooked a car park , Room was clean Complementary coffee and tea with take away cups were useful Hotel magazine was good Modern decor 
390291,Aloft London Excel, Dull and dingy room could do with more lighting or brighter bulbs In these days of low energy light bulbs why do hotels continue to insist that their rooms are so dark , Helpful friendly staff comfortable bed very close to DLR and Excel 
390292,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, It s a lovely modern hotel My room was very comfortable with a lovely walk in shower Lovely restaurant although I only had time for breakfast there this time Would definitely stay there again 
390293,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, Staff on front desk very professional and friendly Green hotel with option to skip room clean and option to contribute to unicef Swimming pool fantastic So close to conference centre colour scheme restaurant
390294,Aloft London Excel, Similar rooms with huge variability in price a bit overpriced really probably due to location Bar staff quite rude like customers were an inconvenience Some people in the bar had stupidly helped themselves to some dregs in the beer pipe at closing staff came rushing through saying there was bleach in the beer line they were going to get sick Not the best way to handle a few drunk people Some things in need of refreshing disabled door or excel level not working the turnstile door had the brush trim dangling on the floor Rest of hotel beautiful but not the entrance , Staff I met very friendly helpful with check in Excellent location for conference at the Excel Generally clean 
390295,Aloft London Excel, There was not anything that displeased us with our short stay , Polite informative and friendly staff Good size room was clean and had all facilities Comfy bed ensured good nights sleep DLR station almost on the doorstep made for very easy access into central London 
390296,Aloft London Excel, awful location utterly desolate and soulless felt like a pampered prisoner and just like at motorway services or on the train plane the only consumables all vastly over priced and bland Such is life these days I guess , clean big room free water nice coffee
390297,Aloft London Excel, The view despite being on the 6th floor was disappointing The location was remote, The colourful decor of the hotel lobby and bar the sound insulation and warmth on a galey day The contemporary feel and finish in the rooms 
390298,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, the staff are friendly the room is spacious and clean perfect if you have anything to do at the excel center although the location is a bit far from central london but the dlr is a 1 min walk which is fine 
390299,Aloft London Excel, great location especially for conferences etc and close to London City Airport but quite a long way from central London, staff very helpful very warm welcoming lounge bar areas
390300,Aloft London Excel, Nothing bad but the air con did not work that great and even when you put in on 18 it would take a day just to get it down to 21 , The way the staff helped and nothing was a problem The man at reception with a beard was amazing and I felt he did more than expected and would like to thank him 
390301,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, This hotel is simply amazing It offers everything you need the staff is very kind and helpful the room is absolutely fantastic and also the pool with sauna

390303,Aloft London Excel, I felt the food was somewhat overpriced especially for the portion size but maybe this is just indicative of London Can not complain at all however about the quality or taste of the food which was delicious , Lovely hotel Great decor Lovely rooms and helpful friendly staff 
390304,Aloft London Excel, Had no dislikes , Location for excel Comfort 24hr food bar Left to our own devices but staff on hand if we needed them P leasent quiet atmosphere Good nearby transport services 
390305,Aloft London Excel, Checking in was very slow After a long day it would have been nice to check in and get to bed but I waited about half an hour to check in , Room was nice and comfy Breakfast was also nice

390307,Aloft London Excel, 5 star hotel part of the SPG group infers W brand yet you have to collect your own food lite edition of the brand you are paying for the convenience to the Excel Centre No toothbrushes on sale across 2 nights stay don t forget yours , Location extremely good for the Excel Centre Decent fast hair dryer Digital equipment good But lets not suggest the Excel Centre itself is an easy location for anyone who lives to the west of London bring back venues like Earls Court 
390308,Aloft London Excel, Staff on arrival a little brusque Professional rather than friendly Price of food in snack bar was astronomical No soya milk in snack bar No bath in rooms , Superb location near to Prince Regent DLR Lovely pool Lots of nice extras in the rooms 
390309,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, Aloft is my home from home in London Staff are great location suits me really well and its very clean can be very busy and the restaurant is pricey with little options around But they do well with the mini bar downstairs with a microwave and sandwiches I have stayed in this hotel 6 times and its always my first pick

390318,Aloft London Excel, Not much I don t like really just don t think it should be priced above 130 especially as there is no breakfast included , Love the Aloft Location and excellent staff Also love the splash pool and sauna and steam area Short length allows me do reasonable laps before bed 
390319,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, I liked everything about the hotel the strategic location the amenities the staff the cleanliness the modernness the breakfast need I go on I was attending an exhibition at Excel London and I was on the second floor so all I needed to do was walk to my exhibition hall It s also very close to the prince regent DLR station for evenings when I felt like going out I especially liked the personal message on the tv in my room welcoming me to the hotel I will definitely stay here again and again 
390320,Aloft London Excel, Bathroom was a bit simple for this price range No minibar no room service and no food outside regular hours An hour by tube Uber from the nice places in the center of town and nothing to do in the vicinity , Friendly staff very helpful with everything Location is great if you re going to the Excel Great beds Nice restaurant when open Great staff Did I mention the staff

390323,Aloft London Excel, Tried to obtain more tea bags from food stall in reception Was told that I had to purchase them Reported this to reception and was told that they were free Embarrassing to witness a confrontation between food stall attendant and reception staff , The convenience for the LDR 
390324,Aloft London Excel, We were asked to transfer hotel said it was just block off incase we use any service 25 pound for each of our nights 4 there that was nearly 150 euros it was taken out of our account straight away money we could not use for our holiday and something we had not planed on it took 4 days after we left for it to come back into our account and you are not warned about this before hand which I believe the hotel should have made us aware of this cost before we arrived, Everything I found the staff real helpful and very nice we were there for 5 days and lost internet on our second day and the hotel had no issue with moving us so we could get better Internet
390325,Aloft London Excel, Although it s a bit far from London center there s a train station in front of the hotel In 20m we can reach the center , Everything New modern quiet spotless clean confort wide room Excellent staff service and Wi Fi

390330,Aloft London Excel, Restaurant service was strange My daughter wanted Sphagetti from the menu but was declined as she is above 14, Clean and quiet business hotel with big rooms Efficient check in out Nearness to London City Airport and DLR into the city
390331,Aloft London Excel, Parking is exaggerated at 16 per day ramada hotel nearby is free Also the ambiance can be a bit like a lounge bar feel with dramatic lighting which older guests might not appreciate Windows not too large and do not open Room service did not refresh our linen which had obvious raspberry stains Breakfast could be included given the price Ramada hotel has exceptional breakfast for half of the price, Nice modern rooms very clean with good facilities in room water coffees tea and fridge Didn t use the gym or swim but nice to know you can use if you need

390334,Aloft London Excel,No Negative, The staff at this hotel excels any that we have met in other hotels Staff at Aloft have fantastic customer service skills that go beyond the extra mile This is our second time we have booked this hotel The staff are more than happy to meet your requests at any time during your stay This what hospitality is about providing a excellent service Aloft exceeds this service All other chains should take note of this hotel The hotel was pristine in all departments We were a party of eight four adults four children and the facilities including the pool were highly appreciated The Restaurant and shop were very good value and the range of food excellent The car parking to the Docklands Railway a few mins walk from hotel was so convenient The location of the hotel next to London Excel and overlooks the River Thames Overall our short stay was thoroughly enjoyed and have already planned our next stay Thank you to all the staff at Aloft London
390335,Aloft London Excel, WiFi is extremely slow when it works to load one page it takes soemtimes 20 minutes Sorry this is the worst WiFi experience in a while Location far away from Center Fitness is not as good as in other Aloft Hotels , Bed is comfy big TV Free Coffee and Tea in Room 
390336,Aloft London Excel, Unfortunately the wifi didn t work in our rooms at all times , A really nice hotel with great interior huge rooms and friendly staff The beds are super comfortable and the shower is great The subway to the Tower bridge closest sight in the inner city takes about 20mins from there you can get further into the city do some sights can take 45mins to reach We still found the quality of the hotel worth the extra journey We didn t book the breakfast option but had something from the grab n go every morning They offer sandwiches fresh fruit cereals and more We found it absolutely good value for money we paid about 10 for two people if you don t need a full english breakfast We would definitely stay here again 
390337,Aloft London Excel, Bed was too firm for my taste but fine if you like that kind of bed wifi was ok when it got going but had some hiccups every now and then Beds felt a little Short I m only 6 ft and felt small to me Only real issue I had was with the take to room burger the burger was amazing but at 15 pounds if expect more than a great burger with some soggy wedges on the side, Vote was clean staff friendly and perfectly located for the excell centre
390338,Aloft London Excel, Reception was a little awkward to find We expected to walk in a door to reception straight behind the big Aloft sign That was the only negative, The location was a little out of the way but having the DLR nearby is a bonus For us the proximity to the London City Airport was the main reason for us staying there 
390339,Aloft London Excel, The price Not sure if this is what their chain is like or the fact that it s London though not even central London , I like everything about the feel of this hotel would enjoy staying here again
390340,Aloft London Excel, A little bit out of the way although this isn t a major problem , Fantastic modern hotel rooms are perfect and very comfortable The hotel is easily reached by the Tube DLR 
390341,Aloft London Excel, The gym equipment is very minimal which restricts and true workout The wi fi is very hit and miss and is far from high speed , Location is convenient for Canary Wharf as its a short trip on the DLR Restaurant food is good standard 
390342,Aloft London Excel, The fact that the toilet and shower were in what felt like a cupboard Room service facilities would have been nice The breakfast on offer at the restaurant was too expensive and I thought the choice at refuel was too limited , The room had all the standard amenities The hotel itself is very modern and nicely furnished The bed was wonderfully comfortable and the shower was amazing 
390343,Aloft London Excel, I asked for a cab number and the hotel offered to book a cab for me but they booked a cab that cost a third more than it cost for me to get to the excel and they didn t tell me in fact they gave the impression they had nothing to do with the car company This ruined my impression of Aloft and left me with a negative impression , The things I liked are encapsulated in the above review I was busy all day and evening and would have liked to use the gym facilities
390344,Aloft London Excel, Nothing , Hotel is just great modern comfortable with very nice pool and steam sauna For those who went to go to central London the Prince Regent DLR Station right next to the hotel will take about 30 minutes
