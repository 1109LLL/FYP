122606,Mandarin Oriental Paris, Breakfast was quite expensive but delicious, Amazing hotel great location room size was immensely spacious especially for Paris Staff were very friendly and attentive Would highly recommend 
122607,Mandarin Oriental Paris, Concierges not particularly helpful especially the guy who we asked to call Allard and tell them we were running late and when we got to the restaurant we were told he had cancelled it I figure this was a miscommunication Or your bar waiter who got my drink order wrong and blamed it on me my friends laughed as I had explained it quite well and didn t apologize Literally told me that s why I asked you and blamed it on me Frankly relative to the other top hotels in Paris the bar is rather unimpressive , Room nice Well located for shopping if that s your thing 
122608,Mandarin Oriental Paris, Bathroom is non light tight soundproof its set up as an open door split bathroom in entrance hallway of the room is annoying and leads to loss of space and movement fluency too many sharp corners and angles in room knobs of drawers closets shower wash sinks glass sliding doors non centered sinks and mirrors in bathroom too many colors and materials used in decoration Lack of food offers for vegans , Great staff attentionate and responsive Great spa Very nice breakfast display 
122609,Mandarin Oriental Paris, It is hard to complain Mandarin Oriental in Paris is very expensive but the outstanding hotel above all on account of the staff but it is necessary to stay into Mandarin Oriental in the Hong Kong in order to feel the difference between the outstanding but luxury hotel I have only one attention in the corridor near 325 room to smell cigarettes what very much is disturbing , Staff is wonderful professional helpful and polite breakfest is expensive even on 5 hotel but the best in Paris in my opinion
