510808,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Nothing with the hotel actually There was some huge construction going on next to the train station so the nearby street and area was not so impressive during my stay But in the future I guess this area will become more centralized and lively , Close to the train station and underground station The staff was very helpful and friendly We were leaving on Sunday and wanted to buy something from supermarket The staff gave us some good advice on where we could find an opened supermarket when most of the shops closed on that day Excellent value for a very nice room 
510809,Hotel Prinz Eugen, No extra facilities in the hotel just a breakfast place and that was it , An old facade hides a modern hotel with nice staff The location next to the Main Station is a plus too 
510810,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, The hotel is very close to the station which is very convenient if you have to travel by train Also it is close to a metro station with fast connection to the city center The personnel in the hotel is very kind They try to help you with any need and provide a lot of touristic information I found the ratio quality price excellent for a hotel in Vienna 
510811,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Shower had no door and the bathroom flooded when showering Poor quality TV Double bed had two single quilts instead of one large one Lousy pillows , Good breakfast and close to the main international train station 
510812,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Some issues with house keeping and when they would come to room but a talk with front desk cleared it up quickly and smoothly, There are many hotel choices near the Vienna Main Train Station now For the best access to the city transportation the Hotel Prinz Eugen is still the best bet I was there early July heat wave and I was comfortable in the hotel and in my room The breakfast buffet is very good the staff are quick to keep the food trays full and the coffee is excellent I also liked having a bar for a wind down drink at the end of the day 
510813,Hotel Prinz Eugen, It was a bit of a way out of Vienna and next to a derelict piece of land which made it look scruffy Staff were very helpful though in getting us around Great restaurant around the corner Sperl Restaurant , breakfast was great a good selection Close by to the tram stops and train station to get to Vienna
510814,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Customer Service and contact by two staff members who were rude Only one out of 3 staff we dealt with at the front counter was pleasant lady with the bob haircut was fabulous The breakfast staff were amazing though on both days We were upgraded to a suite the first night and this room was fine The air con worked well and the bed was comfortable The second night we got transferred to a standard room which was like a box Very jammed with poor aircon We had a shocking nights sleep on very uncomfortable beds 2 singles pushed together to make a double bed In the end we opened up the window lay the duvet below us for comfort as this was better than the noisy hot and cold experience we were getting The Staff member wasn t very helpful at midnight regarding the air con So overall it was a shame to have this negative experience in such a beautiful city We would not stay at this hotel again Simple things like consistent manners air con that worked properly good towels and a softer mattress would have made this the perfect place to stay Interestingly enough the hotel seemed to have put better mattresses air con in the suite we had on the first night We ve stayed all over the World and feel this hotel could do better , It was quiet and near the train station 
510815,Hotel Prinz Eugen, the old TV but it was not really important , The staff was very friendly the hotel was quite close to the Central railway station that was very important for our short trip from Budapest to Vienna 
510816,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The free wifi I couldn t make it work nor could the front desk I later had the same difficulty at the train station and on the train Eventually I learned how to trick it into working I have been to five other countries on this trip and the wifi worked perfectly everywhere WHAT IS WRONG WITH AUSTRIA The breakfast was adequate but the dishes were cleverly engineered to restrict the amount of breakfast one could eat , The location I literally walked to the train station even with luggage 
510817,Hotel Prinz Eugen, During the windy night the doors of the room were knocking and making quite loud sound room 716 , Very nice and comfort room tasty breakfast nice people
510818,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Can t think of anything , Close to Vienna main railway station and underground Had a good sized room at the back of the hotel I thought it could be noisy being on a main road but I never heard a sound the bed was comfortable and clean Breakfast was buffet style and included boiled and scrambled eggs bacon and sausage as well as the usual continental choices There is a small bar with some outdoor seating but no restaurant 
510819,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The hotels appearance from the outside looked like something from bay roots it was very dated and nothing like the picture the tv looked like something from the 70 s, The hotel breakfast was tasty and the beds were confortable
510820,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Very minor quibbles a no kettle b old fashioned tv, Great value for money It worked out at 36 per person sharing and this included breakfast Others have criticised the wifi but it was fine for us Very near the central train station belvedere castle and numerous transport links Place was spotless
510821,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Absolutely appalling that when the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night I saw NO staff and absolutely appalling that the next morning there wasn t even a board saying what had caused the alarm and apologising A complimentary breakfast or something It would put me off coming again especially as in the morning all fire doors were jammed open probably illegally I haven t had the energy to complain but I was staying in a hotel rather than a train to get a good nights sleep NO staff visible in any way in the middle of the night , Felt safe walking from station at 11 pm at night A bit of a surprise and indeed I travelled with friends so I didn t have to do that walk as a single woman on my own If necessary I would now do that transition on my own
510822,Hotel Prinz Eugen, As above i would have liked a better selection for breakfast, The staff were very helpful and the hotel was spotless Breakfast was disappointing no croissants It was very close to Belvidere Palace which was great but not too many restaurants nearby No restaurant or proper bar
510823,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Nothing, I really like the location of this hotel as it is very near to the central station I stayed in the upper floor and witness the beautiful skyline of Vienna The place was cozy and the price is absolutely good with bountiful buffet breakfast 
510824,Hotel Prinz Eugen, A little out of the old town , Very pleased with the hotel terrific spacious room antique furnished clean modern bathroom Great breakfast room and breakfast Staff at desk were extremely helpful Great location to the railway station 
510825,Hotel Prinz Eugen, No kitchen facilities at all , My room is next to the street To my surprise it is very quiet at night The bed is comfortable and breakfast is very good 
510826,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Nothing that comes to my mind , The location was great Breakfast was rich and fresh They upgraded our room free of charge Everything was exceptionally clean and comfortable Great stay 
510827,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Old tv Need more chairs in the room , The breakfast is great Location is good you can walk to from the main station Staff are friendly Our room is big with a balcony Nice place to stay 
510828,Hotel Prinz Eugen, No ashtray in the balcony Old TV , Right next to the train station Easy to get to from Erdberg bus station using U3 metro and then U1 from Stephansplaz the heart of the old city It s a noisy boulevard but windows mute the sound perfectly Breakfast good and there s a little backyard Very close to Belvedere Palace 
510829,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Check out time is too early should be more flexible with that and no kettle to make tea coffe in the room , The room was clean and cosey the stuff were friendly but there would be kettle and tea coffe in the room and the check out time should be the same time as check in time 
510830,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Old fashion style but it was not a problem for us, Location is perfect Close walk distance to the main train station Belvedere palace and KarlPlatz City center is reachable by public transport Breakfast is quite good and it was included in the room price
510831,Hotel Prinz Eugen, WHY to they have to impose pop music in the breakfast room Why can we not eat quietly or engage in quiet conversation without the suffocating background drivel of piped music I think I liked the food well enough but the muzak ruined it for me so I left half way through , the room was really excellent and so were the staff
510832,Hotel Prinz Eugen, It was a cheap motel with old cheap furniture but my fault best deal for a last minute reservation My sister and I said it looked like a working girls hotel , The receptionist was very informative and friendly Close to central station 
510833,Hotel Prinz Eugen, On the Saturday night we were looking forward to a drink in the bar after a day of sightseeing and the bar was shut early No bars nearby or mini bars in room so that was a bit disappointing , Near train station and tram underground stops so very good base for exploring Very clean and comfortable good showers and buffet breakfast was fine Found some gluten free bread for one of us Nice staff serving breakfast and the cleaner was lovely too 
510834,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The hotel is right next to a busy street Even though they had double windows I could hear the street noise all night The bed was very hard , Breakfast was nice just enough to choose from Hotel was clean 
510835,Hotel Prinz Eugen, It must also be said that if you want to stay close to Die Innere Stadt near the cathedral of St Stephan it is not a short walking distance to those areas However why bother when the U Bahn tickets do not cost a fortune a day card ticket might cost you approx 6 Eur and it brings you to the very center of the city within 15 minutes after a 7 min walk form the hotel entrance , Very accommodating and nice service at the reception comfortable and nice room and beds nice interior in the style we sought older viennese style but not baroque good and sufficient breakfast excellent position regarding public communication 5 minutes walk to the Main railway station in Vienna with railway bus tram taxi and U Bahn Tube connections to all parts of Vienna and railway and bus connections to other parts of Austria and abroad It is a short walking distance from the lovely castle and gardens of Belvedere and further into the city from there However the first impression of the hotel when arriving from the station was rather chocking The whole area around this main railway station is an enormous development area with building of new huge public and private buildings all over the place including the development of a new neighbouring building very close to the hotel But forget this When you have arrived into the lobby all is forgotten A stay at this hotel is a very good advice for a very good stay in the lovely Vienna 
510836,Hotel Prinz Eugen, need notes in the room to explain how the heat cooling works , breakfast buffet was substantial good connections to the local transit bus streetcar commuter train convenient 5 min walk to the main train station cozy bar area for a late night nightcap
510837,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The decor is dated however room size was bigger than some suites that I have stayed in , The room size was enormous and the location very close to the train station which was the primary reason we booked this hotel 
510838,Hotel Prinz Eugen, there was a smell of closed in the room and we had to keep the windows open a lot to get rid of it quite expensive for the conditions offered did not feel like a 4 stars hotel, the location of the hotel is ok close to subway stations the room was clean the ladies from the reception very nice breakfast was fair
510839,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Evening receptionist was horrible The morning staff was however co operative and made up for the pathetic service which we received earlier She was not at all co operative Room is so out dated Definitely wont come back to this hotel nor I would recommend this hotel It is barely 2 hotel I dont know how it is rated as 4 Breakfast is pathetic Travellers with kids please avoid this hotel as the rooms are very small and not at all good Booking com please look into the rating of this hotel IT IS NOT 4 as mentioned on your site , Only the location is near the train station That s the only good point 
510840,Hotel Prinz Eugen, No kettle in the room, Holger was amazing Great customer service We got there late and was hungry He arranged some hot water for our noodles and also a travel plug as our one broken He also printed off all the train times for our trip to Linz the following day Great service and a credit to the hotel It s staff like him that make you want to return
510841,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, Bed and pillows very good room a good size and very quiet easy to get to from airport take the normal train to the main train station hotel opposite side of main road D tram near hotel takes you into centre in about 5 minutes
510842,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Small bathroom you can not sit normally on the toilet maybe a problem for bigger people , Close to the train station Luxurious look and nice interiour although the oustide looks very old Broad selection at the breakfast Ideal for starting a city trip The city center can be reached via metro within a short time 
510843,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Watch out for all the touts and new immigrants trying to help you You don t need their help Don t be polite Be blunt and rude Not a safe area late at night Even the locals I was with are changing their behaviour because of the general lack of security All the flower sellers trying to force you to buy their ugly decrepit roses Where are the police to stop this , An easy walk across the square from the Central Station 
510844,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Across the street the City fathers have decided to replace historic Vienna with blocks of glass and steel NY Style high rise buildings and the ugliest train station in Europe This are all under construction while no fault of the hotel an old world view would have left me without negative comments , Location for train travelers could not be better cross the street and here you are The staff are very helpful planning your day and the hotel while not a luxury hotel is pleasntly decorated in keeping with Vienese tradition If you don t like old you shouldn t be in Vienna in the first place The price is a bargin in an expensive world I paid less than 70 a night with a huge breakfast 
510845,Hotel Prinz Eugen, There was no customer computer in the lobby Needed to check in to return flight and print out the boarding pass was advised to do that on mobile but not all people manage to do it on mobile There is no coffee tea making facilities in the room If you travel only with Vienna Pass during your visit you cannot reach the hotel late in the evening as there is no late hop on hop off bus service after 6 30 pm You would need to book hotel nearer the center or you need to pay additional for trams taxis etc , Rooms were rather small but clean Central train station nearby 
510846,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Maybe the view of the balcony was a little annoying for some persons because it s an area of constructions For us it was ok we didn t hear big noise or smell dust We was at the 5 th floor nice perspective from there , I liked that we received some informations about the city in the paper guide from the reception staff That was easy for us to find the best attarctions faster It was a peacefull place good beakfast polite staff It was really close to the Belvedere Palace like 5 min on foot Clasic hotel but with modern devices I would certainly come back in other ocasion 
510847,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The location is a bit far from the city center You can take the metro which is somewhat near Breakfast was nothing special , I don t know if it is really a four star hotel because having CRT TVs from 90s doesn t leave a good first impression 
510848,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Without apparent cons Well except an absence of parking, Interior staff good breakfast pretty room location in terms of transport and supermarkets 
510849,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Everything The rooms were probable decorated when prince Eugen was alive Uncomfortable beds lack of and poor quality bed linen duvets and pillows smelly rooms tobacco smoke stain marks on a lot of items television not working properly 1960 70s not very helpful or courteous staff etc Very poor quality hotel It seems the management are not likely to improve it either Would not not rate it 2 star a poor one at that long way from the city centre, Absolutely nothing For similar price you can get better hotels near the city
510850,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The late cleaning of my room after 2 pm every day was a little annoying Strong outdated TV in the room not flat screen TV but it was of no importance to me I m not on holiday to watch television , Very good location with regard to public transport U Bahn S line and tram lines within comfortable walking distance The little boring view from my room was of no importance to me I m not on vacation to look out of my hotel window 
510851,Hotel Prinz Eugen, No tea and coffee making facilities TV was very old but worked adequately although not all channels listed were available, Good location near the Belvedere Palace and easy journey from the airport
510852,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The hotel seems old and not in a good way but outdated I find it really hard to think of things that may have changed there during the past 20 years apart from the WiFi One example to prove my point which is almost funny the TVs are not only ancient but they are also black white I almost thought this is on purpose to create some vintage feel but that s not the case better no TV than having a super cheap 90s black white TV on the desk How much could it cost to upgrade this Now I don t care about TV in general and especially not on holiday but I m just saying The hotel facade could do with a bit of refurbishment as the balconies are rusty and you don t want your 4 hotel to look like a 2 hotel at most On the inside I would give it 3 because it looks nice and it is really clean but certainly not 4 The breakfast is good and there is choice but it s otherwise pretty basic Also at 4 I d expect my bed to be a double bed not a combination of 2 single beds I think an old look would do really well especially in a hotel in Vienna but that doesn t mean nothing should ever be changed Some things need to brought into the 21st century , The staff is very nice and polite The rooms are clean towels linen get changed everyday Location is good very close to train subway station and thus within easy reach of the airport 5min walk to Belvedere Palace 30min walk to city centre which is good Good value for money given that Vienna is quite an expensive city 
510853,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Reception had to ring for the barman even though there were four others in the bar Limited amount of drinks available and at extortionate prices , Close to the railway station and the Belverdere 
510854,Hotel Prinz Eugen, A bit worn down but nothing deal breaking , Perfect and central location Very clean Nice staff Good Wifi Good sound isolation Good breakfast 
510855,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The breakfast was not poor but could offer a better variety We had two single blankets that really seemed small for us This was actually the only thing that we didn t like , We got a room in the eighth floor It was spacious with lots of natural sunlight The bathroom was also large and clean It seemed like the clock had stopped somewhere in early 90s since everything was old but very well preserved e g old fashioned CRT TV sofa etc The room also got a balcony which we liked but could not appreciate much due to the cold The rest of the hotel looked even older It must be the same since the sixties and seemed like a joke when we first got inside but to say the truth this gave it a unique style which we liked The location was very close to the main central station hauptbahnhof wien so it was really easy to get there from the airport using the train The train station offered connection to the metro so you can get anywhere in the city 
510856,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The room was very hot , Comfortable hotel fairly modern but with features of a traditional style Sizable and tasty breakfast Excellent access to the Belvedere palaces and gardens very close to the Hauptbahnhof and U Bahn and a nice stroll to the city centre 
510857,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Wi fi has a habit of dropping out and not the best Breakfast is basic it s not bad but one suspects they could do better , Great location within walking distance from the Hauptbahnhof and close to many of Vienna s main sights Nice rooms in the old central European style and well equipped 
510858,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Location feels industrial as it is near a main road and the railway station views are not picturesque But it is a functional location , Great location for the main railway station Wien Hauptbahnhof Clean comfortable room but not luxurious Good value for money at 45 with breakfast Friendly easy check in and check out 
510859,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, possibility of very early check in thank you so much friendly and helpful staff hotel interiors beautiful lobby close to metro station and Belvedere walking distance to downtown view from the room
510860,Hotel Prinz Eugen, There s absolutely nothing I didn t like , The location is ideal if you need to travel from Hauptbahnhof and you have a direct underground into the centre of town The staff was really friendly and helpful Even though I booked a standard single they gave me a double room 
510861,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Although we hung the DO NOT DISTURB card the room was still made up and we regarded it as a violence of privacy more than a considerate behavior The room had a door connecting to the next door room while you could hear the conversation of your neighbor clearly and sometimes it was pretty noisy , Good location just near the main train station and the Schloss Belvedere Fast check in and check out The breakfast was good and served from 6 30 which was convenient for travelers but the coffee was not so good as other dishes 
510862,Hotel Prinz Eugen, As is common throughout Austria and Germany the TV sets in the rooms are prehistoric and fairly small with not very good reception Only BBC news 24 and NBC were the only 2 English chanbels, Breakfast excellent Wide choice and plentiful Both hot and cold options available Location excellent directly opposite Wien hbf and tram lines Of and 18 run in front of the hotel Tram line D is also very close and the U bahn can be reached by foot in under 5 mins Rooms at the rear of the hotel are extremely quiet and an internal doors separates the bathroom and lobby from the bedroom giving extra soundproofing Other reviewers have moaned about the carpets but they looked perfectly clean and acceptable to me Radiators in the winter emitted a good amount of heat Bathrooms appear to have been recently updated and we re perfectly clean We were given an option to pay either on arrival or at departure Whilst check in is not before 14 00 we arrived earlier and happily the rooms were ready for us by 11am
510863,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Building works across the road directly opposite and building works next door to us and directly below , Everything was brilliant and I m one fussy person 
510864,Hotel Prinz Eugen, It s more 3 standard , It s near the railway station Hotel needs updating the bathroom is modern and functional The breakfast was just OK for 4 hotel TV in the room was quite old bed comfortable and it gave a good night s sleep 
510865,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Room very small breakfast very basic definitely not for a 4 hotel , Easy to find the hotel Loca iune very good near the main railstation Very clean Nice staff Excellent for a 3 
510866,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, The staff were friendly and helpful and the reception staff had a good sense of humour Perfect location across the road from the railway station Breakfast each day was really good With our genius access we were able to stay in our room until 5pm as our train was leaving at 9pm The room was comfortable Would definitely recommend this hotel 
510867,Hotel Prinz Eugen, No restaurant in the hotel but some choice nearby for dinner and no kettle for a cuppa , Good location to the Wein Hauptbahnhof about half a kilometer but a bit distant with skis and luggage 
510868,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Damaged furniture old and dirty carpet walls unable to regulate temperature unable to switch ventilation on toalet calling the hotel elegant is over exagerrated 4 stars are mistake breakfast is Tesco brand food unpacted and put on the offer Pricelist price of the hotel 220 EUR per doublebed room is a bad joke , Friendly staff
510869,Hotel Prinz Eugen, During our stay we had no negative points , The hotel s location was great 2 min walk to the underground and across the road from the main railway station It was about a twenty min walk into the City Centre All the staff were very pleasant and helpful The rooms were very clean and the breakfast was enough to start the day on 
510870,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Nothing , Hotel Prinz Eugen is located just a few steps diagonally across the road from Vienna s new Hauptbahnhof The interior lobby dining hall and room exhibits traditional Viennese charm which is surprisingly not evident from the outside My room was cosy and had an air conditioning unit to regulate the winter temperature It also came with its own balcony The bed was soft and comfortable with suitable bedding The refrigerator and room safe were great additions Breakfast was a simple and nutritious affair Staff overall were superb Though taking a tram or the subway would be the transport choice for most visitors to the city centre the 25 minute walk allows you to admire the sights and enjoy an unhurried break Well priced and with lovely hospitality Prinz Eugen is a definite pick for any future breaks here 
510871,Hotel Prinz Eugen, No kettle in room We asked for a 3 single bed triple room but our third bed turned out to be a sofa bed instead of a proper bed The bathtub drain stopper stuck in closed position on the last night of our stay we were unable to get it out so we had to ask to shower in another vacant room , The little bar at the lobby Convenient location close to the u bahn and train stations 
510872,Hotel Prinz Eugen, It could be a bit cleaner While the bathroom was cleaned daily with new towels etc the bedroom was never cleaned off dust Eventually i had to wipe it off with a damp cloth The TV is old Poor wifi signal The refrigerator was empty The decoration, Near the main train station and the metro station Nice breakfast Warm quiet rooms Friendly personnel
510873,Hotel Prinz Eugen, All fine thank you , Safe and clean close to the station from where we left to go to Budapest Breakfast was great Access to wifi excellent Able to walk or take tram to the city centre Close to Belvedere Palace Staff were friendly and made the stay seamless 
510874,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The room was quite basic No hot drink making facilities but there is a hotel bar The main downside was the size of the duvets We were in a double room which had two single beds pushed together and two single duvets They just aren t big enough to wrap around you and get warm and cosy We had to ask for an extra , Hotel is in a great location just a couple minutes walk to the station There was a lovely restaurant just across the road where we ate both nights Breakfast was really good lots of choice and very tasty 
510875,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Hey the lobby and bar are a bit dated but all makes the place a bit different , Great service from this lovely none chain hotel nice Breakfast cozy room 
510876,Hotel Prinz Eugen, There is no kettle in the room I would like to drink something hot but the staff call me that I can t drink in the hall that I must go on my room I didn t like it , Good breakfast Room was clean 
510877,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Room interieur was a bit dated very old TV old armchair with a stain , Excellent breakfast while not located directly in the city centre the main sights are easily accessible by public transportation even though the hotel was at a rather busy road we did not hear any noise from the traffic 
510878,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The hotel is clean and well kept however the decor is in need of an update, The staff were very helpfull and friendly The beds were very comfy Had a great sleep every night The breakfast buffet is very good with lots to choose from The hotel is not in the city centre however the transport links to all areas of Vienna are on the hotels doorstep and easy to use 
510879,Hotel Prinz Eugen, it was windy that night so the windows were not good enough to sound proof the wind, near to main station room was nice cozy and i was placed on the 8 th floor so get pretty nice view of the city fast and stable internet
510880,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, At this hotel the staff was very efficient and cordial My room was very good and comfortable The breakfast included with my room was excellent This hotel is very close to U Bahn S Bahn and OBB Stations as well as the wonderful Belvedere complex 
510881,Hotel Prinz Eugen, bar could have opened a bit earlier, very friendly helpful staff great breakfasts excellent location with great tram links to centre excellant value for money
510882,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Air con were not switched on in winter Breakfast is the same every morning, 5min walk to the main train station Able to check in early Nice breakfast
510883,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, The staff were eager to go the extra mile for instance it was difficult to identify the parking entrance and one of the staff members made himself available to drive with us in the car to the entrance
510884,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The WiFi connection could have been better and maybe is a good idea to modernize a little bit the room furniture which looks very old Also being with a cat I would appreciate a way to keep the cat securely inside the room while the balcony was open so a mosquito net on a frame would have been of great help , We ve been there with our cat to participate to World Show 2016 which was in Vienna The hotel is close enough to the show hall and is quite cheap these were our criteria for choosing it Has very good connections to railway station metro and tram buses The breakfast is good enough the bathroom was spotlessly clean the room was comfortable enough The staff was helpful they made it possible to take the room a few hours earlier than the check in official hour as we were with a cat and the cat was eager to use the bathroom sort to say On the whole is a very good value for money and even if is not in the city center you have good connections Also the room has double windows doors to the exterior so is very quiet even with some traffic on the street 
510885,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Small room no kettle in room cleaning was NOT done properly e g sink not cleaning and soap not replenished breakfast basic , Decent location good value for money
510886,Hotel Prinz Eugen, There is construction work taking place literally outside the hotel which made early mornings annoying The breakfast was mediocre The rooms are not sound proof so we heard a lot more than we bargained for , The hotel is close to the train station The rooms were clean and staff slow but helpful 
510887,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The bed was ok but not overly comfortable We weren t crazy about the shower as the design made water go into the rest of the bathroom The location is pretty good but you re right by all the embassies so it s a little more business like in the area , We had an excellent bartender at the hotel The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly It was nice having the mini fridge in the room Breakfast was very nice as well with a good variety of foods available 
510888,Hotel Prinz Eugen, No complaints, 2 minute walk from main train station 15 minute walk from city centre Friendly staff comfortable clean rooms excellent wifi Breakfast choices were top quality and plentiful Top quality hotel Will stay here again
510889,Hotel Prinz Eugen, One of the reasons to choose this hotel was breakfast stated by other guests as very good In fact I felt disappointed because everyday was exactly the same the choice was also limited and to be honest nothing special Ok the bread was tasty I thought the room would be bigger , The hotel is conveniently located close to the main train station easy access to the airport and to the entrance to metro As the room was exceptionally quiet and the bed was super comfortable my quality of sleep was excellent there 
510890,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Have to get used to shower stall with only a pane of glass We must have splashed water over half of the bathroom Oh well , Very convenient location Great breakfast Next to major road but quiet in room 
510891,Hotel Prinz Eugen, No tea making facilities in the room and no tea served in the lobby No shampoos or other toiletries available only liquid soap I guess I was super lucky with the price deal and did not mind these things much But I saw that the price went higher later on and overall for a 4 start hotel the amenities are quite basic , Great value for money I paid less than 50 Euro per night with breakfast which is amazing value good location near Main train station and there is metro U1 and tram lines around room was of good size clean and comfortable good internet speed breakfast quite nice variety tasty pancakes Staff was also pleasant and helpful 
510892,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, I had a short stay at NH one night but everything was clean and comfy Not VERY close to the city center but within walking distance I am a walking enthusiast but I think others could enjoy the walk as well it s about 2 km I think Very close to the subway and easy to find The staff was friendly and I liked the mint cucumber infused water you can drink at the reception All in all I had a pleasant stay and I would return even for more than one night 
510893,Hotel Prinz Eugen, the interior of the hotel is little bit old, just opposite of central station very convenient to transport within in town few minutes walk to Schloss Belvedere Plus good breakfast 
510894,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Three breakfast were enough Hard to find parking place near hotel and parking garage fees was double more than payment of rent car , Great location very close to the Vienna main train station with many shops and delicious fast food Quiet and clean room but fitted carpet Friendly staff and wifi worked well allover Fridge in the room Breakfast was generous but nothing home made or specialities 
510895,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Nothing really, Nothing was too much trouble for the staff The location was excellent Value for money excellent and all the staff were exceptionally pleasant 
510896,Hotel Prinz Eugen, This hotel should be rated as 3 star hotel The mattress was uncomfortable and had a dent in the middle it wasn t flat The carpet had stains and the whole room had a bit of a worn down feeling to it with humidity stains and scratched walls see photos Wi Fi didn t work in the room 511 the signal was too weak It was the first time in a 4 star hotel that I called the reception to have wine glasses and a corkscrew delivered to the room and got asked to go to the hotel bar and ask if they have it Breakfast was a little disappointing with overcooked bland scrambled eggs supermarket cakes being served and horrible coffee ,No Positive
510897,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Tea or coffee making facilities in the room would have been nice , Excellent location opposite main station and with tram stops outside Great value for money with very good breakfast and helpful staff Fridge in the room was a real plus Would definately recommend 
510898,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Old tv The last day we had to be gone real early and we arrived at breakfast at 6 30 No hot water for tea and we had to ask for the eggs and bacon at 6 50 We needed to leave by 7 In general the breakfast staff were wonderful helpful and friendly But they seemed run off their feet , Great price having booked 6 months previously Worried initially on arrival because of the busy road But double windows made it very doable Comfortable warm rooms as the weather became cold Most of the staff helpful and friendly Nicely appointed foyer 
510899,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Had a standard double room It is on the small side for 2 people however manageable , Excellent Breakfast Buffet friendly staff very good internet and very clean 
510900,Hotel Prinz Eugen, i didn t like the late check in it was at 14o clock we left our luggage and we went for a walk , it was a nice and confortable room the bed big enough as well as the toillet warm water at any time sampoo soap toillet paper hair dryer fridge tv aircondition the breakfast was nice too i mostly enjoyed the crepes and merenda all perfect and 5 minute walk from metro and 5 minute walk from belvedere schloss 
510901,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The breakfast was mediocre The bread and rolls were disappointing, The hotel is very close to the train station which makes the location very convenient for travelling by train plane and subway Although it s on a busy street my room was very quiet 
510902,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The breakfast was not good worst coffee in Austria The lobby bar did not work the whole time furniture is from the 60s or 70s this is not OK for a 4 star hotel, The location is good very close to central station The hotel staff was friendly and helpful 
510903,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The room I had was on the small side furniture were very old fashioned TV was very small and signal was bad The wifi was very poor and slow , Location was very convenient close to 2 stations hauptbahnof and Quatier Belvedere not far by tube from the city centre The breakfast was good with lots of selections both cold and hot Clean bathroom and good facility Good value overall 
510904,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The hotel is comfortable but a little tired Some of the furniture could do with an upgrade such as reupholstery and cushions on the chairs Flat screens in the bedrooms would be a good move as would a rethink about room decoration which is a tad on the bland side Tea and coffee making facilities would be useful as would an iron and ironing board Being female the trouser press was redundant , The hotel was very close to public transport stops However I also found it a pleasant walk into the inner stadt of Vienna It was very clean and there was plenty of choice for breakfast Wifi was good The area is being developed with a new contemporary art gallery literally just across the road and part of the Belvedere Palace group Overall I d stay here again 
510905,Hotel Prinz Eugen, I did not experience any negative issues so the hotel can maintain the standards, The breakfast was great with several options depending on one s preference The bed was also very comfortable 
510906,Hotel Prinz Eugen, no tea coffee in room , one of the best hotels ive stayed in reception staff very freindly deco in reception was very relaxing large garden area at the back large room beds were very comfy clean bathroom lovely breakfast room plenty of choice for breakfast would stay here again 10 mins from train station 4 stops on metro into center of vienna
510907,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, The hotel is very near to the central train station Around 7 minute walk The hotel staffs were very accomodating with our request and very helpful with regards to our queries The room was spacious and ours had a terrace Since we need to catch a 6am train the next morning and we couldn t make it to the breakfast timing the staff even packed us a sandwich and some fruits It was a very comfortable stay 
510908,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, Great hotel just next to the train station what was important for us Big variety of choice on breakfast Everything important in the rooom fridge balcony aircon and in the highest standard 
510909,Hotel Prinz Eugen, A five minute walk from train station Surrounding a bit dark and quiet at night , Staff very helpful patient and polite Booked a twin room but was given a spacious triple room and allowed early check in too Clean comfortable room at very low price 
510910,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Breakfast was not good Not enough staff not enough tables ready for guest coming for breakfast Not a lot to choose from No view from the room and a lot of traffic outside the hotel ,No Positive
510911,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Breakfast options are limited Personally i would choose a hotel closer to another safer subway station if i knew the city and were staying longer , Though the location of the property is it s biggest asset the same is also a bit of a problem considering how hbf has increasingly become a dwelling for miscreants 
510912,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Main train station is just 5min away in evening not so nice place to walk around Windows to very noisy street during all day time so not possible to open it but prety nice air conditioning so it helps , Good for 1 night stay very good if you are just in transit via Vienna if more nights would advise more nicer places in Vienna Standart economy number but just walls and furniture in reallity is more obsolate than on photos It was rainy and in the reception were available umbrelas big 
510913,Hotel Prinz Eugen, There is a construction site across the road so the view is limited However the excellent sound proofing of the rooms means there is no noise whatsoever well done , The beds were superb very comfy The rooms were also cleaned exceptionally well 
510914,Hotel Prinz Eugen, 4 stars hotel without parking area we have parked the car in a public parking for 19 50 euro day amount payed at hotel 2 euro beeing hotel fee only one size for pillows dirty room walls the room smell poor breakfast for 4 stars hotel, comfortable mattress the hotel staff the hotel position 5 minutes to the metro station 8 minutes to Belvedere Palace 25 minutes to Karlkirche by walk good price for room 57 euro night 
510915,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The internet connection was not great , The beds were very comfortable the air conditioning was exceptional the breakfast choice was almost overwhelming in its options and variety and waiters were so friendly and helpful very close to the centre and station really polite and helpful front desk staff and a fridge in the room plus the most powerful shower on earth 
510916,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, The hotel was conveniently located for the railway station and a 15 minute walk from central Vienna through the beautiful Belvedere gardens It was clean comfortable and quiet despite fronting onto a busy road 
510917,Hotel Prinz Eugen, No kettle in room Only 1 pillow too soft, Near train station other transport Fast early checkin given Good early breakfast Free fast wifi Request for room facing main road given room on 7 8th floor is not noisy
510918,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Not on city centre so at night there s not many people on the street wich can be spooky , Next to train station and Belvedere Subway is close too Hotel is not new but confortable given the Vienna prices The breakfast is very good No problem with wifi 
510919,Hotel Prinz Eugen, No parking but host gave us 50 voucher for parking under central railroad station 600 m away , Tasty breakfast Helpfull multilingual staff Clean rooms Great location 200 m from uban 600 m from bahnhoff 15 min walk from Old Town
510920,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Nothing, Everything from its close proximity to the Train and Metro Station friendly and helpful reception staff great room excellent Breakfast cleanliness and safety at night
510921,Hotel Prinz Eugen, I would have liked tea and coffee making facilities in the room , I stayed here for 3 nights and it was perfect It s situated 2 minutes away from the train station and also just around the corner from the tram line D which takes you into the city centre My room was spacious and comfortable I noticed it didn t have a minibar in the fridge but I wouldn t have used it if there was so no problem there The inclusive breakfast was fantastic with such a wide choice there must be something to suit everyone All in all a great base for exploring Vienna and I d definitely stay here again if I return 
510922,Hotel Prinz Eugen, If I have to be critical it would be helpful to have extra space or an extra shelf in the bathroom for toiletries The shelf in the bathroom was suitable for one guest but not two But don t let this stop anyone from staying here It was a very good place to stay , Close to the main station close to Belvedere Palace and Gardens good breakfast which was included clean friendly staff One particular male staff member had a great personality and customer service skills Easy to access transport and get around Vienna efficiently and without any hassle 
510923,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Poor wifi in the rooms, The hotel was very nice The receptionist was very helpful and patient because of a problem we had The bed was super comfortable and we also had a small fridge in the room 
510924,Hotel Prinz Eugen, 2 single beds that pretended double bed No tea or coffee on welcome It is very unpleasant especially when the arrival to the hotel was on Sunday and travel before arrival was very long 23 hours of flying No iron in the room , location
510925,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Further from the city centre than first thought about 20 minute walk , Good location for the train station Clean and comfortable hotel with a nice breakfast and friendly staff Good public transport near hotel 
510926,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Just a very little details the 2 single beds close to each others When travelling as couple this is a little surprising because the are no double beds in the hotel Would be nice to have this option , The location is nice because close to the center with good public transport connections the personal is kind and helpful the beds are goods as well Also the breakfast was nice Definitely a very good hotel if you are coming to Vienna 
510927,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The carpeted floor made a crunching sound when walked on which was a little odd , Staff were helpful and kind room was good size and bed was comfortable Location was good for restaurants and the Hauptbanhof is right across the road The breakfast here is superb Public transport leaves from almost directly in front of the hotel to the city centre 
510928,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Iron is only available in the cleaners room For this reason I am no longer going back for a business trip Breakfast doesn t have much variety If the hotel is indeed 4 stars the should need a doorman at least to open those old heavy doors at the entrance It is a struggle for a short person like myself to enter while carrying luggages , Clean and very good air conditioner 
510929,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Should be refreshed a bit the furniture the bathrooms etc But not a big deal , A bit outdated but still very convenient for one night stay before the early start from Vienna Main Station Didn t have time for breakfast Wi fi works ok 
510930,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Not too much choices in breakfast even there is no croissant also not delicious choices very fabricated foods not 4 star hotel standart , Good location easy access to stephanplatz with just 3 stops by metro Providing discount for publich parking garages 
510931,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, Well located directly in the centre of the Wienna next Haupt Bahnof Good breakfast since early morning it is great if you cannot sleep We were welcomed with the bikes 
510932,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The decoration of the room was a little dated but everything still worked so no real complaints , We arrived off the sleeper train from Venice at 9am so just nipped in to the hotel to drop off our bags but were informed that our room was already prepared for us which was excellent The whole stay was great and the breakfast was lovely 
510933,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Nothing, That it was unpretentious and exceptionally good value It was easy to get to the sights we wanted to see with good access to public transport and back to the airport 
510934,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Room lighting could be brighter, Staff very friendly and helpful good breakfast handy to tram transport to Vienna ring and underground to Schonbrun Palace and 5 minutes walk to Belvedere Palace
510935,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Can t think of anything , Great location a few doors down from the main train station great places to eat in the station Room was very comfortable and staff very professional great price about half compared to Zurich and Geneva 
510936,Hotel Prinz Eugen, We arrived late at night and the staff was very welcoming However next morning some friends came to pick us up and were told that there was no one there by that name and we would not be arriving for another 2 months They had arrived early and sat around for 1 2 hour not knowing what to do until we came down ,No Positive
510937,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Breakfast to be improved e g no croissant Overall building to be renewed current aspect is quite sad Arm chairs in the all much consumed not really a comfortable welcome impression Sold as a 4 hotel in reality is 2 5 not more , Good position mearby the Belvedere and the main train station good ratio quality price but not at all a 4 it s really a 2 5 not more 
510938,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, I think the hotel really has a long history the facilities are old but the room is clean actually It s near the train station The location is OK and easy to find The breakfast is the highlight 
510939,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Quite noisy because our room is facing the main road and breakfast is average , Only 30 mins walk to the town centre and also located very close to Belverde Palace
510940,Hotel Prinz Eugen, I felt there was a unique smell to the hotel which has a very old school d cor but that is probably part of its charm , Nice spacious superior twin room with great shower and we got it in a nice deal Breakfast was okay and staff brought soya milk when asked as we are vegan so our choices in general were limited but there was enough for us to fill our stomachs Around a 5 10 minute walk to a main train station from which it is three stops to the centre 
510941,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Breakfast wasn t good to us The pies cakes on the photos are not there only some dry factory plain slice of cake Bacon was not fried well sour artificial juices airconditioning is not good The temperature outside was over 24 Inside 23 Lower wasn t possible The solution according to the staff open a window but we were on the VERY noisy street side multiple lanes and sleeping wasn t comfortable I wouldn t book again , Location was good beds are comfortable 
510942,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Expect a 20 mins walk into central Vienna from here as it is situated right by train station , Based on a main road I was surprised that no noise could be heared in the rooms Rooms spacious clean Good breakfast choice 
510943,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The shower room has no full door So when I shower water is splattered out They need to fully enclosed shower , Location to vienna central train station Room was very clean with view of city 
510944,Hotel Prinz Eugen, I could find some minor things to complain but not for this price really , This is my second stay in this hotel and the first impressions are confirmed The big advantage is the vicinity of the main train station Hauptbahnhof from where are available all possible train connections Hotel is clean and comfortable the perfect value for really good price 
510945,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Problem with parking only very limited space in front of the hotel and quite full places in the nearby streets , The breakfast was perfect room very clean and staff friendly and helpful The hotel bar was very fine 
510946,Hotel Prinz Eugen, NIL, Hotel location is about 5 10 mins walk from the Wien Hauptbahnhof Train station Hotel room is big clean toilet amenity provided good strong shower water pressure Buffet breakfast with excellect choice breads hard boil eggs scramble eggs pancake etc Hotel staffs are friendly and offer assistance to us Take approx 40 mins by walk to reach Stephanspl Billa supermarket is close by 
510947,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The furnitures and facilities are a bit old and they are consistent with the age of the hotel , The staffs at the reception were very friendly and helpful The breakfast was super good 
510948,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, the hotel is a little bit old but it is just on the other side of the train station there is balcony in the room and the breakfast is really rich but the reception staff is not that friendly please improve the service quality 
510949,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Asked for quiet room but were given room over busy avenue Yet once windows closed very little noise was heard , Pleasant staff Clean and large rooms Excellent breakfast Efficient A C Luggage storage facility Good location near main train station and access to Underground 
510950,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The reception people dont care if you are looking for something more than a bed If they have come up with some advice it would make me come back whenever in Wien, The view The terrace should be better promoted while people register
510951,Hotel Prinz Eugen, We would have enjoyed two pillows , It had old world style very roomy charming decor Lovely breakfast something for everyone so close to transportation Train station is like a shopping mall 
510952,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Construction of the glass door that separates bath from bath room door between rooms probably it was one big room converted to two smaller ones , Excellent location transport Central station U Bahn tram and bus stop sight Belveder palace post office and product supermarkets Billa Spar etc Good breakfast Early start 6 30 AM can be very convenient Court is calm we had the window opened whole the night Room is cleaned on regular basis Stuff is ready to help 
510953,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, The bedroom was really cosy and every room has a balcony The breakfast was really nice with a variety of choice of food and drinks Most importantly it s very close to Wien Hauptbahnhof which is very convenient 
510954,Hotel Prinz Eugen, I liked everything , During our stay the stuff was extra helpful the rooms which were very comfortable were cleaned every day and the breakfast was really great Another plus was that the hotel was across the Central Train Station which provided a direct connection to the airport and the city centre Overall an excellent choice 
510955,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Dirty bathroom very noisy location windows towards big road construction in front Area outside also not good with many poor people begging First day stuff was not helpful when trying to find a better headdryer answer to every question was in the room ,No Positive
510956,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Keep some complementary moisturizers in the room , The room was very clean and the breakfast tasty with a good offer The staff was friendly and attentive 
510957,Hotel Prinz Eugen, WI FI network stops unexpectedly signal is soemtimes poor you have to look for the good spot but I ve seen worse Finally it worked , Breakfast is excellent My room on 8th floor had a wonderful terrace very good for smokers and with a splendid view over the city 
510958,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The staffs are okay It is not that they are not nice but just not as welcoming as others, Close to the station easy access to the center and airport Good breakfast Really comfortable beds Clean bathroom Highly recommended
510959,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, Great spread with their buffet breakfast Great location for our needs 5min walk to main train station and Belvedere Palace Very clean and well sized Helpful staff who let us check in 2hrs earlier which was much appreciated 
510960,Hotel Prinz Eugen, This visit I was put in a room directly next to the building next door where major construction is going on so beware , I stay here often and it is usually quite nice 
510961,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Location of hotel Looks a bit run down from the outside rusty and dirty railings on balconies Had room on 2nd floor overlooking a busy 6 lane road so noisy , Walking distance to main railway station Helpful and friendly staff nice comfortable bed good choice of hot and cold food for breakfast Great value for money 
510962,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, A good view from the room We requested for a quiet room and the hotel staff promptly assisted with that It s like an old school hotel from the 70s they even have suit pressed installed in the room I ve never seen one in my life till the stay 
510963,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The room was too hot air conditioning wasn t working and to have the balcony door open was too noisy at night asked to be moved to rear facing room that was much quieter , convenient to train station and trams there was a really good and reasonable restaurant just along the road and cafe around the corner Small bar around the back of reception nice coctails breakfast was very good 
510964,Hotel Prinz Eugen, First time I saw hotel which use air conditioning according to calendar They told us from 1st May we ll start air conditioning it was very uncomfortable there was no ventelation in the room So we have to open the glass door which faces main road it was so noisy outside at night that it s very difficult to sleep plz start air conditioning as per temperature not by date , Location is the only good part 
510965,Hotel Prinz Eugen, In the winter or late winter when the AC of the building was still not on and you had to open the window a car noise from outside was quite annoying , It s near the main train station 
510966,Hotel Prinz Eugen, When i check in staff is kindly but after the day Other staff is not good , Location is very good Room is comfortable and view of balcony is good too 
510967,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, Unfortunately I couldn t visit Wien but just my parent did They were really satisfied with the experience in Hotel Prinz Eugen Also I asked for many services like taxi print and they have done everything perfectly I really recommend this place to visit 
510968,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Parking around the location is a question of luck and a small car we had both The usual room rates are way above what I would pay no matter how great the hotel is but we were lucky , It was close to perfection very nice staff fine classic rooms all in best shape We were lucky to get a bargain rate with very early booking 
510969,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, Great location A few minutes from the Belvedere train station including the U1 3 stops to Stephansdom All staff reception breakfast cleaning were very nice Nice is important 
510970,Hotel Prinz Eugen, It would be nice if there was extra pillow and a kettle it be nice after a long day trip out would be nice there tea or coffee in the hotel room , Everything was close to eve thing that we wanted Beautiful places
510971,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The cafe should give more information on what they serve Extra pillow will be great , Location is good to start explore the city as it is around 10 minutes walk from central station 
510972,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, Location to Wien Hbf Main station Room surprising well sound insulated from outside noise and given how busy the main road is and that I was facing that way I was not disturbed at all Also bedroom had an inner door which when shut cut down on noise in the corridor as well so a good night sleep was had Breakfast buffet is very varied I have stayed here some years ago before the days of Booking com so I had a good idea of what to expect anyway 
510973,Hotel Prinz Eugen, No coffee tea making facilities in bedrooms Hotel bar seemed a little though not excessively pricey , Well located for transport links into and out of the city Metro Main line trains and Trams Good breakfasts Hotel kept very clean and the room are well serviced Extremely helpful friendly staff who give useful advice Free WiFi 
510974,Hotel Prinz Eugen, I would have preferred having a bathtub rather than just a shower , Good breakfast choices and also that breakfast was included unlike the 5 star Athens Airport Sofitel It is handy to the beautiful new train station complex Loved the displays relating to Prince Eugene of Savoy who liberated Hungary from the Turks 
510975,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Only thing I didn t like was we were on tbe 6th floor and the window opened right in could have had a safety catch especially if you had children as the window was low , Good breakfast plenty of choice Clean and nice room Staff very nice 
510976,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, Very convenient location for travellers by train as near the Main Trainstation Even for Airport is a good location as trains go every 30 minutes to Vienna Airport Rooms are good and clean breakfast is fine staff is professional 
510977,Hotel Prinz Eugen, the room facilities were basic we thought there were bedbugs because we both got itchy bites afterwards, breakfast choices were ample location was good
510978,Hotel Prinz Eugen, One minor niggle would be that the beds were too soft for me but that s just a matter of personal preference that s why I cannot give the hotel a full 10 out of 10 unfortunately , The staff was by far the best thing about this brilliant hotel The level of service was incredible to say the least better than anywhere else I ve ever stayed Ibrahim was a delight to talk to in the bar area when my girlfriend was very poorly with a severe case of sinusitis we asked if we could prolong our checkout time until our train back home Emanuel at reception was immediately able to help us He not only let us stay in our room for the extra few hours we needed but he also did not charge us a penny for it either This to me indicates an exceptional level of service he should be rewarded for it accordingly The whole staff was extremely helpful the management should be VERY proud of everyone who works there On top of this it s also an absolutely delightful place to stay Close to Hauptbanhof it is a nice pleasant walk into Vienna city centre on foot from the hotel It has comfy clean rooms provides a very tasty breakfast I genuinely cannot find any major faults about this superb hotel It also has a very interesting cool art deco decorated interior very pleasing to the eye One minor niggle would be that the beds were too soft for me but that s just a matter of personal preference that s why I cannot give the hotel a full 10 out of 10 unfortunately Stay at this hotel you won t regret it I will definitely be recommending this hotel to everyone who would like to visit Vienna one day 
510979,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Most shops close on Sunday, The location is very good especially for a new visitor who does not need to worry about timing of transportation amongs airport different cities and different places inside Vienna
510980,Hotel Prinz Eugen, enormous building site opposite the hotel Weaker breakfast offer , Positive approach personnel in the reception and lobby bar Very good price to value ratio
510981,Hotel Prinz Eugen, I literally have nothing bad to say about this hotel , Everything was amazing The staff was extremely accommodating the hotel decor and room were lovely the breakfast was very good it is directly across from the train station and just a 30 minute walk from the historic city center It s a fantastic price to boot for the quality of this amazing hotel 
510982,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, The location of the hotel next to the Hauptbahnhof cannot be matched Staff were friendly and very accommodating to our requests Breakfast spread was adequate and sumptuous 
510983,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, This hotel is at the top end of the three star category Very well appointed rooms carpeted which is unusual in Austria Lovely breakfast room with extensive choices for breakfast Lovely foyer and cosy bar Very close to Wien Hauptbahnof and easy access to the centre of Wien via Tramline D or Ubahn Only five minutes walk to the Belvedere 
510984,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Value for money although Vienna is expensive and it was before the new year so maybe prices were at a premium, Close to train station good breakfast buffet included
510985,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Stuff was not very reliable for booking events they forgot several times But in the end it worked , Location is quite convenient walking distance from the station and 25 30 mins walk from the very center 
510986,Hotel Prinz Eugen, It might be a bit far to walk to get into the central part of town rather take the tram, It was a short easy walk from the railway station and two blocks away from the tram D that goes into town The room was clean and comfortable with a reasonably sized bathroom The breakfast spread was more than ample The hotel foyer is reminiscent of a majestic old building It is also only two blocks away from the Belvedere which is absolutely stunning There is a laundromat within walking distance There is a supermarket and eateries in the station and a few restaurants just down the street 
510987,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Old fashioned and funny TV , Location and easy access to any other places in Vienna fresh and delicious breakfast but it would be better to install a coffee machine instead of offering ready made coffee wi fi excellent quiet room though on the front side 
510988,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Parking is an issue in the area Small elevator very tight fit with a baby buggy , Very good value for money Relatively large room Friendly staff Good breakfast 
510989,Hotel Prinz Eugen, the area doesnt have restaurants or bars or pubs very close you have to walk a bit, Price Location opposite to hauptbahnof comfortable spacious rooms cleanliness
510990,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Nothing, Stayed only one night located 3 min by foot from central rail station of Viena Stuff at reception very nice even gave me brekfast pack on 5 00 am when I left to airport 
510991,Hotel Prinz Eugen, One receptionist is not nice at all He is young and he tries hard to look important and cool and the only time he smiled was when he tried to make fun of me for one simple question I had the impression that I was the receptionist and he was the client Message to him You should look for another job All other personnel we met were very nice and friendly One more bad thing I booked 9 months in advance and when I booked I asked for a room on the highest floor please But when we arrived we were given a room not even close to the highest floor So there is no point in asking for something in the booking when not even 9 months are enough to have it , Beautiful but standard is more like three stars Room was small but enough for us Nice classic furnitures good breakfast close to railway station good value for money 
510992,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, Clean close to the metro supermarket spar not far nice variety of hot and cold dishes for breakfast excellent personal in the breakfast room Close to beautiful Belvedere 
510993,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Large construction view from the window, Very helpful staff good location near to Belvedere good clean room beautiful lobby interior and good breakfast Free wi fi everywhere
510994,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, The location was highly accessible to public transport and catching train to the airport and the staff were very helpful and the breakfast was substantial I particularly liked the very new bathroom for such a boutique hotel Walking distance to the Belvedere palace and a tram ride to Hundertwasser museum made this hotel the perfect choice for my stay
510995,Hotel Prinz Eugen, There is not a computer internet corner at the hotel for common use in case you do not have a laptop with you I think the receptionist should have proposed to me to use her computer at the reception as I needed it just for 5 minutes , The great location at the Hauptbahnhof the room the cleanliness All this taking into account the great price we paid 
510996,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Very noisy You can hear the always busy road outside but also your neighbours taking a bath in the middle of the night Besides the maid was vacuum cleaning since 8 30 which is quite early when you want to rest on your holidays , The staff was comprehensive and helpfull
510997,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Waiting at the reception that somebody shows up was less nice but time acceptable, The facility interior is charming breakfast is also good The location is also OK near Belvedere
510998,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The wet dry area in the bath room is not well separated Spillage of water can t be avoided during shower I think this is the area to be improved Overall is still very good , The location is near to the main train station Hauptbahnhof The room is cozy with a small balcony Breakfast is included with high variety Excellent wifi connection I think it is value for money 
510999,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The hotel is far from center to walk on foot There are many construction sites nearby so it s noisy Hotel hasn t a place for parking Nearest garage is far away and very expensive Very old interior and furniture , Good price for accomodation Super solution for guests with a low budget and the ones who will only sleep there 
511000,Hotel Prinz Eugen, The shower should have a full box so it wouldn t wet the whole bathroom Breakfast could also be a bit better , The location is very convenient and staff is very helpful 
511001,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Location is very close to main train station hbf but far from city center We take metro to go city center, Bed is comfortable Hotel and room design was nice
511002,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Despite being high quality I would appreciate more variety on breakfast , I liked everything about the hotel Breakfast is good The best thing is staff s attention to guests and politeness as i was accepted into my room way before check in time after being awake for more than 24 hours in a row and was exausted Kudos to them Also meters from metro and main train station Belvedere palace is very close too 
511003,Hotel Prinz Eugen, No tea coffee making ability in the room Had to pay for a cup of tea each evening , Our room was very big and roomy and very comfortable Staff were great very knowledgable and very friendly
511004,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Everything was Perfect really execpt for the fact that we had to leave the room so early I would ve love it if we could ve stayed until 14 15 00 o clock but everything else well i can t complain i really enjoyed my time there , I was really surprised at how everything was absolutely clean and made perfectly comfortable I will Definitely book a room again in the near future and I do hope it will be as perfect as this one The offer of the stay was really good and the price very fair all in all it was a very comfortable and well planned stay 
511005,Hotel Prinz Eugen,No Negative, The room was ready upon our arrival at 11 00 We really appreciate it It s a nice and comfortable hotel with great location We recommend this hotel and we will book it for sure next time when coming to Vienna
511006,Hotel Prinz Eugen, It was some distance from the centre of the city and the ring road outside is not attractive but this is balanced by being close to the Hbf , Nice room with balcony Excellent breakfast Close to Hbf for those arriving and departing by train Close to Schloss Belvedere and botanic gardens 
511007,Hotel Prinz Eugen, Nothing It was perfect if there was a tea facilities, Great location Beautifully decorated Spotlessly clean Great service from the stuff Very good breakfast
