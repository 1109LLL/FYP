469201,Sunotel Club Central, My son insisted watching cartoons in Spanish on the tv could not find any decent channels in English , Good location if you want to travel all around Barcelona and not just head to the beach area Bus stops close by and good food Staff fantastic and really helpful The room was clean smart and had all that s required but is on the small side Pool and jacuzzi area small but lovely and towels are provided 
469202,Sunotel Club Central, As a couple provided with two single beds pushed together wasn t ideal , Perfect location Loved the rooftop jacuzzi and pool Staff were lovely belongings felt safe left in room 
469203,Sunotel Club Central, Pool was pretty small and no toilet facilities by pool which meant going down seven floors to use them , Great location and really friendly staff Delicious breakfast and quite friendly neighbourhood 
469204,Sunotel Club Central, I did not like the fact that the stated dibble bed was actually two singles pushed together which was very uncomfortable , The location was fantastic as well as the rooftop pool and patio 
469205,Sunotel Club Central, Very small room and location was good but still not walkable everywhere The pool was also very small , Clean and comfortable room Overall very good value for money 
469206,Sunotel Club Central, The location was less central than we had hoped , The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and willing to answer any questions we had Plus they gave great recommendations for restaurants etc 
469207,Sunotel Club Central, Breakfast a little pricey much better to go to a local cafe other than that no negatives at all , Extremely clean and comfortable facilities Comfortable bed excellent quiet outdoor pool and terrace Well maintained Polite and friendly staff 
469208,Sunotel Club Central, Beds not very comfortable very poor lighting in the room , Very good location short walking distance to shops and center great facilities of rooftop pool with shower jacuzzi and towels Friendly and accommodating staff 
469209,Sunotel Club Central, Nothing to complain about , Small but cozy hotel with an excellent location on Carrer de Valencia a street where nice cafes local bars abound where going to a crawl through the purely local lifestyle was the best attraction for me but inquire hotel staff about opening hours mind siesta I appreciate friendliness of the staff enjoyed cleanliness of the breakfast place The breakfast itself is quite enough to kick start a good day Though it may seem the hotel is a bit far from main attractions it is just 10 15 mins walk away from great Rambla de Catalunya and Passeig de Gracia wide tourist streets leading to lots of famous places Public transport is there metro is not in the immediate vicinity for some but just 4 blocks away 10 mins walk Hospital Clinic or Universitat are the nearest stations My room on the 1st floor was spacious with all necessary amenities in bathroom 
469210,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, Great location Friendly staff willing to help with special requests and directions Pool was a welcome bonus to relax in between sightseeing and evenings out 
469211,Sunotel Club Central, Bad matrasses the light switch turns on both the ceiling and the desk lamp the swimming pool is too small poor ventilation we smelled tobacco coming from the vents, Very friendly and knowledgeable stuff superb location near restaurants and close to major attractions fantastic windows block all the street noise
469212,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, Very friendly and helpful staff Breakfast is good Bicycle rent for free was easy and great way to explore the city Pool and jacuzzi top on the roof nice We really enjoyed our stay at sunotel Great location 
469213,Sunotel Club Central, Soundproofing could be a bit better but not detrimental to the stay Pricey breakfast so didn t try coffee shop across the road was excellent , Clean fresh and modern hotel with a decent sized room and a comfy bed The room was nice and dark so slept well and had a nespresso machine so could enjoy a really good coffee on waking up Staff were excellent 
469214,Sunotel Club Central, Woken up every morning like clockwork with cleaners dragging the heavy chairs around other rooms while cleaning Payed such a high price and not one breakfast thrown in on any of our four mornings , Nespresso coffee machines in the room was great Staff at desk were so helpful Pool and Jacuzzi on the roof was great
469215,Sunotel Club Central, A bit too expensive for what it is The rooms had those old style keys that you need to leave in reception before exiting the hotel The mattresses were a big old but you can sleep through the night , The staff was super nice we asked them for twin beds as I was traveling with a relative and they quickly sorted that out Location is good close to university and around 10 15 minutes walk to Plaza Catalunya Swimming pool is great As we were in not such a busy time of the year June there were enough sun beds for us 
469216,Sunotel Club Central, No iron in the room Had to wait hours for iron because other guests were using the iron Shower in the bath Nearly slipped in the bath Had to put towels in the bath topreveslipping , Location friendly staff
469217,Sunotel Club Central, Pool was small the size of the room was relatively small the quality of the breakfast was average , Good location clean rooms and friendly staff I liked a lot the nespresso machine in the room 
469218,Sunotel Club Central, no balcony no outside seating area noisy from main road poor bedside lighting It was a shock to get the city tax at the end of the stay , Central Staff were very good pool good bed and bathroom 
469219,Sunotel Club Central, Nice and quiet area however not many bars and restaurants near the hotel , The bedrooms were clean and comfy Lovely roof top pool and jacuzzi very calm and relaxing to sit around Staff were helpful and friendly 
469220,Sunotel Club Central, Very very loud with thin walls Could literally hear what TV show was on in next room Could hear conversations Bad But worst was the AC You have to put your room key in a slot by the door to turn on the AC When you leave obviously you have to take the key out and so the AC is always off when you aren t in the room So when it s 98 degrees outside as it was when we were there it is boiling hot when you walk back in the room from being out sightseeing and takes a couple of HOURS to cool off and even after several hours we figured out how to stick a piece of paper in the slot so the air would run while we went out it was still barely cool at all Would never use this hotel again for that reason along with the noise Bed was adequate but sheets felt like sandpaper Had to climb a 3 foot tub wall to get into the shower Cheap toiletries Makeup mirror loose and no washcloths Not a great experience to say the least , Clean and good location and nice front desk but that s all that was good
469221,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, Jacuzzi and pool on the rooftop are fabulous Staff very nice and happy Position good Eixample is full of restaurantes and Gracia is one of the more catalan barrios With 6 12 euro of taxi you can reach easily all the parts of Barcelona 
469222,Sunotel Club Central, Nothing Just it wasn t possible to late check out but it was a busy week in Barcelona so I understand , Very kind staff clean room modern furniture terrace pool 24 7 reception I will come back for sure 
469223,Sunotel Club Central, Nothing to complain about at all , The hotel was perfect It s a 20 minute walk to La Ramblas so we didn t need to take transport The rooms were lovely and clean air con was great pool on the roof was perfect with towels easily accessible just wish it was open to watch the sunset Breakfast was huge and good value for money 
469224,Sunotel Club Central, Honestly there was nothing that needed improving I would choose Sunotel over more luxurient hotels , The staff was helpful and friendly like no other hotel I have been to in the world The beds are super comfortable and the shower alone was worth coming to the hotel for 
469225,Sunotel Club Central, Although breakfast is served in a dining room there is no restaurant for any other meals Then again the choice outside the hotel is quite good , Central location Walking distance of several Gaudi properties We felt safe on the streets at night although like any major city a need to be aware of opportunistic pickpockets in the major tourist areas Excellent and very friendly and helpful staff Nothing was too much trouble Rooms were clean and spacious with good aircon all over the hotel The Wifi generally worked well not more than 7mbps in our room but signal did drop occasionally Then again we booked for a holiday break and not streaming videos Hotel Bar was open until 10pm but the choice of bars many opening into the early hours were available within walking distance There was a good breakfast until 11am with a reasonable choice of hot and cold food although not always piping hot Cheery breakfast staff as well We had stayed in what would be considered a more upmarket hotel in Barcelona a few days earlier The Sunotel in my view though was a more pleasant experience all round My wife and I will definitely return 
469226,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, Ideally placed for enjoying the local gay nightlife without paying the premium prices of the well known gay hotel nearby iIt is near the bars and clubs The room was spacious and the beds comfortable The room benefits from great air conditioning very important to us cold blooded Northern Europeans and also has good shower 
469227,Sunotel Club Central, We visited in June and Rooftop with pool was closing at 21 00 o clock Basically they were closing the door with access to roof top or pool even though it was still not dark So you could not see the view take fresh air or smoke after that Rooms quit big but no balconies Never tried breakfast because thought it was very expensive 16 euros each besides that plenty of bakeries around in the area where you could enjoy coffee and breakfast where you could pay much less , Staff was very friendly and gave us excellent tip s for the area Upon our arrival they had champagne for us bec we were celebrating which we thought it was a very nice gesture of them Around the corner was a very nice restaurant with very good paella and not very expensive The rooms are very clean They had espresso maschine and refilled it every day They had minibar and safe in the rooms and plenty of space in the rooms Area where hotel was located had plenty of restaurants and outside bars with good prices 
469228,Sunotel Club Central, Quality of bathroom you can see the materials used are not the best but the prices for rooms are as it is a top hotel Colours are boring in the rooms , Angel from Reception was very helpful Great customer service throughout Nice pool Nice location 
469229,Sunotel Club Central, No room service arrived late at the hotel I had to go out to eat Poor wifi speed Some minor repairs need to be done in the room but the room is very clean though The door opens with a key which is less handy than a card , Central location in Barcelona you can easily get anywhere from the hotel The neighborhood is good plenty of shops and restaurants The room is clean everything in it to have a good stay personnel is helpful 
469230,Sunotel Club Central, the Hotel is a minimum 15 minutes walk from the nearest metro, The rooms were spacious There is a small supermarket opposite of the hotel they have bicycles to use
469231,Sunotel Club Central, Although the neighborhood was nice it was quite long to all metro stations There were no non sweetened youghurt option at the breakfast and no multigrain bread i e difficult to get a good and heatlhy start of the day Beds not so comfotable and did not manage to get the aircon to work properly, Located in a nice neighborhood Basic hotel with OK facilities
469232,Sunotel Club Central, Worn old bathtub gave appearance of being dirty , Friendly staff affordable and tasty breakfast and the morning hostess was wonderful to meet our certain diet requests The service at reception was excellent 
469233,Sunotel Club Central, Nothing wish I had time to see the pool , Very quiet close to everything but not near noise of Los Ramblas There is a wonderful neighborhood bar restaurant next door open to 2 am Great breakfast across the street and an espadrille shop next door starting at 12 I would definitely stay here again Also from the airport you can jump on the aero bus off near the hospital and then it s a 4 00 taxi ride to the hotel 
469234,Sunotel Club Central, Only a minor niggle we had to ask for an iron and send it back once we d finished with it Would prefer to have an iron in our room for the duration of our stay But that s just me being fussy , Great hotel Everything we needed for our short stay Location was great central to everything we wanted to see 
469235,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, Hotel was excellent in every way Food was great Staff were most helpful Very near to everything in the city Pool was terrific We had a great stay in Barcelona All good 
469236,Sunotel Club Central, Wasn t anything not to like , The breakfast was stellar My sister and I truly enjoyed our 3 day stay in Barcelona and the hotel was perfect for us 
469237,Sunotel Club Central, Everything about this hotel apart from location was absolutely DIRE Poor noise insulation so we heard anyone everyone moving in the hotel and returning back at night the floors were laminated poor noisy quality the decor was cringe worthy and the breakfast was 4th rate Avoid if you want to have a quality time The so called pool really Forget , Location was good
469238,Sunotel Club Central, We felt the breakfast was quite expensive and decided to eat out each morning Apart from that we liked everything about this hotel , The room was large and very clean The shower was excellent Our view was quite good too The location of this hotel is brilliant within walking distance to great shops and La Ramble There were lots of lovely restaurants and cafes all around which were all inexpensive but good quality food and drink My daughter and I would definitely recommend it and will be back We couldn t believe that we spent so little and had a brilliant holiday 
469239,Sunotel Club Central, location was a bit far from La Ramblas and other hang out places that I would have liked to spend a bit more time in very noisy rooms next to me and could always hear neighbors moving furniture around,No Positive
469240,Sunotel Club Central, The pool was very small and the roof top deck around it constantly crowded with not enough sun loungers , The hotel staff was wonderful and the breakfast buffet had a nice variety of food 
469241,Sunotel Club Central, Nothing, Lovely hotel and close to all the sites we used taxis to get around only about 6 and so much safer at night Can t fault the hotel at all lovely staff and so clean
469242,Sunotel Club Central, No handrail to hold when getting out of the shower in bathtub Only a half door across the bath so lots of water splashed out on the floor , Good choice of food for breakfast 
469243,Sunotel Club Central, They kindly held my bad for my last day after checking out But my flight was in the pm I went for a run on the afternoon And Did not allow me to shower afterwards when picking my bag up after checking out I think this facility would be used by other travellers if they would allow this but tickly as I spent more than 500 for the four days I stayed,No Positive
469244,Sunotel Club Central, The only thing we did not like were noisy neighbours , We liked staff which was very helpful and polite Breakfast was good so was swimming pool and jacuzzi open until 9pm and had nice view Check out at midday was a real treat for us 
469245,Sunotel Club Central, The only negative point was that I was on the first floor with a small balcony and people above discarded their cigarettes onto it Not the hotel s fault it is the irresponsible smoker but the cleaner did not clean outside at all whilst I was there , I didn t book the breakfast However I had it two times in four days Some people on here have complained about the price but for cereal and or a cooked breakfast with toast coffees and juice followed by yogurt and a bowl of mixed fresh fruit It really is good value Do your public transport homework Buses and the Metro are very easy Get a T10 transport pass and you can catch the 59 bus around the corner to the beach for just 1 Euro per person and its about 4 miles away The Metro will take you to any of the tourist places and the beach If you are not so confident or have a bigger budget stand outside the hotel and flag a taxi down within 30 seconds or so Visit the Son Hao Taiwanese restaurant at Carrer de Muntaner for the most amazing Asian like Chinese food available in my view in the whole of Barcelona There are also fantastic Italian and Greek food within a 5 minute walk Its a nice slow 20 minute walk to the centre of Barcelona Plaza Catalonia but you can vary the walking route and window shop along the way Plenty of Spanish tapas bars etc nearby and some English Irish pubs Also I found at least three places selling craft beers including a BrewDog pub just streets away from the Sunotel Club Central which is legendary Enjoy 
469246,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, Slightly off the centre of Barcelona about 10 15 mins from the Ramblas but the advantage is that it is quieter and the local restaurants give good value for money The staff were very helpful and the Wi Fi was good 
469247,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, Centrally located very pleasant too early to enjoy the pool which is smallish but still in the center of the city is a nice touch even at the end of the day to sit outside away from traffic Rooms facilities good Classic neigborhood Did not eat in the hotel so cannot opine on that Walked everywhere from the hotel ok not Park Guell but a lot 
469248,Sunotel Club Central, Expensive breakfast and minibar , Nice clean hotel On a busy road but the rooms were quiet Within walking distance of majority of Barcelona s tourist attractions Good choice of eateries and cafes nearby Good wifi The area felt safe 
469249,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, Great location 10 15 minute walk to Placa Catalunya nice view from the room pleasant rooftop hangout wth a tiny but cosy pool area Tasty breakfast with a variety of traditional Spanish food and fruit a coffe machine in the room friendly staff 
469250,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, Of the 9 hotels we stayed at in Spain and Portugal mostly 4 star this was the only hotel that had secure wifi There was a nice selection of reasonably priced cafes in the area 
469251,Sunotel Club Central, Lobby and hallways were cold it was cold outside during our stay Extremely thin walls We could hear our neighbor s excessively loud snoring all night , Nice shower comfy bed and nice linens friendly helpful staff good internet nice little garden off dining area Loved being across the street from the organic market and a bakery and around the corner from a great restaurant Location was a short taxi ride and moderate walk to desired destinations and nice shopping 
469252,Sunotel Club Central, The lobby has a bar but it is not open at any time That seems to be a big mistake for a four star hotel Also at the pool area you got to bring up something to drink Sunbeds and the whole area looks unfortunately out of shape However lots of new clean towels are placed here for use instead of bringing up towels from your room That was in fact very nice , I stayed here for one night only Very friendly staff and a nice lobby My room was fine and at the top of the hotel it was possible to use the pool and sunbeds Breakfast was also very good
469253,Sunotel Club Central, Soundproofing leaves a lot to be desired I was woken up every morning at 7am by the baby next door Nobodies fault but it really annoyed me as I m the least morning person you will find The pillows were too long sounds strange and I felt the mattress was a bit soft Very minor problems , Location was great Just a short walk to La Rambla and there is a food market just round the corner which is similar to the tourist ridden one on La Rambla but far quieter Staff were really friendly We didn t use the pool on the roof but we had drinks up there It s really nice 
469254,Sunotel Club Central, Walls are like from paper you can actually hear every move and sound from next rooms and when somebody clean the room because they drag chairs , Breakfast was very good 
469255,Sunotel Club Central, There is nothing to complain over during our short stay there , The room and the hotel seems new and clean The room was spacious so was the bathroom even having a bd 
469256,Sunotel Club Central, The walls are a little thin in this older hotel and you can certainly hear the neighbours , The property is very central and offers very good rates for this category 
469257,Sunotel Club Central, Beds very uncomfortable pillows like rock didn t get a good night sleep for entire duration Walls paper thin Can hear everything from ajoining rooms not great when people in room next door decided to have a domestic that went on for hours until we complained to reception Can literally hear conversations and people going to the toilet Not ideal unless you are into that sort of thing , Great location 15 mins from main centre of Barcelona hotel clean and staff friendly 
469258,Sunotel Club Central, The walls are thin you can hear your neighbours talking every word taking shower moving chairs etc One day the staff was doing renovation of room I guess or maybe just cleaning at 8 o clock in the morning so we couldn t sleep it was so loud , The location is awesome not far from most of attractions but at the same time in very quiet place with lots of nice restaurants the room is comfortable and cozy staff is friendly 
469259,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, We stayed just two nights a weekend to celebrate a special birthday and found the staff friendly and helpful the hotel clean and location convenient This all helped to make it a lovely visit to Barcelona 
469260,Sunotel Club Central, Pillow wasn t comfortable for me And view from the window wasn t nice But it s not really important , Breakfasts were quite good fruits eggs cheese bacon cakes Not exceptional but good enough cant t say anything bad I would recommend this hotel if you want to stay for several days 
469261,Sunotel Club Central, Even though the Hotel is non smoking people still smoked in their rooms and the cigarette smoke smell came into our bathroom through the vents We smelt it all night long smokers are so inconsiderate and disrespectful , Good breakfast a 10 minute walk to Passage Gracia close enough to metro station a short taxi ride to Sants train station if you are thinking of travelling by fast train to other cities 
469262,Sunotel Club Central, Pool opened at 10am the day we tried to go there That s late AC was not working the first two days but was on the third It may have been to early in the season beginning of April but it was already warm in Barcelona , First impression was how courteous all the front desk clerks were The ones working there the first day we arrived and all the other ones we met during our stay Extremely helpful with directions to Barcelona s top attractions They even use different color markers to match the subway line colors to get you to the destinations you want The room is well maintained but there is nothing extra special about it nor anything bad Very generic but comfortable and clean The bed was a little bit soft to my taste and there was no choice of pillows for you to chose from a harder one to a softer one Nevertheless it was still a comfortable and clean bed Bathroom was also clean The free amenities are very basic Just shampoo and bath gel The only problem in the bathroom is that the tub is higher than the bathroom floor and the tub border is pretty thick When stepping out of the shower you are actually stepping down If you don t realize it you can hurt yourself if you are short My fiancee has a huge purple bruise on her leg because of this We stayed in a room without breakfast so I can t review it At 16 euros per person it is simply too expensive Go across the street to a caf called Honey Operated by two friendly twin sisters offering simple but well made food that is fresh and made when you order All in all this was a good hotel where the good points outweigh the bad ones I would consider it more of a three star than a four star but in the end I would recommend it and would stay there again P S I don t know if its possible but I would like to see a pamphlet with instructions on how to change languages on the TV Everything in Spain is dubbed into spanish but I could see there were options to change languages As much as I tried I couldn t figure out how to do it If the hotel cable service offers the ability to change languages I would like to see them make it clear how to do it 
469263,Sunotel Club Central, Hotel is not so close to the metro station 10 15 minutes of walking , Reception staff is very kind and helpfull room is quite comfortable and clean good value for money
469264,Sunotel Club Central, Same food specialities each day 3 days in a row , Good recommendation for eating out from the front office associate clean room luggage storage for free tasty food
469265,Sunotel Club Central, Room facility said patio but this was mis information as the said room window opened onto an internal non accessible patio just facing rooms on the opposite side Following my complaint I see that there is now now mention of patio Also the room description said wheelchair accessible but the bathroom was in no way wheelchair accessible and a wall along inside the bath meant one had to get into the bath to access the taps which themselves had no makings to say which was shower rain shower hot or cold , very comfortable bed and pillow The rain shower was great once one managed to discover how to work the taps The hot Jacuzzi on the roof was amazing but only hot first night cold second night and closed for cleaning third night 
469266,Sunotel Club Central, Every thing was great, Rooms are confortable nice and roomy The staff at the front desk are very courteous and helpful They gave me some suggestions about some touristic places For example I asked about the teleferic they suggested me the old one that goes to the Barceloneta beach and they were right The ride was amazing and we had the chance to see the beach and take great pictures from the teleferic Thanks again for the suggestion I don t remember the names of the front desk guys but thanks 
469267,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, To be fair it must be said that this is my second stay at this hotel Nothing to say friendly staff proximity to Rambalas 700 M This hotel is in the center of town
469268,Sunotel Club Central, Nothing, Very nice breakfast something for everyone The room was nice bright and clean the bathroom seemed all new and the shower was nice The neighborhood was nice safe and friendly many nice restaurants and small shops Close to most attractions we walked to everything The pool and spa on the roof was good even though the weather was cold because the spa was hot Friendly staff 
469269,Sunotel Club Central, one of the staff was not good with us while the rest of them was very good , location is excellent near to the center 10 min on foot the hotel is very clean and comfort really I would recommend this hotel for honeymooner 
469270,Sunotel Club Central, Upon arrival we found out the pool was under maintenance we were not notified upfront , Rooms were very tidy beds also comfortable Staff is very friendly to show your way around the city Wifi signal is very good throughout the hotel 
469271,Sunotel Club Central, I would appreciate more bathroom utensils paper tissues shower cap etc Unfortunately the swimming pool was closed because of reconstruction during our stay , Good location easy access with Aerobus excellent breakfast comfortable and spacy room and bathroom jacuzzi on top floor We really enjoyed free bicycles Good coffee from machine inside room 
469272,Sunotel Club Central, I spent seven days a bad odor coming from the bathroom for the entire week the hotel does not have the its own restaurant, the location of the hotel is good quite close to many points of interest subway bus stations Breakfast quite varied good
469273,Sunotel Club Central, The bad not comfy The walls are too thin You can here every move sound in the hall way In the morning you can hear the cleaning ladies You can hear the neighbors closing their doors using the bathroom , The location was good Walking distance to important touristic points The room was ok bathroom ok cleaning good The front desk people were very nice
469274,Sunotel Club Central, The rooms weren t sound proof and although I had a room in the back I could hear everything happening in the rooms near mine Breakfast was poor not adequate to a 4 star hotel,No Positive
469275,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, The staff was very helpful and the hotel was clean Breakfast was diverse and plentiful and our room was perfect Good bars and resturants in the vicinity Thank you very much for everything 
469276,Sunotel Club Central, Tea and coffee being automatically replenished each day The walls were a bit thin and the room initially smelt of stale cigarette smoke , Location and secure car parking Great reception staff who were responsive to our needs and friendly The basic room was beyond our expectations and had comfy beds and a good bathroom 
469277,Sunotel Club Central, As the location is difficult for public transportation and far away from anything interesting the hotel offers 8 bikes BUT beware You have to give all your sensitive details including your credit card security code to get the bike When I refused the arrogant receptionist demanded 400 Euro in cash as a guarantee I was given a lecture in Spanish law for free He was also refused the talk with the manager who was not there as the hotel does not need the manager I would add it does not need clients like me , Modernised facility comfortable bed Welcome coffee service only the first night 
469278,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, The pool terrace on the roof was a lovey place to relax after all the sightseeing Staff were very helpful Las Rambla is about 15 20 minutes walking distance from hotel
469279,Sunotel Club Central, Breakfast too expensive and not that good , Free bicycle usage is a big bonus There s a roof top pool but we were there in winter so didn t enjoy it 
469280,Sunotel Club Central, Pillows are too thick and pretty uncomfortable I just slept without it, All was great location size of room amenities everything seems brand new great attitude from staff etc Will definitely return 
469281,Sunotel Club Central, Had the perception that the walls were made of the papers You can hear everything what s going on in the corridors and in the rooms next to yours , The location is great 
469282,Sunotel Club Central, Soundproofing of rooms not great could hear other guest talking in next room Fried eggs when there bacon and sausages were cold , Staff very friendly and helpful and convenient location very clean 
469283,Sunotel Club Central, It could have been slightly better closer to the city centre It was only a 20 minutes walk though so not too bad , The hotel room was lovely and clean Very comfy beds Staff were nice and helpful Good value for money I would recommend 
469284,Sunotel Club Central, Lack of washing soap no coffee capsules water replacement bath too high to get in noise from 3rd parties premises , Cleanliness orderly locality size of room good bed 
469285,Sunotel Club Central, Wifi not great near the top floor where we were , The swimming pool and sun terrace on the roof was brilliant Easy to find and staff spoke excellent English 
469286,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, A new hotel perfect for the night I stayed there as it was across the street from a great health food store and near a friend Friendly staff I wasn t there except to sleep but everything was fine 
469287,Sunotel Club Central, Breakfast was good but nothing special I think they can improve using a bit more of typical products , Very good position nice area close to the main attractions Nice staff that give you a very warm welcome Clean and organised structure 
469288,Sunotel Club Central, Cleaning the cleaner has not even took our rubbish out all he did every day is changing towels No tea or coffe in the room if you have used all 4 tea bags on your first day Floor has not even been swept for 4 days The wall are very thin we couldn t sleep at all we were unlucky to have very noisy French couple next to us You can hear every single word , The location reception staff very helpful free bikes 
469289,Sunotel Club Central, Cleanliness We were 3 days and they never even think of picking up the trash Our bin was full and they did not change it until we advice them, The Location is perfect The hotel is in the city centre but not just right in the middle of the crowd There re many supermarkets stores and restaurants near it The staff is ok quite helpful and very nice
469290,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, we loved that guy at the reception who helped us catch a cab on saturday night Dec17 4am he was very nice kind we forgot his name but he was very helpful I think he was wearing glasses Thanks again you are the best receptionist 
469291,Sunotel Club Central, Bed not very comfortable and a little squeaky pillow a bit hard Coffee pods were not replaced after use Walls could do with a lick of paint a lot of scuff marks , Location was great Room was a good size Staff very helpful 
469292,Sunotel Club Central, The ordinary rooms are not suitable for disabled persons They gave us a smaller room with no physical barrier in the bathroom but the room itself was too small and we had paid a larger sum of money They refused to give any refunding for this downgrading Quite disappointing Absolutely not recommended if you are a person with special needs , The location was good as the the breakfast 
469293,Sunotel Club Central, The breakfast seemed to be quite poor particularly compared with the price Thus we decided to eat our breakfast outside of the hotel , The location was very good 
469294,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, Location close to all places of interest Spar across the street Reception was very informative in terms if what to do ideas and info Also booked tours tickets Breakfast was great Lovely experience 
469295,Sunotel Club Central, The walls are way too thin We was woken by other visitors in the rooms next door every single morning , Staff were very friendly location was good and hotel was clean
469296,Sunotel Club Central, The price for a breakfast is too high You can easily hear what is going on in other rooms The cleaning personel starts at 8 00 am and you assist them cos walls are too thin , Good localization plenty of good bars pubs and restaurants in nearby esp BASQUE PALERMO great paella s nice personel quite clean We ve had a silent room Free of charge bike renting is a big strength but check the bike carefully before route mine had a chain problem Good public transport many bus stops up to 300 m You can go to the Rambla by foot in 15 minutes
469297,Sunotel Club Central, The breakfast it s ok but it could be better You can hear a little too much of what s going on in the next rooms , Friendly stuff good position very clean comfortable bed and pillows
469298,Sunotel Club Central, Very uncomfortable bed Just a single blanket for two people Not sure how good is a breakfast in buffet We were leaving early and asked for a picnic It was much to be improved , Location is nice Just 10 minutes walk from Placa de la Catalunya but a bit away from crowds Lots of good restaurants and bars nearby A bottle of champagne as a welcome gift With respect to the fact that it was one of the cheapest 4 star options I d say that it is a good value for money 
469299,Sunotel Club Central, It is very nosy you can hear everything and it s hard to rest , The location close to city center lots of restaurants and markets around bus stops etc And mostly the bikes we used to see the city 
469300,Sunotel Club Central, When you sleep in the room you can hear everything you can hear people 2 3 rooms away from you upstairs downstairs the walls are like papers so thin hard to believe for the 4 star hotel so be ready to wake up early in the morning The guy on reception who was working on 07 12 2016 in the afternoon one day before we left told us that the taxi to the airport is around 30 euro s and it could be little bit more or less because of the traffic but he said there is nothing to worry about that we should trust the taxi driver because hotel will call the taxi on the end they was no traffic and we payed 42 euro s so the taxi driver charge us much more normally 30 euro s , We liked the stuff reception guys they was really kind friendly and probably the best we ever had before we really feel like at home also cleanliness was perfect they cleaned our room every day and it was perfect clean The location is very good not far away from the center also hotel is in the quiet area 
469301,Sunotel Club Central, Nothing would def reccomend this hotel to anyone and will be returning very soon i hope , Brilliant location within walking distance of all the main areas Staff always friendly always smiling and asking you how your day was Hotel was well presented very clean 
469302,Sunotel Club Central, The breakfast is too expensive for that quality , The staff is really nice and they have a garage under the building It costs extra money but if you have a car it s very important to have a safety spot The jacuzzi is very cool on the roof top But they close it very early 
469303,Sunotel Club Central, small buffet not top up only 1 single waiter to take care of all restaurat witch i found little less and nobody to welcome u in or to show the table or to explain what is on the buffet, the room it was very clean and comfortable
469304,Sunotel Club Central, Unfortunately the location is not all that great It is still good though The thing I did not like was the towels were not available for the outside pool at the time when I was there , The hotel was better than I expected The staff are super nice and helpful They provided me with clear tips and guidance for the area It was definitely a big help Also the room was really clean The bed was comfy too 
469305,Sunotel Club Central, The location is a bit far from the city centre, The staff was very helpful Barcelona is a very beautiful town The hotel is a true 4 stars with a spacious room and comfortable hall
469306,Sunotel Club Central, No power outlet at the bed There is only one free socket in the whole room and one in the bath room Walls are thin so it is a bit noisy, Clean big enough room great neighborhood easy public transport possibilities Metro is 10 minutes bus stations are 2 minutes walk Breakfast is great for the price Free wifi for unlimited devices Free printing service
469307,Sunotel Club Central, No air conditioning despite the rooms being sweltering Too noisy in the night to have windows open as located on a main road Walls are very thin and you can constantly hear other people including every time they go to the bathroom I appreciate it wasn t the most expensive room in the hotel but for 4 you expect tea and coffee making facilities Very disappointed , It was very clean and the wifi was great 
469308,Sunotel Club Central, Can t remember last time i was given a key for a room rather than a card Also told to hand in key whenever we left hotel almost like a parent checking on a teenager Also didn t start well when i asked for a double room and was given twin room In fairness they corrected this fault very quickly after we called Eggs were extremely cold at breakfast Can hear noise from other rooms , An ok hotel Staff at reception were nice enough Room was clean Bed comfy enough 
469309,Sunotel Club Central, Bathrooms drains bit smelly could have done with an extractor fan Four lanes of traffic outside so take earplugs , Very comfy bed Coffee maker and fridge in room very useful Decent buffet breakfast

469311,Sunotel Club Central, The noise you can hear anything from the others rooms during the nights The pillows The smell from the bathroom only sometimes , Great Location The coffee machine in room The staff communication WI FI in room A lot of public transportation around metro and bus 
469312,Sunotel Club Central, Room 604 Unfortunately I didn t feel that I am living in 4 hotel 1 Cosmetic products e g shower cap nail file cotton swabs toothbrush should be in any room during check in It was required to ask it on reception 2 There re no bath robe and slippers in the room 3 Hotel didn t do my wish about normal pillows 50 70cm but existing pillows were rather good 4 Hose in shower was a bit broken 5 Cleaning was not very good sometimes but mostly it s ok 6 Only 5 towels for 2 persons It should be at least 8 towels per standards 7 There s no toilet brush very uncomfortable Also there s no air freshener 8 Walls are very thin Some guests called to reception to say that we are listening music Of course it was but only half of iPhone volume Not loudly than usual talking Strange that walls don t help with such little noise 9 Big gap under the door i could see walking people 10 Very dark room Per standard it should be at least 150 Lux of light but I assume that it was about 30 Lux only 11 Fridge worked very bad it s almost not freezing , Overall experience is rather good Good staff Good WiFi Coffee machine is good but it s required to press 3 4 times to receive half of cup 
469313,Sunotel Club Central, Room to room sound insulation very poor but didn t cause us a problem Management are aware and intend improving it Breakfast wasn t to my liking only had one to try but suited us to have cereal in our room which we d brought with us , Relaxed atmosphere staff obliging Location is reasonable good area metro 4 blocks buses around the corner Fridge in room which we used for milk and soft fruit purchased locally 
469314,Sunotel Club Central, Nothing , For the price this was a good location within a reasonable walking distance of the city centre although there are plenty of restaurants and bars close by Staff were extremely friendly and helpful wifi worked pretty well The room was comfortable well equipped and a reasonable size 
469315,Sunotel Club Central, Not a very nice view out of the back of the hotel onto other apartments Thought it more of a 3 than 4 in the room , The reception staff were very helpful in recommending restaurants Location was fairly accessible to most places Good secure parking 
469316,Sunotel Club Central, Quite basic room and facilities for price paid But staff were friendly Lobby was nicely decorated Cleaners were vacuuming and banging furniture around in the various nearby rooms from very early on in the morning ,No Positive
469317,Sunotel Club Central, Value for money ratio might be better A bit softer mattresses than usual A double bed consisting of two single beds not sticking to each other A bit noisy street at nights , A close walking distance to the city center within 20 mins a local market round the corner a very helpful and friendly staff at the reception a rich breakfast replenished all the time A clean and very well maintained facility with a pool on the roof 
469318,Sunotel Club Central, The surroundings of the hotel don t offer much The hotel although nice and pleasant seemed to me a little overpriced, Nice clean modern and well communicated Staff is excellent

469320,Sunotel Club Central, City view was back of other buildings , Roof top pool Area not so touristy lots of locals milling around in more traditional restaurants Free hotel push bikes brilliant city to cycle around 
469321,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, Great area Great size room with windows that can be opened rooftop pool with jacuzzi views of the neighbourhood Very pleasant helpful staff Carrer de Muntaner has very good places to eat as well as great shops It s not too far to walk to Passeig de Gracia La Rambla if y re that way inclined The metro train underground public transport is a great way to get around on a 10 trip for 9 80 Barcelona is such a great city 
469322,Sunotel Club Central, More of a 3 rather than 4 Coffee in room was not topped up daily we were told the coffee was a gift and therefore would not be topped up , Location Staff were helpfull
469323,Sunotel Club Central, When I made the booking I requested for a double bed room however unfortunately we were given a room with two twin beds put together which is not the most comfortable for a young couple Room service also came around very early in the mornings and whilst we often used the do not disturb sign they made a lot of noise in corridors and sounds coming from the next room along , The location was good Whilst the nearest Metro stops were about 10 15mins walk away it was nice to take time walking around the area The staff in the hotel were all very friendly and very helpful at advice for around Barcelona and how to get around 
469324,Sunotel Club Central, Extremely noisy every night Sounded like someone was breaking the door down one night so didn t get much rest Wifi reception was virtually non existent in our room , It was a basic affordable hotel 
469325,Sunotel Club Central, A more relaxed small Cafe type breakfast facility instead of a major meal at that time of day, Friendly staff and they recognised a friends daughters big birthday with Cava 
469326,Sunotel Club Central, Nothing everything was good no complaints here, Lovely hotel beds very comfortable staff helpful and friendly Breakfast was good value good location and not far from the metro station

469329,Sunotel Club Central, Staff were a bit hit and miss The guy checking us in gave away the fact that my girlfriend had arranged a surprise for the room and had zero care or remorse for spilling the beans The rooms were pretty basic there was only one charging point a long way away from the bed no sofa but plenty of room for it very thin walls as heard next doors alarm 3 days on the trot vibrating for 15 minutes at 7am Couldn t pick up the WiFi on the 5th floor The pool area was shut on the Monday for maintenance , The location of this hotel is great right in the middle of Eixample The pool area is pretty cool and the breakfast options were adequate and plentiful The free bike hire was a nice touch 
469330,Sunotel Club Central, Rooms not sound proof Very off putting when you can hear someone above you jumping up and down like they were doing exercises in the morning Bad luck if you wanted a sleep in , Nice place to stay not to far to walk to areas of interest Staff every helpful and friendly 
469331,Sunotel Club Central, The hotel had a very strong smell like sulphur The air conditioning in the room shuts off when you leave and without circulating air the oder was extremely unpleasant It faded quickly once the AC was on But I could have done without , Great roof top pool And beautiful little neighbourhood 
469332,Sunotel Club Central, The pillows were a bit uncomfortable but sleep able and the fact that there was no kitchenette , Prime location for restaurants bus routes the metro and all types of quick shopping areas Walking distance from prime tour access as well The staff is very friendly and they are well informed and very helpful There was no racism or bias in the area although Spain is also known for it 
469333,Sunotel Club Central, The breakfast was really expensive so we couldn t afford to eat at the hotel , Compared to the price everything was really good and much better than expected It was air condition and a fridge in the room and we loved the rooftop pool A perfect place to stay for students with a small budget 
469334,Sunotel Club Central, Breakfast was basic had to wait ages to get eggs the pool on the roof was very small and around 0 5m deep , Location was ok 15 20mins walk to La Rambla 
469335,Sunotel Club Central, Room furniture was old very old fashioned and lacked personality Bed was small and not very comfortable Bathroom was smelly as there was no ventilation We didn t have breakfast there as it was too expensive for what was offered and not appealing at all Overall the stay was ok but certainly way too expensive for the value offered Definitely not 4 stars , Location swimming pool and helpful staff Room was big and AC and shower were good 
469336,Sunotel Club Central, Woke one morning and there was feces on the floor outside our room and rubbed on the door Staff was very apologetic Offered us free breakfast and provided a bottle of Cava Would have preferred a discount on the room ,No Positive
469337,Sunotel Club Central, You have to leave your keys at reception every time You only get 1 key and we were 2 ppl Old fashioned way no badge system but an old key to open door Very very thin walls You could hear every thing Not enough sockets to charge your phone for example , There were 2 lifts available Air con Internet Location 10 15min walking distance to shops Nespresso coffee machine in room 
469338,Sunotel Club Central, 4 stars rating a bit too high for the accommodation and room features Maybe more of 3 stars , Clean spacious rooms perfectly air conditioned Location very good although slightly away from the beach but close to Sagrada familia area Pool on roof top quite a nice touch 
469339,Sunotel Club Central, Bar wasn t very inviting, Located 10 min walk from the centre of the city Clean tidy very comfortable bed Room was big enough with large ensuite mini bar fridge and nespresso machine for making coffee and tea etc Roof top terrace with small pool and jacuzzi Ideal for a weekend visit with local shops bars and restaurants nearby It s maybe not 4 star in English terms probably 3 but I d use it again because of location price comfort and cleanliness 
469340,Sunotel Club Central, Expensive for the size of the rooms bar was never open Only 1 key offered so had to find a way of keeping the air con on when going up to the pool , This hotel was in a good location The staff were helpful and friendly the pool was lovely and heated The beds were comfy 
469341,Sunotel Club Central, No plug sockets by the bed was a bit annoying but can t really think of anything else , The rooftop pool and hot tub was great there were probably about 20 sun loungers and a few tables by the pool Location of this place is really good too with good bars restaurants and supermarkets within a couple of minutes walk The walk to the gothic quarter is around 20 minutes so you don t need to worry about taxis etc 
469342,Sunotel Club Central, Walls a bit thin as was woken up in the middle of the night by neighboring room had to sleep with the window shut due to traffic sound , the room had a excellent coffee maker and the roof top area was ideal air conditioning was good
469343,Sunotel Club Central, Location of hotel quite far from public transportation Staff should advise us on traveling , The staff at reception are very eager to help and give advice 
469344,Sunotel Club Central, Pool is 1 metre deep so not incredibly refreshing on hot days Reasonable walk to closest metro stop , Access to hotel bikes Non intrusive cleaning staff 
469345,Sunotel Club Central, Internet connection did not work the entire week breakfast not worth the price sound isolation between rooms and to hallway poor a good 3 star hotel but not 4 stars, Good location centrally in Barcelona quiet from street noises rooms clean
469346,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, Great hotel in a near enough location to all the hot spots Only a 5 10 minute walk to Le Ramblas Cleanliness was outstanding staff very helpful Nice to have the option of a dip in the pool too We hired the bikes one day for no extra charge it was a quick option for getting around beautiful Barcelona 
469347,Sunotel Club Central, Beds a little on the firm side , Great Location very nice rooftop terrace with swimming pool and jacuzzi Staff were fantastic throughout Room clean and modern 
469348,Sunotel Club Central, Uncomy bed very loud maids waking us up at 8am no view run down street came back to my room to find one trainer missing asked staff if maids had picked it up with sheets or something in error Was accused of lying asked to have my bags searched and made to look like a criminal at the front desk Offered no compensation and wouldn t take any responsibility I even offered them to keep the other trainer to prove I wasn t lying After kicking up a fuss they phoned the laundry service and half hour later I was told just as I suspected they had the trainer treated so poorly before this I was gobsmacked , Good location Rooftop pool Walking distance to La Rambla
469349,Sunotel Club Central, Staff were like robots but then again the Spanish aren t exactly known for their customer service, The location was incredible and the free wifi wasn t bad not too weak a signal although it doesn t work by the rooftop pool which I might add was bigger than expected 
469350,Sunotel Club Central, This hotel is exceptionally noisey Sound from the corridors transmits into the rooms you can hear the other rooms TVs clearly in your room and conversations etc from other rooms Out of 7 nights we had 1 undisturbed nights sleep Beds are not comfy There is no room service or restaurant other than the breakfast service the local restaurants are not of a good quality All but one of the reception staff we encountered were unhelpful and unfriendly Some renovation work was also occurring during our stay so paint and varnish fumes seeped through the air vents , Breakfast was good
469351,Sunotel Club Central, There are no one off slippers Penthouse closes at 21 00 , Pretty good range of dishes and food at breakfast Also there is a small coffee machine in the room 
469352,Sunotel Club Central, I d like hair conditioner included in toiletries please , Rooftop pool hot tub and sun deck Comfortable sleep Quiet room in back of hotel Tea and coffee making facilities Central location 
469353,Sunotel Club Central, I didn t love the floors it s great to have wooden floors as they are easier to clean but those floors should also stay very clean not dusty , I loved the location and the room was comfortable
469354,Sunotel Club Central, Half of the staff know nothing about customer care We arrived 1 pm one hour before check in time and they didn t make our room ready until 2 30 Additionally we are 2 adults and 2 children 5 years and 7 years The room i booked was for 2 adults only since there wasn t any other rooms availability The receptionist told me it is illegal to have 4 people in room of 2 people I asked him what is the solution for this He told me I m enforced to get an extra bed in the room i told him that i don t want the extra bed then he started lecturing me that he and his hotel administration do not allow this since it is illegal to exceed the maximum number of people per room And the solution to this is to get an extra bed with 38 Euros I looked in the hotel policy but i couldn t see anywhere mentions that it is illegal to exceed the maximum number of people , Location was not bad Half of the staff are good 
469355,Sunotel Club Central, Didn t personally have the breakfast but it seemed a little expensive , Good location possible to reach most places on foot Staff were very friendly Good value for money in a city where accommodation can be expensive 
469356,Sunotel Club Central, Noisy at night from street Shower was hard to get into and I thought dangerous No English tv channels Not near a metro station, Staff were very friendly Breakfast was good Good location with loads of bars and resturants
469357,Sunotel Club Central, The TV was a very strange set up and could not get it to a decent channel and weirdly stayed with a menu down half the page You coukd hear the chairs scrapping from floor above , The room i had was quite large and the beds and linen comfortable It was a 10 minute stroll to the ramblas which was just far enough away Pretty much had thevpool lounge area to myself in mornings if not the whole day 
469358,Sunotel Club Central, Pool was freezing No toilets on roof top and jacuzzi was no where near the temperature it said it was , The roof top sun loungers a nice place to relax central location situated between two metro stations 
469359,Sunotel Club Central, Beds were not comfortable sheets were not soft breakfast was expensive for the options served and most importantly there was a group of people making too much noise at night until 3 4 AM and despite the good intentions of the staff they wouldn t stop Lasted for 3 nights which was not acceptable , Staff is friendly and nice and location is very good
469360,Sunotel Club Central, This property is a little far away from the city centre but if you don t mind the walk then the value for money is there I would have enjoyed a more comfy bed but I m not picking This hotel is fine and very clean Nothing to complain about , This hotel d a large standard total The room was clean and pretty standard The room only had a queen size bed but that was fine for the purpose of my stay The rooftop pool was just perfect with comfortable sum lounges Wifi is available throughout the hotel 
469361,Sunotel Club Central, 5 degrees outside and at 1am the windows suddenly are open because the windows of the room was bad from the beginning i didn t sleep all night taking care of my little baby was a nightmare the people of this place knew and give me this room this people are very negligent and no service culture ,No Positive
469362,Sunotel Club Central, internet connection is awful in this day and age internet shouldn t be this bad bedding was dirty had spots of blood and goodness knows what ever on it pool on the roof is nice however no one supervises the area and there was lots of empty glass bottles and cans of alcohol everywhere especially the hot tub no bedside sockets in fact there is only one 1 free socket to plug your items into which is beside the window i e cant have phone plugged in to charge this socket is used for the provided kettle so you have to unplug this and hope your room mate doesn t want to use things like hair straighteners etc , Location spot on close to train station and 10 15 min walk to ramblas rooftop pool if area was tidy free safe in room 
469363,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, Staff were excellent even left my husband champagne n treats when they found out it was his b day lovely surprise Very helpful room cleaned every day fantastic location We got quiet rooms as asked for two rooms with there own corridor with a locking door Plenty of lovely places to eat a walk away Safe in room free and easy to use 
469364,Sunotel Club Central, I think is a little bit far from the train 10 mins 5 blocks maybe is not too much for others , the staff was very kind Specially the guy named Ricky he was very helpful for directions locations and even good restaurants the room was nice very comfortable bed nice and clean bathroom the locations was great good restaurants arround
469365,Sunotel Club Central, Felt the breakfast was too expensive I only ate a piece of bread and a coffee and payed way too much Even if I asked for a double bed I still got a 2 bed room , Place was ok decent clean and relatively close to main parts maybe 10 15 mins walk There s a restaurant next to hotel where you can eat a good meal on a cheap price 
469366,Sunotel Club Central, VERY VERY VERY POOR SOUNDPROOFING You can hear every move every step of the cleaning ladies and they are moving furniture all morning from 8 or 8 30 in the morning VERY LOUD we were pissed WIFI is bad also , Room was ok small but ok and we are very tall so the bad was also a little bit short Location and neighbourhood are very good and staff is great 
469367,Sunotel Club Central, staff no really helpful I seems that when doing the room the cleaner drop one of my t shirts into the laundry bin Slow response from the staff still waiting for some feedback after a week despite many promises to call me back Area relax wasn t open yet but it was not mentioned anywhere when booking The walls are really thin you could hear people people snoring from the room next to us not really pleasant, only location
469368,Sunotel Club Central, The smell of the room interior was weird Had to open the windows to get fresh air The door key in combination with the card for the light was inconvenient , The location was perfect for our purpose Also the free bike rental was a big big plus The restaurant recommendations from staff were good 
469369,Sunotel Club Central,No Negative, Hotel is placed in a calm district but still very close to all the atractions You could walk everywhere actually The room was very clean Bed sheets were changed every 2 nights we stayed for 4 nights Nice roof terrace with pool jacuzzi and nice view

469371,Sunotel Club Central, Position too far from the metro it s 10 minutes walking But there are buses and taxis are cheap Quality of the food at breakfast not worth 15 euros , Room big enough clean people at the reception polite and helpful 
469372,Sunotel Club Central, We can not remark anything negative Probably it would be better a wider choice in the breakfast but it was anyway very good , Great hotel clean and everything perfectly worked and really nice staff all of them We felt like home at this hotel and especially receptionist Ricky was really helpful and welcoming with the tips for sightseeing restaurants and everything you need to know This is absolutely to be remarked 
469373,Sunotel Club Central, Our fridge wasn t cold we had not enough pressure one morning to shower The room tended to be on the warm side , The location was great the staff were very helpful and fluent in English which was helpful The place was clean 
469374,Sunotel Club Central, Staff not friendly Room was not clean when we checked in They gave us another and when i open the door the first thing i saw was a cockroach i requested a 2 beds room and was given a double bed one , Breakfast Location
469375,Sunotel Club Central, the room of hotel was very tight for 3 persons to stay in it and toilet door has no lock inside it, first of all i want the thank Mr Masahiro Shindo front desk manager for his welcoming and for his help he is really good receptionist second the hotel location was very good close to Catalonia square and shopping centers
469376,Sunotel Club Central, We did ask for a double bed and were given twins maybe ask and don t presume the two guys are just friends , Comfy clean good location friendly staff great facilities
469377,Sunotel Club Central, wi fi connection everywhere except for the lobby is awful in room service stops after 9 30 pm , not far away from the Universitat metro station located in a good upper middle class neighborhood modern and clean building
469378,Sunotel Club Central, Well we thought really there was a Solarium And the price of the Breakfast is a bit expensive so we went out to one of the many options to have breakfast Sadly some Cockroaches appeared on the bath which was not so nice But the room was very clean overall , The Jaccuzi was really nice and the global service was also good The Location of the Hotel was nice since we were near the Metro or the University You can reach everything by walk 
469379,Sunotel Club Central, The bed was too short , Nice position in within walking distance to the city centre placa de Catalunya and Sagrada familia It was very useful to have bicycle available to go around the city 
469380,Sunotel Club Central, The cleaning ladies came without knocking the door a few times or we didn t listen the knocks but our fault we forgot to put the no disturb sign , Beautiful hotel and room and the staff was really cool They gave us a twin room but the next day they changed to double room under our request

469387,Sunotel Club Central, Very basic and dark room No frills whatsoever in this hotel Tired and dated except in public areas Does not deserve rating Have stayed in Barcelona many times and this is the most disappointing hotel I have found there , Location good
469388,Sunotel Club Central, The rooms and corridors were not kept really clean The bed sheets were not changed daily and when we enquirer at reception we were told sheets are changed every second day which is unacceptable for a 4 star hotel The dirty glasses in the room were not replaced with new ones after room servicing Even when we requested through reception to inform housekeeping to replace dirty glasses with new ones during servicing of the room The pictures of the hotel on the website were slightly different from the actual facility The hotel is situated far from the nearest Metro and bus station The hotel insisted on payment as we checked in which is not the usual practice for hotels , I did not like anything about the hotel
