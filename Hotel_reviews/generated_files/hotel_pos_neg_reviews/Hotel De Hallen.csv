284512,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, Lovely hotel quirky and interesting great location really nice breakfast and bonus of a fab food hall just next door hotel bed rooms quiet bed very big and very comfy 
284513,Hotel De Hallen, I knew about this in advance and it was fine for me as I wasn t intending to spend much time relaxing in the room but some people might not like the fact there was no external window The window was onto the foyer which meant keeping the curtains shut for privacy There are sofas in the central lobby though so you could sit and read there as an alternative I ate in the restaurant once and I have to say the food wasn t all that impressive , The huge bath and walk in shower were fab Nespresso machine in the room was very welcome and the bed was extremely comfortable The location as part of the De Hallen development was a huge plus It was great having the food market next door and as a solo traveller it was the perfect place to go in the evenings 
284514,Hotel De Hallen, Had to discuss twice with the staff whether the breakfast was included on the room rate I ve booked Apparently something was missing in their system , Nice new hotel with perfect location and comfortable rooms Great breakfast 
284515,Hotel De Hallen, Unfortunately the hotel does not have parking so you need to park your car in the parking garage additional 27 euros per day I do think the hotel is a little overpriced Staff was OK didn t really pay much attention to the guests , The property is very nice Great neighborhood Bed was very conferrable and the rooms exceptionally clean 
284516,Hotel De Hallen, Room quite small even a deluxe not a lot of privacy in the bathroom area everything is pretty much open plan although there is a door on the toilet My only criticism of an otherwise great hotel perhaps this has more to do with my English sensibilities prudishness , Location is very good decor and design of the hotel is beautiful very quirky very Amsterdam Good location if you want to be just a little out of chaos of central Amsterdam very easy to jump on a tram and travel anywhere from this location 
284517,Hotel De Hallen, Unfortunately the cost for adding on breakfast was very expensive almost 30 euros and not quite worth the cost Additionally we were completely unaware there would be a city tax of approx 30 when we arrived Also the room faced inwards a nice idea but meant curtains were closed most of the time and therefore no natural light at all in the room We can t complain as the room was lovely but it wasn t clear online that this would be the case , The hotel was really clean and modern in a brilliant location couldn t have asked for a better spot The staff were friendly and attentive 
284518,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, Staff were friendly and helpful Great tips regarding places to visit and eat great Indonesian restaurant close by Walking distant to Museums and city centre via some lovely canals Food hall next door was worth the visit 
284519,Hotel De Hallen, Wifi in room 125 was patchy at best when connected I d avoid this room if possible it s a courtyard view twin it s right opposite the cleaning store and not the best for when you want a lie in , The location is perfect decor is really interesting and there s lots of comfy seating in a common area 
284520,Hotel De Hallen, Nothing to add here my one night stay could not have been better , The bed was extremely comfortable Nespresso pods and machine in the room a welcome edition Both a walk in waterfall shower and a bath available The room was fairly quiet especially after 9 30pm which made for a great night sleep The hotel decor is on point with a wide variety of indoor plants and seating areas The Food Hallen next door is the cherry on top 
284521,Hotel De Hallen, Hotel staff were a bit uptight and they also took 50 from my card by accident Didn t apologise and said it would be a month before I would be refunded , The decor was super cool 
284522,Hotel De Hallen, There were no windows in any of the hotel rooms at all There was air con but I feel that some people would not book if they knew this up front It may have made me change my mind before we stayed but it was ok to be fair I also had a query on my bill which I emailed the hotel about They sent a copy through to me but on a further query regarding 2 items charged to our room I have heard nothing It seems it is not up for discussion Service was extremely slow for breakfast and waiter service outside to the point that we had to leave without our drinks arriving before we headed out Hence I feel this was one of our extra charges to our room even though we did not receive them and could not find a waiter to cancel the order , The hotel d cor was great rooms very clean great location Loved the outside area
284523,Hotel De Hallen, A long walk to the city centre but it is scenic if you re up for the walk , The hotel was easily accessible to tram routes which take you directly to the city centre Staff was very friendly and helpful Lots of food options and small shops nearby The beds were so soft and comfortable Would definitely recommend and stay again 
284524,Hotel De Hallen, Coffee machine was broken when we arrived it was fixed the next day but we did have to ask twice Very minor complaint though , Food Hallen is in the same building serving some fantastic street food and the breakfast club is just over the road so there should be enough food choice to satisfy anyone Far enough from the centre to be very quiet but only a 20 minute walk back into the middle of all the shops and bars Amsterdam has to offer Our room had huge windows on three sides and staff were friendly and helpful It is also a short walk to the Vondelpark which is lovely for a stroll and a drink in the cafe 
284525,Hotel De Hallen, Our room had no window and hence the air con needed to be on permanently not ideal for sleeping , Good fresh food promptly served The waitress remembered that I was wheat free We especially enjoyed the wine here Lovely bathroom too 
284526,Hotel De Hallen, A bit far from the city center and touristic sites and enforces you to long walks or riding trams but reasonable price comparing to other hotels in Amsterdam , Nice room Good air conditioning system Danielle the receptionist was very welcoming and made her best to make us feel good and recommend sites and activities Nice restaurant for evening dinner Nice and very welcoming restaurant staff A daily market in a street near by The public areas at the hotel are very uniquely and beautifully decorated An impressive preserved newly refurbished building the vicinity to the De Hallen food market is a great bonus 
284527,Hotel De Hallen, Windows face centre of building so if curtains are open leave you exposed to outside As I did not spend too much time in my room this didn t really bother me You can choose a room upstairs towards the end for more privacy Room a bit compact , decor definitely different trendy hip etc Conversion done very well in contemporary style in contrast to lobby Room like photo Open feel of single lobby with vintage decorations Arrived early and unable to check in They stored my bags and put them in my room Staff helpful and kind Got a free coffee Drinking Water cooler at reception a thoughtful touch Hotel is only a storey high but there is a lift for those with sore feet or heavy lugagge Room done to a high standard Door has an alarm if not locked behind you which is a huge bonus for safety TV with some English channels Nespresso machine in room is handy At least 3 variety of pods provided probably not enough for two people but you can request more Also nice teas green and English breakfast provided Loved the bathroom with both bath tub and shower Nice toiletries Breakfast was tempting as both buffet and a la carte available not taken up as wanted to have a lie in and not rush for10 30 limit There is a cafe and restaurant at hotel In a more residential area Hence more quiet but further from centre Trams nearby You can also walk to central areas within 20 30 mins depending on your route and speed 
284528,Hotel De Hallen, nothing, fun creative decor helpful staff great restaurant and food hall in the larger Hallen structure area was lively but not too touristy museums and a few nice parks in walking distance
284529,Hotel De Hallen, Bit expensive for 2 nights, The location was brilliant loved being beside the food hallen No need to go round searching for decent restaurant when there are lots of tasty places to eat right beside the hotel Easy to get in and out of city Staff were very helpful and friendly
284530,Hotel De Hallen, No issues we picked an inside facing room which I thought meant facing a courtyard but it was facing the inside of the building corridor hallway no issue just surprised loved the place picked inside facing to save money , Not your standard hotel built in an old historic tramcar maintenance building very old very cool room and layout adjacent to Foodhallen and Filmhallen very good tram access via 13 and 17 trams 
284531,Hotel De Hallen, We upgraded from the bookings com room to a junior suite because the booked double room by bookings com had windows facing an empty passage This was not a great view to the outside Can recommend the hotel with confidence , Great service from the front desk a quirky character in the hotel Exceptional look and feel Not much not to like in this great hotel 
284532,Hotel De Hallen, N A, WOW What to say I loved everything This place was much much more cool than I expected It s decoration was quirky unique chic and trendy You can t stop exploring even though it s not even that big of a building The staff was fantastic they upgraded me because the room wasn t ready so I was very grateful The hotel itself is quiet and comfortable more than you d think The room was sooo comfy and very clean And the location TAKE ME BACK TO FOOD DE HALLEN which is connected to the hotel The neighborhood is the best and super trendy safe I paid twice the amount for a luxury hotel in Dam Square the night before and this was much more enjoyable comfy and for half the price per night I enjoyed being away from so many tourists all the while being treated greatly as one if anyone noticed haha Please do yourself the favor of experiencing this place and the location if you visit beautiful Amsterdam 
284533,Hotel De Hallen, Nothing i didn t like , The bed was really comfortable staff were so friendly great facilities loved having a bar and terrace just downstairs really good value for the price 
284534,Hotel De Hallen, The breakfast selection is a bit limited Some rooms are a bit small in space , Lovely hotel with a boutique vibe a bit of the beaten path Awesomely designed rooms staff is friendly and always helpful 
284535,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, Quirky conversion to a hotel that has been well done room was clean a reasonable size quiet A very generous sized shower Location is in a nice vibrant pert of town with great food choices in the Foodhallen next door Easy tram access in to the town centre and the walk in is very nice too 
284536,Hotel De Hallen, Small things were overlooked Complimentary items were missing breakfast is good if you get there early otherwise they run out of things and cooked food is a bit stewed Nearly got hit in the face by the two way kitchen door that opens onto the walkway that has no warning signs, The area was nice the hotel was to a high standard in terms of furnishings and style It is very close to Food Hallen which is well worth a visit
284537,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, It is located in a quite neighborhood with two tram stops close by Walking distance to the Museum Quarter and Nine Street shopping district Good location and good service Breakfast is good as well 
284538,Hotel De Hallen, Breakfast was average They never informed us we could order ala carte we had to figure this out ourself and missed one morning as a consequence The waffle was very good though The worst part though was the fact that they charged me when I booked even though it was stated very clearly that I shouldn t have to pay until I got there Getting the hotel to reimburse the money was a hassle and they were not easy to work with However I did get free breakfast as compensation Also when you make your booking email the hotel and try to get a room with a window with daylight Half the rooms don t have any natural light and a quite dark as a consequese I booked a more expensive room thinking I d get a window with daylight and I didn t and ended up switching rooms , Even though out of the central distrcit the location was nice It s a 2 5k or 25 minute walk to downtown But it s a nice walk The decor is cute 
284539,Hotel De Hallen, Breakfast was a bit too expensive what was served , Staff very nice The room was very comfortable the bed was great The building itself was great too 
284540,Hotel De Hallen, For this price you d expect actual windows not just a window out to the hall If you like to sleep with windows open or like fresh air book elsewhere The room is rather small but we were informed we were upgraded to a superior room with a larger bathroom due to our category being fully booked The bathroom was indeed rather large boasting a shower and a bath which I find unnecessary on a short trip I d gladly have exchanged the tub for a proper window We didn t opt for the breakfast as you can easily get something excellent for less money on your walk into town , The area around the hotel is quite hip there is an indoor food market right next door plenty of caf s and some nice restaurants within short walking distance The design of the hotel overall is quite nice the rooms are furnished nicely Everything was clean and seemed quite new 
284541,Hotel De Hallen, On arrival at the Hotel the receptionists were unwilling to proceed with check in unless we produced the credit card the trip was booked with I booked 6 months previous and since changed my credit card so could not do so After 20 minutes of arguing and some instruction from a boss we were eventually allowed to check in Not a great start but thankfully things improved from there Hotel seemed slightly further out from the City than we anticipated however once we had mastered the tram system this was not a problem It was approx 45 60 minute walk from Central Station we learned the hard way although we seen plenty of the City along the way , Most of the staff went out of the way to be helpful The building is also attached to the Foodhallen which is a wonderful foodcourt with dishes from all over the world there is also a daily market at Ten Katestraat which is also the name of the nearest Tram stop From Ten Katestraat Tram 17 runs to Central Station from which everywhere else in the City can be accessed and Tram 7 runs to Leidseplein Square which is full of bars and restaurants Then from Leidseplein and you can also get Tram 16 to Rembrandtplein which is lovely Far enough out from the mayhem and has a more relaxed vibe The tram system seems to be the best way to move around the city fast safe 
284542,Hotel De Hallen, The bed was soft as if it was a decade old The room is nice but not sound proof so sound from the lobby enters the room it s basically a glorified motel Check out person was overworked because of badly designed system , Excellent location The staff very friendly 
284543,Hotel De Hallen, My mum said the coffee wasn t great It was a nespresso machine and only did espresso but she usually drinks lattes and they were too strong for her , The hotel was beautiful Very quirky And the staff were very friendly and helpful 
284544,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, Location is amazing in a really cool neighborhood yet still close enough to all the attractions and good public transport links We LOVED the Food Hallen next door it s such a great place to have lunch or dinner and drinks in the evening Very cool spot highly recommend
284545,Hotel De Hallen, Awful service at the restaurant Don t bother go next door to the Food Hallen , The bed was comfortable location great rooms good size walking distance to plenty public transport 
284546,Hotel De Hallen, Leaving early for the plane home, The hotel own a food hall next door Is amazing and different We ate dinner there Lovely tasty food 20 ish stalls to choose from It has a round bar and live music The hotels restaurant is lovely and intimate too 
284547,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, Very quirky lovely staff gorgeous food and extremely comfy All whilst being quite spacious especially for Amsterdam efficient and fairly centrally located I will definitely be using this hotel for Amsterdam trips going forward 
284548,Hotel De Hallen, The Junior suite that we stayed in had a number of paint chips on the walls It made things look pretty tacky and was not a sign of quality The beds were tidied and not made on the three nights that we stayed The tea and coffee items were not replaced at all which meant when we wanted a drink there was nothing to have The toilet was in a cupboard i m aware that it was in a historical building The doors did not close properly and did not offer privacy There was no air system There should have been some comfortable addition to the flooring in the bathroom bar the concrete No mention was made when we booked on the ongoing work outside Generally the room was not comfy and was a little austere , The staff were friendly and helpful It was my birthday and kindly a bottle of wine was provided 
284549,Hotel De Hallen, Not much we didn t like we had a courtyard view room on the ground floor i e a standard room so we had no window to open at night I don t think rooms with a street view have opening windows either the building is a converted tram depot so originally industrial in design Lovely conversation job so work still on going in Feb 2017 but it never started until after 9 30am so no problem Never eat at the hotel so nothing to report , Really close to the no 17 tram into central station 20min journey and no 7 up to the museum district 10mins journey The Food De Hellen is a great place to have next door and loads of nice cafes around the area for breakfast 
284550,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, great style very handy on tram to center and very easy from airport on public transport Dinner was good and good places to eat nearby Very good beds and nespresso machine in room 
284551,Hotel De Hallen, Bed was far too soft I appreciate it s not possible to accommodate everyone here but my back was not in a good place after a couple of nights so if you suffer too I recommend asking if they have any rooms with firmer mattresses , Pretty much everything The hotel is fun and individual certainly different from standard chain hotels It s new clean well maintained and the staff are friendly and helpful The location is also great not being in the hectic old town but still within walking distance of most of the city s best attractions and next door to an amazing food hall Very much recommend a stay here 
284552,Hotel De Hallen, Building works going on Guests were provided with ear plugs but I think a little extra than that should be provided for being disturbed whilst on a holiday Wine and olives that were left beside the kettle were charged as mini bar items It costs 30 in a taxi to get to this hotel from Central Station 20 extra for breakfast is way too steep The front desk booked a taxi for us VIP taxis and the company turned out to be very expensive 36 for what was promised to be a 25 30 maximum journey Advise them to book you a regular cab whilst you are staying there , The room was spacious and bed was cosy Staff very friendly and helpful Fab shower and lots of beautiful mood lighting options The hotel was fascinating Very well designed paying attention to its previous uses Lots to look at lovely restaurant 
284553,Hotel De Hallen, Not necessary a bad thing but would be great to have a direct connection to the food area in the Foodhallen , Great design and awesome location
284554,Hotel De Hallen, Not my first stay at this hotel This time I was really disappointed and did not enjoy the stay 1 There are construction works at the hotel which start 9 30 in the morning 2 Cleaning in the rooms It was not nice to find the white pillow lying on the floor and the top of the garbage box over my clothes I put the do not disturb sign to avoid anything similar the next day 3 Brought my dress to the reception desk Thursday evening Monday morning found out that it has not been sent to the laundry yet Hopefully the lady from the reception working that day tried her best to speed up the process Anyway I could not wear it for the business dinner as it was planned 4 Problem with booking We agreed before my arrival with the booking team about the details of my stay but receptionist did not have a clew and there were any marks in the system and I had to pay for my last night 20 euros more that it was planned in advance , 1 Good location 2 Design of the hotel and rooms 3 Nespresso coffee machine in the room 4 Possibility to rent a bike 5 Nice area around 6 Good breakfast and friendly staff at restaurant area 
284555,Hotel De Hallen, The room is without window impossible to know the weather outside and day night The double bed is combined with two single bed impossible to sleep with your partner the room is seperated with outside by a glass wall you can hear everything outside also means people outside can hear everything inside lack of privacy for couples The staff is not so friendly they seldom greet customer even you walk in just in front of them they didnt give any advices or information about the hotel and nearby We found there are plenty of nice resturants and a food court just next to the hotel on the last day , There are plenty of resturant just next to the hotel The bed liners are good quality The location is in the local neibourghood
284556,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, one of the most comfortable bed i ve ever slept in very cool reception areas and great local area ate and drank with mostly locals for 2 of the 3 nights
284557,Hotel De Hallen, There were nibbles and wine in the room which as they were not in the minibar we thought were complimentary they were not We were charged for them at checkout which is understandable but this needs to be made much clearer , Great room layout very comfortable bed welcoming staff great design and decor throughout whole hotel interesting art pieces 
284558,Hotel De Hallen, The room was so cosy but you need to be careful when you use the shower room The water can be flow outside Just the deposit system was not good still I am confused Mine was payed both cash and credit card Needed to be canceled, Really close to The Food Hallen So you do not need to consider where to eat Sure in the hotel the restaurant bar and lounge hall were great it is worth to visit The staffs were so kind Even I do not want to go out when I enter the hotel 
284559,Hotel De Hallen, Hotel s location was really good but quite hard to find initially It s not obvious that it is a hotel , The bed was really comfy and the toilet bathroom was nice and clean Staff really helpful and friendly interior of the hotel was modern and trendy 
284560,Hotel De Hallen, Approx 30 minute walk from the train station centre of Amsterdam No milk provided or offered with drink making facilities Trendy but cold in terms of environment and vibe Overall overpriced for the facilities and experience offered The hotel charged more than the fee agreed when booked through Booking com this is something I now have to resolve with the companies , The food in the restaurant was very good Staff were helpful and polite Very comfortable beds Good shower 
284561,Hotel De Hallen, The only thing I didnt like was that the room didn t have a window , The hotel is beautiful very clean very modern amazing art and a great vibe We really liked the location right next to the food de hallen and only about a 20 min walk into the main centre We really enjoyed our stay here 
284562,Hotel De Hallen, The staffs could be more knowledgeable about the area Found they were able to answer simple questions but not able to provide much advice like a concierge typically could , The room s design and I liked everything was there but in a compact way The design of the hotel is really nice and also a great location beside the Foodhallen where there are lots of different food available There is also a nice fruit veg market stands nearby 
284563,Hotel De Hallen, We had no bottle of water on our room but the barkeeper gave us one for free so not a big deal We had no proper door just a folding door to the toilette which was ok in general but the toilette made a quite loud noise during the whole night which was a bit annoying But these were just very small things which wouldn t stop me to fully recommend this hotel , The style and design of the hotel is spectacular nice The rooms are nicely made as well 
284564,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, Old tram depot which makes it an interesting building definitely non standard Some rooms including mine overlook what is called the inner courtyard or the central part of the depot i e no windows looking outside which takes a bit of getting used to Very nice restaurant bar and breakfast 15 euro Convenient for public transport 
284565,Hotel De Hallen, A bit more storage space would have been great , Exceptional customer service Personalised hand written notes from the team on several occasions were a great touch to a wonderful stay Well done to the team for their passion and commitment to quality service Large comfortable bed with matching pillows Great amenities too Close to public transport providing quick access to Dam Square and other popular destinations Various restaurants grocery stores and fresh food market surround the hotel as does the Foodhallen which is an awesome buzzing and delicious food hall with a great variety of local and international cuisine You couldn t ask for more 
284566,Hotel De Hallen, In our check out we were charged a city tourist tax 5 euros per night and we had no idea for this Also I found the breakfast 19euros p p a bit expensive although this is what most hotels charge The room wasn t very clean and in one occasion it hadn t been cleaned until 5 p m Besides our room was in the ground floor and it was noisy some nights because of the people in the hotel s restaurant Finally some of the staff members could be more kind not all some of them were fantastic , Good location walking distance from anywhere you would like to go in Amsterdam very modern hotel like an art gallery with a nice bar and restaurant and an amazing street food market bar cafe next to it Mattress perfect room quite spacious breakfast very good Ideal for young couples friends
284567,Hotel De Hallen, Not being able to see out have sunlight or know what the weather is like No window , Hotel went to effort to supply soft mattress as I had hurt my back Thank you Staff very helpful Food good Clean Would be nice to have window external view from room though Converted warehouse very clever with eclectic design theme 
284568,Hotel De Hallen, Mini Bar mistakes white wine bottle was already open at arrival no nuts and olives first day but I ve got them on the bill luckily I do always check bills Restaurant mistake the wine bottle I wanted was no longer available I took another one on the bill I found both luckily I do always check bills , Comfort Very good restaurant Restaurant Remise 47 Location Food Hallen great 
284569,Hotel De Hallen, Room was too hot air conditioning temp only went down to 18 and no windows to open, Rooms were lovely and staff great Breakfast was great lots of choice and very tasty Great building decor 
284570,Hotel De Hallen, could use more towel rails , Staff was very friendly and helpful The room was very nice a little dim and the bath tub has exceptional water pressure and drains fast too It s not in the city center but we liked it that way and it s super easy to take the tram to most tourist sites Food Hallen and the Breakfast club are just next to the hotel 
284571,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, The hotel is located in the building of a former tram depot smartly renovated with some very nice interiors Downtown is very easily accessible by tram and also by foot if you enjoy a little walk 
284572,Hotel De Hallen, The approach is through a construction zone Not the fault of the hotel and that will soon be finished and the area will be a very good one with lots of new apartments , The hotel is built inside an old tram depot and is a very good use of an old building We walked from the hotel to Van Gogh Museum Rijksmuseum etc one way and to Anne Frank House and the Royal Palace the other way We are in our sixties so younger people could walk everywhere if they wanted to Very quiet Loved the coffee machine in the room The food hall behind the hotel was very popular with younger people All staff were very helpful and went out of their way to offer assistance when needed Free wifi which worked well 
284573,Hotel De Hallen, 1 In spite of previous ratings the hotel is located rather far away from all sites 2 Taking a shower is risky water is flooding the room 3 The blankets are made of cheap stuff very uncomfortable 4 Sheets towels etc have not been changed unless specifically requested , The street market outside is nice and lively Helpful staff Espresso machine in the room 
284574,Hotel De Hallen, Bathroom layout was a little odd not a ton of room for the bathroom sink for ladies doing hair and make up but that is not enough to affect our review , The Hotel was super cool While it was hard to find the front door due to construction the inside of the hotel is awesome They upgraded our room and gave us a bottle of wine with a note to congratulate us on our anniversary Touches like that are so valuable We really enjoyed the food court we were there on a weekend not sure if it s the same during the week and ate there twice There was a market right outside with fresh food baked goods and more during one day of our stay Great coffee amenities in the room Right next to the tram so the location is perfect We walked everywhere though It was a short 20 min walk to Anne Frank House We would absolutely stay here again 
284575,Hotel De Hallen, The fact that De Hallen was overbooked The cleanliness of Vondelhotel The noise at night and in the morning The suite smelled very damp and stuffy old and old fashioned airco Not a lot of bathroom amenities Very poor TV signal The chair at the desk was very uncomfortable and too low compared to the height of the desk , The spaciousness of a suite as an upgrade The bath tub and bathroom
284576,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, Set in a renovated tram depot this hotel is one of a kind The location the Old West neighborhood is also fantastic with Foodhallen right next door and a short walk to multiple tram stops Would happily stay here again 
284577,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, The interior of the hotel is absolutely great Very clean spacious room with very comfortable bed and big bathroom Well located close to the Museumplein and within walking distance from the city center Highly recommended to everyone 
284578,Hotel De Hallen, Not very close to the city center to walk Rooms are isolated from outside noises but sometimes noises from inside can be hear until 00 00 Also there is no window that can be opened to the outside , Rooms are clean and comfortable hotel design was perfect also very close to FoodHallen and filmhallen Internet was excellent Staff were friendly Tram station is 2 minutes away with walking 
284579,Hotel De Hallen, We were surprised that the hotel did not provide food after hours perhaps consider a simple light bite in room menu but they recommended a takeaway shop and arranged delivery for us , Beautiful renovated building with trendy and quirky interior in a quiet location yet within easy access of main attractions The UK plug socket came in handy as I had forgotten my adapter The staff were friendly professional and very efficient Our suite was very quiet and the beds 2 singles pushed together very comfortable The hotel is next door to a fantastic food hall which serves almost every type of food you can imagine on the Thursday evening it was transformed into a large sophisticated drinking venue and had an amazing vibe 
284580,Hotel De Hallen, The construction for the new development however it will be great in the future , Great that it was also adjoining the fantastic DeHallen Food Court and around the corner from outdoor markets ATM close by Transportation to City Center close I looked for something unusual and unique and this was right on point 
284581,Hotel De Hallen, There is still ongoing building work around the property which is inconvenient although there was no noise, Beautiful boutique hotel with excellent staff and creative relaxing eclectic decoration I visit Amsterdam on a regular basis and this is the best hotel I have found The new development around the hotel is a fascinating and tasteful renovation of an old tram depot The city center is a pleasant 20 minute walk
284582,Hotel De Hallen, Parking closed and not being informed properly in advance, Location close to congress center friendly staff fine atmosphere room upgrade and special present 
284583,Hotel De Hallen, a bit strange to not have a window the fully transparent wall next to the door there was a heavy curtain though, fantastic bed and bathtub great location gorgeous design
284584,Hotel De Hallen, The entrance somewhat hidden The area with a construction I know this is temporary No indications on how to reach the hotel from the public parking lot underneath , The way the space is set up design The quality of the foods served at breakfast The pleasant and lively lobby nice space to rest up or read ort work 
284585,Hotel De Hallen, A bit of a building site in the roads around but hopefully will soon be finished , Great lounge area and bar to relax in It s an old Tram Depot so full of character 
284586,Hotel De Hallen, The room was very noisy since it was close to the reception and restaurant and the window leads to a corridor So you feel a bit cooped up , The hotel is nice well decorated and the staff is great 
284587,Hotel De Hallen, All awesome Nothing not to like , Beautiful building and interiors The room was a superb quality and design also and very comfortable beds Lovely helpful staff and an excellent breakfast It s right next to the de hallen food market too which is again brilliant with great little shops food and drinks I would come back every weekend if I could Such a great hotel and area to chill out in And it s very easy to walk anywhere from 
284588,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, the place is in a good location one tram line and 10 minutes from the old town the room is clean and warm and the bed is comfortable and cozy the decoration is trendy and very beautiful We loved it the proximity of the hotel to the food court is priceless breakfast was good come early if you want to have it all fresh the staff was amazing always smiling and helpful and have the patience to answer any question at any given time definitely going to come back to De Hallen again in our next visit to Amsterdam 
284589,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, The bed was extremely comfortable The staff was very friendly they made you feel welcome right when you walk in Breakfast was very good enough choice Parking available underneath the hotel 
284590,Hotel De Hallen, There is no window in the room , The hotel is decorated in an interesting manner Good location near food hallen and 15 min walk to meseum plein Great personal friendly and helpful 
284591,Hotel De Hallen, Staff at reception was uninviting We arrived too early 12noon room wasnt ready Receptionist Steph was in bad mood maybe and she was not concerned at all Told us to come back took our bags and ignored us after No smile no hello how was ur trip It was off putting The other girl next day paid more attention and had excellent approach This one girl made very bad impression The other con is that bicycle rent is so expensive 17 50 euro per day there is local shop next to hotel that rents for 10euro Hotel should make more effort to lower price We stayed in Hoxton before and bikes were free Also l find it rude when staff chatt to eachother in dutch when client is in front of them Girls were making arrangements and us and group of other people were english speakers Pointing at client and saying things in dutch comes across as quite rude Thats just few observations , The hotel is very cool Interesting decor with modern art and made com seats Rooms are spacious and comfortable Bed was amazing Location is good not very central though Quick ride on tram or bike though So no problem Breakfast was delicious and fresh 
284592,Hotel De Hallen, Breakfast is really not worth 19 Euro Given the amount of options and type of option presented I expect something more for 19 Euros, We loved how the hotel is right next to food market amazing Close to everything the transportation is also quite easy Love everything about it 
284593,Hotel De Hallen, Just a bit out of town 20 min walk to the centre No external windows in my room Room bit on the small size, Great Cocktails Lovely large comfy bed Very friendly helpful staff Lots of different seating areas Quirky different to a boring hotel Immaculately clean
284594,Hotel De Hallen, The hotel is very trendy but our room others does not have an external window, The friendliness of the staff the welcoming when we first arrived the access to public transport to get to Amsterdam central

284596,Hotel De Hallen, I have booked a double bed room but they only had a room with 2 single bed It s not good for us with a 2 year old kid They proposed we could change to a suit room and would be charged 20 euro per night , Very clean Good location 
284597,Hotel De Hallen, Our room was on the small side , Stunning interior public space decorated with very interesting and diverse objects Quiet location but only a short walk to local cafes

284599,Hotel De Hallen, 1 There is no view The even numbered rooms have no window the odd numbered rooms look onto building construction which I expect can be noisy on week days 2 It is farther from the centre of Amsterdam than we had anticipated , The hotel itself is an unusual high tech renovation Rooms are lovely and well appointed Staff is fantastic Had a nice dinner at the hotel 
284600,Hotel De Hallen, Card was debited 3 times Once when I booked with Booking com Once when I checked in by clerk Once when I checked out Despite showing them bank notification of the 2 previous reservations off my card they still said I needed to pay upon checkout and that the two other amounts were hold amounts Now I have to wait a week to see if they are released Less than ideal, Great space Great people Cool location Great food 
284601,Hotel De Hallen, My only criticism is that there was no milk in the room for my tea However they were quick to provide me with what can only be described as too much milk from the bar Wonderful , In a word Perfect I am a regular traveller for work and pleasure so rest assured it is no small thing for me to say this is the best hotel I have stayed in for quite some time An utter pleasure to stay here Wonderful location close to the trendy Jordaan district my favourite area of Amsterdam walkable into the centre and all the sights Car park underneath the hotel very easy The hotel itself is unique Located in a converted Tram Depot it is on the pleasant side of hipstery and feels homely Lovely bar and lots of seating areas You could happily stay in the hotel to relax drink do work or chat Rooms are big and well fitted out with all you need for a long or short stay They even have UK plug sockets in the rooms very handy And it must be said the best hotel staff I ve seen in years Overall a warm and homely place for you to enjoy Amsterdam from and exceptionally good value for money I will be staying here whenever I pass through Amsterdam again that is certain 
284602,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, Very comfortable hotel with great staff and nearby facilities for dining movies shops and access to city centre We were very happy with our five night stay Top marks 
284603,Hotel De Hallen, A young lady who was in room 104 managed to unlock our door room 108 as we were still inside Very worrying and really not happy that she managed to do this , the bed was comfortable the stafe were friendly
284604,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, Hotel has great ambiance The staff are wonderfully helpful and pleasant The atmosphere is relaxed The beds pillows are very comfortable The bathroom and shower are great The adjoining food hall is an excellent asset 
284605,Hotel De Hallen, Air conditioning was a little warm considering summer temperatures , What a little gem Its location is excellent in a trendy neighbourhood with good transport links to the main tourist areas The hotel is literally right next to a very hipster food hall small independent boutiques and possibly one of the coolest cinemas ever The decor is stylish and quirky and the rooms are clean and comfortable Definitely our top choice for an Amsterdam break 
284606,Hotel De Hallen, The only window large opened up to the communal area so you did in effect need to keep the curtains drawn at all times if you wanted privacy, The hotel was in a very interesting location and the room very nice Location good too 
284607,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, The staff were all very friendly and helpful especially with directions The room was extremely quiet The area is excellent for local eating places
284608,Hotel De Hallen, Lack of window Rather poor Housekeeping dirty mugs not removed or replaced hairdryer not put away No toilet roll in lobby toilets on first night Broken bike stand on bike, Decor
284609,Hotel De Hallen, As you may be able to tell there was nothing I disliked about this hotel and we already have plans to stay again , All the staff were super friendly super polite and super helpful The room was stunning Not just functional but beautifully laid out and spacious and made the most of the building s previous incarnation as a tram depot Despite being in a room directly above the bar because of the excellent sound proofing we didn t hear anything and consequently slept very well all the 3 nights we were there The air conditioning was perfect too keeping us nice and cool despite the humid weather outside The d cor of the room was bright and airy too The shower was fabulous and spacious The breakfast was outstanding and I think they served the best coffee I have drunk in my life The bar was also lovely and the area on the ground floor where the bar lounge and restaurant were located were all really funkily uniquely decorated 
284610,Hotel De Hallen, No breakfast mini bar costs , Beautiful hotel Best interior design we have ever seen within a hotel Bed amazingly big and comfy Brilliant jacuzzi bath and nice walk in shower 
284611,Hotel De Hallen, I liked everything about the hotel , The hotel is beautiful in a trendy not touristy part of town It is decorated beautifully and doesn t look feel like a hotel The beds are the softest we slept in while in Europe The staff were friendly and helpful when asking questions about where to go in Amsterdam 
284612,Hotel De Hallen, The description said window facing court yard but failed to say that it meant glass wall towards hallway The room lacked window which strangely enough didn t bother us On the contrary it made the room secluded and peaceful We lacked hangers for towels and there should have been more than one soap One night the staff forgot to turn off the up beat music in the hallway which was of course disturbing At breakfast the staff was not really on their toes for another star dirty dishes left behind etc The neighbourhood was okey though nothing special Veggie market in adjacent street , Very stylish and modern hotel with a fantastic big city air Great lounge with design furniture right outside the room Awesome foodcourt with a wide selection of cuisines in the same building including a top notch gin bar There are also some interesting shops Good restaurant in the hotel with friendly staff Within walking distance from centre The hotel rents bikes but there is a cheaper bike shop across the street 10 day 
284613,Hotel De Hallen, Only a few rooms have opening windows and we were lucky to request this however the a c is very quiet and acceptable , Bed extra comfy and the decor amazing Breakfast also great value and delicious 
284614,Hotel De Hallen, No complaints , Good location for traveling around the city Next door there was a large food hall where we ate every night and prices were very reasonable with live entertainment 
284615,Hotel De Hallen, Staff was not as polite or helpful as I would have expected The hotel locations is not in the core center of Amsterdam , Cool hotel with good restaurant 
284616,Hotel De Hallen, We would have liked more opening windows rather than the air conditioning and somewhere to put your suitcase e g On a luggage rack rather than on the floor , We didn t have a meal there so sadly not applicable
284617,Hotel De Hallen, Wifi was very weak in the rooms We requested a double bed but got 2 single beds connected just to clarify not as 1 double Pillows were squared shaped and odd to sleep on as they were quite high, The decor was very hipster like Shower was amazing and what you want after being a tourist all day The food hall next door was a bonus Although there was construction next door you could not hear anything Also the curtains were great as they hid all the light Loved that there were 3 tram stops near by
284618,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, This hotel is very modern and amenity is good Very pretty and everything is above the average Bed is very comfortable restroom is clean and fancy On the back of the hotel is a market with lots of food selection Very nice area 
284619,Hotel De Hallen, A discount breakfast rate was proposed in the chekin which was lower than what have been proposed by email few days before checkin , The breakfast was fantastic The room very comfort and modern Very good service
284620,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, The hotel was very clean and tidy All of the staff friendly and helpful I was staying for my birthday and they provided a complimentary bottle of wine which was unexpected and very thoughtful The hotel is in a great location easily walkable to major attractions and very close to tram routes if you don t fancy a walk Great value for money given the quality of the hotel and its location The hotel restaurant breakfast was very good lots of choice on the buffet and the bat offered a good selection of drinks I would definitely recommend staying to anyone 
284621,Hotel De Hallen, air conditioning had intermittent high pitched whine reception said we should have mentioned it as soon as we heard it Once again good advice Will do so next time we stay , Quiet hotel excellent service at front desk Very comfortable stay 
284622,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, Very comfy and clean rooms Quiet hotel so good a good nights sleep Only about 15 minutes from the centre by tram We had a small drainage issue in the shower but the staff were very helpful and sorted the issue quickly Would definitely stay here again 
284623,Hotel De Hallen, When I was there the internet connection was malfunctioning They tried to fix it but didn t so throughout my stay it would fail to connect or drop the connection Irritating but presumably fixed by now , Unconventional being a converted tram depot with clever design elements Good restaurant 
284624,Hotel De Hallen, Slightly out of centre but knew that before we booked anyway , Staff very friendly and helpful very clean restaurant was excellent for both breakfast and dinner 
284625,Hotel De Hallen, The room was very small Also in the shower cabin water was leaked outside , Bed was really good and so comfortable Breakfasts were very tasty It was also possible to order pancakes waffles or poached eggs by a la carte on breakfast Awesome 
284626,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, Lovely quirky hotel Nice and quiet Plenty of nearby places to eat and drink A little bit off the beaten track but a great base for the city centre and other attractions using the tram service near by 
284627,Hotel De Hallen, The first room we had on left hand side was noisy as we were near the bar and lobby Second room on right hand side had no natural day light , Breakfast buffet was great Decor of hotel beautiful Hotel staff were very polite and helpful Comfy bed Good shower 
284628,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, Lovely hotel very comfortable Its a little way from city center but easily accessible by short tram ride Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great hotel Checkout the excellent foodhallen next door full of bars and eateries 
284629,Hotel De Hallen, Room was noisy location of downstairs bar restuarant noise echoed thru room till late Reasonable value for money but a bit overpriced , Location is good away from tourist area 15 mins by tram or 30 min walk modern decor facilities comfortable bedding polite helpful staff food hall eatery many other eateries cafes close by 
284630,Hotel De Hallen, As soon as we arrived reception staff informed us that we could not check in because they overbooked the hotel and that they would send us to another one but not as nice as this one However we eventually checked in but when we went to the room we realised that the room was just a standard one and not the deluxe one I booked 2 months in advance We confronted the reception staff and they did confirm that in fact they gave our room away so they sneakily downgraded us hoping we will not realise Disgraceful and disappointing to say the least To make up for it they offered to give us breakfast for one even though there were 2 of us We got out room the next day and the free breakfast but the it put a bad spin on what was supposed to be a special birthday present Also to add that the AC in both rooms was making a non stop whistling sound making it almost impossible to sleep Not going back , The decor and the room
284631,Hotel De Hallen, Cocktails from the bar weren t good Building site next door so the rooms with a window look into it, Staff were really friendly and helpful The design was great
284632,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, Quirky modern hotel in walking distance to the centre Hotel is also on tram route direct from Centraal Station should you arrive in Amsterdam by train Good breakfast restaurant and bar on site Great food hall on the same site for lunch or dinner to explore Free wifi also 
284633,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, Very hip and comfortable hotel The bed was comfortable and made us feel so relaxed at night It is just next to the indoor Foodhallen which has many choices of food to choose from The staff were friendly and speak good english 
284634,Hotel De Hallen, Rooms had no outside window , It s kwirkiness The decor in the communal areas is very unusual Great bath for two and separate shower wet area Coffee machine and kettle Lots of fresh air room didn t feel stuffy at all having said that there were no outside windows Breakfast really good and worth the money 
284635,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, Light bright and modern in a very interesting local neighbourhood I liked being in a converted tram hall Some previous reviews said the toilet was open to view in my bedroom this was not the case it was separate in the bathroom in a small room with wooden doors 
284636,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, The inside was amazing lots of living rooms where you could hang out and relax if you are not out visiting museums or doing tours The rooms are also very comfortable The scene is very hip The bar area was nice for relaxing and we enjoyed the restaurant as well Since it was very cold while we were there it was nice to have a friendly comfortable hotel to relax in It is very light and airy a renovated commercial building There is a parking lot below the hotel if you need parking It is close enough to walk everywhere but also close to tram lines if you get tired and need a lift This area of the city is very nice to stay Next door is an amazing food court We were able to buy a tram pass there as well as tickets to the Keukenhof tulip garden Highly recommend 
284637,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, The breakfast was excellent the room was comfortable and clean and the staff was very friendly It was beside a great food hall that was really nice for a glass of wine and a meal 
284638,Hotel De Hallen, The guy on reception was very helpful but I was surprised that he didn t tell us about the rest of the complex especially the food hall and the hotel s restaurants which we happened upon ourselves , I loved the concept of the hotel It was really different and cool especially being part of the bigger De Hallen complex The beds were huge and very comfortable The hotel was nice and quiet 
284639,Hotel De Hallen, The breakfast was a little expensive , Room and lobby area are very nicely designed Great windows in the room Very comfortable bed Good lighting Good shower Wifi worked fine Nice neighborhood I recommend this hotel 
284640,Hotel De Hallen, Ground floor room had no window so we couldn t look outside from our room Slight noise of footsteps walking past room , Very comfortable large bed and lovely bathroom with large shower area Tea and coffee facilities and good television reception 
284641,Hotel De Hallen, The rooms with no outside window feel very claustrophobic The building works next door are invasive , The staff were great and he bed super comfy Bar and restaurant very convenient Exterior seating super 
284642,Hotel De Hallen, No windows in the room except the one overlooks the reception that takes away privacy for I had to keep the shades shut off entirely all the time no one to help with the luggage so I had to carry them to my room finally a mistake that ruined my mood at check out the receptionist released the amount paid to the hotel that was the full amount of my residency that I have paid once I arrived to have the peace of mind spending the remaining amount in my card After doing this the remaining amount in my card was blocked and the hotel kept trying to withdraw the amount that will take more than a week to be restored I don t carry cash only cards when they have blocked my card they have caused me trouble cause I couldn t use my card neither in the airport for I was leaving to another country that day and I m still crippled because of this until today this hotel will never be my choice again , Friendly staff Clean room 
284643,Hotel De Hallen, I have read it in previous reviews already but it was a little strange for us not to be able to open a window however we had the best sleep there as it is always dark inside the room due to the missing sunlight i felt the room itself was quite small but the bathroom huge bath tub and shower it can get noisy if people walk passed your room in heels you will need to get a tram ticket or otherwise walk 20 mins into town every day , Very clean and modern hotel staff is really friendly and helpful breakfast is great tram just a 5min walk for Amsterdam the value for money is probably good 
284644,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, A cool place in a former tram depot Everything is new and well made in a modern style Very friendly staff thank you for your help Good breakfast not really cheap but it s worth the price Restaurant is good as well 
284645,Hotel De Hallen, We liked that it wasn t a part of the madness of party Amsterdam but if you re after that definitely don t stay here as it s quiet peaceful clean and respectable , De Hallen was comfortable and really clean which as South Africans we appreciated It doesn t feel like 100 students have stayed there before you The bed was comfy and the hotel was quirky and welcoming Located right next door to the Food Hallen we were able to taste various dishes throughout our stay Apart from the great cheese Holland doesn t really scream food capital so this food hall saved us as we ate our way through burgers ballen waffles cheese toasties etc They don t mind if you bring food back into the hotel room so it was great to make our way home at the end of a busy touristy day and enjoy dinner The wifi in De Hallen hotel was strong which was helpful The staff were very friendly and we enjoyed the art sprinkled throughout the hotel About 15 minutes from the Grand Central Station via tram it s super easy to get to but a bit too far to walk everywhere definitely use a tram 
284646,Hotel De Hallen, Hotel is part of a big de Hallen complex and it s not well signposted how to get to it especially with the construction happening next door Bathroom door heavy glass and painful when bonked into In the west part of town so expect to ride transit or cab it to get around , Outstanding breakfast competent and eager staff very cool design in old tram depot next door to a great food hall cinema and design oriented shops Great evening bar and restaurant staff Liked staying away from throngs of tourists in center of town 
284647,Hotel De Hallen, No carpets in the room though it was winter you have to pay to upgrade to other room with carpet No free bottle of waters normally in other hotels two bottles will be provided every day Not near to city center, Staff are friendly and helpful Clean room and modern design Good internet connection
284648,Hotel De Hallen, bed too short parking not included despite being the parking place just under the hotel We asked for umbrellas cause it was pouring and they said we could only buy them from them ,No Positive
284649,Hotel De Hallen, Nothing, Good location in the up and coming west area Away from the busy canal district However a good 25 mins walk to Dam square Tram stop right outside the hotel which takes you into the centre in 10 mins Buy a hop on off ticket for the length or your stay 
284650,Hotel De Hallen, Bathroom privacy isn t great in any room I was shown a few Some rooms just have frosted glass separating bedroom from bathroom area other rooms rely on an L shaped layout for privacy but have no doors at all Awkward when sharing a room with someone The communal areas outside the room are great of passing the time while someone else is in the bathroom , Power sockets for US UK and EU plugs Nespresso coffee machine in the room Unusual and quirky design for communal areas great place to hangout Beware courtyard view means a room with windows pointing inwards toward the hotel lobby communal areas little natural light 
284651,Hotel De Hallen, Courtyard view turned out to be not a outdoor courtyard but an atrium indoor So in effect no real view as you probably keep the curtains closed when your bed is effectively like 2 meters from the conference table outside only separated by glass , Stayed one night only all good Small but comfortable room with courtyard view The restaurant is serves really nice food for a very reasonable price 
284652,Hotel De Hallen, Being in an old tram depot the rooms have very big internal windows that face into the centre of the building Not a problem at all in mid February but might have felt slightly oppressive in summer although it is probably just a good reason to get on with the day s sight seeing , Exceptionally welcoming staff in a very cleverly designed hotel Great few nights sleep in the comfortable bed Located just across the road from a trendy breakfast cafe in case you fancy a change from the hotel breakfast We liked staying a bit out of the centre of town as it was much quieter and meant we got a better sense of the city 
284653,Hotel De Hallen, I spent the weekend sharing a room with my adult son The bathroom has glass doors and wall that gives no privacy to the person using the bathroom The doors should at least close properly so the occupant feels shut off and not worried if they can be seen heard Replace the glass with a proper partition wall and door would be my suggestion My wife says she wouldn t stay there with doors and wall like that , Great location for proximity to our friends who live nearby Great welcome and service from staff Clean and comfortable room
284654,Hotel De Hallen, Front desk staff were mixed some very friendly and others not so much , Beautiful old tram station converted into a hotel Rooms are clean and comfortable Hotel d cor is quirky and also feels spacious and light Nice bar and restaurant with terrace which I didn t use as was raining
284655,Hotel De Hallen, as the building was a former tram depot there are no outdoor facing windows in any of the rooms, very comfy bed beautiful polished cement floors but bring slippers great shower separate bath tub spacious rooms great staff very helpful and friendly breakfast was great free wifi and water cool building a former tram depot good value for money
284656,Hotel De Hallen, Nothing Lacks some facilities of the bigger hotels like a gym but that s all I can think of Go for a run in Vondelpark instead , Loved everything about De Hallen rooms staff location The location may not suit everyone but it is well served by public transport and most things are walkable if you re happy walking Food hallen next door is awesome
284657,Hotel De Hallen, The breakfast on the website was 19 99 which I thought a little pricey we were offered it at 15 in the hotel but we found The breakfast club caf right on the corner opposite was fabulous so recommend trying it out , The hotel is great and the food hall next door is a must for a brilliant night out with food from all over the world plus a gin and tonic bar which is amazing Love the fact that it isn t right on the tourist trail and you feel that you get to see the real Amsterdam only a 15 minute walk along and across the beautiful canal and you are at the sights 
284658,Hotel De Hallen, It was a little out of the way from the tourist attractions but there were some really lovely places to eat near it , Friendly staff beautiful hotel with great facilities 
284659,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, location of the hotel is fantastic there s a food court next to the place filled with fusion dishes staff was really helpful design is fascinating Wish we d stayed longer to enjoy all of it 
284660,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, The staff were fantastic very warm welcoming friendly And we loved the look design of the hotel too Everything we wanted to see was within 20 minutes walking distance and there were tram stops close by to get us to and from the station The room and hotel itself were very quiet and there were plenty of great places to dine out in the area Would definitely stay here again 
284661,Hotel De Hallen, Room was warm no daylight , Lovely staff great interior design nice bar Room was pleasant good bathroom Amazing that it included power sockets for UK US and EU 
284662,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, This hotel is amazing We enjoyed everything about our stay The building is beautiful in a great location to catch the tram around the city and within the Hallen complex there is a cinema shops and Food Hallen a great place to eat with a really lively atmosphere Our ground floor room was great spacious with a huge comfy bed The bathroom was also beautiful bath is big enough for 2 All the staff we encountered during our stay couldn t have been more helpful or friendly lots of little added extras are available for free including good coffee and bath robes We drank at the bar great cocktails and ate in Remise47 the small intimate restaurant the food was amazing and recommendations helpful We thought the hotel was fantastic value one of the best we ve been to Thank you we will be back 
284663,Hotel De Hallen, The only real downside was the layout of the room though beautifully designed which doesn t allow much privacy shower is see through sink facing the room Wasn t a big deal for us but might be uncomfortable if you re not traveling with a very close companion Our room didn t have a window that opens which could feel a little sitfling , Great location close to cafes market and tram lines Friendly and helpful Staff Beautiful design and fun atmosphere Super comfy bed Attention to details soaps coffee etc Had a great experience would definitely stay there again 
284664,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, Quirky hotel nice art great rooms and the staff couldn t have been more helpful I ve paid double for half the hotel in the past wouldn t hesitate to go back

284666,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, It was a lovely hotel the staff were extremely helpful with directions and knowledge of the area The rooms were spacious with the most comfortable bed 
284667,Hotel De Hallen, the view wasn t good building site, the hotel is part of a complex that includes a couple of restaurants a cinema we watched Spectre in English with Dutch subtitles and some shops and stalls selling street food all under cover the rooms were soundproofed so there was very little noise on the way home we jumped onto a tram which was very cheap and convenient 
284668,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, Very cool hotel in up and coming part of town Amazing renovation of old team depot functional design interesting furniture and furnishings not your average hotel En suite of standard room has double walk in shower and bath Brilliant location next to the De Hallen food hall and market Centre of Amsterdam is a walkable distance away with option of tram ride home at the end of the day Staff were very friendly helpful knowledgeable and like everyone we came across in Amsterdam spoke outstanding English Only ate breakfast at the hotel which had everything we wanted and more 
284669,Hotel De Hallen, I gave my preference for a double bed but got a twin bed instead Not a deal breaker this time but still , Very clean great value for money liked the facilities 
284670,Hotel De Hallen, The room did not have windows of which there was no mention when booking How is a guest supposed to know that room with a courtyard view is in fact a room with no windows and with a view to the hotel corridor , Very nice design of the hotel lobby area
284671,Hotel De Hallen, Our first room was really dark with no natural light and very small for a twin room This wasn t the room we had booked and we were moved to a much brighter more spacious room , Good location Friendly staff and really super relaxing areas 
284672,Hotel De Hallen, The west side is a cool up and coming neighborhood There are a few great places to eat and drink here But the hotel is just on the limit of being too far from the real center of Amsterdam Even though I think its worth it , Very comfortable and artsy hotel The staff is very accommodating Ive stayed here about 8 times and its the only place I consider when coming to Amsterdam
284673,Hotel De Hallen, Location was a little out but there was a tram connections to the centre within walking distance There was no window that opened in my room to get fresh air It rained all the time I was there it would have been nice to get a complimentary umbrella instead of having to buy one from the hotel , I liked the layout of the rooms They all opened out to a central balcony Generous toiletries and good tea and coffee making facility in the rooms Bed linen and pillows were all top quality And rooms were sound proof which guaranteed a good night sleep 
284674,Hotel De Hallen, Room fraction small but was so quirky and modern we loved it Highly recommend will be back , Very modern great beers at the bar Amazing shower and close to tram stop for the city
284675,Hotel De Hallen, You cannot open windows in your room Half of the rooms do not even have outside windows so if that is an issue make sure to ask for the rooms with windows overlooking a construction site but no noise The service is just ok maybe they have decided to be as less as intruding as possible Checkout took ages , The hotel looks extremely nice a very pleasant environment stylish yet cosy Nice breakfast area solid breakfast Not directly in the city centre but very convenient location as there is a huge and very good food hall just around the corner which gets very busy over the weekend

284679,Hotel De Hallen, Our room was really small and supposedly with a garden view It was manageable and they did offer to change our room after the first sold out night , The location was perfect for the areas we wanted to visit The facility is modern and still feels new in a building with some history The staff helped with any questions we had including tickets Great bathroom 
284680,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, We my boyfriend and I had the best time here celebrating a last minute trip for my birthday I arrived early and they had upgraded me and there was a beautiful handwritten birthday note from the management and a welcome drink The bath was great The bed was very comfortable and the location was convenient Thank you 
284681,Hotel De Hallen, Half the rooms have no windows we got to stay in both kinds and makes a world of difference to have daylight There are NO drawers and very limited shelf space Bathrooms have no surface space for personal items although attractive and stylish could be more functional , Fabulous friendly staff very pleasant spacious lobby bar area Loved easy access to trams and walking around 
284682,Hotel De Hallen, Rooms didn t have windows you could open and some didn t even have any windows A little bit hard to find, Really friendly staff excellent food and great design
284683,Hotel De Hallen, Lacked some of the finer things like dressing gowns body lotion free water etc that you would expect for the price per night, Stunning decor Great for anyone who appreciates design and style
284684,Hotel De Hallen,No Negative, Nice place to stay next to a great food court Staff were very helpful and friendly The room was comfortable and had everything we needed Nice bathroom also It was a little way to walk to the museumplein and center of town but worth the quiet of the West side Really nice stay
