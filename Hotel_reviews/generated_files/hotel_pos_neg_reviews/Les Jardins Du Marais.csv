242168,Les Jardins Du Marais, Make sure you get a good view We paid for a deluxe suite which we got but which was at the rear of the hotel with a view of a wall Dreadful , Very comfortable beds 
242169,Les Jardins Du Marais, The breakfast wasn t included and we had to go to local cafes every day as it was 20 Euros , This hotel comes with a complimentary cell phone I was blown away It allowed us to use GPS through the city access restaurant reviews and place reservations It also helped us translate some English to French and navigate the city Also the hotel is beautiful Would definitely book again 
242170,Les Jardins Du Marais, There were no dishes pots or pans dispite the fact that there is although very small but there is a microwave sink stove and dishwasher , I loved the fact that they will provide you with a smart phone free of charge that allows you to call with their free WI FI just about ANYWHERE in the world You can also use the phone as you would your own phone Metro is walking distance Staff was very friendly 
242171,Les Jardins Du Marais, They do not respect the do not disturb sign Hard to understand were everything is located and how everything works , The personal are super nice and helped us with all our needs They have very good English The relaxing area is super nice 
242172,Les Jardins Du Marais, The noise from the courtyard but apparently an upgrade on the windows building to ensure better sound proofing is imminent The follow up to my complaint on the noise levels from the courtyard was satisfactory, The fantastic location
242173,Les Jardins Du Marais, No in room ironing facilities had to order and they wanted back quick Ended up buying an iron and board Worst gym I have ever seen Both things very important to me if not to you a good hotel Rooms somewhat dated seems to be some penny pinching that impacts the stay for example nofull length mirrors in the room only a small mirror in the bathroom , Very good location nice courtyard good shops and a supermarket nearby 
242174,Les Jardins Du Marais, Parking access was too small for cars to get out without damage Bed was huge in comparison to the room Could not walk between bed and closet Carpet was heavily stained , Location is fantastic Staff is knowledgeable 
242175,Les Jardins Du Marais, Seemd a little far fetched to have to wait until check out day to receive information from reception whether a later check out but before ordinary check in time would be acceptable While the breakfast choices were generally OK there could have been a plate with raw vegetables such as cucumber and tomato No salt on the tables nor a cook making that omelette francais Also while there was fresh orange juice there was no other type of coffee than black americano which was not really of the finest quality Cappuccino etc could be requested from staff but given breakfast here was a self service buffe one probably wants to engage with staff as little as possible to fully enjoy their breakfast especially that drinks were also self service The interior design of the breakfast room seemed to distance itself somewhat from the very nice decor of the hotel esp the courtyard making it not as pleasant to the eye as it was to the taste buds Combined with the fact that breakfast is basically in a basement some work probably needs to be done to align it with the same feeling one has at the courtyard Possiblity to use the provided smartphone more than just a smartphone would have provided a true 21st century experence While the smartphone came with an internet connection possiblity to make free calls to selected destinations use maps and had a pre installed Paris guide That was it For the regular EU traveller owning a smartphone and having an internet connection in France without the roaming charges this wouldn t give much unlike for non EU travellers who might benefit at least from internet on the go while visiting Paris Would have been much more interesting if it could be used as a room peripheral as well e g to control the a c turn lights on off etc It s time to upgrade the room safe despit box as it seemed rather outdated and had a too long digit combination given what others offer , Very clean room although bathtub could be upgraded wear tear marks Pleasant room decor and extremely comfortable bed with fantastically soft pillows Perfect water pressure made every shower a pleaseant experience Toiletries were of good quality A C working smoothlessly and easy to configure Smartphone provided by the hotel could be used outside the hotel which was a nice perk Large TV with many channels although could be more international channels in English besides the regular BBC World Bloomberg etc Minibar fridge working and sufficiently big to store other things bigger water bottle etc Got likely upgraded we requested a baby cot as the room also had a kichenette included a microwave oven sink induction cooktop and even a dishwasher except a kettle Wi Fi cover good and working as it should Hotel courtyard provided a fantastic lounge like atmosphere Very pleasant decor There was indeed a spa and sauna on location Choice of food during breakfast was good In general metaphoric terms the bacon was not burnt nor too crunchy and the scrambled eggs were actual scrambled eggs Brunch in the courtyard on Sundays 
242176,Les Jardins Du Marais, It was IMPOSSIBLE to contact the hotel from abroad the service people online were literally not knowing what they were asked for It took me a month and more than 7 calls to Booking com to get Booking com representatives to contact Jardins du Marais I needed to change my stay in the hotel for 1 day due to the change of the grpahic they could not move this booking for one day and it took me forever to agree with them booking of another one day and joining the orders When I came to the hotel personnel promised a compensation for the one day that we did not stay in this hotel but on the last day they said that this could never be done The hotel may be good for people travelling from France but absolutely horrendous for foreigners , Well the room was alright and cleaning was good 
242177,Les Jardins Du Marais, Shower was super small Parking was extremely difficult around the hotel Closest parking garage was at Ibis hotel , It was a modern hotel in comparison with other older buildings in Paris 
242178,Les Jardins Du Marais, Access to car parking is from a different road not comfortable when checking in Parking access is very tight for the car Initially we got room 205 which is right above the garage and very noisy at night and at early morning probably laundry of the hotel For the second night we got a quite room ,No Positive
242179,Les Jardins Du Marais, Some of the interior design is a little clunky My room had a wonderful vintage style sink but the tap and plug control were hard to access as they were too large for the unit Also a very old fashioned wall mounted hairdryer as well as being not that effective got in the way a little Small points overall though , This is a charming hotel tucked away in an up and coming section of Paris Great bar scene nearby The interior courtyard is a wonderful surprise oasis surrounded by a number of buildings where the rooms are Some have said the rooms look a little tired but they are very clean and designed to suit the period of the buildings Very comfortable bed which is why you re there Breakfast was good if a little hard to find at first 
242180,Les Jardins Du Marais, Housecleaning staff were hit and miss didn t clean my room one day I missed my flight because they didn t clean my room for four hours after I checked out Elevator wasn t working for the first day in the building they put me up in , Love the garden and the location Rooms were comfortable and well sized 
242181,Les Jardins Du Marais, Limited menu options , My partner had an accident prior to arrival and had a full knee splint The Hotel was very accommodating in putting us in a room that facilitated wheelchair access They even had a wheelchair for us to use while we were there 
242182,Les Jardins Du Marais,No Negative, This hotel is in a lovely area with lots of bars bistros and restaurants in walking distance Its very accessible by several different metros and bus routes The hotel has a lovely courtyards to sit in with deck chairs and umbrellas The reception staff were very helpful and knowledgable gave us lots of good tips Our superior room was comfortable and had everything we needed even a little kitchen A real bonus the hotel provided a free use mobile called a Handy which if you don t have data on your phone is perfect great tips for travel tourist sites routes on metro and calling each other when lost 
242183,Les Jardins Du Marais, The fact that one of the curtains was missing Despite explaining this fact Two men came to check if it was the case instead of sorting something out straight away I m not sure there was a need for that This was at 1 am A solution was found and we were given a better room which was great It was a bit of a hassle though having to move at this time No proper apologies given by anyone , The location and fhe second room we stayed in The cleaner manager was genuine and very friendly Some receptionists need to learn from her customer service style 
242184,Les Jardins Du Marais, The breakfast in Europe is too high for cheese and ham That is anywhere Also ice was scarce and we came in July when it was hot , The staff was outstanding and friendly They were helpful with tours directions reservations and were sincere wanting to help us Paul our bar tender was amusing The room was spacious up to date and it was equipped with a microwave and refrigerator Paris is very expensive so I highly recommend families booking the Jr suite so they can use the refrigerator and microwave to cut down on food costs There was a market not far The metro was right at the hotel so getting around was easy I didn t think the neighborhood had a lot to offer as a walk We didn t Most attraction were away from the hotel but it made it nice and quiet for our needs The patio was beautiful and perfect for a nightcap I would recommend this hotel for comfort staff and access to metro We would come back Thank you for a nice stay 
242185,Les Jardins Du Marais, The rooms the furniture and the interior decoration are old They look more like the rooms of a country inn than of a 4 star hotel in Paris The courtyard is magnificent but causes a lot of noise because of the cobblestone pavement Every time someone leaves or arrives with a luggage from 6 am to 22 pm you hear a noise caused by the cobblestone pavement I stayed for two days and both days they had big business groups who had a seminar or congress the whole day They stayed mostly in the courtyard apero late lunch and it was impossible to work or relax , The courtyard but only from a visual point of view 
242186,Les Jardins Du Marais, Warning for international guests Keep your passport locked up in the room safe at all times do not leave it out in your room or your bags My story Within 15 minutes of checking in I left my room to have dinner When I came back my passport was gone and the various cards I had inside of it were on the floor The hotel desk staff helped me look for it in vain but their attitude left me wondering how often this happens at this hotel I d typically chalk it up to being forgetful but the evidence stands my passport and only my passport was taken from my room After asking around I ve found that passport theft from hotel rooms is not uncommon in Paris Given my experience at this hotel using extreme caution with important documents is absolutely required at this hotel The first room I checked into was not cleaned even though the receptionist had called the cleaning staff to make sure the room was available That said the receptionist made sure to put me in another room immediately which was cleaned and they ended up not charging me for the room upgrade as a result which was much appreciated The room I ended up in had water damage to some of the carpets as well as various issues that made this 4 star hotel seem more like a 2 star like broken plugs odd fitting appliances and the like Also don t order room service after 6PM even though there is a restaurant on site they will tell you that they are out of whatever you re looking for Upon leaving the hotel to seek food elsewhere you can stroll past the restaurant and see that they re serving the same food they re supposedly out of Ridiculous , The sheets and bed were very comfortable as well as the air conditioning especially in a hot Paris summer The hotel is much larger than I expected with plenty of outdoor seating areas and balconies depending on the room you ve booked The hotel was kind enough to upgrade me on request to a better room although that didn t work out too well in the end See what I didn t like 
242187,Les Jardins Du Marais, We were not impressed with the bedroom The decor was dated and it felt small The bathroom was a bit old as well We didn t spend any time in our room so it was fine , We loved the courtyard It s what sold us the hotel and the price cause we got a good deal It was in a good location too Easy to get around and use public transport 
242188,Les Jardins Du Marais, The room smelled bad humid toiletsmell when we entered the room The elevator makes real doubtfull noises Decoration of the room outdated, Nice guy at the reception Good beds
242189,Les Jardins Du Marais,No Negative, positive The staff were very friendly Negative breakfast buffet for 20 and for a 4 star hotel was very very poor even the breakfast room was not a pleasant area My room had a window to the yard where the restaurant guest were sitting so although I was on 5th floor i could hear people talking and laughing there Inside the room the Refrigerator was the biggest noise generator I even tried to unplug it but no chance Being in Paris on business for only one day and not being able to sleep properly is not really eficient 
242190,Les Jardins Du Marais, I liked this hotel a lot My only concern however which I will write the hotel about was that the bathtub shower lacked a secure handhold and it was difficult getting in and out of a slippery tub It certainly would be dangerous for a person in worse physical shape than I am in Also the bathroom lacked an exhaust , Great location very able staff and very welcoming and helpful interesting construction the hotel consists of several linked old buildings which have been modernized and the buildings surround a large private courtyard and garden for dining The breakfasts were terrific 
242191,Les Jardins Du Marais,No Negative, Staff were really friendly and helpful Hotel is chic with a nice garden courtyard good fitness centre and is in a great location near metro stations and lots of great cafes etc 
242192,Les Jardins Du Marais, It is not a good area full of Ho Bo s Dog Shit and Dodgy massage parlours and no real tourist attractions The restaurants in the area are mediocre If you are a tourist I recommend the 7th I paid my bill the night before because I had a 4am start the following day The receptionist screwed up the check out and in the morning I had to spend 30 minutes convincing the night manager that I had paid my 14 bar bill the night before He simply did not believe me until finally he realised that I had been charged twice for the same drinks Then I found out I had to pay more for the city tax because the day staff had not included it in my bill the night before Overall a very poor and amateur response from the staff and unpleasant experience for me The delay almost cost me my flight , They have decent rooms at a reasonable price and a nice seating area in the courtyard I stayed here because it is close to my family home 
242193,Les Jardins Du Marais, Staff were friendly but not helpful I put in notes that I was driving from Italy and wanted parking this was full and wasn t helpful on any suggestions in the area Asked for individual beds but gave double and hotel was full so no changes could be made Running out of food at breakfast and some was cold , Beautiful hotel facilities and comfortable bed 
242194,Les Jardins Du Marais, One of the cups in the room had a crack in it and it should have been removed but it was just cleaned , Bed very comfy room well lit window had a view and was able to be opened Bathroom clean Room quiet and warm 
242195,Les Jardins Du Marais, Bed was comfy but a double bed was ordered and twin beds were pushed together to make a double pillows comfy too, Located a few hundred meters from a metro with surrounded by lots of lovely restaurants bars supermarkets pharmacies newsagents etc very easy to get to and from the centre of Paris without much effort The local restaurants bars are much more reasonably priced than the centre too If you have the time and the weather is good I d recommend a picnic along the seine waving at the passing boats the atmosphere is just magical 
242196,Les Jardins Du Marais, Bathrooms are small , Excellent staff super comfy beds and pillows Easy to access the metro to reach the usual tourist spots Le Marais is a good area for strolling in with good bars and restaurants We will return 
242197,Les Jardins Du Marais, Despite being polite I think the staff need more training My room service order charcuterie and cheese plate took over 2 hours to arrive and after several calls to room service apparently they wrote down the wrong room number Then I had asked them to book a taxi for the next morning and when I checked out I was told no taxi had been booked the staff sorted it out quickly but it could have been a disaster as the start of Ramadan month meant fewer drivers were working So although the staff were pleasant these hiccups made my trip not very pleasant , The courtyard is really nice and the staff are polite 
242198,Les Jardins Du Marais, The building Rodin was quite dated and as a result the elevator lift was extremely slow If anyone feels claustrophobic in an elevator take the stairs , The location was perfect The courtyard made you feel as though you were in the south of France The room was larger than expected 
242199,Les Jardins Du Marais, The room service dishes from a neighbouring room seemed simply to wait outside on the carpet The cleaning staff left regularly the door to their supply cupboard open for all to see which just seemed sloppy At 20 a head breakfast scarcely seemed worth it so we went out for coffee and buns , The hotel is in a good location on the edge of the Marais The room was comfortable and of a good size and the courtyard garden was very welcome in what was rather hot weather We booked at a competitive price for the city at this time of year 
242200,Les Jardins Du Marais, Most other things The room was old and cleaning services inconsistent Some staff friendly others not so much , The garden is a nice place to relax and the location is great 
242201,Les Jardins Du Marais,No Negative, This location is fantastic a short walk will yield fantastic food treats Check out a place called BigLove Cafe for lunch You ll not regret There is a supermarket two minute walk north where you can stock up on wine drinks snacks and more The 5 metro is 7 min walk away and the 8 is practically on the doorstep 
242202,Les Jardins Du Marais, The lights in my bathroom weren t working but I got around it Also the neighbourhood that the hotel is in comes off a little sketchy but the more you walk around it is better Distance from the hotel to the more touristy spots ie Eiffel Tower Arc de Triomphe Luxembourg Garden are a little far if you re walking great alternative as Paris traffic is terrible , All you can eat breakfast was stupendous and concierge was very friendly and helpful With only one night the staff the staff really made sure it was a comfortable stay 
242203,Les Jardins Du Marais,No Negative, Room colors peaceful and attractive urban view from the window excellent mattress and hot shower excellent staff welcoming courteous efficient Perfect location for walking into the Marais and beyond 
242204,Les Jardins Du Marais, When they have the option of being more environmentally friendly of using the same towels again they should also do it I wanted to keep the towels and yet the changed them even though I followed the instructions , Very cute backyard 
242205,Les Jardins Du Marais, overall we loved staying at the hotel the bed was a little too soft and there were two mattresses put together as opposed to one there was no sugar in the room alongside the teabags and instant coffee the room offered , The hotel s location is perfect in my opinion It is a walking distance from a few tourist sights but a bit off the beaten path so that the cafes and restaurants are not of the tourist trap variety The metro is very close and getting around is easy The hotel is pleasant to the eye and the inner yard is absolutely charming The staff are very friendly and helpful The condition of the hotel overall is good but not perfectly new there were small things that needed minor improvement such as the lack of sugar and kitchen utensils in the room we were upgtaded to a suite and had a kitchenette 
242206,Les Jardins Du Marais,No Negative, The location in the Marais was new to us and was excellent with easy access to public transport The staff were friendly and helpful at all times The room was quiet with a view over the courtyard not overlooking the street was a bonus We also welcomed having a kettle fridge and a sink and had we needed it the hob We would certainly stay again We got a very good rate by booking early 
242207,Les Jardins Du Marais, Sink and bathtub full of dents and chips power sockets smudged out of the wall not working at all a window facing directly a very noisy street that was kinda broken and couldn t be completely closed all this in a 4 hotel Hell maybe the cost says 4 but these conditions indicate a cheap hostel , It s close to the metro the room was large and had a fridge and microwave which I wasn t looking for but still the garden of the hotel looks nice 
242208,Les Jardins Du Marais, The restaurant was closed for winter time Wifi you have to log in every time Room was that small that bed was fit in a space you can t reach the window without climbing on it , The area where hotel is located is very nice Hotel is just a step away from the metro station Room was nice traditional but all equipment needed was there Inner garden was beautiful in summer time you can eat outside 
242209,Les Jardins Du Marais,No Negative, The hotel atmosphere was cool and it is very close to metro station market and the restaurants The hotel crew was so helpful and kind to us the only problem was the air condition 
242210,Les Jardins Du Marais, The mattress was probably the worst mattress I have ever slept on in a hotel If the hotel were a two star this would be somewhat acceptable but it is unacceptable for a four star There is nothing worse than taking a nicer hotel with the hope of being rested for business meetings and in the end getting a horrible night s sleep Also I could hear pretty much everything in the room next to me as there was a door connecting the two rooms I could literally hear someone masturbating on the other side of the door Once again that may be expected at a flophouse but not a four star hotel , Great location beautiful interior patio space friendly staff access to a sauna but don t forget your bathing suit 
242211,Les Jardins Du Marais, Extremely noisy cleaning staff shouting at each other and carrying on from roughly 9 in the morning Ignored do not disturb sign on door and opened it and walked into the room whilst partner and I were sleeping at 9 15am Fridge also did not work however I do not consider a fridge essential , Location is great 
242212,Les Jardins Du Marais, An express breakfast offer would have muchimproved my experience , I did not take breakfast as I consider 25 euros extortionate for a small breakfast which was all I wanted or needed 
242213,Les Jardins Du Marais, 11 am somebody I believe the mini bar service knocked the door despite of DND sign on that s not acceptable especially for 4 hotel The cleaners later also tried to come in despite of DND but they thought I departed We live in 21 century phones are invented already and I guess cleaners could call to reception if they see DND sign on the day of departure in case of late check out for example before disturbing the guests Elevator in my building was really slow and it got broken finally and it is the only elevator at the building , Staff is extremely friendly and helpful Francesco especially Room was really nice big even for Paris well decorated bright and clean Breakfast was poor for my choice I d love to see more fresh vegetables But overall hotel is really good Definitely would stay there again 
242214,Les Jardins Du Marais, Price of drinks were expensive, Everything from welcoming arrival to leaving Very comfortable rooms excellent attentive staff relaxing secure courtyard with a breakfast to set up a full day touring 
242215,Les Jardins Du Marais, Stayed for garden and no place to sit with my friends for evening drink They made me beg to use a dinner table under the condition that don t touch the table setting which they wouldn t move and replace after we left As my cousin said I won t even look at it the table setting Ridiculous , Staff let me check in early Front desk fabulous 
242216,Les Jardins Du Marais, Dreadful service we waited 20 minutes in the garden for a waiter to come and take our drinks order and then a further 20 minutes for our drinks which never arrived Also the hotel lacks the lovely Parisian views but that can t be helped , Lovely room clean and comfortable in a quiet location Also the beautiful garden with lovely furniture
242217,Les Jardins Du Marais,No Negative, The whole place is tastefully designed comfortable friendly and clean The beds were excellent the room charming and the ambiance of a high standard It is in a good position being near to Bastille Opera Le Marais with its art galleries smart shops and fine restaurants and Metro stations 
242218,Les Jardins Du Marais, The rooms are very simple with a business hotel feel For the price it is still a pretty good deal The bathroom should have more shelf or cabinet space , Our room happened to have a little kitchen which was convenient The location was good in a sense that the Marais district with restaurants and museums is just across the big avenue and the metro station was nearby Also a supermarket was just a few blocks away to pick up water or snack 
242219,Les Jardins Du Marais, The staff are not great Concierge is how to judge a good 4 star hotel This hotel had poor level advice The best restaurant tips and guides we got were from cab drivers and other waiters The service was slow and languid , The hotel itself is actually quite good Nice sized rooms decent location plenty of locations within short walks and a very close metro stop 
242220,Les Jardins Du Marais, I stayed in the Ravel part It was unkept and the cleanliness in room not good There was debris of plaster in the hallway all during my stay it would have been very easy to vacuum away The service in the courtyard was bad I waited 30 minutes for a glass of wine when there was not even anyone else there and after one reminder The staff there were arguing very loudly the nexy day , I loved the courtyard Gorgeous Room OK Staff at breakfast abseloutly lovely as well as the receptionists 
242221,Les Jardins Du Marais, the staff were not helpful uninterested almost rude this is a hotel that pretends to be cool because of its location and garden but the staff lets it down not cool,No Positive
242222,Les Jardins Du Marais, Executive room a little dated Bathroom was not great for showering Very small , Courtyard was amazing great staff location is perfect Loads of restaurants and bars around the corner Quiet room and awesome metro acces 
242223,Les Jardins Du Marais,No Negative, Interesting property the central courtyard was a plus Even though I didn t utilize it it was a pleasant experience to have that space between reception accommodation 
242224,Les Jardins Du Marais, The first room I was given had a howling dog locked in the adjacent room I was moved to a new room on the third floor by Tim on the desk who is brilliant The door to the lobby was also broken necessitating a detour The elevator has been broken for a long time in the Eiffel building and so I found myself needing a porter to help me up three flights with my bags and a lot of extra traipsing up and down I had problems with my air conditioner which was fixed quickly The curtains cannot be drawn shut and my room was boiling hot without the aircon and it made an afternoon nap hard with the sun streaming in Decor a bit tired My toiletries were not replenished Breakfast was abysmal and an absolute rip off at 20 Considering these points I don t think this hotel earns its star rating , The location near the metro was good Tim on the front desk is outstanding All staff were bright and smiley The courtyard in the centre is wonderful to relax in The rooms had a certain drama with their rich red tones 
242225,Les Jardins Du Marais, Wished that I could have moved it all down closer to the Seine I thought the breakfast was too expensive so we ate in the corner cafe each morning Now THAT was the real Paris experience , Lovely hotel staff not a 10 but a 15 Helpful smiling accomodating Room was spacious so clean lovely view into the inner courtyard 
242226,Les Jardins Du Marais, No shower just a bath tub into which one has to climb when showering Dangerous , There was a very good selection of bread even dark and with cereals on the first morning Unfortunately this was not always the case at other mornings there was only white bread Very nice courtyard great possibility to sit outside 
242227,Les Jardins Du Marais, Rooms are very old and furniture worn off Not excellent staff Breakfast is less than average with cold eggs and not fresh croissant, Location is good and short walk to Republique and Bastille
242228,Les Jardins Du Marais, We had booked an executive room with nice views When we arrived the recepcionist gave us a room at the other end of the patio and with horrible views After refusing it we were giving a better room ,No Positive
242229,Les Jardins Du Marais, There was nt anything that I was unhappy with , The breakfasts were excellent Great choices The staff were friendly helpful The hotel was well situated very welcoming The rooms were lovely
242230,Les Jardins Du Marais, All good, Beautiful modern clean stylish Very efficient helpful staff Additional request for a kettle etc was arranged Super slightly themed sections to the groups of rooms around an enclosed courtyard area 
242231,Les Jardins Du Marais, Unfriendly but polite reception staff checked us in to an already used room upgraded us to a noisy street level room even though I asked for a quiet garden view room Both times the card keys didn t work on both rooms having to go down twice and no explanation given , Location
242232,Les Jardins Du Marais, We ordered the Romantic Package that included a room upgrade and several other things On arrival they had no record of the order and when we said OK we ll order it now were told it was different from the website and anyway they could not upgrade They gave us a very small poky noisy room with dirty carpet We should have complained but were too tired from the journey The following morning they found our Romantic order but their interpretation differed from the website that I had managed to show them The helpful manager upgraded us since the original room was so poor No proper restaurant Breakfast too expensive previously we ordered direct not through booking com and received free breakfasts , Position excellent for walking to Picasso Museum Pompidou Centre Place des Vosges etc Superior room is very good Some staff were very helpful but some not This was the third or fourth time we stayed in this hotel so it must have been good then 
242233,Les Jardins Du Marais, I really don t know who assigned this hotel as a 4 star hotel 1 The staff were not friendly and polite as it is expected in a 4 stars hotel 2 the rooms are decorated with cheap old wooden furniture and is not in accordance with a 4 stars hotel 3 We had booked 2 suits and they were in Rodin Nos 302 and 303 in room 303 we were suffering from the smell and odour of the kitchen my Mother an 79 year old lady was in the room 302 and unfortunately the bath was not designed for an old person as she couldn t climb the bath tub and take a shower during her stay in my mothers room the air condition was not working and the room was cold and when we asked the reception then nothing was done simply ignored us our complaint and asking to change the room had no success and we had to bear the unpleasant situation 4 actually we paid a high price for both suits but it didn t worth 5 they offered the free wifi in all areas but it is ridiculously a fake network you can not even check your mails with this offer the offered 10 per day for a better connection and it is funny that it is only for one gadget it mean if you are a couple in a room and each have 2 gadgets a laptop and phone or a tablet then you have to pay 40 per day 6 the expensive rooms were offered without any meal we paid 20 per person for the breakfast with this price the breakfast was not a proper and suitable due to the price and the claimed 4 star accommodation it was a simple breakfast equivalent to a 2 star hotel 7 The staff were impolite and ignorant and simply ignore any request or complaint 8 the hotel was full of group travellers and not a relaxing place , There was nothing to like about this property 
242234,Les Jardins Du Marais, Staff were not very responsive Missing elements in the room such as tea and coffee Took over an hour for the tea to arrive and then they forgot the tea cups and spoons Didn t explain breakfast costs and had to incur a charge after asking if it was included Sneakily got around it , Setting was nice and location was ok 
242235,Les Jardins Du Marais, There was a 2 day conference and the participants were rather noisy in their breaks , It was a peaceful setting The closeness of the metro made getting to central Paris very easy The room was spacious Also very handy to local restos 
242236,Les Jardins Du Marais, This hotel was very run down the bed was broken room was so small I couldn t open my suitcase For the value we expected a lot more There was a constant smell of cigarette smoke Have never stayed in such s terrible hotel , I liked nothing about this hotel 
242237,Les Jardins Du Marais, Room dark with only one small window sofa really a bed not comfortable to sit Only one easy chair No robes tub shower very high with no grab bars Cooktop in room but no plates or utensils Location at the edge of Marais not in Room really dark, Room jr suite large
242238,Les Jardins Du Marais, The first room we were in had a little mildew mold and many standing stains on the floor The breakfast was pricey for not having any options and for what was received , Loved the staff especially Corine Camille and Kevin They were all very helpful Many other members were as well but I didn t get their names They accommodated our requests and made everything easy 
242239,Les Jardins Du Marais, Breakfast was poor crowded big room ran out of coffee and milk Situated on the edge of the Marais quite a walk into the heart of the area , Very comfortable big hotel with on site parking Good facilities 
242240,Les Jardins Du Marais, Room was next to lift which was noisy and kept us awake at night Intermittant wifi connection Gym was too warm , Great location clean and contemporary Bar and courtyard lovely Helpful staff 
242241,Les Jardins Du Marais, Overall the venue was not the worth of price it charges It was not at all a 4 star property as they claim, It was just okay It was a 3 start hotel and not 4 star
242242,Les Jardins Du Marais, We booked a quadruple room whichever thought would be a lot bigger than what it was We were a little disappointed with the location as it is just outside the Marais area This is fine if you don t have young children but our two found the walking to the nice restaurant area a bit tiresome , The staff were very helpful and friendly Our beds were comfortable The hotel had a great outdoor area for relaxing and having an afternoon cocktail 
242243,Les Jardins Du Marais, Keys did not work perfectly, Location and services including very useful free mobile phone 
242244,Les Jardins Du Marais, The bathroom wasn t cleaned everyday properly , Location the hotel itself
