194475,The Zetter Townhouse Clerkenwell, Bathroom disappointing that there was no bath but the staff were very understanding and gave us a complimentary breakfast to make up for it , Cocktails stunning
194476,The Zetter Townhouse Clerkenwell, See above hot water Working window Butter and a decent toaster at breakfast Night cap that never came immediate response from management on crediting our bill as compensation for fundamental hotel facility of hot water, Location decor atmosphere and friendliness of staff But we would have liked hot water butter at breakfast window that stayed open toaster that toasted on both sides and missing cocktail ordered Third visit Shame it was not like the first two 
194477,The Zetter Townhouse Clerkenwell, Please can they stock an alcohol free beer such as Becks Blue , Wonderful welcome from wonderful staff A great place to stay in a fun area of London So friendly and gorgeous rooms made me feel I was staying in a Dickens novel but with all the mod cons and luxuries of the present day 
194478,The Zetter Townhouse Clerkenwell, Unfortunately the service let things down dramatically It was not made clear at the time of arriving that if you are in the Townhouse you have much less access to food and drink Equally the bed was astonishingly hard and uncomfortable and the room either very hot or very cold no real way of moderating the temperature In the morning having rung down repeatedly as they had told me to do at check in to try and get some milk for tea eventually gave up and left Unfortunately to compound the disappointment arrived downstairs to find that if you are staying in the Townhouse the only option is a Buffet continental breakfast Overall a great concept really disappointingly executed and therefore very expensive for what you receive Did leave feedback to this extent and was promised I would be contacted by the Manager to discuss further although this did not happen even after an initial phone call to double check my email address A shame really as it should have been lovely and really could have been , The location is great and the decor and property really lovely
194479,The Zetter Townhouse Clerkenwell, Our booked breakfast arrived late to our room but once again without any delay the house manager apologised and in return gave us this as a complimentary service A positive out of what could be a negative , The staff were very friendly and accommodating to our needs helping to make the special birthday of my partner even more special The room was fabulous with a gorgeous bath feature Mini bar and snacks were superbly sourced and plenty of if needed The digital Marshall speakers were perfect to have whilst enjoying our morning in the room without having to rush for check out as they have a later check out time of midday It was such a wonderful experience and we will sim to come back again and again 
194480,The Zetter Townhouse Clerkenwell, AC was ice cold all night with no in room controls Reception seemed unable to fix it for us , The rooms are amazing and in it s one of the best areas of London 
194481,The Zetter Townhouse Clerkenwell, Everything about this stay was great Nothing negative to report , The service was fab and they even upgraded us as it was our Anniversary They printed out vouchers via my email and nothing was too much trouble 
194482,The Zetter Townhouse Clerkenwell,No Negative, Rooms above our favourite cocktail bar Friendliness of the staff Perfect location View of the historical square plus out to the Barbican from our room 
194483,The Zetter Townhouse Clerkenwell, No metro in 5 minutes walking distance Food snacks in the hotel were a bit pricy but they own also a nice restaurant opposite the townhouse that supposedly serves meals that are more value for money , Staff was very friendly and helpful the bar lounge is great very lively always room is really cozy nice clean Very nice atmosphere in the hotel rooms They have nice bikes that you can borrow to cycle around but bring your own lock as they do not come with a lock 
194484,The Zetter Townhouse Clerkenwell, Straffs skills or service level are variable but mainly with best intentions Unfortunately this great little homy townhouse Hotel is a bit on the pricy side , My score should have been higher as comfort and crazy hipster coolness in a warm ambience package does not way enough on this score board It is a fantastic Hotel Both The hotel and the townhouse are to be recomended however The T house is spectacular and hipster ironic iconic british A dash orient express a nib Harry Potter and Jack The ripper located on a square that makes it feel like retreat within a buzy city 
194485,The Zetter Townhouse Clerkenwell,No Negative, Front of house staff were delightful they could not have been more helpful or more personable We stayed here because we didn t want a corporate experience and we were right It was relaxed luxurious quirky individual and we were treated like friends 
194486,The Zetter Townhouse Clerkenwell, It is in many ways a bar and event space with some rooms to rent The bar host was a parody of self regard who seemed to resent that he had to suffer hotel guests taking up space On the weekend nights the bar was rammed with stuffy self important types but then that s the neighborhood , The hotel hostess was brilliant kind thoughtful and always ready with a genuine smile The bartenders were gregarious enthusiastic craftsmen Given the opportunity they waxed rhapsodic about their spirits and mixes Tastes and jokes were freely offered The hotel itself is beautifully designed quirky and delightful All the small details were well attended And that shower oh that shower 
194487,The Zetter Townhouse Clerkenwell, Twice I asked staff to reserve a table for me in the evening for two twice I was told no need to book we keep tables spare for residents twice I had no table and was told sorry sir the bar is full if they can sort that out everything else was fabulous btw we fixed the problem by just starting cocktails earlier before it filled up , Fantastic and funky
