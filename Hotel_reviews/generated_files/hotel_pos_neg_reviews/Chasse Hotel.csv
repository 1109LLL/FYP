299207,Chasse Hotel, There was once a moment when we had to wait that our room will be cleaned , I had a big room with balcony and that was just fantastic Service people were all very happy and polite It was just fun to come back hotel after long walks Beds were excellent Location was quite interesting little bit away from City center but still very nice neighbourhood Foodhall was very close and warmly recommend to visit there Tram stops are close that is fastest connection to center less than 10 minutes to DAM Taxi was about 40 from airport and it is quite fast I will warmly recommend this Chasse hotel to adult travellers 
299208,Chasse Hotel, Our bed was actually two single beds pushed together which was ok but a little awkward when rolling over in the night Our shower head also sprayed water all over the bathroom but when we mentioned this to the staff they fixed it for us very quickly Only thing that could be improved would maybe be having a mini fridge to keep bottles of water etc but this wasn t a big issue , We loved our stay at the Chasse Hotel After a disastrous experience at a different place we had booked arriving at the Chasse was a welcome relief Our room was gorgeous Comfy bed incredibly clean and a lovely balcony leading off our room The staff were very friendly and helpful too 
299209,Chasse Hotel, It would be the perfect place to stay with the addition of a small refrigerator in the room and access to a guest laundry , Very comfortable bed great shower friendly staff Good location in a quiet area 
299210,Chasse Hotel, Pillows were little too high Didn t like that hotel hadn t umbrellas for guests to borrow hotel should think of that in the future , Personal was really nice Nice quiet quarter Room was nicely done 
299211,Chasse Hotel,No Negative, I didn t try the breakfast but the hotel now has a cosy pub dining area and terrace If you stay here you ll find the staff very friendly and helpful Its actually closer to the city center than it appears The area its situated in is beautiful and the walk into the center was lovely If needed the tram stop around the corner will take you to all areas of the city A fantastic find of a hotel Ive stayed in a few in Amsterdam and this is the best Large clean room and large balcony 
299212,Chasse Hotel, Comstruction above our room during the day with Jetlag was tough, The accommodations were excellent Modern and yet cozy Staff were very helpful Bed was very comfortable 
299213,Chasse Hotel,No Negative, Wow what a amazing stay I had at the Chasse hotel Room was amazing and worth more then what we paid Great location 15 minutes from the airport around 30 euros in taxi or tram stop at the end of the road which was around a minute walk Only 5 stops away from dam centre it was in the perfect location what a lovely friendly hotel I cannot wait to stay again thank you for making my boyfriends 21st birthday a lovely stay 
299214,Chasse Hotel, Nothing Couldnt fault The accomodation was better than we hoped and the price was fair compared to where we stayed days before , We had an amazing room Comfortable bed and pillows Amazing bathroom and shower Helpful friendly staff and a great restaurant After travelling from other countries coming here we could really relax be comfortable and recharge for more travels We planned to stay one night and treated ourselves to a second night in the same room with no fuss during high season We hired a bike from reception and had easy access to anything on foot When we return to Amsterdam we will not hesitate to come back here again Highly recommended 
299215,Chasse Hotel, There is some noise during the day from the dance studio and gymnasium that are attached but it is very quiet at night , The staff were exceptional and the location is convenient if a bit out of the center of town 
299216,Chasse Hotel, Just maybe add hangers for the bathrobes in the toilets not a big deal though , Loved the style the bed is extremely comfortable best shower ever lovely staff it feels like a 5 star hotel
299217,Chasse Hotel, The dance studio is next door and the music is really laud it ends at 9 00 9 30 p m Cleaning of the room was not done as it should there was still dirt on the floor the water in the cattle was in the balcony chairs were full of water in the afternoon from raining the night before , The room is big and a balcony was a plus Connections to the city center and museums are excellent 
299218,Chasse Hotel,No Negative, Hotel is pretty new and connection to tramp is very easy Just few m nutes then you are on adm ral Station to go to city center and most atractive places in amsterdam 
299219,Chasse Hotel, Before booking our stay I could see that there was a dance school right next to the hotel I was not aware however of how noisy the school was and how much it could be heard from the hotel rooms Between the hours of 8am and 4pm noises can be heard which can be quite loud and can make it hard to sleep through if you want a lie in , The staff were very friendly I had asked them to decorate the room for my partner s birthday which they did at an extra cost The bed was extra comfy The hotel itself was a 2 minute walk from the tram stops which made it easy to get to Dam Square 
299220,Chasse Hotel, The hotel is bit noisy you can hear people in the hallways or taking a shower in adjacent room No fridge Windows are locked and can t be opened Bit off from other hotels and main sights this can be a plus if you want quieter neighbourhood , Spacious room with comfortable bed Quiet A C Very friendly staff Nice bikes for rent although bit more expensive than in the city 
299221,Chasse Hotel, It was quite new and we did not have a fridge in the room That would have been nice , I liked the staff they were friendly and helpful I also liked the bathroom shower 2 alternative strengths 
299222,Chasse Hotel, Would have loved the complimentary snacks replaced on cleaning day would be great if the bikes at hotel weren t more expensive then those on the streets the wifi and telly were having issues over our stay but it wasn t a big deal The only thing really I missed having was a fridge and real milk being English I m partial to a cup of tea , Loved the wine which I paid for but was kindly organised snacks in the room huge comfy bed and the hire of bikes from the hotel Super friendly staff beautiful room 
299223,Chasse Hotel, There is a gym right above the whole floor They practice between 9 00 16 00 except Saturday and Sunday I didn t bother us but it surely can bother someone that stays in the room during those hours , Extra comfortable bad large room and very good facilities Staff is great very nice and helpful 
299224,Chasse Hotel,No Negative, Gorgeous rooms incredibly comfortable beds and pillows great location and lovely and extremely helpful staff Couldn t ask for anything more And it is located in a fabulous part of Amsterdam that is not overrun by tourists yet still highly convenient to the center 
299225,Chasse Hotel, A little too far from city centre and unfortunately restaurant was not yet open Buongiorno a nearby Italian restaurant was recommended for breakfast When we went there the lady who was in charge was so unhelpful and rude we actually left and went to Bar Spek further down the street which was a delightful little place , Lovely comfortable clean hotel staff really friendly and helpful
299226,Chasse Hotel, There are full of amenities in the room only missed a hair dryer , Staffs at the Chasse hotel are very nice friendly and helpful Location is reachable easily to famous spots in Amsterdam Spacious bathroom and comfy bed 
299227,Chasse Hotel, The hotel was still not complete when I stayed so it was unfortunate that there were no breakfast facilities at the time we stayed There is quite a lot of noise both from the church bell and from what I think were children in the dance school I would suggest that a higher floor room would reduce the noise from the children if you were concerned , Lovely rooms in a nice location a little outside the hustle and bustle of the city centre Rooms were beautiful and felt light and airy Staff were very friendly and happy to help with any inquiries Excellent links on the tram straight into the city Would definitely stay here again if I visit Amsterdam again
299228,Chasse Hotel, Like I mentioned the hotel is fairly new so little glitches are expected We had some issues with the original room we booked bathroom lights and air conditioning we understand that some things still need to be checked and fixed but it does not invalidate our experience The staff promptly solved the problem moving us to a much better room I think it is one of the best rooms I ve ever stayed in Althow I mentioned all this in the did not like session I think it might be a positive point since we were not disappointed at all with our stay and I can t think of another thing I didn t like , The hotel is fairly new 2 months according to the frontdesk lady and it s really beautiful The red carpet on the entrance makes you feel like a Hollywood star The room is amazing we got some goodies chocolates pringles water glass bottles Good bathroom size specially showers which we had problems with really tiny ones in other countries of our Eurotour bed is confy and towels feel like new not those old hotels that have towels you feel it was washed over and over and over The staff is really friendly helpful and polite and they can speak English all of them It s a quiet neighbourhood but it s pretty close to tram and bus stops 
299229,Chasse Hotel,No Negative, The staff were extremely nice and very accommodating The room was brand new Nice touches like chocolate on your pillow and snacks in the room It s a fairly new hotel in a sweet little neighborhood in Amsterdam I will recommend to friends 
299230,Chasse Hotel, Bit disappointed that restaurant wasn t open as it was supposed to be Stated when we booked would be up and running but wasn t completed when we arrived , Fantastic sized rooms with plenty of storage 
299231,Chasse Hotel, No fitness center, The hotel was wonderful and the staff was very friendly and accommodating The building was so impressive as it had formerly been a church and you still hear the church bells on the hour High tech lighting lots of amenities the breakfast buffet was excellent 
299232,Chasse Hotel,No Negative, our stay was GREAT comfortable easy accessable hotel Completely new everything perfect And we were greeted by bottle of wine at arrival Great Holland hospitality 
299233,Chasse Hotel,No Negative, Newly opened hotel part of a church conversion property Fresh decor spacious rooms Bright and airy Very friendly and helpful staff Bike hire at hotel a plus 
299234,Chasse Hotel, Dirty water glasses had to wash them before use No refrigerator , Eveyrthing was great comfortable bed nice curtains to blackout any day light perfect if you want to take a nap before the partying Tram stop is 2 minutes walk from the hotel 10 minute tram ride to city centre Great and helpful staff 
299235,Chasse Hotel, Thre was nothing really we did not like Brilliant location 7 minute walk from the canals wonderful staff scrupulously clean instant friendly service what is not to like , This little boutique hotel is simply superb all newly renovated and the staff are incredibly helpful welocming and nice We could not find any fault at all with it Rooms are superb and the bathrooms especially also a beautiful terrace outside our first floor room 
299236,Chasse Hotel, Would have liked more hot options at breakfast but it was the first weekend the restaurant has been open so I m sure it will improve, Lovely hotel clean and modern The staff go above and beyond to make sure guests are happy 
299237,Chasse Hotel, The building was still under construction so there were no breakfast or any meal services available , The room was very comfortable and modern very friendly staff and good location it was very easy to take the tram bus to main stations and tourist sites 
299238,Chasse Hotel, Restaurant was not operational hotel only opened in March 2017 this was not a major issue, Light airy well located rooms were spacious and facilities in the room excellent
299239,Chasse Hotel, The bathroom lights are on an motion sensor and turn off every 10 seconds if you stop moving Very annoying The Wifi kicks you off periodically and you have to relog on There is a kindergarden right next door and the kids play loudly starting around 8 am , The bed was comfy The staff was nice
299240,Chasse Hotel, The only thing that i can note is that is missing a place in the hotel to have a breakfast you have to walk until a reserved bar near the hotel about 300mt , The Hotel is really good connected with the center city because the main tram rail is to 200mt Very nice building kindly and professional assistance by the staff reception and top quality of the room and the cleaning activities Also the price is really competitive considering that you can arrive in 15min to Dam plaza and live the city center Really suggested thanks to the hotel staff from the 8 italian guys 
299241,Chasse Hotel, Still brand new so no breakfast options They gave us a welcome drink in the dance studio It was a bottle of vitamin water not my kind of welcome drink , New hotel so I think we landed a nice opening rate as it was way cheaper than anything in Amsterdam Don t be worried that on the map it might look out of town compared to other hotels the tram is super easy and everything is close by Love the old exterior of the hotel my parents had a suite and it had a great balcony 
299242,Chasse Hotel, Just a small minus the restaurant wasn t opened yet because the hotel was new so no breakfast was offered But anyway everything was fine , Everything was fine It was very kindly to offer coffee tea water and chips for free in the room I liked the location as well not really in the center I don t like places in the middle of all the noisy city centers but anyway near to the center even for a walk The personal was very friendly the room was very clean 
299243,Chasse Hotel, No breakfast but it s coming in two weeks we were told , We loved to size of rooms and terrace in the superior room Also the ladies in reception were exceptional and welcoming very informative the staff went out their way to insure we enjoyed our stay and visited Many Amsterdam attractions over the bank holiday weekend 
299244,Chasse Hotel, Most of the rest Not very clean unannounced absence of breakfast without extra time for checkout at 11h innacurate bill they claimed 20 euros more without justification The hotel is clearly unfinished and messed up , The location
299245,Chasse Hotel, Only minor points Small bath towels No bath soap dispenser only for the shower Noise from dance classes Not enough hangers for clothes , The hotel is excellent rooms and bathroom large and everything you need Bed is really comfy Staff very friendly and helpful Hotel will be even better when the restaurant opens Very near to tram stops Local restaurants and bars very good 
299246,Chasse Hotel, Could do with a fridge, Brand new hotel in a quieter part of town Room was very clean and the bed was huge with the best pillows Easy to find and it was around a 20 min walk into town 
299247,Chasse Hotel, The electrics kept flickering and one of the plugs stopped working I feel a mini fridge would have been great to keep drinks and snacks cool When the room was cleaned the water was not replaced and there was a few things that werent tidied , Comfortable bed didnt want to leave it it was lovely to wake up and sit out on the balcony and the pillow chocolates were thoughtful When we arrived it was all very clean Overall lovely room 
299248,Chasse Hotel, , room was nicely decorated can be considered luxurious complimentary drinks and snacks were available people were helpful internet connection was fast 
299249,Chasse Hotel,No Negative, Nice friendly staff willing to help New hotel opened two months ago very nice Great value for money 40mins from downtown Ams but it is not a problem because the neighbourhoods you pass walking to city center are great No restaurant yet but they have cooperation with around the corner cafe to enjoy breakfast Overall great
299250,Chasse Hotel, There was no breakfast on offer as the hotel is new and still having restaurant completed , Lovely hotel in quiet neighbourhood Really enjoyed the huge bathroom shower Would highly recommend and will be staying again in the future 
299251,Chasse Hotel, The restaurant that was supposed to be there was closed due to refurbishment so we had to always go out to eat , The staff were extremely friendly and helpful They made our experience in Amsterdam worthwhile 
299252,Chasse Hotel, Before we did the check out some lady from the staff come in our room before even the check out time she said sorry but she have to check before going inside any rooms,No Positive
299253,Chasse Hotel, The only fault I could give is the location being a fraction too far but this is all forgotten after hiring the bikes they have on offer You can be basically anywhere in town within 5 minutes when riding , The room was immaculately clean and very spacious The walk in shower was very big and the balcony gave a very nice outdoor area to relax 
299254,Chasse Hotel, I didn t mind that they didn t have a common area or hotel bar restaurant There are plenty restaurant bar cafes nearby , Location was great Friendly staff Very approachable small local hotel Clean comfortable and convenient 
299255,Chasse Hotel, nothing to mention, The hotel was really good with very friendly staff the room was awesome with very comfortable bed The location was 30 minutes from the center with foot 
299256,Chasse Hotel, It was a bit over priced , It was brand new and spotless It was really nice that the Hotel Manager left us a bottle of wine and a little card in our room saying hope you enjoy your stay nice touch All the staff were really helpful too 
299257,Chasse Hotel, Unfortunately no breakfast facility but that was known at the point of booking , Very comfortable room Coffee and tea available in the room Bathroom very spacious and nice Parking can be challenging in the evening 
299258,Chasse Hotel, The bed was slightly too hard and the pillows too big but that s just my preference as I have a bad back and prefer memory foam View wasn t great but can t really get much better in a residential location, The extra touches like free crisps nuts still and sparkling water chocolate on bed vanity kit tea coffee etc we re really nice We slept in very late one day and didn t leave the room until 330pm but the maid had still gone in and tidied our room Reception we re friendly The power shower was great
299259,Chasse Hotel, The staff in hotel is great everybody Very Very helpful very friendly , We love everything in hotel Hotel is great and great value for money have been paid The room and bathroom are big comfortable very clean and have everything and more The bed is the best what can be expected very comfortable for good sleep and the rest We loved the hotel so very much 
299260,Chasse Hotel, 1 The noise from dance studio can not rest if you have constant noise during the day 2 Because of new hotel was not ready restaurant for breakfast order only small cafe , I like building old church staff was polite Not so expensive for 4 star hotel new rooms with new furniture
299261,Chasse Hotel,No Negative, The room was a wonderful surprise when we walked in very spacious beautifully decorated which goes for the entire hotel best hotel bed I ve ever slept in and big bathroom with a great shower The staff was very friendly and always keen to help with any questions be it about the room or about food recommendations in the city When you arrive before check in or want to explore the city some more after checking out they safely store your luggage at the reception for as long as you want The tram station where you can take trams to Sloterdijk station and to the city centre is only a 5 minute walk away Even though there are no breakfast facilities and mini bar yet the hotel easily compensated this by offering two free drinks in the bar next door a breakfast deal in a nearby espressobar and coffee tea water and some snacks in the room so this didn t bother us at all Would certainly recommend 
299262,Chasse Hotel, Room was not soundproofed could here everything in the dance studio at a very early hour really not good but apparently this is being done very soon Couldn t open the window in standard room however this was rectified by being moved and very kindly upgraded to a superior room which had a balcony outside area Views from room not that great No breakfast option No room service No spa facilities apparently there will be a wellness centre which would complete it Facilities in room basic for example shower cap refreshments no mini bar etc Poor choice of tea coffee Where are your good coffee machines , Super comfy bed Delightful high grade cotton sheets Lovely furnishings Brand new hotel Great location Very close to public transport Also a decent and enjoyable walk into the centre Decorated beautifully Original features of the building maintained Staff very helpful Manager attentive Bikes to rent I was upgraded to a superior room which was stunning and very spacious Dance studio next door within same building I believe this hotel could easily be a 4 hotel if it added a few little touches and extras the decor and quality of the furniture and all in it are definitely 4 star I really enjoyed staying at this hotel and will definitely return to see if the amendments that I was told will happen have It is in a perfect location I enjoyed walking into town 30 minutes or so and getting the tram equally The staff were helpful and although everything is new and they have some teething problems I would not let this stop you booking as they did everything possible to make it a fantastic stay Thanks 
299263,Chasse Hotel, The hotel lacked any facilities they don t even serve breakfasts One should notice however that we were shown excellent place for breakfast in the close neighborhood , The staff was very friendly and helpful quiet neighborhood and room was excellent
299264,Chasse Hotel, Could not open windows Motion sensor lights are very annoying Go off very quickly so you have to constantly move to Leto them on in the bathroom , Great area Staff very nice 
299265,Chasse Hotel, Nothing onlynthing that could use a little work but not a complaint the timers for the lights were a little quick but just a quick movement and they were right back on , New place very nice room and the staff was super nice 
299266,Chasse Hotel, nothing, Staff super friendly and extremely accommodating Facilities not completed as of yet but we enjoyed our stay Bed and shower great plenty of hot water Walk up the street to the Tram stop 
299267,Chasse Hotel, The room has light motion sensor in corridor and bathroom which is a bit annoying that the light goes on every time you go to bathroom at night and stays on for a while As the hotel is very new without the constant flow of customers yet the room was a bit dusty felt like it was prepared couple of days in advance The hotel is related to dance studios so in my room I experienced noise from the dance classes However manager of the hotel was very considerate of my inconvenience and promised that this situation is going to be resolved with isolation of the dance studio in due time Overall nice hotel with amazing stuff but still needs time to get ready for customers For example I did not find a hair drier in my room this is kind of inappropriate for the 4 stars hotel , The hotel is very new so feels like you are first person who entered the room Rooms are very spacious with nice terrace and lounge chair Staff was extremely friendly At first I got a room with twin beds but they change the room immediately on my request Very polite and caring they offered us a 1 hour later check out and some sale for the next stay due to some inconveniences 
299268,Chasse Hotel,No Negative, As a welcome guest we got bottle of french wine free of charge Room was very commodious as well as bathroom Hotel staff were very complaisant with lots of information 
299269,Chasse Hotel, Was difficult trying to get from the airport to this hotel using public transport so ended up getting a taxi , The staff were lovely and so friendly room was really spacious and beds were so comfy Tram into dam square just across the road very easy to get about once you know what trams to get 
299270,Chasse Hotel, There is a dance scool under the hotel and they start to play loud music each morning around 10am , Good location comfortable and big room nice shower
299271,Chasse Hotel, The noise from the dance studio, It s a new hotel so the kitchen isn t ready yet The lady did say there s a cafe around the corner say your staying in chasse hotel and u get breakfast for 5 We had superior room and wow it was lovely it had a balcony aswell could sit outside with patio table and chairs There was just one thing that I didn t like because our room was on top of a dance studio we heard a piano every morning as if it was in the hallway and about 50 elephants dancing The hotel is in like a built up housing estate but only 5 10mins on a tram we got a taxi the first day just to see where it was 
299272,Chasse Hotel, Just with the fact the hotel has only been open 3 weeks and the restaurant wasn t yet complete Would ve saved a lot of money if I was able to eat within the hotel but liked the fact they offered discount at the italian restaurant just a short walk from the hotel , Amazing staff very friendly Rooms absolutely gleaming every day Also liked the option for the DND wait or clean option from the room My balcony was beautiful from my room also 
299273,Chasse Hotel, It s a bit outside of Amsterdam life Takes a tram to get here from anywhere We loved this property but we re surprised when dance class began above our room early in the morning It was so loud the people dancing just above our bed The staff was wonderful to move us to a new room but the new room was above the day care playground also very loud , Nice new hotel Gorgeous rooms Very spacious and comfortable We loved all of the restaurants we could get to closely 
299274,Chasse Hotel, We stayed for 3 nights in this so called 4 Hotel and I am quite disappointed They did not change the bed linen after the previous guest it was dirty and had hair on it the cups were dirty as well and the room was in dust the napkin box was empty We asked for clean bed sheets and we had to change them ourselves at midnight Although the reception guys promised that the next day they will make sure to clean the room and change the bed linen and the cups but guess what the next day we came to the 4 hotel room and nothing has been changed they did not change the bed linen they just took away the new bed sheets which we got from reception guys to somehow spend the first night the cups were dirty from the previous guest and the room in dust Besides that the windows were locked and we were not able to air the room They are newly opened hotel and they definitely need to improve their service I had the impression that I have stayed in a cheap hostel but not in a 4 hotel , Only the bathroom was nice and the mattress was comfortable
299275,Chasse Hotel,No Negative, Personel was really nice and friendly The hotel is in a quiet and relaxing neighborhood away from chaotic side of Amsterdam Centraal The rooms are spacious and the bed was very comfy Recommended 
299276,Chasse Hotel,No Negative, From the moment I walked in at reception I was surprised Friendly effective and informative staff Check in was quick The room was an even greater surprise Very spacious not only to Amsterdam standards but in general Ample space for luggage and enough drawers Bathroom also very spacious The decor in rooms and right through the property is modern and very attractive The are is quiet and very close to the tram station I liked everything about this hotel 
299277,Chasse Hotel, The room price is too expensive for the facilities available at the property There is no bar or restaurant and breakfast is not included It is also located beside a school and it was very noisy outside from the early morning The property itself is unfinished , My room was very comfortable and clean The staff at the front desk were very helpful and welcoming 
299278,Chasse Hotel, The toiletries where in dispenser only close to sink and shower cabin but far from bath tub A few things where missing at start but issue was fixed very fast , Friendly stuff and very helpful Large and comfortable bed Relaxing in the bath tub for an hour after a very busy day was great
