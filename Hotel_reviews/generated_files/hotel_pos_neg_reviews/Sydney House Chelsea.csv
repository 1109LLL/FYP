257812,Sydney House Chelsea, The standard rooms are too small to be really comfortable however I do understand that this is London and space Some staff were fabulous but I do feel they were let down by colleagues who couldn t muster a smile which makes it hard for me to give it an outstanding rating on that front , What sells this property is the location Location wise this property is top notch Property looks great outside and everything s clean inside 
257813,Sydney House Chelsea, Room a bit cramped Hot water supply tepid particularly at popular shower times Air conditioning reluctant to work Gave up trying and opened the window which sorted the problem At the price these faults should not have been there , Location Friendly helpful staff Breakfast 
257814,Sydney House Chelsea, The rooms are small Air conditioning poor No fridge or tea cofffe making facility in room Lift was a tight squeeze for the two of us we are very slim , Location nothing else to like
257815,Sydney House Chelsea, The room and common spaces in general are too small narrow Relation price room is not balanced For the rate applied the services of the hotel and facilities Ex 1 person luggage elevator are a bit poor Breakfast too expensive , The staff is kind and hotel well communicated Even small well designed room 
257816,Sydney House Chelsea, I had specifically asked for a quiet room The room I was in had a laminate wood floor and I suspect others next to and around it also did Whilst overall it was quiet suddenly I d be woken up by others moving They probably weren t making a huge amount of noise but because of the laminate flooring the sound really carried In addition to that the bed has a wooden frame around it and creaks every time you move loudly enough to wake you up I had chosen to stay in London as I had a social engagement in town that night and thought I would be better rested the next day if I didn t commute home after it and back in to London early the next day I all honesty it was probably the worst night s sleep I ve ever had Added to that the fire alarm went off just after 6 a false alarm but the man working had no idea what to do Really disappointed as I ve stayed here before and had a good stay , The trip was part business part leisure The hotel is very close to where I work so ideally situated for me 
257817,Sydney House Chelsea, Its a premium boutique hotel bordering on luxury I d recommend some expansion at your bar to include some Cognac , This boutique hotel is in the perfect spot quiet street minutes from SK tube close to good restaurants a bars The reception team ensure a slick transition whether checking in or out Room 10 very comfortable bright with 2 French Doors to small balcony Its simply a really pleasant experience

257829,Sydney House Chelsea, This is not a negative comment on the hotel as one needs to keep in mind it s a historic building in London so expect a lack of space Room was small and the elevator can fit only one person with one luggage the stairs were a bit old and steep so I would not recommend this to people with limited mobility , This is a lovely boutique hotel in the heart of South Ken Chelsea area 5min walk to the South Kensington station and 5min walk to King s Road Wonderful hotel location and pleasant staff Our room was very small but the bed was very comfortable bathroom great amazing toiletries better than most 5star in London Overall great value for money I would stay here again next time and just choose a bigger room It was only a half hour ride to Heathrow

257837,Sydney House Chelsea, We upgraded to a balcony room which I regret as we only did that for space but our room was tiny in comparison to our friend s who had not paid extra It was very noisy and you could hear everything happening in the room above , Lovely cute hotel right in the heart of Chelsea Friendly staff new and clean rooms 
257838,Sydney House Chelsea, small lift was out of use at 9am for sole use of housekeeping stsff inconvenient for my disabled wife as we were located on the fourth floor gin and tonics ordered in the bar were served in separate glasses one for gin and one for tonic more bar training needed for otherwise kind and considerate staff, friendly staff ideal location

257851,Sydney House Chelsea, Breakfast was amazing although it would be nice to see the same kind of variety in food with the rest of the menu The rooms were really comforting however I thought a double twin bedroom would be two separate beds however it was only two separate mattresses still pushed together on one bed which was a bit disappointing so I would reccomend having some bedding options Other than that the room was amazing , The bedroom was open and light yet comfortable to be in with an amazing view The staff were very helpful and kind The food was very nice especially breakfast The atmosphere of the hotel is very relaxing Would definitely reccomend 
257852,Sydney House Chelsea, I didn t like that b fadtcwasnt included and the prices for food were ridiculously high B fast with no boiled egg for 15 pounds A full English b fast for 20 pounds Ridiculous and insulting , Nice staff cozy hotel Price was reduced otherwise I wouldn t have booked

257857,Sydney House Chelsea, Room 8 suffers from noise travelling from other rooms such as the creaking floor boards in the room above and noise from the running baths shower which is especially irritating if guests arrive late into the night ie after midnight , The deluxe double bedroom ensuite was small but decorated and furnished to a high standard Attention to details such as black out blinds and privacy blinds double glazing and well maintained d cor The staff are very welcoming and helpful 
257858,Sydney House Chelsea,No Negative, I found the hotel cosy and clean Plus with booking com the place was a good value for money However when I tried to extend the stay the cost per night went up exorbitantly making it completely not worth the price for the size and type of hotel it is I did not extend obviously 
257859,Sydney House Chelsea, No complaints, The staff is awesome and helpful finding the place you want to see The room was very quiet with no disturbance from other rooms and the a c was rocking cold 
257860,Sydney House Chelsea, The bathtub was very dangerous I stepped in and it is tiny space on a slope and I slipped on the mat and fell completely Surprised I made it without a bruise etc for safety they need to put a walk in shower and get rid of the tub The most dangerous tub I have ever been in Huge step to get in etc a real problem Also the first floor room is tiny tiny , Staff was terrific and the entry bar and coffee was a nice amenity Location superb

257877,Sydney House Chelsea,No Negative, This is a return visit Sydney House has to be the very best boutique hotel in London and indeed beyond We have returned here a couple of times even extended our stay and there is a reason for that Quality of staff quality of service professionalism and simply it is a high quality townhouse hotel that manages to create a home from home atmosphere Our work in music involves various hours so we often come and go at different times of the day and this was never an issue We have stayed in many hotels and certainly Sydney House can hold its place with the best five star

257880,Sydney House Chelsea, Very noisy Lack of carpeting in the bedrooms mean that every journey made by the occupant of the room upstairs whether to the loo or what sounded rather like a body being dragged back and forth across the floor by an elephant wearing stilettos will be shared by you If you aren t bothered about noise the hotel is fine , Comfy beds and pleasant staff great location
257881,Sydney House Chelsea, The bedroom could be slightly bigger, The staff went out of their way to make our stay pleasant the hotel was really clean the interior very pleasing the bedlinen was perfect pure crisp white cotton Great area to stay all in all really nice
