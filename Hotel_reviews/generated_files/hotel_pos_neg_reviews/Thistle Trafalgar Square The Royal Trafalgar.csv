508553,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Although we enjoy our breakfast on our many visits the toasting machine drives us crazy The machine you use must cost a fortune to run why not a simple toaster Our stay on this occasion was rather marred by the necessity to request a change of room which was dealt with promptly and efficiently The extreme temperature on this occasion being a SW facing room rather defeated the capacity of the air conditioning and a supplementary Fan Finally I usually book my stay by keying in to a regular user screen This time I came confused by what seemed to be a rogue site Booking com This company was eventually explained on check in With the current concern with internet fraud one gets a bit nervous in such circumstances ,No Positive

508566,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, The toilet was pointing in the wrong direction so that your knees were pressed up again the shower door instead of facing into the bathroom where there would have been more room to sit down It s a shame there is no bar but you can still have a drink so it wasn t a problem , Loved the big comfy bed and the view of Nelson s Column The anniversary card chocolates and bottle of prosecco were a lovely touch

508575,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Tiny rooms and terrible design in regards to luggage storage no room at all for it and we were tripping over suitcases and we pack lightly We transferred to the Hilton on Queen s Gate after a few days the room was the same size but they put a lot of thought into having nightstand storage and a luggage cabinet in the room , Bed comfy staff friendly location excellent very clean and quiet

508578,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, The only thing we found wrong with this type of room I E A junior suite the bathroom was too small no room to move around , The hotel was situated in the right place Met with all my requirements
508579,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Very outdated no bar and a very small seating area in reception My room 603 looked straight into the windows of around five other rooms Much better hotels in London for that sort of money , Not much
508580,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Although the overall impression of the hotel was of moderate luxury I thought more could be done to develop the restaurant and bar facilities , The location and the room were excellent
508581,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Room was replenished after our first day with only one towel which we didn t realise till after my husband finished his shower No replenishment of tea coffee milk etc A nuisance rather than a drama but it s the small things that let down what could have been a 100 experience , Responsive friendly staff for any issue Comfortable small bar area to meet friends before heading to the theatre again with good staff Excellent location for accessing all that London has to offer

508583,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, I think the hotel could offer a choice of continental or full English breakfast as it was the same price no matter what you wanted to eat But the staff were very helpful and offered us a coffee and Danish for 5 instead of 12, Rooms very clean and well heated
508584,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar,No Negative, Very comfortable Hotel conveniently situated for theatre visits I liked the relaxed atmosphere within the hotel and the helpfulness of the staff Very nice breakfast 
508585,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, it was not worth 240 a night it was mediocre I have been to much better hotels for half the price i had to ask for more tea bags as 2 are not enough for 2 nights so they gave me 4 , it was very central
508586,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, The room was very underwhelming Whilst I felt the location was good this was extremely overpriced The bathroom was smaller than that of student accommodation , The location was good

508589,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Shower was small and awkward to use Woken up by noise of other guests showering and opening doors There is a building site directly next to the hotel This did not bother us as there were no workers on Sunday but could be an issue during the week, Large comfy bed and really good location
508590,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, I thought the room at 211 was expensive for what we got the shower was hard pressure The beds were two singles pushed together so you have a lump in the middle the view was absolutely awful and there was rubbish out on the ledge bit I didn t realise but apparently the guy Fawkes night where people run through the streets was on sat night making the night time rubbish and I hated the room if it was half decent I wouldn t have minded staying in there Staff should warn people of that night and you should make it clear so to sum up hated the room hated the view hated the shower part and hated that I didn t know anything about this firework rampage Not very happy at all I wish I had stayed further out to be honest , The reception staff were welcoming
508591,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Sofa bed was dreadful for my guests I will be writing a letter of complaint about this The hotel rooms were grubby One Reception worker told me I couldn t move room as i wanted to open the windows I slept uncomfortably for three nights then my collleague staying there said her windows Opened so when I asked again they said it was only my floor where the windows did not open Bathroom too small No toilet brush Water not topped up The whole thing was a mess ,No Positive

508595,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, We didn t like the look of the hotel from the outside Some of the staff were either rude or unhelpful We weren t aware that we had no breakfast in our order through Booking com and this was not made clear It made it a very expensive stay The picture we were sent of the room was misleading also and was very much smaller even though it was classed as a king size executive suite , The location was perfect The relationship manager did give us a change of rooms and complimentary prosecco for my partners special birthday I dread to think what the size of the room was like that we originally booked though 
508596,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Would have been nice to be able to open a window even if only a tiny bit Would have liked a couple more teabags coffee sachets and milks , Very comfy pillows Lovely bathroom and shower Good and quiet air conditioning

508603,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Crazy night person on street yelling at 3 am almost every night we were there Only half a shower door makes wet bath floor after every use Toilet did not flush without having to hold button for entire time and even then it did not flush all the toilet paper down I did have a repair person come to take a look at problem and he said that was the way it worked or didn t really , Great location to National Gallery Tube station resturants and theaters 
508604,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, I had traveled internationally and need to freshen up and change before my 11am meeting Unfortunately there were no facilities available for me to take a shower and change clothes before my room was ready No gym and the staff would not even allow me to use a shower in a room that had been vacated but not fully cleaned , Room was modern reasonably sized and the bed comfortable

508609,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, No security in elevator with room key Too loud reception did not pick up No password needed for internet so it was insecure Small room, Just ok The Thistle at Kensington gardens is much better
508610,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Bathroom toilet had no space in front of it the room had a stale cigarette smell when I first went in the TV channels were very limited not a smart TV and no access to USB or HDMI ports as mounted into the wall the TV remote was filthy I washed my hands every time I used it in case I caught an infection There was mould in the tile grouting of the shower cubicle Minor things but for the price paid one can t expect luxury , Quiet room on sixth floor they gave me a free upgrade to an executive room huge lovely bed probably super king size great air conditioning decent shower ironing board iron secure safe huge room great views over London the location was the massive draw factor so convenient for all the main London sights restaurants bars galleries etc The staff were very friendly and efficient especially the Indian lady at reception 
508611,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, I get the feeling the owner doesn t invest enough in property maintenance eg carpet cleaning refurbishing breakfast room furniture breakfast set up disfunctional when it s busy Also there seemed to be junior reception staff on duty with not much back up which made it hard for them as they seemed to be less knowledgeable about helping with travel tourism queries , Breakfast staff and room staff very cheerful
508612,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, We had some difficulty in getting taxis arranged by the staff but that is not their fault We could not understand this as the cabbies in London are pretty mad about UBER so you would think they would be grateful for the call We had one cabbie stop tell us he s the one they called and then tell us he wasn t picking us up No explanation The hotel was also pretty upset about this , The staff was amazing This property is in an EXCELLENT location between Trafalgar Square Leicester Square and the Warrick Theater our first stop Our first room was a bit small it was the room we had booked and the view out the window was not great When we inquired what else was available they showed us a larger king room for a bit more a night which was wonderful I have some mobility issues and the staff was excellent in making sure I was comfortable This room had air conditioning it was super hot in London when we were there elevator and was very well maintained Being American I love my ice and they always accommodated my wishes ice was free in a small amount but we did tip Our room was on the front side of the hotel with a view of the skyline Even so it was amazingly QUIET 
508613,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, The minibar fridge is available in the suites only All other rooms don t have it , We took a suite and an executive room We like the service that was provided by the kind and helpful staff and the unbeatable location An excellent hotel in 4 star category
508614,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, The bed which is bigger than a king size was too big for the room so it was hard to find a place to put our things , The staff was very friendly and helpful 
508615,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Limited tv channels slow room service then no condiments Biscuits could have been provided with tea coffee and more milk cartons Please think of finishing touches , Cleanliness of the room huge comfy bed and stylish bathroom 
508616,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, The windows were so dirty you could hardly see through them We were given a room which hadn t been cleaned to begin with No mini bar in room Cigarette butts all over ledge in front of window which had been dropped from above , Location was good
508617,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, The homeless element was in your face world wide issue their personal toilet habits was the issue to step around not nice but not the hotel s fault, The location was terrific We could walk to all the big ticket tourist attractions like the Thames embankment Buckingham Palace West End shows National Gallery Big Ben Picadilly Circus amidst Trafalgar Square
508618,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, The pastries could have been warm instead of cold, the staff are excellent remembered us The best location close to everything Which is why we stay with you every time we are in London
508619,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, The lounge bar is now used as a meeting room unacceptable for a 4 star hotel not to even have a bar just chairs in the lobby I used to like to eat in there in the evening There is no BBC4 on TV Could not watch a lot of the Olympics , Location and size of hotel have stayed there many times for this although I think it is overpriced 
508620,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, bed was not very comfortable and the facility is quite old They had steps ups and down in the corridors which makes luggage movement a bit hicktek , Staff was nice and helpful and location is just great 
508621,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, there was confusion with breakfast service in that was there a free breakfast credit according to check in staff yes but according to breakfast host hostess no so I was never sure The charges were paid by family members staying in an adjacent room so I never saw any charges personally for the meals , Very clean and comfortable and great location 
508622,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Our room was not cleaned until 4 30 in the afternoon This was a little inconvenient since we had come back to the room to change for the eventing We had been out all day touring We had to go wait in the lobby for a while until they were finished , This hotel is in a nice location Walking distance to several tube stations and many attractions The staff was very friendly and helpful The rooms were comfortable 
508623,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, This hotel had been one of the WORST experiences I ever had They have absolutely no tenant respect and don t know what room privacy is at all They just barge in your room day or night whether you have the Do not disturb sign or not It could be a man a women or the cleaning crew that opens the door without ringing the bell The rooms aren t as website shows the bathroom is literally 2m square and you could forget any maneuvering space You can ignore the hotel restaurants or the room service you re better off getting McDonald s takeaway than eating in here I blame bookings com for their review and images as they were false and misguiding and would never waste my money on this hotel ever again Shame on you bookings com and shame on this hotel that doesn t deserve the Royal or the Hotel in its name ,No Positive
508624,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Overcharged Price charged was nearly 300 more than quoted on booking Com While ut was refunded it was only after I spotted it and should not have happened, Good location good rooms
508625,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Wash basin plug needs adjusting water flows straight through Shower door doesn t close properly allowing water to escape onto the floor Minor problems I know but easy to sort out so should be dealt with , On line booking very easy Staff very helpful Good value breakfast 
508626,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, The room photograph was misleading When I protested about that I just was told there was nothing they would do about that and that I would have to pay a further 20 a night to upgrade No refrigerator in the room which for that price there should have been Never any response when I rang down for room service Desk staff just incompetent Menu at their restaurant very limited Hall way carpets smelled musty , The room too which I upgraded because the one first offered was tiny was adequate 
508627,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Bed was slightly firmer than I like and pillows a bit uncomfortable More my taste than any fault of the hotel , The location of the hotel can t be beaten Right behind the national gallery Decor is simple and modern and we felt at home Shower also great 
508628,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Thought price very expensive for what was on offer Breakfast at that price should have been included Bed massive but a little short , Location brilliant for theatre and sightseeing Very large bed Extra paid Well worth it Breakfast although extra very good value 
508629,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, I did not like that the sofa bed was not made up and they did not have linen provided When we discovered that it was not made I was given a lecture about it being on request only Why have a sofa bed in the room if you don t expect people to use it The other thing was the stairs I had hurt my back a few days prior I even told the check in person but when she gave us our room number there were several sets of stairs to navigate and no one offered to help with my large bag I would have expected that from a luxury hotel which is a brand they use for themselves , I liked that this hotel was located within minutes to the Prince of Wales Theatre it made our late night easy to get home 
508630,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, The bed was uncomfortable it felt like 2 beds pushed together Check out time was 12 midday however a cleaner tried coming into the room before this time ,No Positive
508631,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Nothing to complain about other than toilet could ve flushed better and bath didn t drain too well , Great location Reasonable price Quiet Comfortable room and friendly helpful staff 
508632,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, 2nd stay here for business 1st time was not too bad so booked again for ease of location for my business visit giving them a second chance Hell never again Upon arrival they didn t have my reservation then asked to see my confirmation about 4 times on my phone making me feel I was some guy who just turned up off the street then was told that the credit card machine was not working so took down my card number and was told this would be processed the next day Following morning when checking out was told to make payment for the room told the receptionist that I had paid when I checked the day before but she told me no payment was processed so gave her card to make payment Later checked my statement to see that I have been charged the first time when I checked in and then charged again checking out Went back to hotel and was told by the receptionist that I will just have to wait 5 days for it to be credited back into my account YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED Double check that you have not been charged twice Overall stay was average stayed in better hotels bathroom very horrible cracked tiles loose grout from the floor tiles horrible dirty yellow stained bath tub and shower curtain TV in room was not looked after remote control not working TV stations is a joke Horrible building site view from window Never be back again , Easy for train and tube
508633,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Very tired place I mean inside and facilities rooms tired and very small curtains cannot be fully used so if you need curtains closed you will have a big problem Stuff is ok but it depends My girlfriend asked for a comb and reply was no In hotel where standard room cost more than 300 GBP this is a joke Another thing is that on one side is construction site and if you get this side eg all suites be sure you will wake up on 7AM It could be a good place if it s for half price otherwise it must be rebuild from scratch to return Breakfast is awful , This hotel may have the best location in London Unfortunately that s all 
508634,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Bar service slightly slow coffee and croissants took a while to arrive , We felt welcome and valued were upgraded when we told them we were repeat visitors lovely room Friendly staff Excellent croissants when they eventually arrived

508636,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Couldn t have expected anything better for the price good value hotel Swimming pool and balconies would have been nice but that s not a reasonable expectation for price charged , Good full cooked breakfast comfortable room in good location
508637,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Price tooooooo high but not really worth the price And the bath tab was very very very hard to use The water pressure was either too strong or not stable And the fan in the toilet was not working It seems that the maintenance team didn t come to check it even I had reported And in the first night one of the lamps was not working , Staff are helpful 
508638,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, My husband felt the residents bar should ve stayed open longer , This hotel can t be beat for location a stones throw to Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery walking distance to Big Ben and Houses of Parliament Westminster Abbey Whitehall the Mall Buckingham Palace Soho Covent Garden with so many restaurants and bars etc also the main Parks Just a couple of minutes to the tubes Charing cross and Piccadilly staff very helpful and friendly helped us with directions etc also it was our anniversary and we got a room upgrade a card and chocolates very impressed
508639,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Nothing, Stayed here for one night on my birthday On hearing this when we checked in we were upgraded to a bigger room and on our return after a night out found a surprise birthday card and complimentary chocolates in our room Staff went out of their way to be helpful Only a few minutes walk to Leicester Square but on a side street so very quiet Would definitely stay here again 
508640,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Had to pay extra for breakfast the dining area was noisy from chair making a noise on the floor staff did not seam to know what they where doing Toilet blocked and was embarrassing to say at reception ,No Positive

508646,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Housekeeping wasn t impressive and bathroom sink was extremely small water would go all over the place whenever you wash your hands or face, Location was convenient
508647,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, The price of the continental breakfast is crazy over priced when compared to the full English which is also ridiculously expensive I didn t have the choice of a full English as I was running the marathon and had to eat before 7 30 , A certain staff member at front of house took extra effort in making sure my small requests were met to help me with my stay with the marathon in mind Thank you 
508648,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, For a foreigner it is difficult to understand very fast speaking non english personnel in the reception Everything correct but not a warm feeling However super service from the guy helping to catch a taxi but not so easy to understand him My suggestion is that more attention should be given to the language from some of the staff Or employ british personel , Fantastic location nice rooms 
508649,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar,No Negative, Hotel is very well located for a visit to the center of London the room was clean although a bit smaller than other rooms we have had on previous visits
508650,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Can t think of anything although I don t know about parking as we travelled by train tube , Room was small but comfortable as was the bed Staff were excellent frendly and helpful but not pushy it was my 60th birthday while we were there and we returned to the room to find a complimentary bottle or wine and a birthday card from the hotel Position is excellent just around the corner from Trafalgar Square 
508651,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, The food was awful There are Hungarian cooks in the kitchen please let them cook their native foods and the clientele will love the hotel even more and they will not have to fine elsewhere to eat every day , The staff were excellent especially Lily the manager was very professional and always helpful Lazlo was also excellent nothing was too much trouble 
508652,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, The TV system was not working very well with only a limited range of channels and confusing controls I understand that changes were under way and that all should be fine next time I come , Relatively easy to get around I now have to use a stick and quiet Reasonable menu choices for vegetarians

508694,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, The room was small for an executive twin room and although the shower was excellent I think a room at 250 a night should have a bath Some noise transfer from other rooms as the building is not that new but fortunately quiet guests , Excellent quiet location we pulled in three shows and meals out within walking distance Friendly staff Room nicely refurbished with comfortable beds

508703,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, I shared an executive twin room with my other sister and was not impressed that this was called executive It did not look anything like the picture which was on booking com and there were very few pictures of the bathroom to see on line I would have liked to have seen a standard twin room to compare The toilet was placed in such a position that you had to sit on it sideways and my sister could not get wi fi on her phone , Was grateful that my sister s room was upgraded as she had a very bad knee and leg so would have been difficult to move around a small room Also liked the fact that the hotel had a restaurant liked the breakfast but there was not a big variety of dinner choices

508715,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, Rooms Extremely small no room even for 1 suitcase No drawers SMALL desk with LARGE chair with wheels that stuck out tripping as one squeezed by Large cubical lamp which took up the only possible space for a suitcase Moldy shower Staff not happy perhaps due to recent sale of property Overbearing Maintenance guy A publicly chewed out a cleaning lady in large loud voice Horrible person , Great Location central to most London activities

508718,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, The bar staff were poor they obviously didn t want to serve us as they were closing we did enquire if it was still ok to get a drink at 11 50pm They decided that we had ordered doubles and therefore our bill was extortionate for four drinks , The receptionist Lola was extremely helpful and polite Patricia in the restaurant for breakfast couldn t do enough for you

508722,Thistle Trafalgar Square The Royal Trafalgar, There was a major building site right next door which was a surprise The noise didn t affect us but access routes to the hotel were disrupted lined with barriers which doesn t give a very good impression of the location There was an early morning fire alarm evacuation from the hotel caused by a guest using an alarmed door The event wasn t very well managed by the night shift staff or the local fire brigade who were slow to turn up on foot presumably because they didn t know about the building works , Friendly and helpful staff and good central location
