54026,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Road repair was going on at the curb in front of the hotel , This was in a great location Museums on the corner and fancy car shops on the high street While out doing touristy things the Pelham fairies cleaned our rooms and created a beautiful welcoming place to come back to 
54027,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The room was meant to be spacious and have two single beds it wasn t and it was one normal sized double bed which I shared with my daughter Not arriving to go in the room until 9pm after a day at Wimbledon I was just pleased to get in the room so didn t query it I have previously stayed at the Ampersand and I would return there next time much bigger room and much better value for money on that basis , The building and its decor is maintained to a high standard The staff were friendly and helpful 
54028,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Breakfast was not included No tea coffee making facilities in the room asked for at reception but not delivered Room smaller than expected from pictures on line no bigger than rooms booked at other London hotels near Hyde Park for half the price Poor value for anyone on a tight budget even at the supposed discounted price No lift to our room stairs only , Location very close to South Kensington tube station and short walking distance to Museums and Royal Albert Hall 
54029,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Nothing not to like, We were offered an upgrade to a junior suite which was unexpected and very welcome The room was beautifully appointed and spacious Extremely comfortable bed and bedding Excellent bathroom and facilities Fabulous location across the street from South Kensington station and many cafes and shops 
54030,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, My room had a bad smell Wanted to change no room in the same category available Upgrade refused No check from the staff I asked for a solution no one bothered In 5 days I ended up getting a room refresher myself Breakfast basic No egg offer Omelette etc ,No Positive
54031,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Excellent location with buses taxis and train within 30m Great room friendly staff Walk to VA Museum Hyde Park RAH Harrods etc Liked that it was in a more residential part of the city and not as touristy
54032,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Breakfast service were very friendly but food a little slow , Lovely room great decor not your usual creative artistic Very friendly relaxed staff 
54033,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The k bed was nice but the mattress was not very comfortable The original triple room we booked was very small we were traveling with 18 year old granddaughter there simplely was too small for 3 people we then upgraded at considerable cost to the jr suite , A beautiful hotel very elegant Although we booked a triple room we ended up staying in a Jr Suite The bathroom was luxerous especially the shower absolutely the best We had the hotel high tea and was everything we expected 
54034,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, No facility to make a hot drink in the room, Brilliant location opposite a station near a pub and local caf s and a short walk to the museums and Royal Albert Hall 
54035,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Wall Isolation is a bit insufficient , The room is very clean and comfortable the hotel staffs are very nice polite and very helpful very good location We are very happy our stay in this hotel will definitely come back 
54036,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Room wasn t ready when we got there it was nearly 3pm by the time we could go to the room Check in was supposed to be from 2pm Had to request a tray for tea and coffee making facilities did not realise this was an option on first night , Excellent location just across the road from South Kensington tube station Lots of places to eat in the neighbourhood Good for the Albert Hall and the V A Museum Lovely room and very comfortable bed very quiet 
54037,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Unfortunately the on site restaurant does not live up to its chic decor while staff is charming service is bad and food uninspiring I m not even sure there is an on site kitchen or chef got the impression that the wait staff disappears somewhere and puts food together With wonderful restaurants in the area avoid this one , Beautiful comfortable small hotel in the English style may not be for everyone If you are looking for a big flashy hotel in London don t go here On the other hand if you want a quirky elegant private home away from home book it 
54038,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Located in a perfect spot near South Kensington tube station The reception was very helpful troughtout the stay they picked up the delivery on our behalf the room was very quiet cozy with comfortable beds We recomend an italian restaurant at the hotel serving delicious meal We recommend 100 
54039,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Front facing rooms can be nosy due to traffic , Decor great staff very helpful room size and bathrooms good for London First night stayed in room in front of hotel which was noisy due to traffic We moved to a back facing room which was excellent Breakfast at hotel very pricey but there are numerous patisseries and cafes across street I recommend Paul 
54040,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The only issue was the overwhelming fragrance coming from the deodorizing pots of fragrance that were placed around the building Not good for anyone with respiratory sensitivities , A beautiful well appointed property luxurious bathroom with full size tub and excellent service Directly across from a tube station and tons of places to eat Double paned glass on the windows so pretty quiet on the street side 
54041,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, i stayed in a spacious room with high ceilings the only drawback was that i heard sometimes footsteps above I think the property itself is older and they still used wooden flooring so that could have been it but everything else being great overruled that small nuisance , great stay
54042,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, There was an unfortunate bungle regarding our Viator booked sunrise trip to Stonehenge Bath and a mediaeval village that day before we left I had arranged for a wake up at 4 00am so we could meet the tour coach at 5 00am Someone forgot to tell someone we were not woken and missed our tour but after a phone call we did manage to catch an afternoon trip to Stonehenge instead The afternoon weather was perfectly clear and sunny the experience very satisfying and we realized that this was probably the better outing in the end So please know that we did what we needed and enjoyed our London days , Breakfasts were excellent Big variety in the selection Also had a gourmet dinner one night that was amazing Excellent service was unobtrusive friendly and helpful Even 10 year old enjoyed the food 
54043,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Our room was not available when we arrived to check in at 3pm even though check in is 2pm The receptionist told us they were busy that day I didn t see why them being busy meant they couldn t have our room ready in time for check in Also this is the first time I have stayed at a UK hotel with no tea and coffee making facilities You can but a tea or coffee there for around 3 each but you can t make one in the room , Good location for our evening at the Albert Hall 
54044,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, nothing i am a picky traveller but there was nothing to complain about, excellent very friendly and professional staff made me feel very welcome nice room comfortable bed excellent restaurant overall an amazingly positive experience i have stayed in many 5 star hotels in london this was one of the best 
54045,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The Wi Fi connection could be poor at times , If you are looking for a quiet boutique hotel situated within a great location in London The Pelham Hotel is the right place The staff are friendly and so helpful everyone is willing to go an extra mile for their guests Everything was good I mean it was my third stay there and I have no regrets I will be back again 
54046,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Only staying one night I wish we had stayed for longer , Fantastically friendly and helpful staff Very comfortable room We were in a hurry to eat as we were attending a concert at the Albert Hall so we decided to eat in La Trattoria Best decision the food was sublime and Marco a welcoming informative and enthusiastic host Breakfast was also of the same excellent standard 
54047,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, the front desk one of the clerks was not helpful or friendly Ewin is great though , Beautiful boutique hotel with style and charm Great bed and linens Lovely bath products 
54048,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Very central location which makes it easy to go anywhere around in London Very nice and caring staff and a great restaurant if you feel like having a break while visiting London 
54049,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Very small room 3rd bed was a little cot at the end of the bed ok for a child maybe but not very impressive for an adult , Beautifully appointed and olde world English charm
54050,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Wooden walls and floors tend to amplify noises from confining rooms, English nostalgia at its best in the former college dormitory neatly appointed with all cons in a classic 19th Century setting Rooms and bathrooms are on the small side yet furnished with all the quality and accessories of a 5 star hotel The hotel is just across the road from South Kensington underground station taking full advantage of its enviably central location 
54051,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, The hotel is gorgeous with cozy elegant rooms beautiful bathrooms and very friendly staff There are two sitting rooms on the ground floor where you can have a drink that are so beautiful you almost don t want to get out of the hotel Location is perfect just steps away from South Kensington tube station 
54052,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Beautiful furnishings throughout the hotel and a very comfortable bed Particularly liked the honesty bar in the sitting room nice trustful touch Great range of bars cafes and restaurants nearby 
54053,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Some machine noise all night long at least I think so outside our window into the alley Like some air conditioning or something We decided not to be bothered , Breakfast was very good Bed comfortable and what a treat to have it made ready for the night when you come after an evening at the restaurant or the cinema or the musical They say across the road from the underground and it is Heathrow to South Kensington no change and bother with your bags between trains and only 10 min longer 
54054,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Nothing , Very friendly and helpful staff amazing hotel comfortable and nicely decorated rooms public transport right outside the door many coffee shops and caf s 
54055,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, I booked this hotel more than two months in advance to make sure I have the best hotel in this location The hotel claims to have 5 stars and although I ve never stayed there before I have good memories after staying in another Starhotel in Genoa which by the way has 4 stars So I was hoping this one will be much better However when we arrived it appeared to be a tiny hotel occupying a part of a 5 floor building sharing it with a bank We arrived on Sat noon and since the room was not ready yet we dropped the luggage and went to the city till evening The surprise was when we came back and our room appeared to be on the top floor However it was not a penthouse room Roof tops have lower ceilings and inclined upper part of walls which make the room smaller Besides curtains are hung at this position and are so close to the bed that it was very difficult not to step on it when getting up from bed The room was so small that if yo lie on the bed it was possible to reach the window up and from the other side of the bed you can open the bathroom door without getting up I could not believe 5 star hotels could have such small rooms It looked rather like a 3 star hotel which the Owners tried to upgrade by encouraging personnel to be attentive and offering Penhaligon s bathroom cosmetics However out of the whole rage of Penhaligons they had Blenheim Bouquet only which is primarily a men s fragrance My wife asked if they could find some of ladies fragrances they promised to look for it but it seems they have not found any after staying two nights in that small room I had to tell at the reception that the room was small and inconvenient and not exactly what one could expect booking the room so much in advance I have to admit the reception clercs did their best and 4 5 other rooms of different categories and I have chosen a much better room on the 3rd floor which was 50 night more expensive but was much bigger and convenient , Location is very good just across the road from South Kensington underground station There s a pub round the corner which was open till 23 00 hrs even on Sunday The personnel was very attentive and cooperative I kicked scrambled eggs which were perfect not too dry not too soft I would not be able to make better myself 
54056,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, As usual in England the bathroom Not warm enough so the mirrors mist up and then you cannot plug in a hairdryer in the bathroom to demist them , Very comfortable Lovely warm lounge at the back red velvet and a fire on cold winter day Nice art flowers 
54057,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Room was too hot for me but I feel the heat view was a little obscured room 402 but not a problem , Loved the room d cor Comfy bed good bed linen nice bathroom 
54058,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, I didn t like the bed it had a accentuation on the middle of the bed I wake up with the crying of a baby at 06h00 on the morning they said they were sad so do I i slept 3 hours the staff not even a breakfast offer , I like the localization I Like the apresentation and the ambient is very cousy
54059,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The property is decadent in a bad way cleanliness is very poor and the staff expecially Italian one is rude and bad with guests no concierge service at all and a worst welcoming ever I do not recommend at all , I liked the pics on the booking com page and location just few mins from tube station that s it 
54060,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Bed was a bit short for my tall husband but he still slept really well Bathroom was cold and had no heating but thats just finding fault because you re insisting O yes and the wifi kept dropping out quite annoying , Cannot fault it It was perfectly positioned for Royal Albert Hall evening entertainment and day browsing in Chelsea and visit to the V A Great sleep in lovely pristine white sheets It was lovely Penhalligon soaps in the dish perfect a great bit of extravagance Afternoon tea served with fresh biscotti in warm interesting lounge Lots of old books to browse through
54061,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Bed too soft Aircon difficult to control at night Bathroom floor tiled absolutely freezing, Perfect location adjacent to tube station but quiet Pleasant helpful staff Nice period house Good breakfast
54062,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, No heater in the bathroom It was like a fridge I have ask the reception 4 times to repair it but no reaction I have tried other Starhotels in Italy and France and the experience was much better , The beds were very comfortable The location is very good 
54063,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, It was a bit cold in the morning and the termostate was always turning back to 20 degrees after I change it to be 22 But it was January and it is England The free wifi was to slow The breakfast was too expensive as it was not included in our price But a lots of other breakfast places just outside, Very good small boutique hotel close to Harrods Kings Road and V A museum Exclusive and familiar at the same time with two nice lobby rooms with fireplace and honest bar Nice cosy room
54064,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Fact that they do not accept Maestro Debit card was a disaster made a total stress when it came to payment , Best location ever Very nice small cousy hotel reception desk was very friendly Nice clean and comfy room Recommended 
54065,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, It was really hot overnight hard to open the velux window upstairs No tea making facilities in the room although a lovely cup of tea did arrive when ordered, Spacious triple suite very quaint
54066,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Air cond was difficult very cold Wallpaper in first room 210 was really dirty by the entrance door, Room 5 was meeting my expectations Nice personel staff great Quiet room tidy wifi great 
54067,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Bathroom lovely but too small especially as it had a wonderfully powerful shower , Friendly attentive staff A casual comment from me that I was celebrating my birthday resulted in a surprise tray of beautiful chocolates from staff Gorgeous interior design adds to boutique style of hotel 
54068,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, we looked very diligently to find a room for 3 adults on booking com it says you get a double bed and a single bed however the single bed is actually a rollaway , good location right next to south kensington station staff was friendly and gave us a room upgrade after we complained about the rollaway bed situation 
54069,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Breakfast service could have been faster more attentive The breakfast itself was lovely though , Cosy and comfortably rooms friendly and helpful staff perfect location right next to South Kensington tube 
54070,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The breakfast service was slow and the choice was not wide The ongoing reconstruction works were noisy , Extremly helpful staff best location the superior room had a fantastic view We will definitely return 
54071,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Renovations were taking place at the time so scaffolding interfered with the street view, Great position opposite South Kensington tube great staff and room was a good size for inner London All round a great place to stay 
54072,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, While there is an elevator you will probably still have to climb half a flight of stairs Construction was underway on the exterior making it difficult to locate the hotel Perhaps most importantly at 8 20 am on a Saturday morning construction work began on room next to ours with jack hammer pounding etc Called reception who claimed there was no construction being done to their knowledge While the pounding lessened never received a call back to apologize for the noise or any offer of compensation Disappointing , Great location 
54073,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The air in the room was really dry and it was quite hot The air con was too noisy to use overnight and made the room even more dry The room was quite noisy due to the proximity of the tube and traffic lights though this was less of a problem than the noise of the air con , Very easy to find and fantastic location Nice customer service 
54074,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, After requesting a quiet room I was allocated one on the main road After moving and complaining about having work men looking in to my bathroom toilet which had no curtains and bedroom on 2 separate days for over 30 minutes there was no goodwill gesture made to rectify this I was moved to various rooms al of which had trains from the underground keeping me awake from 5am The fact that exterior building work was being carried out throughout my stay was not mentioned at check in This is unacceptable when paying in the region of 250 pounds per night for a room Last visit I had at this hotel my sheets had large holes in them Not very impressed by the standards which used to be great here , Some of the staff were great The lounges are comfortable Location is great 
54075,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The hotel is located on a busy road so it is a little noisy at night but I m sure you can request a quiet room at the rear if this is going to bother you , Stunning interior designed rooms with lovely bathrooms and beautiful bedlinen Located opposite South Kensington tube so a very central location surrounded by cafes and restaurants Great staff who were very friendly and helpful Plus the hotel held our luggage for the day after checking out which was a huge help as we were not heading to Heathrow until the evening 
54076,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Breakfast a little expensive and full English could have done with option of beans or tinned tomatoes as a little dry without Facilities to make a hot drink in the room would be useful , Bed and pillows comfortable Staff friendly and helpful Location excellent Tray of chocolates for husbands birthday left in the room while we were out 
54077,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, No tea making facilities in the bedroom It said in the brochure that if required it was complimentary and to just ask at reception We did but nothing appeared , The location was perfect just across the road from the tube The bathroom was spacious and very clean The bed was enormous and sooooo comfy All the staff were friendly and helpful Breakfast although expensive was excellent 
54078,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Weekend staff inefficient and failed to provide turndown service or bottle water in a suite in a 5 star allegedly hotel Wow you do take things for granted Plumbing of bath awful Lighting of room inadequate Hotel generally looking tired Scaffolding on outside should have been mentioned on booking first room offered on arrival not great and no others available despite it being only around 5 00 pm Scarcely credible , Bed good 
54079,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Room overcrowded with furniture very little room for 2 large cases Disappointing that breakfast wasn t included in the price , Hotel location was excellent 
54080,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, nothing, Bed was so comfy Staff at reception very helpful as were conceirge left a bottle of wine in room when checked out Went back and was found Loved that cleaners are honest 
54081,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The wall has a spill on wine I was about to sleep and saw a man body hair under the cover In the morning there was leak in bathroom dropping on me I checked out right away at 7 am I forgot some of my clothes inside the closet because i was in hurry to leave this hotel I called them to ask about my clothes and they said noting was left which is not true It was the worest hotel ever Even when i call reception it takes them ages to answer because not many staff are there ,No Positive
54082,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, The staff were so helpful and ensured that we had a delightful visit to your hotel We ate Dinner on our first night and breakfast each morning one each occasion the food was very very good We feel we have found a treasure We thank all your staff Kenneth Eleanor Sandford
54083,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Nothing all good , Great location right across street from South Kensington station as well as cafes Less busy touristy than other areas in London Walk to Hyde Park and Natural History Museum Staff very professional friendly and welcoming Concierge very knowledgable and connected for theatre tickets etc Great experience wish we had longer than one night would have tried the restaurant Would definitely recommend 
54084,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The outside of the building is a little non descript Signage is subtle so not easy to find , The place is beautiful and the location perfect The service from the staff is exemplary and is commensurate with the price point for these accommodations 
54085,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, This is a delightful boutique hotel Very well run with cleanliness and staff attitude as good as can be We will definntely stay there again 10 out of 10 in every respect 
54086,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, pathetically slow wifi the only provide 256kbps free come on this is 2016 Very noisy with the constant rumble of underground trains reverberating in the room and in the morning from 7am the constant banging of doors adjacent too and along the corridor , Location
54087,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Afternoon tea was just okay Warm scones were the best bit Small room, Crisp bed linen Soft fluffy towels Good water flow on bath and shower Attractive room Quiet Friendly staff Close to tube station cafes restaurants and museums
54088,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Restaurant prices a little high so generally best to pop to one of the many local cafe or bars But very close by Everything is 2 mins away , The location is very easy accessible to South Ken underground museums Harrods all walking distance Hyde Park very close by Use of the library and quiet zones in the hotel was delightful Very good standard rooms quality of linen bathroom decoration was very cosy Helpful staff friendly 
54089,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, The rooms at The Pelham are very comfortable and beautifully decorated The breakfast buffet is delicious The concierge is super helpful and has a fantastic knowledge of London The staff at reception are friendly and very eager to please 
54090,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Room was right by a bus stop which went 24 7 and with the tube underneath Noisier than ideal Ask to stay on a higher floor , Location cannot be beaten Lounge facilities etc lovely 
54091,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, I didn t like the fact I had to leave , EVERYTHING This hotel is superb The staff are just so helpful There is even a mini gym 24 7 I have unusual hours so unfortunately I didn t get to enjoy the absolutely beautiful breakfast including in the stay as often as I d liked to have The hotel is open 24 7 which means assistance is always in hand The staff even took time to find out about why I was travelling etc therefore offering more of a personal service South Kensington is PERFECT for that person who doesn t want to stay in the hustle and bustle of the city but be close to London It is a pretty town and nice and quiet The hotel is within a few steps away of the South Kensington tube Thank you to The Pelham for a wonderful stay 
54092,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, We were upgraded to the Mews suite which is a seperate mews house around the corner of the hotel We were very disappointed with this Mews full of rubbish staff smoking in the mews the house was smelly and tired looking with furniture stained and ripped All in all not an upgrade but rather the feeling of the garden shed , We liked the location and the common rooms we saw at the hotel We should have insisted on a room in the main hotel as this seemed indeed quite lovely 
54093,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, This hotel doesnt feel like a 5 star hotel for the following reasons 1 No kettle for coffee or tea in the rooms which you expect in a basic 4 star hotel 2 The booking personell was not cooperative We requested rooms in the same floor as we have young children We called a week earlier and sent emails for that and to our surprise when we arrived we found that rooms are two floors apart The next day they transferred us to tiny rooms next to each other but certainly they dont feel like deluxe rooms at all The exact same size as the superior which they asked us to upgrade to fit the extra bed Too tiny for an extra bed not worth an extra 100 per night 3 No one to help with the luggage The receptionist which was very lovely offered to help so do the conceirge but you would expect a porter in a 5 star hotel , The location was good
54094,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Even we stay on the 4th floor which is on the top floor We can feel and hear the subway train especially at night time Also we can hear every single word next door guests talking even though they didn t speak very loud I guess the wall is super thin Also the room we selected was not the same as the one we got at all A bit disappointment because we promised our daughters to get the room she likes Also we mentioned on booking that we request that room At least should tell if that room is not available , Location is great Very close to Tube station Hotel is clean and nice 
54095,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The standard room I was offered was bad a view of an adjacent building and small I needed to pay an extra 50 pounds per night to get a decent room , The hotel was well located and very nicely decorated 
54096,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Really can not think of anything we did not like , The staff was more than accomadating especially Camilla It is located to any type of transportation you may need Surrounded by restaurants fabulous bakeries coffee shops Far enough away from the main tourist areas but close enough We just loved it 
54097,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, bed sheets as we had those ugly brown blankets you usually see in motels or in the US For this price I would expect a proper feather duvet , Location was great Ambience at the hotel is nice townhouse character Staff was friendly Lots of breakfast places close by Underground close by 
54098,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The fridge was out order TV out of order After changing room everthing was perfekt Included breakfast too expensive but when paid for what orderd it was reasonable , Nice and quiate 
54099,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The room description was complete fiction and the facilities for example the gym were basic , Location was convenient Staff were attentive but not overbearing 
54100,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, My booking form confirmed a city view I was put into room 3 on the ground floor which had a window looking out onto another wall no more than 2 meters away with a view of bird droppings on the ground in between I would not have wanted to do anything other than sleep in that room with the curtains closed consequently I went out for most of the evening The room was comfortable but I was definitely tucked away into the corner and they were probably surprised that I didn t complain , The staff were very nice and the location good for my visit 
54101,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Very comfortable bed after a long journey and the softest sheets imaginable Directly across from South Kensington tube station and very walkable to Hyde Park the V A and Kensington High Street
54102,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Staff at reception is unprofessional not listening to guests speak in a way of ordering people which leads to unpleasant journey absolutely not a five star standard, Good location British decorations
54103,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, A bit on the expensive side, The friendly professional staff Concierge was very helpful Excellent Security Very clean accommodation Excellent location is a big bonus
54104,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, The room was really good and the staff is superfriendly A strong point is the breakfast Very very good The location is perfect And the relaxing rooms are fantastic A lovely home to be when in London Thank you 
54105,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, No good sarvec tha breakfast boor Tha lift is not working good It was my birthday I was not happy And the price too mush for this sarvec, Room so good
54106,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Check out time is 11 00am which is a bit too early Heard mild tube running noise before midnight after early morning Slow free wifi which is not working smoothly , We ordered hot water and they served us with hot water along with tea bags instant coffee powder sugar milk without charges Excellent Free access to laptop at common room 
54107,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The carpet in my room would benefit from a change , Very well located just opposite the South Kensington tube station very friendly and helpful staff 
54108,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The wifi did not work in my room at all The staff went to some lengths to try and remedy this but in the end we re not able to solve the problem In my opinion this had to do with the layout of the room the bedroom party being isolated from the rest of the room It was very frustrating Another thing that really irked me was the lousy attitude of the staff at breakfast Not a single good morning I had to call someone over to order tea and was never offered the breakfast menu It is only when I saw other tables being served all sorts of dishes that I realised that there was more on offer than the buffet The staff did not smile we re not friendly and had an unpleasant attitude I have stayed at the Pelham three or four times now I think they really need to make an effort to improve the friendliness of their staff , Beautiful comfortable hotel Great location Quiet 
54109,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, i have book early check in but i did t get room till 3 30pm no elveator so hard to carry lagguge in stairs, location and room desgin staff the histroic pictures in walls room by named by color
54110,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, broken lift it happens so no big deal really Disappointing breakfast, Lounge and library areas Night staff really helpful and friendly with my late check in 
54111,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Rooms Windows cannot be opened for security reasons No Italian tv channels , Lovely hotel located just in front of the South Kensigthon metro stop Typical old English style with modern facilities Cozy atmosphere and nice staff Breakfast with different choice and rates Nice and helpful staff I will come back 
54112,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The Italian restaurant could be better , Perfect location Comfortable rooms Friendly staff Got an upgrade Wonderful time Definitely will come again 
54113,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The breakfast staff were too busy talking to each other than paying attention to customer s needs It took 3 requests to just get some toast which had been ordered and waited for almost 15 minutes before getting up and asking yet again The standard of food was very good but the service was dreadful , The room was very comfortable with all facilities advertised 
54114,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Charming with a great location The staff was considerate and helpful The room was predictably small and facing the street but the beds were comfortable and quality windows kept street noise outside Loved the library and sitting room online pictures didn t lie 
54115,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Tiny rooms thin windows no central heating in room I suspect we were given a booking com economy room in the back or something Beware of the breakfast rip off, Great location friendly staff
54116,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, My travel companions room same nightly rate as mine was cramped and had a distinct dust and or mold smell Triggered my allergies in about 30 seconds I think you just get lucky or unlucky with a particular room there Restaurant was mediocre wait staff was attentive but it seemed like few of them were trained for the jobs they were doing It never seemed to be crowded which was probably a good thing I can t imagine how they handle high volume There are many restaurant choices in the area so it was not hard to find nice alternatives but there were several cold and windy times it would have been nice to stay in the hotel Did not buy the add on breakfast and very glad we didn t Cost of their afternoon tea was unreasonable and quite a poor value for quality , Bed was great My deluxe room was pretty spacious and comfortable Staff was friendly Various coffees were excellent 
54117,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, No tea or coffee in room the TV had very bad reception rang the front desk a couple of times but there was nothing they could do couldn t even get BBC London The shower was a bit difficult to get temperature right , I liked the d cor room was quite spacious we were on the 3rd floor at the front of the hotel it was quiet The bed linen was lovely bed was huge Lots of restaurants in area 
54118,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Undergoing renovations on the property while we were there but still enjoyed our stay , The bed was wonderfully comfortable And the staff were fantastic 
54119,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Terrible room this time More like a cell was booked very last minute but quite the smallest room with awful view and plug in fire like visiting an elderly relative Was in it for less than 12 hours but quite shocked on arrival , Fourth time I have stayed at the Pelham over past 12 months fantastic location and lovely hotel Some beautiful rooms
54120,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Breakfast was very uninspired and had a sorry selection for a 5 star restaurant All hot items such as eggs cost extra That was way below what one would expect The overall service in the dining area was not sharp not professionally trained waiters imo , Nice and cute little boutique hotel Charming
54121,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, we got a good rate for a 3 bed room but 3rd bed was a camp bed can t complain but only 2 of the 3 travellers had a great sleep, location and hotel staff
54122,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The first night the fire alarm woke me up at 2 and 5 am because of someone smoking the second day they forgot to wake me up and I nearly missed the eurostar, I loved the style and the attention to details The breakfast
54123,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Tiny rooms offered for 205 per night views of air conditioning units or brick walls only offered Having to pay 6 00 for a single small bottle of beer then being charged 75p service charge for the bar person to hand the bottle to me Rather excesive I travel to Dubai often and that s more expensive than buying there Miserable bar staff Greated with a stoney face glare instead of a smile , Great location 
54124,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Room was small and whilst the common areas were well decorated they were small also and often crowded The dining area is not ideal being in the basement The staff in the dining room at breakfast were disorganised but at least they were polite , Staff on reception were charming Food at breakfast was good 
54125,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Nothing really The breakfast room restaurant is a little small and difficult to conduct business but this is a small issue , The staff were friendly and efficient The location perfect 
54126,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, No hot water in the morning The lovely staff soon had the situation rectified , The lovely staff upgraded us to the Mews apartment which was perfect for myself and 2 friends we were only in London for 24 hours so it was nice to have the extra space to chill out in Staff were brilliant nothing was too much trouble
54127,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Even though I had indicated on the booking that i was going to stay for one night this hotel charged me for two nights They assured me that this error was going to be sprted out The following morning When I was checking out the gentleman at Reception refused to sign me out and charge my card because according to him he was supposed to charge me for two nights I realised when I got home that I was charged double for one night To this day no one called me to rectify this or explain this to me I felt so violated and yes I will not recommend this hotel to anyone I know For them it s money before customer service Would not come back here again 
54128,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The room was so small you could touch both walls while in bed Awful like a broom cupboard Would never stay again, The hotel is in a good location close to the albert hall where we were going to a concert 
54129,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, I was given Room 109 which is next to a function room hosting meetings and birthday parties so it was extremely noisy all day long Luckily when I explained the problem to the staff they were very understanding and gave me another room The TV channels are limited to few British channels Would recommend to add other language channels , Excellent location Very friendly and efficient staff 
54130,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Tea and coffee would have been nice but to be hones twe werent really bothered, Excellent location and reception were superb room was clean and comfortable A great base for the museums and a little bit quieter than being right in the centre of London Really liked the room a nice difference to the chain or ersatz hotels you often stay in 
54131,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, this hotel is not well located and can not be listed under 5 or even 4 star Hotel Its a 3 Star Hotel Its old and not clean its very small and scary in the area at night , this hotel is not well located and can not be listed under 5 or even 4 star Hotel Its a 3 Star Hotel
54132,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, I had to leave , Feels like home you walk in the front door and it feels like friends are looking after you No impersonal hotel here more refinement and good manners 
54133,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Service not great had to ring down twice for complimentary teas and coffees to be brought up and second morning service at breakfast poor also beds uncomfortable and asked for foam pillows as feather pillows didn t give any support and they did not have any although literature said they did for the money this is all about location , Right next to South Kensington tube station decor plush in rooms and whole of hotel within walking distance of Harrods
54134,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, We ordered late drinks after we had arrived back from our evening out but they never arrived there seemed to be some confusion with the night staff Real shame as apart from that hotel was faultless , The friendliness of the staff nothing to much trouble 
54135,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, For us it s almost to close to Sth Kensington station with all the grunge that is typical of station the world over , Comfortable clean and well decorated room Pleasant helpful staff Close to transport bus s and trains and V A Harrods and many other of Londons attractions are just a walk away 
54136,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Staff was very good BUT late night staff sloppy we waited for a long time to get our key Porter inattentive saw us with lots of baggage and did not move to offer assistance , Perfect location Beautifully done Great taste 
54137,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, TV channel selection poor and signal quality poor Traffic noise until early hours at front of Hotel , Proximity to Royal Albert Hall 10 minute bus ride bus shelter outside Hotel Route 360 See photo Stop T for return journey Good bed and high quality bedding Tube South Kensington visible from Hotel Continental Breakfast 
54138,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, We had a junior suite It is shown on the website as suitable for 3 adults Our 19 year old son was on a rollaway at the end of our bed and there was barely room to move It isn t a suite at all , Great location and really nice hotel We liked the living room on the main floor It had an honor bar and was a great place to gather before going out and after returning in the evening
54139,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Booked for inclusive breakfast for which we were charged a four percent service charge Did not expect any extra charge , Excellent location for underground buses and taxis museums and Royal Albert Hall Staff friendly on front desk and breakfast restaurant 
54140,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Nothing, Outstanding stay the day before we were married The hotel had a number of lovely surprises in store that we would never have guessed or expected They made our stay truly memorable 
54141,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, No complaints apart from the higher prices If it was cheaper I would give it a 10 , The room is really pretty and quiet the bed really comfortable and the bathroom nice and clean They clean the rooms twice a day The staff was really pleasant Location great
54142,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Bedroom was tired Hotel entrance needs better signage and to be smartened up Curtains carpeting wallpaper scuffed marked shabby Stairs to room were difficult for me and option not acceptable I enquired re another visit at end of month and was quoted an exorbitant figure with little regard for the fact we were current and potentially repeat customers , love the location lounge areas nice but tucked away good bed and linen roomy for London good continental b fast 
54143,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, At last a central London hotel I would whole heartedly recommend Great location staff very helpful and efficient The public areas are immaculately maintained Room was lovely amazingly comfortable bed which I still miss Lots of attention to detail Couldn t fault it so will definitely be booking the Pelham next trip to London 
54144,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Quite tired could do with a bit of a refurb or tlc During turn down service would be nice to have a complimentary gift as received in other boutique hotels The rumbling of the tube trains could unfortunately be heard , Great location small hotel friendly staff 
54145,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, In booking written that there are three single beds in the room but it s not true even if the hotel style is classic the furniture need to be changed the last thing I don t like the housekeeping doesn t reflect 5 stars hotel but it doesn t mean that the room it s not clean also the should change the system of old keys to cards it s not comfortable and not right to use a key in this century, I like the location and staff
54146,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, We were so well looked after by staff nothing was to much trouble beautiful hotel was up graded to suite if only we had more time to enjoy it as we were only there for one night so spoiled during our stay this is the hotel for us for all future London visits To everyone at the Pelham Hotel Thank you so much For making our stay that extra special
54147,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, the electrical power cut on the early morning of my departure spoilt my entire stay The very unbelievable first time to happen , Pretty cute boutique hotel
54148,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Shattered carpet soft beds Although booked a deluxe room was first given a standard room with no view only a brick wall Was given a room facing the street finally on the 2nd night , Good convenient location Cozy hotel Good breakfast with freshly made bread 
54149,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, 256 kbps is the speed of the complimentary WiFi at the Pelham Haven t experience internet this slow since the era of the dial up modems, It was very touching to receive a hand written and colored happy birthday card for my 7 year old and profiteroles too Also loved the interiors stylish with a touch of irony
54150,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, No tea and coffee in the room You need to pay for fast wifi The breakfast was cold We paid for three guests in the room and only had one king sized bed which meant our 6 year old had to sleep with us , The location
54151,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, Nothing at all , Just loved absolutely everything about this hotel The architecture the beautiful interiors the comfortable beds the cleanliness the cozy atmosphere and above all the staff They were so accommodating and helpful they made us feel like we were home We had an issue with the air conditioning and asked to be moved to a different room We were moved to the most gorgeous room in the hotel spacious and beautifully decorated The hotel is ideally located near the south Kensington station which gives you easy access to the tube You ll also always find a cab since they are stationed near the hotel The neighborhood is wonderful and filled with many restaurants and bars to choose from You re also only a walking distance from Hyde Park Not only would I recommend this hotel wholeheartedly but I wouldn t stay anywhere else if and when I go back to London A marvelous experience 
54152,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, We liked the King suite we stayed before more than the Mews suite we stayed this time Remote door opener is better to be fixed , We stayed at Pelham for the second time and both time felt very comfortable The concierge and room service was perfect My special thanks to Evgenyi 
54153,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The Air Conditioner did not work Abd the Rooms were hot The choice to be in a little miserable dark room with air or a larger one without I opted for larger asking to pay for a bigger room 3 days I endured a room so hot till I was moved This happened 2 years ago They need to spend money and upgrade , the staff is lovely and they try hard despite some staff is not really trained on their fields They were very kind and gracious 
54154,The Pelham Starhotels Collezione, The guest s above our room was noisy at night but luckily it happened once , We were impressed by the comfort n luxury of the suite the friendly and helpful staff The location was excellent for shopping restaurants and walks in the parks and it was so close to the tube station
