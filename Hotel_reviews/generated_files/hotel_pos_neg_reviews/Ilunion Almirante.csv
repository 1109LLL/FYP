479116,Ilunion Almirante, The hotel was kinda ugly Although the staff were very nice they were a little unhelpful E g they didn t order me a taxi they said they could provide a wheel away bed and couldn t I booked a room with 2 single beds but when I arrived they only had a room with a double bed There was also a very large cockroach in our room , The location was perfect and the free water was great 
479117,Ilunion Almirante, Parking a fair distance and cash payment only at 36 euros per day was expensive , Staff advisedd of eating venues which were both exceptional and nothing too uch trouble Great friendly service 
479118,Ilunion Almirante, Not so cozy public areas breakfast not included, Amazing room and we even got a balcony 3 Great staff friendly and professional Perfect location
479119,Ilunion Almirante, View to inner court its not a pleasant sight but still better than facing the busy streets so OK ish , The room was large and nice Bathroom is large and has 2 sinks
479120,Ilunion Almirante, It s definitely not 4 stars Room decor is dated and items were broken not cleaned thoroughly but it was a quick trip so didn t bother me, Location is amazing Great staff Karen was so friendly
479121,Ilunion Almirante, We reserved a doble bed but when we arrived they did not have any doble bed available so we have to sleep in one room with 2 single beds and next day change to another room We waste some precious time doing this, I liked the bathrooms and the bed was clean
479122,Ilunion Almirante, renovated bathrooms lobby and the breakfast area , the room was very clean The bathroom fixtures and the tub looked over used I would rate the hotel 3 stars not 4 the location is perfect I wouldn t stay there again 
479123,Ilunion Almirante, Not many power supply points in the room I was staying in 202 had to sacrifice TV supply to charge iPad Not sure how it passes as a 4 star but it wasn t a unpleasant experience by any means just wasn t up to standards of other Ilunion hotels , Location was decent
479124,Ilunion Almirante,No Negative, Good comfy stay Nice eating options nearby pizzeria just down is great If you want to eat late the beach side road has excellent restaurants open till midnight The rooms were clean and adequate had Electric Kettle which is an exception in EU hotels On the main road Taxi stand 2 mins walk and so is the CitySight Seeing tourist Bus stand About 20 30 mins walk from the Barceloneta Beach depending on your ability OR else a Taxi to beach would not take more than 4 5 Euros Check in was super smooth as we were pre paid upon arrival Staff is great charming and helpful and speak good English Definitely recommend and will go again 
479125,Ilunion Almirante, breakfast is rather poor some rooms are too small and dark, location is perfect 20 minutes to Gaudi house 35 minutes walk to sagrada familia 20 minutes to the beach metro is also around 
479126,Ilunion Almirante, Everything What is it with double beds there You don t have any Two single beds pushed together Surely you can find a better way to fill in the wedge in between I gotta stop here because you ve lost me as a customer Oooh You need to do a better job at cleaning The bathroom floors eeewww , Nothing
479127,Ilunion Almirante, The room had milked window bathroom was dirty and in poor condition e g dirty siling broken floor enamel Elevator in poor condition and dirty for whole stay of three days , It s greatly located
479128,Ilunion Almirante,No Negative, Got a room on the 7th floor streetside but quiet and very comfortable The bathroom had a window to the other side which was quite nice too The hotel is perfect for exploring Barcelona It is very near the cathedral and directly at the start of the gothic quarter It is also only a 10 minutes walk to the harbour So you can reach a lot of great places by walking 
479129,Ilunion Almirante, 1 Configuration of the room there was enough space but not well split too little around the bed too much around the hall 2 no room to dry wet towels bathing suits 3 very noisy with open balcony door the room had a view towards Via Laietana which has lots of traffic , 1 Very close to a bus stop where there are 2 buses going to the Barceloneta beach time to the beach 7 8 minutes by bus 2 Very close to city center Pl Catalunya La Rambla etc 
479130,Ilunion Almirante, Annoying staff At 8 am they were cleaning the other rooms on the floor in a very noisy way And didn t stop even once I ve told them I was trying to sleep In addition the receptionist were of no help at all I had to book a taxi by my own since they weren t able to call the agency So disappointed And it was also very expensive , Position
479131,Ilunion Almirante, The check in process took an exceptionally long time where we were left standing there ignored for 15 minutes without explanation Staff not overly friendly customer service virtually non existent but we found this to be common in Spain Our aircon wasn t working the first few days but once we realised this and reported it they fixed it straight away , Great location Within walking to distance to La Rambla the beach Hop on hop off bus right across the road We had a fridge and a kettle on our room which was very convenient Starbucks Burger King supermarkets restaurants taxi rank all very close Beds were the comfiest we d slept in over our 6 week holiday in Europe 
479132,Ilunion Almirante, Small room in need of redecoration Overall a 3 star room Only recommended for the location , I have stayed at other 4 star properties in Spain but this felt much more like a 3 star 
479133,Ilunion Almirante, Rooms are very small and very noisy from inside and out side noice and no window Sun comes in very exhausted to be in ROOM for long time I didn t like it ata ll the services, Only the location of hotel is good
479134,Ilunion Almirante, The rooms are not sound proof at all It s like the entire hotel guests stay together in the one room You can even hear people in the next room breathing , Location is fascinating 
479135,Ilunion Almirante, The room was old and dirty When I first entered the bathroom there were a lot of hairs on the floor Please take note the room with no view has litterally no view The window is milky and if you open it you will find a wall 20cm away from the it , The breakfast was really good A big diversity of food Very friendly stuff Great location close to the cathedral and the city center 
479136,Ilunion Almirante, The price was way too high It was no 4 Star hotel by any means Bathroom was terrible Silicone needs immediate repalc g Scum and Mikey silicone is a terrible sign of lack of care and maintenance This should be addressed The bidet was almost facing the wall The water pressure was good and that s it for positives Bathrooms are very outdated Bed was uncomfortable and the pillows are not good either Finally the curtains we re not able to close the light out from the street and the meting was dirty and needs a wash Below average room for 220 , Location was good and that s that Situated on a very busy main roadway in and out of Barcelona Be prepared for traffic all day and night There are non road facing rooms which may help this situation 
479137,Ilunion Almirante, Well it was not a 4 star maybe 2 We stayed there for only one night after negotiating with the director paid for 1 1 2 days and left Stayed at the Hilton 4 5 stars for the same price and also got b f included, Location
479138,Ilunion Almirante, The room was tiny and there was dirty marks all over the walls The cleaners didn t come one day Also the bed quilt was dirty on arrival , The location was good 
479139,Ilunion Almirante, The elevator was out of service And there was one working in the reception he did not speak good English I asked for the iron he did not have The price was expensive while on the other hand the facilities was bad Really I don t recommend it to anybody, Only the location and not that much
479140,Ilunion Almirante, Space between toilet and bidet in front of it was ridiculously little Could not use toilet normally room 510 , Very nice and dark curtains Good sound proofing of the road side windows 
479141,Ilunion Almirante, The bathroom had a very unpleasant smell sewer or and mold They tried to fix it but could not In the end we got a free breakfast But I think that room should be closed down and be renovated ,No Positive
479142,Ilunion Almirante, Nothing, We did not eat the breakfast only because we were busy enjoying the city The location is great for walking to many of the famous sites We were a half block from the subway bank and the cathedral Barcelona Restaurants and shops are all along the streets Will definitely visit here again 
479143,Ilunion Almirante, I booked a doublet room as a single and got a single room I complained and they say we can not do anything we are full after long arguments they accepted at least to lower the price a little bit A very unfriendly way of treating the guests Also I booked the hotel because of the gym big mistake it was so small and only had weights to 10 kilos Overall I was so disappointed with my visit to the hotel I will never go back and will not recommend anyone to stay there ,No Positive
479144,Ilunion Almirante, The hotel is very run down and definitely not a 4 star property The room was very small Bathroom tiles were very badly cracked toilet roll holder hanging off the wall shower head that kept slipping down the pole so you had to hold it while in the shower Bath was dirty towels with holes in Staff miserable Unpleasant smell in reception On a positive note it s very centrals and we only went there to sleep so it was bearable Disappointing since I booked this for my husbands 50th ,No Positive
479145,Ilunion Almirante, The price is ridiculous especially considering the breakfast with a very limited choice Even the car parking is expensive in my opinion , The position is quite ok the structure looks ok with a modern style Rooms are spacious and clean 
479146,Ilunion Almirante, Hotel looks old 2 slow lifts and one od them didnt work 3 days also some smaler troubles with internet conection and stuff on reception all smile but not so food with english language location is what is the best all a side is justa average od below , Location is super good with la rambla 5min walking distance and metro stations just around the corner 
479147,Ilunion Almirante, Airconditioning only blowing hot air Requested double bed got 2 single beds next to each other Cleaning see foto s Pencil markings on the wall tiles hard water stains on the tiles behind the shower head stains on the tiles next to the toilet To me this equals poot cleaning standards Electricity sockets hanging from the wires Upon request for an iron I was informed that I could get one from the concierge after 09 00 Since I was there for business I left every morning at 8am , Location
479148,Ilunion Almirante, Where to start stayed 3 nights 1st night got a room that was more like a jail cell and view to the walls after requesting the next two nights we had a room with a balcony terrace The hotel is not 4 star category and in need of urgent upgrading Its old and the walls are paper thin you can hear the person in the next room breathe I will not recommend this property to anyone Only good thing is that location is good else nothing so take my advice and dont go there , Well the location is good and thats it
479149,Ilunion Almirante, Misleading 4 star rating this was a 2 3 star hotel at the very best City taxes were a hidden charge that had to be paid which we were not made aware of before booking The staff were very impersonal and upon arrival they did not tell us about any of the facilities or lack of such as breakfast times and price etc There was building work on going when we arrived The decor was dated tired and shabby however this is possibly being restored Breakfast was expensive for what it was and not replenished throughout the service The gym was about 2m by 2m so hot it was more of a sauna and had very limited equipment We stayed in a double room overlooking the main street which was very noisy with external doors not locking The room was very hot but the air conditioning was switched off due to the season and when I asked what could be done about this we were told to open the patio doors of which we were unable to do due to the noise The bathroom tiles were broken and my partner was greeted by a COCKROACH one morning Every morning you were awoken to the sounds of the cleaning staff banging and talking on their radios despite the rooms being advertised as sound proof All in all I would recommend looking somewhere else and read the reviews of hotels rather than take the star rating on face value , The location 
479150,Ilunion Almirante, No view at all Generaally an impersonal design to the whole place lots of black and shiny silver which does transcend to the staff a bit Highly misleading 4 stars , Excellent last minute discount on booking com 52 usd only Location back of hotel is quiet Large room and bathroom TV channels English news Free baggage storage 
479151,Ilunion Almirante, The early check in was in another room then we booked It was very small and didn t have a propper window The bed was very small for two persons and it was very claustrofobic without daylight The next day we moved to the room we orignally booked where there were issues with the bathroom It smelled like a public toilet We told the staff in the morning the guy promised to check it out but no one checked and it was even worse when we returned at 17 00 The bed wasn t even made After we told them again they weren t very helpfull to check The phone didn t work and we had to go down 3 times before they send someone There were 3 people working at reception but I didn t feel like they really wanted to help In the end they asked us to move rooms again and they gave us another room with a very small window It was the only option they had For a 4 hotel you would expect better service or maybe some apologies for the inconvenience No compensation offered for moving twice in 3 days I wouldn t stay here again , The nicest thing about the hotel was the location They offered us to check in early in another room and we could use the computer to print our boarding passes 
479152,Ilunion Almirante, Shower curtain was too short 30 40 cm above the floor so spreading water all around the bathroom floor was inevitable I d requested a back room and was given a front room without any explanation , Fantastic location 
479153,Ilunion Almirante, 1000 for this very average hotel for three nights Pretty basic Poor wifi No air con None of the English language channels on the TV worked for most of my stay Breakfast not included for that exorbitant price , Great location Lovely helpful staff Nice and quiet at night and in the late afternoon
479154,Ilunion Almirante, Worst experience ever I asked in advance for a nice Room with a window to the street because the trip was a present I did also received a confirmation from the hotel on the same day of my arrival The moment I arrived they gave us the worst room small dark and smelly With a window inside a building with no sunlight In the minibar the water was already open and used by others I asked to change the room because they did send me a confirmation the sir on the reception wasn t very nice At the end we could move the next day But the surprise was already ruined For a 4 star hotel I did expected more The lobby was nice and clean but the rooms not The next day we move that room was Much better but also here some water in the minibar already open and half drunk from other people I have no idea but it was disgusting I travel a lot to Barcelona but for sure I will not go again in this hotel, Position
479155,Ilunion Almirante, I booked 5 nights at this hotel in a double twin room which stated had a full bathroom suite with a bath When we arrived we got given a room with a full disabled bathroom with NO bath when I requested to be moved it was impossible until the next day as the hotel was full This was very inconvenient as we had just got off a long flight and needed a hot bath to relax in this ruined our night and plans We moved the next day to a double twin room which was also inconvenient we came for a relaxing holiday I wouldn t say this hotel was worthy of 4 stars there were no tea or coffee facilities the bathroom was very dated also Also on one of our days there our room never got cleaned and nothing got mentioned we had to ask for clean towels The staff was not very helpful or welcoming and when we had problems we got made to feel like a huge inconvenience I would say this hotel is worthy of maybe 2 stars maximum after my experience here , Location 
479156,Ilunion Almirante, Would not rate it a four star hotel but still value for money, Comfortale bed spotless room fantastic location and great value for money accessible bathroom excellent
479157,Ilunion Almirante, The room was so small I know rooms aren t usually spacious in hotels but 2 of us couldn t be walking at the same time Room was dark and hot Windows don t open and it s quite noisy, Location and shower
479158,Ilunion Almirante, Rooms are small and the walls are cardboard I could easily understand what people in the next room we re talking about The shower noise and toilet flushing are disturbingly loud ,No Positive
479159,Ilunion Almirante, Hotel was a time coupsule internet was very very bad in our room And cleaner open the doors around 940 and see me naked thanks god my wife was in toilet Couldn t hear him tv was on First time that happened To me, Room was quiet hotel has good location nice hot water possible to have bath 
479160,Ilunion Almirante, The decor was a little dated and tired especially the bathroom , The hotel was right in the heart of Barcelona so was great for a weekend break The room was very clean and the beds were comfy we slept very well in the hotel Also great value for money 
479161,Ilunion Almirante, Smoke buts from the previous guests we re not cleaned from the balcony The lighting for the area of the mirror is very dark No English channels on the tv Wifi was not good at allin our room on the second floor A loud buzz noise came from the balcony door when traffic drove past which did wake us up during the night We ended up sleeping with the door slightly open to prevent the buzz noise which was annoying , Location is amazing We were able to check in early at 12 which was great Value for money The bed was comfy Strong shower and nice bathroom 4 free bottles of water a day were great Staff were nice Clean room but could definitely do with a paint update The cleaners gave us fresh towels daily Overall a good hotel to stay in for a weekend away 
479162,Ilunion Almirante, Not enough light in room The room was not clean There was noise inside the room from outside window The bed was worst The wifi signal was very bad You can t connect web sites Look at the window in our room and the view from there , Only the location
479163,Ilunion Almirante, The elevators are very very slow , Very well located Near lots of restaurants shops museums Taxis 24 7 just around the corner Room 802 has a nice balcony 
479164,Ilunion Almirante,No Negative, The location was excellent Staff were helpful and the room was nice and beds were comfortable Very nice stay and good value for money A couple of minutes walk from the cathedral and a nice little Irish bar and Burger King next to the hotel 
479165,Ilunion Almirante, The room had very little lighting it was quite a dull room to wake up in Especially since the window was facing into another window with no natural lighting it made the lighting in the room even worse , The hotel was in a great location The staff were helpful and friendly when questioned 
479166,Ilunion Almirante, Noise Heat the awful smell room was falling apart Charged more that what was advertised on the website, The only positive thing about this hotel was the water in the fridge
479167,Ilunion Almirante, I asked for double bed got 2 singles The bedroom floor was very old We had no hot water on our last night Terrible noise from next room Would not recommend this , Location and staff were good 
479168,Ilunion Almirante, Nothing all was good maybe they could use 2 people at the reception desk instead if only one especially on weekends takes a bit too long and staff not always familiar with direction to tourists attractions, Amazing location great breakfast for an extra well worth it cost clean room and great cost
479169,Ilunion Almirante, wifi is so weak we need to sit in the toilet in order to hsve s better connection the view of the room is so bad thst if we open the window we directly face to someone who are living in the opposite building room is dark with a low standard of cleanliness, Staff is nice and helpful
479170,Ilunion Almirante, WiFi struggled with the 3rd device Not sure how a 4 star rating is calculated However I got a 3 2 star impression My good rating is based on the 50 price Whilst most things worked reasonably OK I ll consider spending more next time , This is cheap and cheerful very centrally located the wifi worked with 2 devices shower worked room OK size 3 people room I stayed for 50 a night which is very cheap and it matched the cost
479171,Ilunion Almirante, I could hear all the noise from my neighbor Not a good experience I heard his TV his snoring and many more things , Location great Very friendly staff Good room and Wi Fi Breakfast can improve 
479172,Ilunion Almirante, no electric water pot supply without free of charge bottled water supply rupture tile in bath room the drain of the sink was blocked dirty curtain, Nice and helpful receptionist
479173,Ilunion Almirante, This hotel is everywhere dirty lifts hallways bathroom everything In the lift there was a sign hanging that they might not have water for the day because of work When I complained to the receptionist she said that it is not her problem and that she hears this every day They also gave us a connected room although we were just the 2 of us and we could hear everything from the other guests next door Except the location this hotel is not recommendable ,No Positive
479174,Ilunion Almirante, They were carrying out improvements in the hotel and there was no information about that prior to booking the hotel They cut the water supply throughout one of the days which was not very convenient they put notices on the day but this should have been notified by booking or the hotel prior to booking , The breakfast was really complete and could cater for allergies Being lacto intolerant and celiac this was a bonus 
479175,Ilunion Almirante, The hotel was fabulous I can t complain, Lovely huge room Big balcony Will return and look for the same room and I will recommend to all my friends
479176,Ilunion Almirante, The room we stayed in smelled like vomit , The location was so perfect We would stay there again just because of the location It was right next to some bars and restaurants and just a few steps away from a shopping area and the gothic quarter 
479177,Ilunion Almirante, The wireless in the room worked only intermittently They should not claim that they p provide wireless in the rooms The person at the reception basically admitted that their wireless often does now work with tablets But you cannot find this info on the web Once I had problem with wifi I would change the hotel but they made me pay at the beginning of the stay Still it was not too bad for a two night stay For a longer stay it would be unsuitable without a proper internet , Perfect location on a big street feels very safe 
479178,Ilunion Almirante, Breakfast wasn t the best but that is down to personal taste than the hotel quality, Room was clean Staff always helpful and willing to assist us Bed was comfortable Rooms were always cleaned and made up whilst we were out Water stocked in the fridge every day Location was brilliant 
479179,Ilunion Almirante, street noise The city never sleeps We had to close our window to get sleep , Good location Close to interesting places Great variety of places to eat close by 
479180,Ilunion Almirante, WiFi didn t work perfectly in the room Breakfast is much too expensive should be included for this price , Location is great Close to metro station gothic area Rambla coast room was clean staff at the reception friendly 
479181,Ilunion Almirante, Beds are horrendous Rooms are worn out and smelly Rooms look out on another building and there is no day light entering the room Lighting in the room is absolutely non sufficient Toiletries in bathrooms are more than basic We could hear every word from the room next to us Housekeeper came into our room early morning to take a door tag despite our clear yelling not to enter as we were in bed She absolutely ignorred us and pretended like there s nobody there to take the door tag There is no value for money here , Location is superb a minute from the cathedral and a few minutes from most other main city attractions 
479182,Ilunion Almirante, Better lighting in the rooms and better insulation or trim on doors Lots of severe door slamming heard throughout night , Location cleanliness and efficiency 
479183,Ilunion Almirante, Room is gloomy cud b lil posh Interior can be changed Bathroom tubs werent looking clean Bathing area should be different from a bathing tub Dont kno how many wud hav peed in it, All were average Breakfast cud hav been better
479184,Ilunion Almirante, the huge round Bath was over the top and the whole of the bathroom needed some refurbishments, the quietness of the rooms in such a busy City location and the buffet breakfast was extensive and unexpected
479185,Ilunion Almirante, Basically I forgot my sunglasses when checking out in my hotel room Called later but somehow front desk claimed nothing found Well this leaves something to be desired ,No Positive
479186,Ilunion Almirante, We took a lot out of the window and the hotel was so close to an apartment we could have talked to the people Moreover it was a really easy home ,No Positive
479187,Ilunion Almirante, Everything it was dirty smelt awful everything was worn floors walls really awful place I wouldn t stay there if I was paid to it was disgusting also the rooms are very small , The staff were very nice 
479188,Ilunion Almirante, First of all being an avid traveller and having stayed in many hotels over the years I can definitely say that this is not a 4 star hotel Should be 3 I called the hotel before booking and I asked I will only book if early checkin around 11am was available The answer was yes and I booked accordingly I arrived at the property about quarter to 12 only to be told only one smoking room is available As in take it or wait until 2pm They should have stated this on the phone I was given no other choice and had to take the smoking room I must say I found this attitude disturbing at the start of my stay When I went to the room it wasn t only the horrible smell of heavy smoking the room smelt like it hadn t been aired in a looooong time I had to open the windows and air it myself it was also dirty There were hairs and dust on the floor as well as stains as if someone walked around with their boots on the wet floor The windows faced atrium walls only a couple of meters away so clostrophobic Sound insulation was also not good at all Not cheap at all too After paying 125 night not even breakfast included one expects higher standards I think they got a bit comfortable cos it s at an okay location I think they think people will keep coming no matter what I wouldn t be so sure with their current standards Poor , Good location close to Urquinaona station with good metro links 
479189,Ilunion Almirante, The hotel was dated and could do with refurbishment There should be more double beds in the hotel as we had to push 2 beds together , The wifi was excellent location wise this hotel is perfect for the Gothic quarter of Barcelona 
479190,Ilunion Almirante, We had no negative experiences at all, We had a great room on the 8th floor with a balcony that faced the back of the building and beautiful view including Sagrada Familia in the distance It was incredibly peaceful and quiet unexpectedly so being that we were in a very vibrant part of the city 
479191,Ilunion Almirante, Shower did nor work and bathroom was rather tired and bathroom door handle was very loose I have requested a reduction to take account of the fact I could not take a shower ahead of a 12 hour journey , Location is good breakfast excellent
479192,Ilunion Almirante, Rooms where clean but tiles where cracked and dangerous and some of the fixtures and fittings were falling apart Otherwise good size room that was clean Did see a smaller double room that looked tiny so I would ask for larger room if I had got that as look claustrophobic but that s my preference We had a street view we come from a city so the noise didn t tend to bother us but if your from a quiet surrounding ask for a non street view otherwise the noise may keep you up The city doesn t sleep , Great location literally 30 seconds round the corner from the Cathedral couldn t of asked for a better location Ideal for our short visit helped in us fitting in all the sites we wanted to see 
479193,Ilunion Almirante,No Negative, Snatched a promotion got a massive suite where everything was perfect including the view from the balcony I am unable to point out any of the problems cited in the bad reviews go figure 
479194,Ilunion Almirante, The lighting in my room was very subdued and an adjustable lamp would be useful , Location was very good for the Cathedral Gothic quarter and a number of the museums tourist bus stop is just a minute walk down the street Fresh food market is less than 2 minutes away Staff friendly and helpful with directions to places of interest 
479195,Ilunion Almirante, We had to wait over an hour after the usual check in time There was no iron available or ironing room so instead you have to pay for an ironing service Our room was okay better than what we expected after reading some terrible reviews They are basic and fairly clean but not spotless like you would hope Slept on top of the covers as they were so thin and very close to the mattress which didn t look clean enough , Location 
479196,Ilunion Almirante, The shower leaked a little onto the floor but it was not a big deal the building is old and has personality so much more fun than staying in a modern building without character, The breakfast was amazing the staff extra helpful and friendly I couldn t have found a better location for the price
479197,Ilunion Almirante, Worst hotel in my 25 days trip in Europe Very very very noisy rooms Cleaning of room was just chaning towels nothing else Smallest room in my life Little bed for 2 persons Breakfast was terrible, Only the location
479198,Ilunion Almirante, not that much of facilities compared to the stars, nice hotel close to the center you can walk easily to the most attraction on the city or use hotel bikes
479199,Ilunion Almirante, noisy people in the room next door, location is super close to the beach and la rambla city center kindly staff great terrace on the 8th floor 
479200,Ilunion Almirante, Not a 4 star a 3 star hotel, We had a nice stay and were upgraded to a juniorsuite as we told the journey was very special to us And it was also a surprise in our room The hotel itself needs a restoration it is av three star hotel now Thanks for a nice stay 
479201,Ilunion Almirante, I really think breakfast was advertised in the price and then the hotel said it was not included , Gentlemen on front desk was very helpful I didn t get his name also a young lady named Valeria gave excellent customer service 
479202,Ilunion Almirante, Check in took 20 minutes The window looked onto a dirty courtyard Lighting was poor The toilet was situated with no room for knees Rooms had no pictures No list of TV channels Poor English language TV Internet speed very slow , When we complained manager was quick to find a room with usable toilet and a better view Staff smiled 
479203,Ilunion Almirante, If you pick a quiet room this may have tiny windows facing the vent well and thus not too much sunlight inside even throughout the day On the other hand such a room shall be a really quiet one, Very nice a location near the Gothic Quarter and the Citadel Park very friendly staff Santa Caterina market is within 5 minutes walk and offers anything you might fancy at Boqueria at competitive prices Taxi stop and two subway stations nearby
479204,Ilunion Almirante, Room was very Small Concierge was aware of the issue and gave us two room options That was a nice gesture and we decided to stay in the small room since the other room had separate beds , Great Location
479205,Ilunion Almirante, The room is very small The room also had a few broken things door knob handles in the bathroom broken parts of the sink However this was the cheapest hotel we could find so of course you get what you pay for , The location is really great right in the center We also enjoyed the air conditioning in the room as it is quite hot during this time of year and not everywhere offers AC The staff was also very friendly and helpful 
479206,Ilunion Almirante, The bed was really really uncomfortable And the cover was really unhygienic to use it was not closely covered by new sheets It is not a 4 star hotel should have 3 stars , The location is really good 5 minutes walking from the Cathedral 
479207,Ilunion Almirante, Staff was not nice We did not have any towels in the room when I asked staff he did not want to give me ones No pillows either Bathroom was dirty Water was brown And cherry on the top we had cockroach in the bathroom , Good location and insonorised room
479208,Ilunion Almirante, I requested a double bed but they gave me two single beds put together which kept splitting in the middle making it very uncomfortable for me and the Mrs , Great location 
479209,Ilunion Almirante, The room has no window to the outside meaning I had no fresh air or any idea how is the weather outside It will be fair if the hotel categorize this type of room in separate category some hotels do I d rather stay in a two star hotel with window than feeling trapped in a room like this in a four star hotel The room is not worth this price , Central location about 600 meters from Pla a de Catalunya La Rambla Nice area near bars resturants Clean hotel 
479210,Ilunion Almirante, One staff member tried to be very rude in Spanish and she also tried to be very intimidating She didn t realize we spoke the language , Loved the location Price was decent Walk to Las Ramblas was nice We travel for a living so being close to the metro allowed us to explore at our leisure 
479211,Ilunion Almirante, Bed was hard as a rock and the pillows were tiny and thin Shower head support was falling off the wall ditto TP holder 2 sinks in the bathroom left no space for our kits or for knees while on the toilet , Breakfast buffet was good Staff cheerful and friendly Location was Excellent 
479212,Ilunion Almirante,No Negative, Large modern rooms in a great location next to the Gothic quarter with loads of restaurants nearby Decent breakfast buffet Excellent value for money
479213,Ilunion Almirante, Worst staff professionalism I have ever had on my stay in barcelona Leaking ceilings Dishonest business operations lied about charging my card , Nothing 
479214,Ilunion Almirante, Bath wouldn t drain away but this was fixed by the next day Possibly more 3 than 4 star but still nice place to stay , Lovely views on 7th floor to back of hotel Very clean good powerful shower huge bed and great balcony to sit with drinks before heading out Cheep Irish bar few doors down was handy for watching football 
479215,Ilunion Almirante, Asked for a double room and extra cot bed and breakfast on top floor on arrival got 1 st floor room three single beds one bed very close to the cupboard and really uncomfortable to sleep on since between cupboard and side desk secondly I selected a room with breakfast included but once the payment went off and I looked at confirmation email the breakfast was not included so felt a bit cheated View overlooked other people s laundry , Staff were friendly room were small but clean
479216,Ilunion Almirante, Nothing really , Breakfast was excellent Victor and Arnau and the other staff were absolutely helpful and kind and caring They must be commended for their excellent client service 
479217,Ilunion Almirante, More stations on the TV and hair conditioner would have been a bonus but these are not essential and we picked up conditioner in a local mercado , We loved our spacious room with a long balcony There were twin beds which went easily together to make a huge sleeping area The staff were more than helpful and friendly The girl that cleaned our room for the 6 days we were there was very unobtrusive respective and professional The property was exactly as it was described online and our accommodation much larger than we d hoped and very quiet 
479218,Ilunion Almirante, There was an odour in my bathroom coming from poor pipes or pipe problems It was on almost the whole floor , The patio is nice and large and well designed elegant and clean 
479219,Ilunion Almirante,No Negative, Excellent central location and no traffic noise D cor a little dated and basic however room had a wonderful large balcony with views across the city 
479220,Ilunion Almirante, There r no hot water for drink after 14 00 no facility for hot water we were with our 9 months baby so we need to prefere milk for the baby and there r no hot Waterford drink in 4 stars hotel , Location the staff change our room to bigger because of our baby we didn t ask they just did it 
479221,Ilunion Almirante, bed is not comfortable we asked for 3 single beds and 2 of the beds are next to each other and very close looks like a double bed there were no slippers avaliable , location of the hotel is excellent 
479222,Ilunion Almirante, There were some difficulties with the wi fi few times and a view from the upper level windows 6th floor wasn t so great those few minor things are the only downsides I can think of Not really a hotels fault but FYI taxi from the airport was around 30 euros , Great location bathroom was nice and hotel suplied bottled water for free Our room was in the 6th floor facing away from the main street and there was no traffic noise etc and you could sleep with your window open even though there was a functional air conditioning in the room Relatively big fridge in the room for storing your beer and wine Taxipost was in few minutes of walk from the frontdoor good restaurant and Irish bar next door and a convenience store where you could get all necessities was just around the corner 
479223,Ilunion Almirante, a smaller more broken down room would not have been possible a bed stuffed with rocks a lake in the bathroom sore shins from walking into everything horrible lighting i feel taken advantage of oh and don t forget the people next door smoking joints all day , the location was perfect internet was fast 
479224,Ilunion Almirante, The room was very noisy even on 7th floor we could ear the street all night long, Location next to Catedral and all commodities Nice hotel Breakfast 
479225,Ilunion Almirante, I was very disappointed by the interiors and comfort of the rooms dark with bad colors on the walls shabby floors , I was content that all the facilities available was working and that the cleaning attended my room on a daily basis 
479226,Ilunion Almirante, Not a bad experience but a strange one A five foot in platform tub may not be what the average mid sixties couple want to take a shower in most mornings , This hotel is in a perfect location to Barcelona close to Old Town La Ramblas the Port La Sagrada Familia the Cathedral of Barcelona and so much more The staff went out of their way to make us feel at home 
479227,Ilunion Almirante, room was without functioning air conditioning despite requests to fix it never was fridge also broken and leaking water into floor was a back room and had to listen to a barking dog all night not much the hotel could do other than have sound proof Windows and air conditioning that works staff didn t seem that accommodating and everything seemed to be a drag , Location and appearance of reception area
479228,Ilunion Almirante, Uncomfortable bed room wasn t pleasant no ironing facility in room had to pay e17 to have clothes ironed braakfast wasn t great , Staff were nice location was decent 
479229,Ilunion Almirante, The Wi Fi went down for a while which was a bit of an inconvenience since I was in Barcelona on business The TV in my room was very small as it looked like a computer monitor and the reception was not the best The bed and pillows were not that comfortable and the shower pressure in the room was not good at all , The location of the hotel is good as it is close to Barri Gotic and Las Rambla The hotel checkin was fairly quick and the lobby is quite nice The hotel Wi Fi was fast and easy to login too when it worked The hotel has a decent fitness centre as well as business centre which you can have access to at any time throughout the day which is convenient The bathroom was a decent size with a walk in shower and the bathroom products were of a decent quality The room set size was okay as there was room for you to store your luggage as well as walk around Relatively speaking the hotel is not that expensive when compared to other hotels in the area 
479230,Ilunion Almirante, They don t offer a king bed or queen bed option only to have 2 twins pushed together That s fine so long at you make the twins into a king but to push the beds together but keep them made into twins Terrible idea and outdated Also the bathroom was incredibly small , The location was the best part of this property
479231,Ilunion Almirante, The room was dirty and small the corridors were chipped and old and unkempt the reception was smart but staff unkempt the whole place was a rip off and poor value for money so bad I diud not even stay for breakfast Chipped tables in the room stains and the ceiling coming apart Terrible,No Positive
479232,Ilunion Almirante, People talk outside of my room or next door just like speaking in front of me I can clearly hear every word Extremely noisy especially when some weird lady talk in the hallway everyday during daytime while I m sleeping Jet lag in American accent That lasts 4 days while I stay there, Location
479233,Ilunion Almirante, 200 euro to have a storage as a bedroom completely dirty dusty and small as a doghouse I had to fight also to get an iron I was shocked , The taxi station beside to run away 
479234,Ilunion Almirante, We ve found a cockrouch in a toilette and there was no view from a room the windows was covered with some foil which was not showing the awful view outside By awful I mean the wall from the next building and some pipes Generally toilette was not clean the bath had some dark spots on a silicon I think this was some fungal or something which obviously could be cleaned with any chlorine detergent And the cockrouch was the worst Finally we did get other room but still it was a shock that it happened in a hotel which seems to worry about quality The rooms on a lower level are generally not worth any money toilette could be cleaner in general, Location
479235,Ilunion Almirante, Our hotel had zero air con which was a feature which was included and in 34 degree heat of August this was terrible and on talking to staff at reception they were not able to provide a fan as it was August they offered free breakfast but as we were departing early the following day this wasn t a solution we could have taken advantage of The room was extremely basic with no ironing facilities or kettle Room had refrigerator which wasn t working and tiles in bathroom were cracked and not the cleanest bathtub and sinks had awfully suspicious black hairs Room was over all tired and needing a good revamp I would only recommend this hotel to budget conscious travels and not for a romantic city break I came on my 21st birthday for 3 nights with my best mate for a crazy weekend and we most certainly had this Taking my partner here for a romantic weekend I wouldn t have even unpacked my bags It s as basic and you could imagine , The hotel looked excellent from reception well air conditioned lobby and functioning elevators to rooms Room had excellent hairdryer and came with fresh towels Beds were also extremely comfortable Free bottles of water on arrival and through out stay which was ideal Location was only a 3 mins walk to last ramblas and a 20min walk to barceloreta beach which was amazing 
479236,Ilunion Almirante, THe tv was not working The seif in the room was broken we change at another room and still the same problem In the bathroom was always dripping water from the seeling they tryed to fix that but the water still dripped off a lot Very bad hotel You should never come here , Nothing 2 Stars Hotel Maximum 
479237,Ilunion Almirante, Breakfast is not included in the room rate The hotel itself is dirty The room is very dirty curtains The floors do not wash just a vacuum cleaner Room facing the inner space with communications Very dark even on a sunny day Poor soundproofing Rate this hotel does not match the quality Look for other options , The hotel s location is excellent all the sights are close by
