153617,ME London by Melia, Room was dusty Appliances that didn t work Broken handles on the bathroom doors Noisy Outside furniture weathered and dirty A lot of noise from Radio Rooftop Couldn t sleep until it closed after midnight,No Positive
153618,ME London by Melia, When i upgraded the receptionist mentioned that the hotel roof top bar was noisy but it wasn t the problem The problem was all the discarded cigarette ends thrown onto the balcony by the patrons of the bar , Booked a room on the 9th floor with a balcony my wife smokes and upgraded to a river view at check in It was worth the extra cash View was great London Eye The Shard Tower Bridge just to mention a few landmarks The room service breakfast was plentiful and delicious it was never late 
153619,ME London by Melia, The door of room is a bit heavy , The hotel is chic and Modern Bed is comfortable the concierge and the doorman is incredibly nice and hard working and professional the day we left hotel there is a cycle event so the road was blocked and raining outside we need a taxi to get to airport but can not get it easily the door man and concierge staff was standing in the rain to help us to get one for more than 20 mins then finally get one where the taxi stops at about 200m from hotel so they have to push our luggage all the way to Taxi my last time stay in London is at W hotel but I have to say the service here is better than W if you like similar vibe hotel but with more thoughtful service maybe this could b a good choice
153620,ME London by Melia, What s not to love about The Me I could have used a make up mirror which was absent in our Urban Terrace room , We love The Me In the past 2 years we have stayed here every time we re in London The position can not be beaten with proximity to so many theatres within walking distance some literally across the road Covent Garden the Thames restaurants and transport Just love the pyramid style reception area with the ever changing light show just has to be seen of course the welcome prosecco or orange juice I love that the staff concierge reception actually acknowledge that we are returning guests are so friendly attentive 
153621,ME London by Melia,No Negative, An oasis in the heart of the city From the welcome and help of the porters to the check in and check out the hotel is the most considered and warm welcome we have ever encountered The communication before our arrival was timely and personal The cocktails in the rooftop bar were amazing also 
153622,ME London by Melia, The rooftop terrace was partially closed which was unfortunate as the bar was very busy the weather very warm and it also meant that we were unable to enjoy the view from the 10th floor , The food was excellent
153623,ME London by Melia,No Negative, Very very Central You are right across the street from the Louis Vuitton store And it s a 10 minute walk to Las Ramblas which makes you feel like you re right in the middle of the hustle bustle but still just slightly away from it If you want to shop in Barcelona this is the perfect place to stay 
153624,ME London by Melia,No Negative, the hotel has great location only a few minutes from Covent garden we ate breakfast at the hotel the food and services was great we enjoy the time at the bar on the roof we really recommend this hotel
153625,ME London by Melia, The only thing I would try to improve is the choice of bread types available for breakfast , The bedroom and the building in general is amazing minimalistic and yet somehow welcoming and cosy Staff at reception and front door are both friendly and professional as was everyone in the breakfast room although Karen deserves a special mention as she always made us feel especially welcome Needless to say the location is ideal City and West End both within walking distance and some rooms even have a view of the Thames 
153626,ME London by Melia, As above , Generally I enjoy everything but one thing the concierge service I specifically request the delivery of one important package by June 22 10am when I call the front desk at 8 20am I call again at 10am but once again nobody comes At 10 25am I go down to the reception and insist wait there Volia in 5 mins I get it Very bad communication and not even one Sorry to the situation 
153627,ME London by Melia, they need to have either powdered milk or bottled cold milk in the minibar for in room coffee , the renovated design interiors were lovely both the public areas such as the lounges restaurants and lobbies and more importantly the room everything worked and in the room all details were customizable e g air conditioning critical because of the heat wave lighting and shower bath huge plus they had 3 charging outlets for the 3 main types of voltages UK Euro US in case you forgot yours the staff were all super accommodating and worked as a team together it was great having a room on a high floor with terrace and highly recommend doing so if you can 
153628,ME London by Melia, Pretty poor service in Radio the roof top bar 20 mins to get served despite booking a table in advance 20 mins extra to then get our drinks and then they gave our food to the next table , Stylish hotel in a great London location Recommend paying more for a balcony room with great views over London 
153629,ME London by Melia, Nothing , The bedroom so so peaceful and comfy Slept so well The staff on check in particularly Maria Stayed an extra night loved it Near everything Can to Covent Garden theatres London eye Buckingham palace Trafalgar Square etc
153630,ME London by Melia,No Negative, The staff really made my experience from the housekeeping to the front desk to the concierge to the amazing bar back who made the best drinks for me even though he wasnt a bar tender it was truly a lovely hotel and the location is super If you are a theatre going person and you love nice reataurants and bars there is nowhere else to stay It was perfect 
153631,ME London by Melia, Balcony was small room needed freshening up with paint TV was temperamental staff seemed unorganised things were not done as they should have been requests for our room were forgotten empty promises from staff breakfast was poor very fatty bacon greasy eggs dried beans limited selection for a 5 star hotel , Modern contemporary reception is beautiful
153632,ME London by Melia, Shower caps need to be provided We did not find a restaurant menu in our room Only one bottle of water for two people on first night but nothing we did not like , Staff were excellent Welcome was very good Location ideal Radio rooftop was a great experience even at our age 
153633,ME London by Melia, nothing much, all the staff were great right from being met through to the trouble taken to get a selected table in the restaurant really really good and I am very picky great location room a bit small but more than made up for this by great design and modern approach so all you need some really excellent thought has gone into making everything available in the space and aren t all London hotel rooms a bit small
153634,ME London by Melia, Overpriced altough not having a pool or spa area You just pay for a large bedroom and the location a very high price , The room was large and comfy Modern facilities The location was great 
153635,ME London by Melia, Room was comfy but broken switch cannot turn off bedside lights and broken balcony door handles Good experience otherwise, Good stay and experience 
153636,ME London by Melia, Prior to arriving we had been offered a complementary bottle of champagne for the room but there was only one glass provided I was also offered the opportunity to have a message written on the mirror in the room which I thought was really lovely but it didn t happen no message on any mirror The complementary toiletries had been used a couple of them were half full What I would like to say is when spending that kind of money which to us is a major treat we are not flush in anyway have saved for ages for this occasion you hope attention to detail would be made but we were offered a room upgrade on check in so that was lovely for us and being given that kind of service how can you complain it was fantastic The above mini negative comments are observations only and in no way a complaint x, The minimal modern style Roof Top Bar Our room was upgraded on check in as we were celebrating a birthday 
153637,ME London by Melia, Bed was too hard for us and we couldn t get to sleep before 1am as room was noisy from music coming from Radio Bar , Smart modern interior and excellent staff
153638,ME London by Melia, Instructions to work the coffee machine, Amazing staff all happy to help and go the extra mile facilities modern and lovely breakfast offered in the comfort of your own room Brilliant stay no complaints about hotel and staff 
153639,ME London by Melia, Leaving, From the moment you arrive you enter a world of aesthetic beauty and service of an impecable standard a pure dream world We drank at Radio and ate at STRK all of which added to the experience 
153640,ME London by Melia,No Negative, This was My first time staying at this amazing Hotel and it will not be my last Everything from the Arrival to the Departure was amazing Front Desk staff was so friendly and helpful I could not Fault their Service As it was my partners birthday I asked them to arrange a surprise We arrived in the room and there were cake and a bottle of champagne Writing on the mirror with a personal message to add a personal touch to the experience I would lie to thank every single member of staff at this hotel for making the experience so amazing I will be 100 Staying again Tip This hotel is very close to the Novello theater so if you are going to watch Mamma Mia you don t even have to walk 30 Seconds 
153641,ME London by Melia, Whilst the room was great it was close to the Penthouse From 2 30am for over 2 hours there were room doors being constantly knocked at doors opened and closed people in and out chatting in the hall way and mobile phones ringing If the noise was from the Penthouse maybe it would benefit from having direct access from the lift and not from the same hall way as other paying customers Disappointed not to have had a good nights sleep , For an extra 50 our room was upgraded to one on the 9th floor room 909 with a large balcony Room was a good size and the bathroom had both a bath and a shower The bed was super large and comfy Great room with a good view 
153642,ME London by Melia, The hallway is a bit dark but it wasn t a n issue, Staff are friendly and the room is very good modern design Hotel location is excellent with near by tube stations and allot of bus stops
153643,ME London by Melia,No Negative, Amazing service beautiful room fab location LOVED IT Would highly recommend for anyone to stay Lovely extra touches like glass of prosecco when you arrive at check in Staff could not have been more friendly and helpful 
153644,ME London by Melia, This stylish luxury hotel is in a fantastic location and is stunning however we had very poor service in the bar We ordered Bar food it took 45 minutes to arrive was average at best Despite the 5 prices I deliberately took off the service charge when I signed the bill in check out found it had been put back on I complained and the service charge was removed but frankly I expect better response to poor service in a hotel of this standard , Stylish hotel very comfortable rooms 
153645,ME London by Melia, Bath tub in the bathroom but no bubble bath only shower gel , Everything was beautiful from the entrance of the hotel to the reception and service The mood lighting in the room and living area was amazing the candles the av and bluetooth functions so we could play our own music The smart tv also had a good variety of playlists Hair straightener in the room international plug sockets no need for adaptors The rooftop bar was a very nice place to have a few drinks with a scenic view 
153646,ME London by Melia, Our room was on the 8th floor and there was some noise from the Radio Rooftop bar , The location is excellent for Theatreland The room was spacious and the bed very comfortable 
153647,ME London by Melia, Room 402 Whenever the room next door 401 closed the door it was like they had come in my room so noisy walls very thin, The room layout Perfect for theatres and Covent Garden and loads of restaurants in walking distance
153648,ME London by Melia, Just that we had two single beds put together as a double that kept splitting apart this was a little frustrating Overall clean tidy and welcoming, Really liked the stk restaurant and the radio roof top experience very attentive service and clean The welcome bottle of champagne for my partners birthday was excellent
153649,ME London by Melia, There was nothing not to like at this hotel It ticks all the boxes , The hotel smelt lovely when you walked in Room was lovely with a nice bottle of champers and a mini chocolate birthday cake lovely touch A surprise for my birthday which I wasnt expecting Bed was very comfortable Location of hotel too was great close to all the threatres and some very good restaurants and bars and only a 5 minute walk to the River Thames 
153650,ME London by Melia, The breakfast is a bit monotonous and expensive but not ridiculous for the hotel however there are so many shops right outside cheaper options and more variety are literally over the street , Perfect location amazing property It was truly 5star service From the time we walked into the hotel it felt out of this world Its totally different very modern and new age The rooms are all automated with ambient lighting as well The light show in the lobby was really cool The location is superb It is on the Strand which and bounds covent gardens and wellington st So tons to do within walking distance 
153651,ME London by Melia, Didn t have an iron in our room which would have been ideal had to ring reception to fetch one to our room but they was quick and friendly about it, The view from our room
153652,ME London by Melia, I cannot fault one thing every single thing surpassed my expectations and I am a customer for life The best hotel I have stayed in in London very happy , The staff where extremely extremely welcoming attentive and provided excellent customer service I would like to say a special thank you to Simona and Riccardo who made my two night stay absolutely perfect This has been the best birthday thus far and I will definitely be returning I also highly recommend STK restaurant thats inside the hotel And finally the hotel itself the food the location was 10 10
153653,ME London by Melia,No Negative, Had the most amazing stay at the hotel room was beautiful with big bath huge balcony and amazing view Went to STK for dinner food was 10 10 as always and then up to radio roof top bar it has stunning views Staff at the hotel were amazing and couldn t do more for us I will 10000 be staying at this hotel again we loved it 
153654,ME London by Melia, Had to book a car 4 to 5 hours before departure 6 of us ended up in a black cab as didn t realise we had to book in advance, The bed said double on the Internet and was huge All staff were very polite and accommodating we didn t want to leave
153655,ME London by Melia, Nothing it was all perfect , I emailed before our trip to say that it was a belated valentine s present for my partner Our room was made into a romantic haven and it was absolutely perfect I didn t know but my partner had planned to propose to me that evening whilst we were at dinner but as we walked into the room he did it there and then because everything was just so lovely We can t wait to return 
153656,ME London by Melia,No Negative, Bed was extra large and very comfy Great rooftop bar great location hotel staff friendly champagne and birthday cake in room plus early check in all in all fantastic

153659,ME London by Melia,No Negative, The room is stylish with all the modern amenities and a great view from the balcony since we stayed on the 9th floor The Valentines day arrangements were great the room was full of rose petals and a free bottle of champagne and some strawberries

153661,ME London by Melia,No Negative, Fantastic large comfy bed with quality linen Staff really went the extra mile To make the stay extra special with complimentary personal touches in the room Fashionable luxury
153662,ME London by Melia, Our room card didn t operate the lift or open our door on Saturday night The staff immediately corrected this and it was a small hick up in an other wise brilliant stay , Spectucular stay Just walked into the reception lobby and this alone will dictate your opinion of the hotel 
153663,ME London by Melia, The lifts at times had a mind of their own On more than one occasion we met people totally confused as to where they were going This was true of us also , The room was spacious and the bed very comfortable Also the sound proofing was superb and we could not hear the traffic ooutside 
153664,ME London by Melia, Unfortunately we wasn t there long enough, The whole experience was amazing My sister I stayed here to celebrate a special birthday A wonderful surprise greeted us in our room a bottle of champagne a beautiful cake together with a personalized message written on the mirror All of the staff were extremely friendly professional who couldn t do enough for us 
153665,ME London by Melia, Reception area is dim and gloomy Small room, Reception staff were cooperative and friendly We ordered some hot drinks on New Year s Eve through room service and we were surprised when they informed us they were complimentary Nice gesture 
153666,ME London by Melia, Extremely dark hotel poor lighting uber trendy Almost too trendy I don t think older people would like it The digital lighting in the bedrooms is confusing and not user friendly especially during the midnight dash to the loo Very expensive , Great location Staff are very friendly and helpful 
153667,ME London by Melia, Paying a lot of money for a bed with 2 mattresses pushed together and no mattress topper to even try and hide it Not a good night sleep and not what you expect from a top notch hotel Also no response from the hotel when I have emailed them about this , The staff and view were lovely 
153668,ME London by Melia, Nothing really was a very pleasant stay , It s has a lovely scent when you walk through the front door staff are very happy and helpful Stylish room was a nice size Roof top bar had a great atmosphere

153671,ME London by Melia,No Negative, The food was excellent Especially the steak All meals were delicious Very polite and friendly staff Great location and we would recommend this hotel 
153672,ME London by Melia, Would love to stay again in the future but unfortunately as the price per night is expensive it will only ever be a one off stay to celebrate a 50th birthday , The location was excellent The staff couldn t help you enough Very modern and quirky design of hotel 
153673,ME London by Melia, Nothing it was perfect , Everything Easily the best hotel we have ever stayed in 5 stars is not enough From the welcome and glass of prosecco the extra treats in the room the amazing view from the balcony the cool rooftop bar the delicious STK restaurant The list goes on and on P s location for London sights and shopping is also 10 10 Special mention about the concierge Luis I have never met someone who understands excellent customer service as he does personal warming and made our stay so special Thank you 
153674,ME London by Melia, I liked everything , Great hotel and great staff service at its best and always with a smile I was here for our end of year awards ceremony and wasn t able to tie my bow tie a member of staff Francois I think personally came up and tied it for me great service Coming from Dubai we are used to great service and quality I would highly recommend this hotel 
153675,ME London by Melia, Used the restaurant and as much as I hate to say it but the food was awful The waiter poured red wine all over whit shirt and tuxedo of which was tailor made in Dubai and completely ruined the shirt alone was 300 furious ,No Positive
153676,ME London by Melia, Busy lift and no real other option from street level Decor ie black walls and very little natural lighting very bizarre Did not detract from our enjoyment , Comfy bed Very clean Staff really friendly Location fantastic 
153677,ME London by Melia, DISAPPOINTED BY THE RECENT LOSS OF THE HOTEL S FAMED ITALIAN RESTAURANT WHICH WAS ONE OF MY REASONS FOR CHOOSING IT, THE SPACIOUSNESS OF THE ROOM AND THE SIZE OF THE BED
153678,ME London by Melia, Loved everything only negative was STK We were looking so forward to dinner there however it was like a loud club at 10pm with drunk loud folk coming in to just drink and dance Better to go for lunch as opposed to dinner, Charming helpful staff Great breakfast Loved the mood lighting and music in room too
153679,ME London by Melia, Nothing , The whole experience was amazing The staff were very welcoming unbelieveable stay we had complementary champagne in the room it made my Daughters surprise trip plus Radio Bar was a major plus Thank you to all Maria Samantha
153680,ME London by Melia, Pillows very loud music at restaurant we think hotel is oriented towards the younger generation and I am 42 sometimes it s nice to have a quiet and tranquil place to go back to when you re in a busy city on holiday would not think of going again , Nothing in particular
153681,ME London by Melia, No swimming pool Lift worked intermittently and there was no visible sign of any stairs After asking one of the staff we were informed the stairs only serviced the hotel up to the 7th floor we were on the 8th floor Many of the electronic devices were showing signs of malfunction , Great central location Amazing sized bed A for cleanliness and friendliness of staff Beautiful decor 
153682,ME London by Melia, The lifts A tad slow in coming , All good Concierge to park the car was waiting outside which in central London is essential Easy check in Comfortable rooms modern high tech with balcony Beds and pillows very comfortable Too comfortable Access to Radio club very nice Special mention to to concierge boys they were exceptional 
153683,ME London by Melia, As above for the price paid for the hotel you don t get lot for your money Bin was not empty on arrival had to wave down my own cab on leaving hotel open the main door myself no concierge in site I paid a lot off money for a nice view which does not even have shelter for the English rainy days No water or fruit within rooms on arrival had to return to reception twice on arrival as door card not working in the end just accepted to use the one card rather than one each for my wife and I Very noisy from bar above An overall very bad stay and disappointed in the hotel itself Feel like I was robbed in broad daylight with your exspensive rates , Not much was to like
153684,ME London by Melia,No Negative, the staff was very friendly and professional the service from reception to room service was impeccable the location is amazing and the rooms just wow 
153685,ME London by Melia, Nothing at all , I love the hotel Will definitely come back to stay here again soon Super great location Very quiet Very clean First class services Excellent in every points plus service minded staffs in all levels 
153686,ME London by Melia, I didn t like the lighting in the room took a while to work out the lighting and slept with a pink neon light on, Didn t want for anything they had thought if everything and the quality of goods was very good 
153687,ME London by Melia, Staff didn t always seem happy to be working there we had to ask people for help a lot rather then them asking if they could help us , Great location and amazing roof top bar Really clean and modern room 
153688,ME London by Melia, the Music DJ in the restaurant kept us awake till 1 pm when they finished our room was 106 felt like we were in the room with the music if you have a function you should notify guests as you are a hotel first,No Positive
153689,ME London by Melia, Expensive everything but worth the splurge , Attentive and friendly staff made the visit fantastic and a glass of prosecco on arrival was a classy treat The hotel is striking in its design and the room was ample and comfortable Overall it s very modern and sleek which we like The room was quiet We d go back in a heartbeat 
153690,ME London by Melia, Checked in at 3pm and room wasn t ready The incidentals deposit was atrocious and their machine wouldn t read my card so they made me go and take out cash incurring services charges and then the exchange rate changed so I lost money that I never technically spent Disgusting , The location was great
153691,ME London by Melia, Leaving , From the amazing orchid scent as you walk in to the glass of bubbles as you check in the ME truly gives the best welcome Not only are the staff attentive friendly and most helpful they also look like Hollywood film stars Spot the Bond lookalike As for the location perfect And the best cherry on top has to be the best rooftop bar in the city Can t wait to go back already
153692,ME London by Melia, The rooftop bar full of stuck up snotty arrogant shallow people, The bed was comfy and the pillows were great the mood lighting in the room just made the night and the breakfast in the room was gorgeous and the friendly staff were always bery helpful and did a good job of making us feel comfortable 
153693,ME London by Melia, maybe an offer of breakfast to be included in the price , the staff at the ME Hotel were fantastic from the porters to the concierge and every member of staff were extremely friendly I have been to several hotels and I would give the ME hotel the highest score 
153694,ME London by Melia,No Negative, Great find and very cool funky hotel Rooftop bar is nice although a tad on the pretentious side Service was a little slow too But the room was great and other staff were spot on Happily stay again
153695,ME London by Melia, It is difficult to find tables at the rooftop bar and though we had asked at reception if we could have a table before actually going up we were still made to understand that we would have to vacate ours after a given time even though hotel guests are supposed to be given priority , Staff are both professional and very friendly in this beautiful hotel recently renovated to plans by Sir Norman Foster The bedrooms are simple but functional and comfortable and rather spacious by London standards The location is priceless There is also a rooftop bar with excellent views of the Thames and central London 
153696,ME London by Melia, Could have been a few more in room complimentary items ie drinks snacks etc considering how much you pay for the room everyone loves a freebie Apart from that it was outstanding , Everything
153697,ME London by Melia, Thought it was expensive in comparison to other 5 star hotels in the area , Room was very well appointed and luxurious for a suite The room was very quiet and comfortable Staff where all very friendly and welcoming 
153698,ME London by Melia, The breakfast was a little cold for a full English will stick to the Continental next time , Superb service excellent quality hotel will stay again If you want to be spoilt this is the place to be 
153699,ME London by Melia, The bed was so uncomfortable both me and my partner had a terrible nights sleep We ate in the radio bar and the steak I have was mainly fat and the managers attitude about was really bad , The decor was nice
153700,ME London by Melia, We was a bit disappointed with the radio rooftop bar as thought it would be a nice relaxed chilled place to have a drink and enjoy the view Instead the staff on the podium were very unhappy and asked us to move from a table even though it didn t have a reserved plaque on it Music was a bit to loud we were shouting at each other just to have a conversation ,No Positive
153701,ME London by Melia, How small the room was I upgraded for my first wedding anniversary and was extremely disappointed we have stopped a few times in standard rooms and upgrade was 400 a night more and not worth a penny of it, Location and its appearance
153702,ME London by Melia,No Negative, I booked a superior room with balcony as we were celebrating my husband s birthday The staff were very friendly and courteous and the room was absolutely amazing We had a complimentary glass of prosecco whilst checking in and when we arrived in the room we were greeted with a lovely bottle of champagne on ice and chocolates Such a lovely touch We will definitely return 
153703,ME London by Melia, A little more clarity on pricing for in room items would ve been nice but that s nit picking , Everything was near enough perfect better than I even expected Our luggage was escorted to our room we were given a guided mini tour of the hotel the service was excellent and overall it s an amazing place to stay 
153704,ME London by Melia, Nothing everything was perfect , I took my wife for her 40th Birthday and the whole experience was first class Being attended to as soon as our taxi pulled up luggage taken off our hands the MOST spectacular reception area I have seen and we have stayed in some very nice hotels The personal touches we received as well from the hotel for the occasion gave the whole stay a very special feel one that we will not be forgetting The room itself was immaculate with mood lighting a beautiful bathroom area and a balcony with views over the city and the Radio rooftop bar is a must to try Perfect location for the Lyceum as well as we went to see the Lion King A very happy and memorable experience we will definitely be back again 
153705,ME London by Melia,No Negative, stayed on the first floor very quiet you would have never thought you were staying in such a busy part of London Location perfect for Covent Garden and the Embankment
153706,ME London by Melia, The bed We though we had a nice sized bed But it ended up being two doubles put together How did we know Because while sleeping in the middle one could feel the crack This is very uncomfortable and not expected at such a high rated hotel It was not a good sleep , Excellent location and staff Everyone was accommodating and very friendly
153707,ME London by Melia, the only thing that I personally did not like was that we were told we have access to the rooftop bar When we went the lady downstairs told us to come back after 15 mins since there was other people from outside the hotel in front of us I thought she should have let us in before them instead of making us wait since we are already residents in the hotel and should have immediate access and saw us coming down the elevator , we loved the luxury feel and design of the hotel The staff at the reception were very proffessional and friendly during check in and check out The room was very clean comfy beds
153708,ME London by Melia, nothing, staff were very attentive hotel extremely clean excellent location short walk to many good restaurants travelled with my 20 year old son he loved roof top bar with views over london apparently gets extremely busy at weekend on rooftop Radio bar
153709,ME London by Melia, Room was not cleaned even after it was requested after returning from being away from hotel 9am 7pm Roof top bar staff where just rude took 20minutes to get a drink Reception staff where not helpful Room 909 was shabby at best with none of the features of the smaller cheaper rooms and the sound proofing from roof top bar was not great This was my 3rd stay and after this one I would never stay at the ME London again , The location is good for Theatres and sights Concierge staff where helpful at front desk and bar staff on ground floor where very attentive 
153710,ME London by Melia, Brunch on Sunday on the rooftop radio bar was terrible and really bad service, We had a great guy from house keeping called Mahfut excuse spelling he went beyond to make is comfortable a really lovely happy to help chap
153711,ME London by Melia, A few small things in the room need attention shower door didn t fit the timed lighting was a bit erratic the toilet seat was unimaginably low to the ground Water pressure was at times poor, Great modern hotel with fantastic views from the Radio Bar
153712,ME London by Melia, Breakfast was poor ordered 2 full breakfast and only one arrived and had to share it between the two of us it was cold coffee cold pastries were lovely they were best part sorry but gor a 5 and 480 pound for the night the breakfast food wasnt up to the standard of the rest of the hotel ecspecially for the price they were charging for it i would stay again but not have breakfast next time , The whole experience was great 
153713,ME London by Melia, The thumping bass from the bar This was only minor and would not stop us coming back but was a little annoying when trying to get to sleep at midnight I guess it was the payoff for having a room on level 9 with great views , Attentive staff always made us feel welcome and the ambience and design of the hotel was remarkable 
153714,ME London by Melia, I found the rooms to be a bit underwhelming The broadloom was dated and the room was very small , Loved STK and Radio The convenience of having all my favourite socials spots in my hotel was ideal

153726,ME London by Melia, The Lifts took ages to arrive with no indication they were in transit , The comfort The staff The welcome great rooms Close to theatre and all the places of interest Wonderful 
153727,ME London by Melia, all good one day hotels will find a way to have proper curtains to block light out of the room but that day is too far for any hotel imcludong the ME, perfect even value for money for being in london doesn t fell so horrible
153728,ME London by Melia, Nothing much expect maybe for the breakfast it wasn t bad but it wasn t great, The balcony in the room is wonderful the staff are friendly and helpful The location of the hotel is excellent
153729,ME London by Melia, The price of drinks in the hotel were extortionate 2 jack Daniels 24 Have been to Dubai and the Maldives Barbados and stayed 5 not this expensive, The happy birthday greeting to my wife that was written beautifully on our mirror the lovely chocolates left on the bed
153730,ME London by Melia, Parking on arrival a nightmare Room light system not good if you have to get up in the middle of the night Food and drink although good quality was expensive, Staff friendly and v helpful Radio bar was excellent Room clean and comfortable
153731,ME London by Melia, The hotel location does not appear in some maps I got from visit the city office information Centers , Awesome location and outstanding facilities The GYM was not as excpacted but it meets the requirements of average travelers 
153732,ME London by Melia, Nothing the stay was perfect, The staff were lovely form the moment we arrived very welcoming and informative The hotel room and general decor of the hotel was absolutely amazing very modern and clean Felt like a celebrity throughout the whole stay 
153733,ME London by Melia, I love tea but sadly didn t like it in the machine in the room but I ordered from room service and it was fine x, We loved the style of the hotel The staff remembered us from last time and they are very friendly We just LOVE this hotel and wouldn t stay anywhere else Xxxx
153734,ME London by Melia,No Negative, Fabulous staff upgraded to a beautiful suite loads of touches like hair straighteners mood lighting and storage We had dinner at STK before visiting the Radio Rooftop Bar and it was lovely having everything under one roof Cannot fault the staff at all this was our second visit and we will certainly be back again 
153735,ME London by Melia, The bar staff on the top floor are not as sophisticated nice or professional as staff elsewhere in the hotel I assume this is because they are dealing with drunk people In general the top floor bar is quite pretentious We attended it on a friday night between 12pm and 2am the music was shocking pop for teenagers the atmosphere pretentious the clientele well put it this way there are better places to party but if you want a convenient drink late at night then do pay it a visit , Front of house staff were brilliant Concierge team also Beautiful hotel They make you feel welcome and valued I would certainly visit again Exceptional staff were Dimitri Front of House and Angelo Concierge They made our stay feel that more special 
153736,ME London by Melia, Neighbours were noisy late into the night Not the hotels fault but room could have been better sound proofed , The staff are always extremely helpful and friendly They really do go the extra mile and nothing seems to be any trouble The glass of wine on arrival and free drink voucher for the bar or restaurant is a nice touch as well 
153737,ME London by Melia,No Negative, It was my boyfriends birthday and the lovely reception team organised to leave a birthday card and wrote happy birthday on the mirror such a lovely little touch
153738,ME London by Melia, It would be nice to get breakfast thrown in with price and not to be charged as an extra as the rooms are already quite expensive , We had a lovely stay great location The rooms were very modern and tastefully done Lovely and clean The staff couldn t have been more helpful The only downfall is alcohol is very expensive in the bars Would highly recommend this hotel 
153739,ME London by Melia, SDK restaurant tries to be a club and a restaurant which means it s difficult to talk over the music In addition our table was right next to the bar There was a ledge behind our seats that people rested their drinks on One of these drinks was knocked over luckily not on any of us This strikes me as poor design as you must have complaints from diners at that table every weekend I d remove the shelf if possible ,No Positive
153740,ME London by Melia, We were not given an induction to the hotel So had no idea where breakfast was and at what time Or where the other restaurants and Gym were , Loved the ambience of the hotel The Cucina restaurant was amazing Not rustic italian home cooking more like italian contemporary fusion Super quiet rooms given its location on a busy London junction off the Strand The Radio roof top bar on the 9th floor has a open 360 stunning view over London and the Thames with a funky dj and buzzing atmosphere 
153741,ME London by Melia, The only tiny point we didn t like were the lifts as you need to put your key card into it to make it work But we got stuck twice and my boyfriend had to peel open the doors once Something so simple caught us and other guests out more than once , From the moment i booked online and had a few extra requests the hotel and the exceptional staff went above and beyond in every aspect We had the most amazing stay and cannot wait to go back on our next special occasion 
153742,ME London by Melia, Visited twice in 3 days on both occasions the service in the STK bar was terrible 20mins to get served at the bar when it wasn t particularly busy , Location room
153743,ME London by Melia, That you can t open a window for natural fresh air that the air con goes off automatically after an hour or so , The location of this hotel is excellent and the taxis stop right outside so you can go anywhere without having to walk ages to grab a taxi Staff are really helpful and friendly and do their upmost to make your experience perfect This is the 2nd time we have stayed here and partied in the radio roof top bar we will be returning soon 
153744,ME London by Melia, Would have been nice to have be able to open a window although I guess the design of the rooms and windows would have made this impossible , Cool hotel if a little dark in some areas Maybe not for the clostrphobic Room was beautiful with lots a tech Staff were very friendly and welcoming We used the restaurant and roof top bar all very good 
153745,ME London by Melia, Ha a great time in the rooftop bar but you HAVE to have a table Bar staff will ignore you other wise Would be better if they made a policy it was table service only They also ask very frequently if you want more drinks Not quite pushy but certainly buying drinks secured your seat Don t get me wrong it was an amazing place Just a little thing that could easily be settled, Food Staff Accommodation
153746,ME London by Melia, We woke up to sick from the room next door on our balcony which the smell meant we were unable to stand on the balcony and enjoy the views , Unbelievable customer service from Beginning to end Check in was easy and check out without having to ask they offered to keep our bags so we could look around London Overall and amazing experience and would definitely return
153747,ME London by Melia, There was a connecting door if you wanted a connecting room even though we didn t want a connecting room the door was still there and OPEN At around 2am next door was drunk and very loud and barged through the connections door screaming because they were drunk The staff did nothing and when you re paying over 600 for 2 night it s not good For a good couple it s too posh to feel comfortable Wouldn t return ,No Positive
153748,ME London by Melia, Housekeeping failed to clean our rooms on two occasions which I feel is unacceptable for a hotel of this calibre, Great location lovely building Rooftop bar is a novelty Rooms were well appointed and very comfortable 
153749,ME London by Melia, Only suggestion for improvement was at breakfast staff standards were not the same seen at reception and other areas service was slow and items of our order forgotten Toast turned up at the table when we had finished our breakfast, Reception staff amazing gave a very pleasant welcome to the hotel Hotel has the wow factor every part from reception rooms restaurants bars exceptional Gave a free upgrade as it was my fianc e s birthday had birthday wishes on the mirror in the room such a nice gesture
153750,ME London by Melia, The gym is ok but for a quality hotel like this you expect more, The quality is everywhere in this hotel the location design staff beds showers restaurants bars I always book this hotel when in London if its available for acceptable price
153751,ME London by Melia, Service in the Radio Bar was slow and inattentive and contrasting to the rest of our experience Still a great stay , Truly wonderful The building design and the staff made our Christmas trip great 
153752,ME London by Melia,No Negative, Great location of hotel just a couple minutes walk from central Covent Garden Hotel was very clean and stunningly decorated Room was comfy clean with great facilities Shower was nice and powerful too

153754,ME London by Melia, The bathroom is terrible i am in hotels around the world weekly and I still don t appreciate no locks on the door no soundproofing almost see through glass , Location Staff Great Lobby bed was great

153756,ME London by Melia, I think it is a tad too expensive And could be a bit more affordable , This hotel was super friendly super clean and super cool Great location with a great restraunt stk And the rooms a fabulous 
153757,ME London by Melia, The hotel is an office conversion and as such internally its a maze with the Reception on the 1st floor at the back of the building dark black decor to the hallways and narrow rooms Its also pricey for everyday business travel , Location breakfast buffet rooftop bar 
153758,ME London by Melia,No Negative, Staff excellent especially on reception Helped provide an upgrade room and a table in the bar at night Manager in the hotel was great from Sunderland Would stay again Gavin Fox
153759,ME London by Melia, Service at breakfast was pretty poor Ordered a tea didn t receive after asking numerous times Also had to send our breakfast back one day due to it being cold This put us off dining in the hotel in the evening TV signal was also a bit interment kept freezing , Location was great 
153760,ME London by Melia, nothing, everything staff very friendly especially those in reception exceptional from the moment we stepped into the building Loved the design of the hotel contemporary room view and upgrade Breakfast was wonderful and overall such a very positive experience I stay in many 5 star hotels but this felt extra special 
153761,ME London by Melia, Lack of internal signage meant I couldn t locate studio I thought gym was only facility and it was squashed and average The communal spaces of hotel corridor etc too dark Doors to bedroom too heavy unsuitable for anyone of average strength Door not self closing making a fire hazard Bathroom didn t have bin or hook to hang robe Bedroom had coffee machine but no tea making facility Breakfast was chaos and I wasn t shown the buffet so thought the menu was it Basically all just ill thought out ,No Positive
153762,ME London by Melia,No Negative, Service was amazing staff were very friendly and the venue was incredible If you want to splurge on a one night experience then ME is the place to go 
153763,ME London by Melia, The hallway was little bit dark but I guess that s not a big issue, The room is spacious comparing London hotels room with a modern design enjoyed the balcony and the location
153764,ME London by Melia, Safe boxes are very hard to open and for two days I even did not know there is a fridge in the room I think it is best if concierge staff are train better to show all the room facilities to the guest open arrival , The hotel unusual design Location reception area the bar in the Lobby the Italian Rest The corridors are dark but I like it it is unique and different from other hotels I even had a photo session shooting with my friend in the corridor with the unusual dark slab colors as background all together very good hotel
153765,ME London by Melia, The standard rooms were not worth the price the Mayfair Hotel is less and I think it is better with bigger rooms as standard If you have the money I would suggest staying here but in a suite or a deluxe room If you don t I would go the Mayfair Hotel as it is better value Both are premium hotels and aren t cheap but the room size at ME Hotel is disappointing for the 330 price , Amazing design and facilities ie radio rooftop and STK The staff are very polite and helpful the whole place is immaculate 
153766,ME London by Melia, Service at breakfast very poor Wrong food given to us both mornings we ate there Waited ages for tea and told machine playing up both mornings not what I expect from a five star hotel Halls leading to bedrooms too dark, Rooms were comfortable and spacious Meal in Italian was excellent 
153767,ME London by Melia, There was no welcome into the room After waiting so long I had to call for my luggage They knew that I was traveling with my children but they didn t supply any extras to accommodate them I had to ask for everything from extra cups glasses bathrobes slippers They gave me only one water to share so I had to ask for more The connector where I connect my Ipod was obviously damaged and I had to wait around for someone to come and fix it twice so it was very difficult to relax in the room My previous experience at the ME was excellent but this time my children nor I enjoyed our stay here , Book a suite as I was staying with my children They like playing with the playstation Comfy bed lovely bathroom 
153768,ME London by Melia, That it was ok to smoke outside on the roof terrace even though people were eating , The rooftop bar was the icing on the cake And a welcome glass of Prosecco was a lovely touch 
153769,ME London by Melia, Waited over half an hour for a round of drinks at the radio bar, Friendly helpful staff Conceigie walked us to covert garden carrying bags to find a taxi as the tour of Britain closed the road in front of hotel
153770,ME London by Melia, Tried to get a cup of tea after a show at appx 10 30 pm and told they don t serve either in the evening Why not Also much too dark inside the hotel corridors, Suitable only for the young with very good eyesight as the inside is very dark and gloomy And why no tea or coffee served in the evening 
153771,ME London by Melia, Nothing , The hotel is GORGEOUS Sleek modern design The location is great and waling distance to the Somerset House Theater we saw kinky boots and close tube access as well The room was very large especially for the city Everything I expected and more The upstairs bar was fabulous 
153772,ME London by Melia, cooked breakfast waiting time was too long On the first day my husbands breakfast was given to someone else and the serving staff noticed but never came to let us know or apologise we had to speak to the attendant 10 minutes later when it still had not arrived and then still had to wait over 10 minutes more for the breakfast to arrive and we were still charged two toothbrushes between three of us and had to wait until the day after to get an extra one secured by a note and not through reception as we had requested had a shirt and jacket pressed but the shirt was appalling had to request an iron and board to correct this although they apologised and refunded the cost of the pressing we should not have been put in that predicament was not able to find a bottle opener so consequently we did have anything out of the minibar and after everything could not be bothered to ask reception for one used Tesco express across the street instead booked taxi to heathrow through hotel and was charged 25 more going than when we came , location friendly staff comfortable bed 
153773,ME London by Melia,No Negative, A beautiful hotel with an amazing staff The reception area was stunning My room and view were breathtaking This hotel is perfect for a couple or someone traveling solo 
153774,ME London by Melia, Corridors a little too dark could hardly see signs for room numbers, Good location for Covent Garden Great for young crowd Suite had great bathroom and TV s Amazing reception
153775,ME London by Melia,No Negative, Lovely location the entrance and reception absolutely stunning but our room was slightly disappointing couldn t open window air conditioning ok but got cold etc the neighbours had adjoining door and slammed it shut so many times that it made you jump out of your skin and at 3 30 a group of men decided to have an argument in the corridor outside our door There wasn t a bath and after all our walking would have loved a long soak Sandro made our stay special he had remembered us from our visit before and left us a welcoming present thank you you are a gentlemen a star look forward to seeing you again
153776,ME London by Melia, there was nothing we did not like , Staff were extremely attentive Facilities were top class Welcome and check in complimentary drink was much appreciated Room was comfortable and very tastefully decorated The rooftop bar and view was amazing if I re visit very likely i would reserve a table 
153777,ME London by Melia, It wasn t clear where the various bars or restaurants were located in the hotel as there didn t appear to be an obvious sign or map To improve the card function for the lift the sleeve for the card given to the guests could possibly have written on it Insert then remove card to press for floor Because it wasn t particularly clear how this system worked , We were really happy with how the staff responded to our requirements throughout our stay The breakfast was very good The in room service was excellent 
153778,ME London by Melia, Didn t like how when we checked in that they took the price of the room plus 100 as I wasn t told at anytime that was going to happen so when I told them I didn t have the extra 100 in the bank I was made to feel uncomfortable and embarrassed, I liked how the staff treated me and my wife like we were royalty 
153779,ME London by Melia,No Negative, absolutely amazing hotel from the moment you arrive outside to the moment you leave there is nothing that is too much trouble for the staff to do for you stunning interior collest roof top bar in the city amazing food and the rooms wow also so quiet although right in the centre of everthing 
153780,ME London by Melia, Ordered an egg bacon sandwich to the room for breakfast which came toasted bacon was tasteless egg over cooked Also had to order tea for room which was excellent tea but 11 for 2 as there is only a coffee machine in room which we couldn t get to work but apparently does tea too, Staff very helpful loved the rooms facilities 
153781,ME London by Melia, Two gripes no tea bags in room not everyone is a nesspresso lover The Hungarian Waitress in the Radio Bar poured our bottle of Lauren Perrier Champagne to empty in half an hour Way too fast and unclassy obviously this was to make us buy another bottle which we did but thereafter we took charge of our own refilling Waitress apart Radio Bar is fantastic , Hotel Staff fabulous from meet and greet to first floor front desk Internal architecture is just awesome wow
