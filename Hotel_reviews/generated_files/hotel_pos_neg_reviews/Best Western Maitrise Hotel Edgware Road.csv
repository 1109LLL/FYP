157843,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Room had no windows i asked for a little something like a card or flowers for my wife as it was her birthday Got nothing All the sounds from other rooms came in Neighbours were banging and slaming doors early hours of the morning Kept hearing other people flush toilets Cupboard was broken Lights above bed didnt work , The Staff member at reception was very friendly and got us complimentary breakfast as we were not happy wth the room 
157844,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, our room was very small and didn t have a window it wa also extremely noisy in the morning as we were right next to the cafe area not a great deal of choice for breakfast, 2 minute walk to the underground
157845,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, When we arrived to check in we were asked to take a seat in the coffee shop for 5 minutes the two girls were chatting and laughing at the reception whilst we waited after 5 minutes we asked again to check in when we arrived in our room there was a guy with his head under the bathroom sink and a toolbox Tiny room could just about manouvre around the bed managed to iron hence blocking entrance to bathroom room exit , Comfy bed

157848,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, The area was very poor And room was also scruffy with black markings all over the walls , Room was cosy and quiet modern wouldn t say a 4 star hotel 
157849,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Windowless room was a disappointment It wouldn t have been asuch of a problem if it otherwise resembled the pictures of the standard double rooms but it was tiny and I could hear all of the noises from the coffee shop upstairs including water running through pipes There was an odd locked door in my room as well that had light coming from all sides through the night Not the worst place to sleep but not a place where you could rest and hang out ,No Positive
157850,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, a bit noisy from the street , Albeit small the room was modern very clean and very practical Overall this is an excellent value for money for london as long as all you need is a clean comfortable room to sleep 
157851,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, The hotel itself you had to enter through a cafe that was unclearly marked in an extremely unwelcoming unattractive area which was also opposite a building site The staff were blunt and too busy serving coffee or looking busy than checking us in The breakfast was an abomination serving cheap value cereal bars a few sad hard boiled eggs left on a plate cold and some stale brioche I would t even call it continental just appalling and not worth the money in the slightest I could have bought the whole of the cheap Tesco selection myself The room itself was topped it off by the broken sink and tiles surrounding the basin dirty scuffed shower plate and the sink did not drain properly The walk too the zoo was around 35 40 minutes and the connections a pain for the main tube stations The money for the compact rooms shoddy street and disgusting breakfast is not one I will EVER choose to do again ,No Positive
157852,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, The ceiling in the shower cubicle needs to be fixed it was very stained and off putting Although I appreciate that the windows could be opened they also needed to have an extra level of glazing as it was very noisy There was no extra space in the room about a foot between end of bed and wall opening the wardrobe meant that the room was full , Reception were very friendly and helpful Windows could be opened 
157853,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, The room was not particularly big and had no window The room had a Skylight which the cover kept lifting off because of the wind At 4 30 in a morning a sudden burst of light into the room wakes you up with a start ,No Positive

157855,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Had a room the size of a prison cell and had no window Very dark and depressing room Had trouble locating reception desk as it s tucked away in the cafe, Cafe in hotel is nice
157856,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, I paid 12 95 for cheese an egg and some ham for breakfast Since I don t eat bread my choices were really limited The bathroom was dirty my toilet seat had a yellow patch on it and a stray pube , Bed was comfortable nice decor
157857,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, The room was very small which was disappointing There was no window but again air con helped I paid 30 extra for breakfast for 2 days and it states cooked or continental breakfast however there was no cooked breakfast so I paid 30 extra for a bowl of cereal I have put a formal complaint as the advertisement is completely false Do not book breakfast , I liked the air con it always kept the room cool as we had no window The wifi was fab 
157858,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, The cleaners do not thoroughly clean the toilets as the mirrors and other areas hold the stain as seen the previous day The room i stayed in was very small , Bed Linen is very clean Accessibility to Bus Cab and Underground are all within 1 3mins from the reception Staff Elodie made my stay a pleasant one she is very courteous always smiling and ready to help

157861,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Far too noisy could hear traffic from outside and pedestrian crossing Could also hear people coming in and out of their rooms and the sound of the lift very poorly insulated To make things worse I was woken to the sound of building work outside the hotel at 8am , Good location simple adequate rooms

157863,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, We visited for a weekend break We checked in to the room which was very small and noisy and headed out for something to eat and drink When we arrived back to the hotel albeit early hours of Saturday morning the hotel was locked and in darkness We had no option but to knock continuously on the window until someone came to let us in very unprofessional We were told breakfast was included when we arrived to breakfast there was 1 croissant a few slices of packaged ham and some cheese There were some stale biscuits and half a jar of apple juice We were told we could upgrade to a full English for additional expense Needless to say we left and went elsewhere Shocking service by staff who didn t seem to care I will never revisit ,No Positive
157864,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, the check in desk is part of the cafe Do not confuse this with the global Best Western Hotel chain it is not part of that chain , be sure to ask for a room with a window I got sent to a room in the basement with no windows at all they changed my room after I complained

157866,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, The room was very small and not suitable for more than one person The bed was smaller than an average double and the air con didn t work Although we had a window if you opened it the curtain would move meaning you re flashing the double decker bus outside That s aside from the building works across the road and general road noise It s like everything in the room had shrunk The cleaner would speak loudly on her mobile while cleaning the hall and other rooms without care for other guests The hall had no lighting We had to use our phones for light Reception was a desk in the coffee shop downstairs This was where we also found out our breakfast was served Breakfast was interesting warm sliced cheese warm yoghurts and fruit curly bread and if you want a pastry you better get there early Overall this is one of the worst hotels I have stayed in and wouldn t recommend to anyone , The location was good and so was the shower water pressure 
157867,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Bed was not comfortable room was extremely noisy I could not sleep at all cleanliness could be improved some pillow cases were dirty overall old and rugged feel Wi fi not working due to busy network 50GBP deposit upon check in , Location was good very close to tube Paddington Easy check in check out procedure Good breakfast although only cold breakfast options 
157868,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Very poor external signage meant we walked straight past We were looking for a Best Western sign and there wasn t one It was only by chance when walking back on the other side of the road that we could see the name Also the description did not make it clear that there is no separate hotel entrance but is within a cafe Very odd ,No Positive

157870,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road,No Negative, there was no heating working in our room and the room we were going to get moved to didn t have working heating either dreadful 3 day stay never again 
157871,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, We arrived at the hotel at about 1pm The receptionist told us that the check was starting at 2pm The room was ready but because we were 1 hour in advance she asked to pay extra 20 pounds That was the hotel policy We didn t accept so we came back after dinner The hotel room was small dirty and especially very cold We were there in December so the heating was supposed to work Unfortunately it was not working At this point we asked the receptionist who was very kind and helpful to check and see what was the problem We checked other 3 rooms but all with the same problem it was too cold to stay and we had to live our jackets on all the time At around 10 30pm after 1h 30 minutes we were trying to solve the problem the night porter came and suggested us to stay there 1 night and the next day they would have repaired the heating system In the meantime other people came down to the reception to complain about the same problem At the end after 2 hours we asked to change the other to another with the heating working At that point they gave us anther hotel of the same chain the Best Western Maida Vale End of the story this is not a hotel it s a dirty place with no heating small and located in a bad place If you don t want to waist your money don t go there Unfortunately I booked the hotel without looking at the reviews otherwise I certainly wouldn t have booked it , The kindness of Elodie the receptionist She tried to do her best in this bad situation 
157872,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, The first room I was given was on the first floor over traffic lights and I could hear the constant beeping of them even with the window closed I was moved to another room on the ground floor with no window I had to make do with this room as there was nothing else available It was very claustrophobic as the room was tiny ,No Positive
157873,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Staff Issue at check in I was told I hadn t paid even though I showed an email confirming I had paid Receptionist stated it did not matter what my email said and that I had to pay in full or else she would not check us in was further told issue was with booking com and I should take it up with them which I did Issue was resolved however as their reception is on the counter of a cafe it was quite embarrassing as receptionist kept saying there was insufficient funds in my acc was not a happy camper Also was the poorest continental breakfast I have EVER come across , Approx 2min walk to Edgeware Road tube station
157874,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Breakfast was very poor If u like boiled eggs salami cheese peppers with bread toast or mini chocolate chip muffins then you will be fine I don t mind a continental breakfast but a croissant or pain au chocolate would have been nice I know traffic noise can t always be helped especially in London but the constant police sirens and the sound of the pedestrian crossing all night really didn t aid a good nights sleep , Room very clean if on the small size Bed comfortable 
157875,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, This hotel is located in a very unpleasant area as a young couple we felt really unsafe in this area due to the amount of people fighting on the streets and police vans just outside the hotel Staff representatives smoking outside the front door After travelling from Newcastle checking in our bags then being told to come back and check in my partner and I received a phone call telling us our room had been cancelled due to overbooking on their end and we did not have a room to stay at for the 2 nights we were in London As 18 year olds miles away from home This had me very distressed and upset and I had to get my parents to call to get our room back The customer service from the reception team was appalling unprofessional attitude and very un friendly They could not have been bothered if they tried no manager to speak to on site either Very disorganised Bed sheets and walls had marks on them and the bed was tiny We were offered complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience they had caused This itself was very dissatisfactory small selection of pastries cereal and some ham and cheese Safe to say I will never be returning or recommending this hotel to anyone worst stay I have ever had Highly disappointed I have wasted my money on this , The room was nicely decorated decent sized telly and a good shower 
157876,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Heating not working only cold air coming out the vent Absence of a proper customer support Extreme staff turnover some tried to be friendly some extremely rude Manager never reachable and not reliable only lots of lies and excuses Had to change 3 rooms in 4 nights never a nice stay Really a pity as if well kept the hotel would be ok and in a nice place Change of manager might help, position
157877,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road,No Negative, Only seconds from the underground and even though it s situated on a main road we didn t notice the traffic noise in the room Yes it is a small room but every time we have stayed in London the rooms have always been small We were concerned after booking this hotel as reviews didn t read well but we had no problems at all staff were polite and attentive room was clean location was excellent

157886,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, I do not recommend this hotel to others as for what it offers can be found in a better establishment The room was on the lower ground very depressing I could hear next room clients noise it seems the lady loves to scream when the man is No insulation The reception was in the middle of a coffee area very confusing , Staff
157887,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, The rooms were ridiculously tiny the dressing table was damaged so kept catching leg as you tried to squeeze past the tiniest gap between that and the bed The entrance is via a coffee shop type set up so not pleasant When we first got there they gave us a basement room well box with NO windows is that even legal surely this is a fire and safety hazard I was so claustrophobic and me and my 6ft1 fianc e had to constantly bump into eachother just to move about Both our feet hung out the bottom of the bed I have stayed in MANY hotels and this by far is the worst I have EVER been to Rip off and the staff are unhelpful and rude While we tried to check out and tell them of our awful experience she took a phone call and took so long we walked out My personal info and licence were left on the reception for everyone to see so I took these with me Horrendous hotel , Nothing

157890,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Air conditioning simply did not work the room was far too warm and as the hotel is situated on a very busy road opening the window was not an option Complained to staff on various occasions about the air con as we couldn t sleep for the heat to their credit they tried their best resetting the system etc all to no avail however We had it set to 16 degrees and running constantly with a functioning air con in this tiny room 5 mins at 16 degrees would have been too cold we consider ourselves fortunate to have stayed here in October as it would be unbearable in summer , The bed was comfy location good close to Tube Stations staff were friendly and helpful 
157891,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, The room had no window And I did not know this while booking The pictures look ok but the hotel is a hole I didn t eat breakfast it looked not appealing at all The stuff could not find my name twice At the check in and also when a friend dropped by to pick me up I don t recommend this hotel at all There are better ones for the same price , Unfortunately nothing 
157892,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, We paid extra for breakfast which was awful Bread with no toaster tea in water not properly boiled stale food The staff were not particularly friendly or responsive One lady said she would come to our room in 2 minutes to help us with our safe 10 minutes later still no sign Reception was in a cafe which felt weird and not that safe for leaving bags , The room was small but the bed was very comfy and the shower was good

157930,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, A room without a window is called a cupboard It should not even be legal and definitely not called a 4 stars hotel And when there is written on the booking description that the room has a view not having a window is a consumer fraud Eventually when a hotel mistakenly charges GBP 267 instead of 297 one can expect the customer to be informed that a mistake was made and that an additional GBP 30 will be charged before the additional charging happens ,No Positive
157931,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Hotel was advertised to include breakfast When we arrived we were told that it was a continental breakfast and would have to pay 7 95 for a full English breakfast When visiting the capital of England I would expect a full English breakfast I was then told that due to short staffing the English breakfast would not be available on our first morning there The Continental breakfast that was provided was of very poor quality The bread was stale there was no selection of cheese or meat only one type of cheese and meat This was curled and dry I ate breakfast out of the hotel on both mornings , Hotel is easily found via the bus route from Euston Train Station Hotel rooms were clean and modern Hotel close to bus routes train and tube stations 
157932,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Room was in the basement surrounded by unfinished rooms It s a good job I m not claustrophobic as it was the tiniest room possible There were staff members banging things around at about midnight The toilet had never had a good clean there was a serious scum line around the bowl The breakfast was meagre and to say it was in a coffee shop the instant coffee in the room would have been hotter and tastier ,No Positive

157936,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, alot of road noise late into the night and early morning For this reason will not stay again The rooms are very small , room and shower clean and comfortable lots of tv chanels
157937,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road,No Negative, Great hotel The staff were very friendly and helpful The family room was great for just myself and my 15 year old son It was small but we both each had our own space and just enough privacy for a mom and son traveling together 
157938,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Felt a little intimidated by the clientele in the cafe It was a large group discussing very loudly political issues with some anger Could hear them in my room too , Staff were very helpful Perfect location for my seminars 
157939,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, The bed when arrived had long hair within the sheets And breakfast options were slim Pillows were hard, Warm and modern rooms Value for money and seconds from Edward road tube station and bakerloo line making it easy to travel in and around London Perfect for our reason of travel 
157940,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, After a long day travelling very disappointing that no food available although good Italian restaurant next door, location very handy next to the underground
157941,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Tiny room size had to move chair to open door Noise level from the street was awful Hardly slept even though the bed was comfortable No wine glasses or ice buckets available considering this is meant to b a 4 found this extremely poor Breakfast is cleared away before 10am even though it s on until 10 Not so good Although they did put it back out for us , Location was great Rooms were decoated lovely Shower fantastic and great bath towels
157942,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Reception staff not hotel trained Just essential breakfast Low standard of cleaning Loud Neighbourhood , Rooms look as newly redecorated and there is only 3 minutes to Edgware Road Bakerloo line
157943,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, I messaged the hotel informing them it was my birthday and our engagement celebration the room we got was literally the smallest room I have ever seen We had to sleep with the window wide open as the aircon did not work and it was like sleeping in the dessert We didn t sleep a wink as it was such a busy street The bed was very short so my fianc s feet were hanging off the end of the bed he is only 6ft I had to request an iron as there wasn t one in the room and I had to sit on the bed as there wasn t enough to room for the iron and me to stand I saw the cleaner in another room which was twice the size so in sure there are bigger rooms we seem to have been given the smallest Breakfast was horriffic it consisted of cheese boiled eggs cut in half a plate of bread which when I asked to have toasted it was warm and soft so seemed to have been microwaved lol and considering the reception is in a coffee shop it was the worst cup of filter coffee I have ever had , However It was clean enough and the location was good to get around London I will not be going back though 
157944,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Extremely hot in room 002 with no window Had to leave the key card in the slot 24 7 to keep the air con Working or it became unbearably hot to the point where I had to take a cold shower in the middle of the night I was woken up by a staff member coming into my room at midnight as I lay sleeping naked due to heat I was not impressed All sorts of noise kept me awake from there on in a water heater noise kept recurring for the best part of the night After finally falling asleep after a very disrupted night I was horrified to be woken up by drilling on the other side of my wall at 9am With no warning or mention of the disturbance I was beside myself with frustration I stayed for two nights over the weekend and thought that maybe the Sunday morning would be a little quieter and time for some rest after going out late on Saturday night wrong Once again hammering and drilling first thing Sunday morning I couldn t wait to get back home to Devon for some rest I will never stay at this hotel again and I advise you to be very cautious when considering this hotel, Stylish room good quality furniture fantastic shower
157945,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, However the lighting on staircase doesnt come on quick enough Also the first room I was given as I opened seemed to have been occupied They did put this right straight away but I was left a bit worried about how safe my room really was also rooms need to be more sound proof and having a vacuum cleaner left right outside my room throighout my 2 night stay spells one thing only health and safety is not something they take seriously , Room was very clean and friendly staff The hitel location is great and nearby facilities are within reach 
157946,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, The lift didn t work It stated breakfast included but it was only continental not a cooked breakfast The walls had marks all over and the bathroom door didn t close or lock , the bed was so comfy the shower was really great 
157947,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Very small room Could not find not even enough room to open my large suitcase other than on the bed The specific room I had was also right underneath the main sewage line and the water noise was constant No windows , Close to the underground and train station
157948,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, There is no reception just man behind a bar at cafe on the ground floor Hoover and some cleaning stuff remained in narrow hallway just in front our doors for all three days Do not expect much from Edgware road area unless you looking for central location in London , Rooms were well equipped clean etc

157951,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Lots of things went wrong I did not like how the toilet roll bracket came off the wall I did not like how the shower fitting was unstable and at a diagonal angle I did not like how the curtain rail fell of the wall when the curtain was drawn back The bedside cabinet came apart when I moved it slightly to get my phone charger But above all these points the air conditioning wasn t working so it was incredibly hot during the night and with Paddington police station opposite made for an impossible night s sleep , We liked the fact the hotel was located very near to a tube station and so access into central London was quick and easy The room also had a modern and clean cut appearance which was nice 
157952,Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, No windows Staff rude on checkout and poorly trained No invoice on checkout No windows No windows No windrows Like a well decorated submarine, Room was clean Bed comfy
