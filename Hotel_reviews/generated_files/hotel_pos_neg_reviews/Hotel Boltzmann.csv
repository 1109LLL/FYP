287865,Hotel Boltzmann, Not a four star hotel Room was very basic with old furniture Bed was rather basic and not comfortable Bed linen was basic and it didn t feel well to sleep in Non smoking hotel but there was strong smoke odor in our room Overall experience is that the hotel feels like a two star motel Significant renovation is needed to qualify for a four star level , Good location welcoming staff Parking on the street is easy but costs money 
287866,Hotel Boltzmann, 1 First impression very unpleasant chat with lady receptionist felt really not welcomed 2 Quite old fashioned interior design too much of red colour and buffet reminding soviet style 3 Very poor wifi 4 No iron at rooms and possibility to ask rent and bring it to your room the only option is to ask at reception to bring it to the hotel buffet downstairs and iron yourself their what to do in in the morning if You want to iron in a hurry to do it between tables with people having lunch weird 5 Air conditioner was working too loud 6 Hotel stuff forgot to supplement free bottle of drinking water few days but haven t forgot to charge for small bottle of water from minibar You should give it for present because I bought it just because of Your lack of attention and free water supplement missed 7 There is at least 10 15 min walk to the closest metro station and with luggage hurrying to the airport you should keep it in mind 8 We wanted to buy some wine in the hotel bar but bartender suggested only a glass of drink because she should go to the cellar for the bottle What Don t You want to serve Your clients better and sell more 9 I asked to make coffee in larger cup in the hotel bar to take away it to my room more safely but got a refusal by bartender no these cups are for only for tea 10 Expensive breakfast in old fashioned buffet for 14 Euros and even less You can get superb breakfast in French cafe with teracce and view to Votive church close to the hotel , Spacy bathroom
287867,Hotel Boltzmann, A little far from downtown restaurants if you want to walk Take a public transportation pass Very good breakfast but it should be included in the price of the room since there are no other restaurants close to the hotel , Clean simple modern but small rooms Close to public transportation Friendly staff who speak English 
287868,Hotel Boltzmann, Tiny criticisms English Tv channels limited but no problem for me not in Vienna to watch tv Lack of decent light around mirror in bathroom for shaving , A good clean hotel in a quiet location Stayed in June during period of hot sunny weather Room type Single Business Class has queen sized bed Room variable aircon works great and really cooled the room well a real bonus for a comfortable nights sleep Not many Vienna hotels in this price range offer this feature Breakfast is a wide and varied buffet cooked eggs and bacon cold meats cheese cereal fruit breads etc juice and coffee There is also a comfortable bar leading onto a small inner courtyard terrace Staff are super friendly especially Sophia on reception but its unfair to single out one they are all great Room and Bathroom very clean bed comfortable and made up every day Safe works with door pass card Stocked Fridge in room Nearest Tram stop is a 5 min stroll down a quiet side street part of the excellent city Tram and Underground network In summary without hesitation I d recommend the Hotel Boltzmann and will definitely stay there again
287869,Hotel Boltzmann,No Negative, I booked a standard double room When I I was offered more luxurious room on the uppoer floor With no extra charge Only because the room was available and not used Very good I m definitely coming back Thanks 
287870,Hotel Boltzmann, The pillows were flat There was no air conditioning and the room was very hot The air conditioning apparently does not get turned on until summer despite the weekend being the hottest weekend in Vienna so far this year I booked this hotel based on the fact that it advertised having air conditioning The breakfast was very poor Not very much choice No bread available even though we went to breakfast 2 hours before it was finished Not great at all , The location of the hotel very close to public transport
287871,Hotel Boltzmann, Every morning I was diturbed by stuff at 9 a m cleaning laddy was knocking at my door to ask about cleaning and another lady also knocked at my door to check a minibar in my room every two days The quality of the building doesn t correspond to 4 stars hotel it looks terrible not like at photos Sound insulation is poor I heared every sound outside my door , Good location Balcony Cleanness in rooms
287872,Hotel Boltzmann, The room was small There wasn t any palece for putting my luggage so i had to move one of the desks near the bed , The location was good The room was clean and quiet and they cleaned the room every day and put clean stuff in bathroom

287874,Hotel Boltzmann, Cheaper garage in the hotel or little more information about Vienna P R garage at 3 40 day , Bed was confortable There was a balcony Well warmed in very cold days 
287875,Hotel Boltzmann, Radiators was closed when we came to room We have to ask employees how to open the radiators We want double bed but they gave us two single bed side by side Breakfast charge was too expensive We can eat in the city centre for same price, Clean and big room Helpfull Employee Easy transportation
287876,Hotel Boltzmann, The mattress was fairly hard and the pillows too soft The TV reception of ORF2 was hindered and one couldn t properly enjoy the New Year s concert The elevator was also slow , The room was very comfortable The hotel was at a great location next to the Gurtel and right across from the Physics institute appropriate for its name and the street in which it is in The breakfast was very good as well

287878,Hotel Boltzmann, There were some hidden charges It seems the lady when I checked in was a bit confused she said breakfast was included but then i got a bill so i guess not I came a few days before meeting up with a tour group a friend was staying with me until the group arrived at which time I would be assigned a room mate from the group I explained this when I checked in but the lady at the desk was visibly upset at this This obvious by her loud typing on the keyboard I then double checked the day the tour group was arriving to make sure it was all set and the lady that day was very nice and did not indicate any issues The shower presented some issues going from blazing hot to freezing cold and it was difficult to find anything in the middle ,No Positive

287882,Hotel Boltzmann, The only thing I didn t like was the breakfast that was charged 14euro per person Quite poor for this price , The location was excellent the staff was very friendly and helpful the beds were nice and comfortable Total value for money if I compare it to any other 4 hotel in Vienna Pet friendly too
