106373,Hotel Le petit Paris, The room was small Three of us felt like we were on top of each other , Location was excellent really close to public transportation the Luxembourg Gardens lots of restaurants shops Had a room facing the back overlooking the roof tops and it was quiet enough Bedding was comfortable shower water pressure was good facilities were clean wifi worked well breakfast was available for 16 euros per person although you can just go a few doors down to Maison Marie and get breakfast for 13 euros

106380,Hotel Le petit Paris, Breakfast looked good but we thought a bit pricey at 18 each and we preferred to eat out at numerous sidewalk cafes in the area , Super friendly helpful and informative front deck staff Complimentary espresso and waters all day long in lounge Room was compact but vey well furnished and modern Super rain shower Our room a double deluxe on top floor 503 had a peek a boo view of Eiffel Tower a long distance away Room 502 looked other way on front of building but was another top floor deluxe double room 
106381,Hotel Le petit Paris,No Negative, The staff did an excellent job making sure we had everything we needed The breakfast was lovely and the rooms were neat and clean The location of this hotel was great We were just a short walk less than one mile to Notre Dame and the buses we needed to tour the city 
106382,Hotel Le petit Paris, The rooms were very small and there was no plug in the bathroom that was working Not much space in the bedroom to put two suitcases for a couple Breakfast a little expensive EUR18 00 compared to another hotel we stayed at in Paris which offered an excellent breakfast for EUR 13 00 per person Our room faced the street and so was noisy perhaps an inner facing room would be better if you prefer a peaceful sleep , The rooms were well decorated the bed was comfortable and the shower was very nice 
106383,Hotel Le petit Paris, My room faced Rue St Jacques that can be quite noisy Sound insolation not good enough to filter out the noise , Comfortable bed new bathroom excellent location only a few minutes walk from Luxembourg RER station

106387,Hotel Le petit Paris, Well I was basically asked to prove that I was a customer of the hotel by a concierge Not a problem in and of itself What I found odd is that no one else was asked although he most probably hadn t seen the other guests either and I was coming from my room Was it maybe because I m black Not sure but asking me whether I m sure that I am supposed to be where I am does hint towards that Pity , Viennoiseries were excellent indeed Great bed as well 
106388,Hotel Le petit Paris,No Negative, The staff was very welcoming and pleasant Also if you barely speak French or it is non existent but you try and or let them know you wish to learn they will accomodate accordingly She helped me by speaking French basics and then would switch to English for me when I was unable to understand All in all lovely and quaint

106390,Hotel Le petit Paris, Room was very compact so not a lot of space The hotel is on a busy narrow one way street so traffic noise would be a big problem in the summer with the French doors open Unfortunately the refuse collectors come down the road every day at around 6 00am so an unwelcome early alarm call , Quality of room decoration bed and bathroom Everything very clean housekeeping was excellent and staff extremely helpful Very close to Jardin du Luxembourg and RER station 
106391,Hotel Le petit Paris, The rooms are super small , I loved the complimentary coffee tea table with pastries available all day Very welcoming The bus stop and metro are walking distance The staff are super friendly Many restaurants and cafes around 
106392,Hotel Le petit Paris, The person at the check in was unpolite and it seems with no formal training in customer services I booked the room through booking com for 4 people 2 kids and requested extra bed in the reservation He argued that extra beds was not possible but they did not reject the reservation even though this was specified clearly in observations We managed to find a solution baby bed for one of my child only because a lady from the hotel appeared and tried to find a solution In the early evening the person at the reception during the first night complained when I requested wireless access 2nd time I had to explained that we were 4 adults so needed 4 connections there is no wifii only through a specific passcode per device The room was not cleaned even though we were out of the bedroom from 11am until 21 00pm never happend to me before and I am a very frequent traveller due to business ,No Positive
