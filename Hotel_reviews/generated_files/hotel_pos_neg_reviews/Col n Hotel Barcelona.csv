280577,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The breakfast was a bit expensive 18 50 each Also the pool is just a tipping pool not a full on swimming pool D, This was a fantastic hotel The staff were so helpful especially Raquel she was soo lovely D Me and my best mates couldn t have enjoyed our stay more 
280578,Col n Hotel Barcelona, We ve stayed at this hotel previously and have always found it good However we ve learnt not to have breakfast there because 1 it s not of a very high standard and 2 it s expensive for what you get What s more we ve discovered an establishment a few minutes walk away Neyras Caf where the breakfast is very good specially prepared and with table service ,No Positive
280579,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The service was poor They made 4 big mistakes 1 they entered the room without knocking at the door when I was sleeping in the room this made me woke up 2 the management left a welcome letter in the room the name was not mine 3 the room was supposed to have basin in the bathroom there was no basin 4 they gave me a ticket for the carpark which was not working This made me wait additional 30mins at the carpark and struggle with a person that cannot speak English , The service was poor They made 4 big mistakes 1 they entered the room without knocking at the door when I was sleeping in the room this made me woke up 2 the management left a welcome letter in the room the name was not mine 3 the room was supposed to have basin in the bathroom there was no basin 4 they gave me a ticket for the carpark which was not working This made me wait additional 30mins at the carpark and struggle with a person that cannot speak English 
280580,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Outdated rooms , The location was AWESOME We had two rooms Our corner room was spacious very clean although outdated without a view Our other smaller room was nice with an incredible spacious balcony and great view Front desk staff was fine The rooftop pool view cannot be beat It was so fun to sit up there at sunset enjoy the view with a cocktail 
280581,Col n Hotel Barcelona, No fitness center Wish staff had repaired steam room at Spa so we could have enjoyed this amenity for at least one day , This grand hotel is a peaceful oasis in the midst of tourist filled square Fantastic location right across from Cathedral our room had view Open balcony doors allowed us to enjoy lovely live music from below yet soundproof glass kept noise to minimum at night Spa was very nice but disappointing in that steam room was closed due to malfunction on both days there 
280582,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Poor supply breakfast teabags and not replaced each morning Had to ring reception for replacement Also no milk on offer , Bed v comfy bathroom great Furnishings good quality 
280583,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Servicing of the room was very poor cups and glasses disappeared every day Staff clearly did not like having to deal with tea coffee in the room , The roof terrace was great in the early evenings with a lovely view of the gothic cathedral 
280584,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, The location was amazing right across from the cathedral on the edge of the Gothic Quarter Not to be missed is the spectacular view from the 7th floor observation deck with beverage service from the hotel bar The recently renovated room was spacious and comfortable with a great shower The staff was very friendly and helpful anxious to please and very professional If you arrive by car there is an extremely convenient underground public parking garage 50 meters from the hotel s door and the Rambla is only a short walk away Altogether a memorable place to stay 
280585,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, The room was wonderful with an exceptional view It overlooked the plaza and the Gaudi Church Great area for walking Lots of stores and small cafes 
280586,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, The front desk staff were fabulous Racquel at the concierge desk was very helpful with suggestions and directions She helped make our stay extra enjoyable with great recommendations 
280587,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, My stay at Hotel Colon was wonderful The Hotel was located in the central part of the city Easy access to dinning public transportation and bars The Hotel room was very spacious with a spa like bathroom 
280588,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The only thing I didn t like about the Colon was the fact that breakfast wasn t included in the room rate and the room rate is significant From memory the hotel wanted to charge an extra Euro 18 for a continental breakfast Consequently we went out for breakfast every morning so the hotel missed out on our business There are plenty of reasonable breakfast options in the area This meant that we never actually ate at the hotel as we went out for dinner every evening as well There is an outstanding restaurant nearby called Neyras which we went to instead and it was terrific great food and wine at very reasonable prices The hotel Colon recommended the restaurant to us in the first place Lucia looked after us most evenings she is lovely , The location of the Hotel Colon is perfect right opposite the Cathedral It is very close to the Ramblas and an easy walk to the harbour We loved our time there The views from the terrace on the 7th floor are superb and it is a great spot for a pre dinner drink 
280589,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Twin beds , We prefer queen or king sized beds which is not the Spanish custom Otherwise excellent Loved location on a courtyard opposite the cathedral Great view and street scene No traffic so very quiet 
280590,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, The property in a great location opposite the Cathedral View from the terrace bar was amazing Staff friendly and helpful and the room we had on the 5th floor was spacious with a large balcony Would recommend the hop on hop off tour bus which is great to get around to see the city 
280591,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The hotel was very comfortable and any issues were usually resolved immediately However on one occasion when I reported that the shower door didn t close properly the staff promised to send someone to fix it and the problem was never rectified Therefore the guests cannot be responsible for flooding on the bathroom floor , Location was brilliant you are very central for sightseeing restaurants shops and the beach is only a short walk away 
280592,Col n Hotel Barcelona, I requested Room 408 when making the booking in October 2016 and upon arrival was allocated 407 fortunately Room 408 was available so not a problem I was with my Sister so we wanted twin beds not a double bed Also the water in the terrace spa pool was cold , The location was perfect and hotel was very clean
280593,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The coffee I would have liked a kettle and packets of coffee and milk as I don t like expresso However I think that if I had asked for this it would have been provided , The beds were comfortable The room was quiet and clean But the staff on reception were excellent Kind helpful polite and humorous I can t rate them highly enough I didn t see other staff but would expect the same from them The location was lovely Close to the Gothic Cathedral and in the square 
280594,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The wi fi was insufficient I could only use my computer to get on line access about a tenth of my stay though phone access was better I thought the breakfast available in the bottom of the hotel was boring and over priced I only went once and then found other places to eat , I booked a single room which was not too small and was cutely comfortable My window opened on to the street at the back of the hotel letting in fresh air and the sounds of the cathedral bells and young people staying at the hostel across the narrow street I liked that it was not too noisy I slept very well My view was of rooftops but that was fine I was on the fourth floor lower than that it might have been more of an issue The staff was friendly and helpful in all ways and spoke English to me when necessary They worked to get me a room early when my flight arrived at 7 am The location could not have been better for me on the plaza across from the Cathedral in the immensely walk able Gothic neighborhood I loved it 
280595,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Only negative was the eggs available at breakfast buffet wet for my tastes But great choices of cheeses danishes and coffee and juice Meats also available , Bedding extremely comfortable enjoyed coffee in room safe in room Loved church bells and being in a square Close proximity to metro and markets Atmosphere of medieval city Numerous bathroom toiletries View from 7th floor terrace amazing Staff friendly and helpful Late night cafe in plaza for night caps and food when you are just not ready to sleep You ll be happy with this choice 
280596,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The quality of the rooms differed quite a bit from floor to floor we were moved 3 times as the first one stank of cigarettes and the second temporary move was not adequate As the price was at a premium over the Easter weekend it didn t reflect great value for money, The views were great from rooftop location excellent Staff did their best to try and accommodate us over a busy Easter weekend
280597,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Room smelt fusty until doors to terrace were opened Top floor generally in need of redecorating as looking tired although I believe this is an ongoing process , Central location view of cathedral Comfy clean spacious room Friendly helpful staff Good selection of food for breakfast 
280598,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Pricey but that s Barcelona for you, Great location Really nice roof top spa Good breakfast I had a modern room which was spacious and nicely deocrated

280600,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Breakfast not included and expensive at 16 each No milk with coffee making facilities in room , Location was fantastic Bed very comfy and clean Staff friendly Would recommend and stay again 
280601,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Air Con didnt seem to function properly not enough of a glass panel in the shower to stop water going out, So many pillows it was like heaven Location was perfect
280602,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Excellent location from newly remodeled room on 2nd floor cathedral view Large room comfortable bed large bathroom beautiful hotel Did not eat at hotel nor have breakfast since so close to outdoor cafes Great area for shopping close to hop on tour bus Would recommend highly Staff helpful 
280603,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Bed not overly comfy and a lot of noise at times from decorating and updating in adjacent rooms Hotel food very overpriced , The hotel is in a great position in the cathedral square with very friendly helpful staff Lovely d cor and very clean Good cafes and restaurants within very close walking distance and taxi rank just across the road A very comfortable and convenient location for seeing the sites 
280604,Col n Hotel Barcelona, There was a marathon scheduled to run right in front of the hotel Sunday morning so we left very early in order to get a taxi to the airport since the whole area was closing down Just an FYI check for local festivals etc The area is busy and noisy with the cathedral bell tower chiming regularly but the hotel has very good windows that really keep out the noise just don t plan on keeping the windows open on a Saturday night if your room faces the cathedral plaza , The location is superb right in front of the cathedral The room was excellent with a little balcony through french doors facing the cathedral I arrived around 8 30 am and I was able to check my luggage put my valuables in the hotel safe and go sightseeing until after lunch when my room was ready Hotel staff advised us of marathon Sunday morning and arranged for our taxi to the airport very early to avoid the shutdown of the streets Everyone was very gracious and helpful I didn t get a chance to check out the spa so I can t comment on it but seems nice to have WI FI is good 
280605,Col n Hotel Barcelona, We could not get the room temp as cool as we would have liked for sleeping , Wonderful location Loved having two sinks in the bathroom also nice windows to have open to listen to outdoor music bells etc but also blocked out all noise when closed 
280606,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Cannot think of anything , Very friendly staff Convenient location to tourist sites Beautiful view of the Cathedral from top floor Nice Spa ammenities but did not use
280607,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, This is a charming traditional hotel so if you re looking for modern this isn t the hotel for you I liked the HC monogrammed towels sheets and pillowcases and blanket rather than duvet The staff were helpful Our room was on the fourth floor with small balcony overlooking the cathedral so the view was magnificent see photo and there are many restaurants within walking distance 
280608,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The cost of a breakfast where you could just get coffee and a croissant without having to pay for a whole Buffet, What I did love about the property which was completely unexpected was to walk out the door and face the beautiful cathedral Barcelona The staff were helpful in giving directions and handing me an umbrella when it rained I would stay there again
280609,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Room was advertised with a bath and only had a shower This may be due to the recent refurbishment Tea and coffee making facilities were great but choice of tea was poor no English Breakfast Tea or milk provided , Location New Room View from Room Roof Top Hot Tub
280610,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Nice decor comfortable room helpful staff Great location Breakfast and tapas restaurant iin square Lots of shops airport bus stops 10 minutes away History all around 
280611,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Our room had 2 single beds pushed together which was kind of funny , We had a beautiful terrace off our room which was nice The rooftop deck also had lovely views The location was also wonderful We had great experiences with the staff who were all helpful and very courteous 
280612,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Nothing, Location couldn t be better if you d like to shop and sightsee too Staff is polite and very helpfull For instance we got a scale to check the weight of our luggage Most of rooms have view to the catedral square in front of hotel is quite crowded notwinthstanding our room 605 was quiet We had a 40sqm balcony like the room itself it was very clear aswell On the 7th is a spa with the same amazing view to catedral both sauna and steam was warm enough for me perfect Hotel itself is a litlebit oldstyle except the small spa on the top 5star hotels could be happy with similar it reflects in price so very good value for money Next time I go to Barcelona I will check this hotel s availability at first
280613,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Single room on 4th floor didnt have curtains and the a c doesn t really work room a little too hot , Spa is fantastic and wonderful rooftop terrace Excellent location too Big room size for a single room 
280614,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The shower was not well contained and did not have a curtain so it was hard to keep water from splashing onto the floor Not a problem for me as the excellent housekeeping staff made the room to be good as new everyday , Very accommodating and present staff Great views of the cathedral The in room bidet and safe are invaluable Surprisingly quiet considering the busy location The small balcony was a great place to people watch 
280615,Col n Hotel Barcelona, builders banging drilling noises at times the hotel is currently undergoing refurbishment which wasn t mentioned during our booking in process surely the hotel staff should pre warn customers politely apologise for any potential inconvenience only three yes just three Nespresso capsules albeit replenished daily were left in our room and no milk yes some of us like our coffee with a little milk added no bath tub within the refurbished bathroom removing bath tubs maybe currently fashionable but we personally like the option and the refurbished bathroom had the space for one the hot air heating system in the room would not work which we assume is controlled centrally by the hotel to save money which was annoying as it gets chilly at night in Barca in December the dated warn decor in the unrefurbished parts of the building the noticeable lack of any smiles from the hotel staff we encountered and the hotel lobby s outer entrance doors are not electrically powered which makes things awkward when carrying luggage , our room classed as a superior room with a cathedral view which included a modern bathroom with large walk in shower having been recently refurbished our room s two balconies facing Barcelona Cathedral s beautiful gothic facade and the adjacent square the hotel s roof top terrace the hotel s central location at the heart of Gothic quarter and its attractive neoclassical external facade the Nespresso coffee tea making facilities and mini bar in our room the bathrobes slippers provided in our room the chocolate treat left in our room replenished daily the live pianist in the hotel lobby every evening professional staff the English speaking tv news channels including BBC World News the generous shampoo conditioner soap supplies in our bathroom replenished daily and the efficient thorough chambermaid service as our room was cleaned very thoroughly daily to an excellent standard 
280616,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The beds are a little hard they could do with a bit more comfort that is if you are me , Definately worth visiting Hotel Colon The breakfast was excellent and staff location cleaning atmosphere was the same I will highly recommend this Hotel 
280617,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Nothing, The location is excellent The food for breakfast is also excellent although sometime the scrambled eggs are not too hot and the bacon not too crispy 
280618,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The spa treatments and the restaurant were very expensive, Staff were very helpful polite and friendly The hotel was beautiful clean and comfortable 
280619,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The only negative thing was too much NOISE around hotel up to 2 00 am Breakfast was very good except they need to have better heating system to keep hot foods warm , We almost liked everything in this hotel The friendly staff location cleanness and its excellent coffee 
280620,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The breakfast was not included and was quite expensive at 18 euros but was very good , Room was large recently renovated and therefore most modern The bed was massive and comfortable Located on the square across from the Cathedral it was quiet and wonderfully accessible to the old city 
280621,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Breakfast was not included and at 18 eu per person we skipped it for something at Starbucks or adjacent outside cafes This worked well , The location on Cathedral Square opposite Barcelona Cathedral is amazing Every afternoon there was a high quality musician playing violin or classical guitar and on Friday a small orchestra playing for folk dancers Our room had a nice terrace but it was at the back of the building overlooking rooftops however it was a nice place to relax in the late afternoon sun before going out for dinner Our room was spacious and quiet and staff were very helpful in giving directions to various activities and sites outside the area 
280622,Col n Hotel Barcelona, We did not eat at the hotel restaurant The prices were very high and there were so many dining options within easy walking distance from the hotel , View from our room of the Cathedral was fantastic The balcony was tiny but we could open the doors and sit just inside to watch the action below from the 5th floor Inside the room was very comfortable and bathroom was clean and well stocked with amenities even a razor Easy to use espresso machine with complimentary espresso and well stocked mini bar honor system payment 
280623,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Position of room last room at the lowest floor overlooking a dark dingy street opposite staring at a dirty Taverna bar filled every night with noisy loud drunkards delivery vans directly below our window from crack of dawn sleep was somewhat elusive Staff were dismissive when asked to change room WiFi was elusive especially in our room Great disappointmen Very poor value for money, Location 
280624,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Room was quite spare no luggage racks No bathtub although one was advertised on booking com We did have a lovely walk in shower however No info on calling reception or wake up call No air conditioning in the hotel after 10pm and our room was stuffy very good hotel overall but expected a bit more for the money Also didn t think the service was especially friendly EXCEPT for the fabulous Bell hops who helped us hail a taxi and helped us with our luggage , The location and the elegant charming lobby bar rooftop terrace rooftop spa Jacuzzi and the view from the room window of the Cathedral and plaza The history of the hotel 
280625,Col n Hotel Barcelona, There wasn t a thing about this hotel that we didn t like The only problem was that they are so popular that we couldn t extend our stay longer , Outstanding location in the Barri Gotic Large and well appointed room Excellent staff Comfy king size bed and great pillows Huge shower and a shower bench 
280626,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Bacon could have been crispier A fried egg would have been nice, Amazing rooftop terrace Proper fresh juice at breakfast Helpful staff offered directions and umbrella
280627,Col n Hotel Barcelona, No Breakfast included Smoking allowed in the rooms even though they say it isn t My room was really smoky especially when I turned on the A C my neighbors were smoking They couldn t do anything about it Room was very small twin sized bed Shower was made strange water fell all over the floor , Good Location Nice piano bar relaxing area to have a drink or talk 
280628,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Just too noisy the view of the Cathedral came with a lot of activity well until 3AM Could hear people out on the square 4 floors up Not big on soundproofing , The staff were friendly and helpful The view from the room was wonderful 
280629,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Not a massive choice for breakfast but this is only a minor gripe , Fabulous room with terrace overlooking the Cathedral fabulous location nothing more need be said 
280630,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Room with a view was a view of a light mast and some trees From a certain angle I could see the Cathedral, Good size rooms with excellent bathroom Nice to have USB charger points to meet today s needs 
280631,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Cathedral view was obscured by trees, Friendly welcome Large room with double French doors armchairs plenty wardrobe space air conditioning bath tub and robes 
280632,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The room was so sad with a horrible and dirty looking wall to wall carpet and the best days of the furniture were long gone , Good location Very nice and friendly staff 
280633,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Some aspects of decor were a bit tired and outdated Not able to sit in front of hotel in the evening to have a drink this was reserved for diners only, Location location location
280634,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Breakfast should be included in the price The jacuzzi wasn t working , Location fanastic Great view from the top floor Room very clean just redecorated Spa on top floor 
280635,Col n Hotel Barcelona, All good , A charming centrally located hotel with helpful and smiling staff Organized everything for us Lovely boutique style hotel with personal touches Loved the double basins in the bathroom 
280636,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Our room overlooked the square with a view of the Cathedral It was magical Beds very comfortable bathroom very clean and the shower was amazing I loved it For me there are no negatives and I am very picky when it comes to hotel rooms You do pay a little more than other hotels but it is worth every penny if you expect high standards 
280637,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Just arrived didn t have small euros was having a drink on the sidewalk patio street performers were allowed demanded tips suggest if the hotel allows performers they should pay for them Stayed 5 days before 5 days after a cruise next time would change to another location for one of the stays, Great location rooms we had were on the inside street both were quiet and very clean Staff very accommodating 
280638,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Loved it here terrace with our room was amazing so private great sun trap shade if wanted too Staff were lovely we arrived before noon and our room was ready so we re able to check in early Location was amazing in middle of everything Have stayed in Barcelona many times and this is by far my favourite hotel Highly recommended 
280639,Col n Hotel Barcelona, My room faced the interior atrium a small area inaccessible to guests All interior rooms have a view of this space I didn t spend much time in my room but those planning to do so may want to spring for the pricier rooms on the exterior side There is a rooftop terrace with a gorgeous view open to all guests but it is only open from 10 10 so early morning coffee or a late night cocktail with a view is not an option Additionally be aware that the pool is little more than a wading pond and there are only a few deck chairs in the pool area This is typical for many European hotels but the photos on the website are slightly misleading , The location is amazing right across from the cathedral The staff was extremely helpful and very friendly They keep your key when you leave the hotel so it s one less thing to think about keeping track of while you re out exploring beautiful Barcelona Upon returning to the hotel tapas and cocktails are available in the restaurant bar or the terrace area The view from the terrace is gorgeous so I d recommend that option as there is no view in the bar The tapas aren t that special but the view improves them If you re especially hungry there are countless delicious options steps from the hotel 
280640,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Breakfast too expensive Suggest coffee making facility in the bedroom which is expected from such an hotel , Excellent location This is my 3rd visit and will return if ever visiting Barc again Staff friendly and helpful 
280641,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Single room had bad view, Perfect location in Gothic Quarter El Born and Gracia are in a walking distance Great Spa on the top not for swimming but for sunbathing and having jaccuzzi with a spectacular view Cathedral 
280642,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The cost of ordering any food or drinks from the rooftop balcony was prohibitive We would have loved to sit up there and relax with a drink but the prices were exorbitant , The location was second to none with a view of the Cathederal and square from our balcony The roof top area was great and we could watch the activities in the square from both our room and the rooftop
280643,Col n Hotel Barcelona, nothing, Old style charm Expensive but worth every penny Very helpful staff Excellent breakfast We had a terrace which was fantastic The view of the cathedral was stunning 
280644,Col n Hotel Barcelona, On the whole the staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful One of the staff on the reception did not unfortunately live up to his colleagues high standards , The hotel is extremely comfortable The location is magnificent 
280645,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, We stayed at the Hotel Colon in mid July and found the location to be wonderful Barcelona is a large city but this hotel was a perfect location for almost anything You walk out of the hotel and you are in front of the Cathedral We had a a room with a little balcony that looked out over the square and Cathedral which was just perfect The room itself was charming and clean The food in Barcelona is amazing If you need to catch a taxi they are right down the street but again location is great if you re willing to walk and explore Staff was very helpful and friendly Would recommend to anyone who wants to experience the charms of Barcelona 
280646,Col n Hotel Barcelona, No formal business center However they loan you a laptop if you need computer , This is a great place to stay in Barcelona Beautiful view of cathedral Newly remodeled rooms and central location Very helpful staff 
280647,Col n Hotel Barcelona, If you book a room with a view of the Cathedral there can be quite a lot of noise coming up from the square most evenings from buskers playing music etc , Great location with great view of Gothic Cathedral from my room I had bookwd a cathedral view room The hotel is central to hundreds of shops and has helpful staff It is only about 150 metres from La Ramblas Breakfast was amazing and worth paying for as all the local cafes only open at about 10am I would definately stay there again 
280648,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Staff at bar ignored us , Great location Staff greeted us at door We were early and couldn t check in but they offered us a place to freshen up after many hours of travel Beautiful veiws 
280649,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Price for breakfast is too high 30 Euro Had to walk around to find someplace which was inconvient as most places didn t open that early , Very comortable room excellent location
280650,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Only a one night stay so didn t come across anything to complain about, Excellent location couldn t be more central Fantastic view from the terrace
280651,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The decor was a little dated but as the hotel was so comfortable to be in it just didn t matter The spa was very pricey , Fabulous location and excellent staff who were always willing to help Very good air con Great view from the roof top area which was quiet with comfortable seating 
280652,Col n Hotel Barcelona, nothing, Excellent standard room on 1st floor upgraded to one with a view of the Cathedral With the windows closed the noise from outside was not a problem 
280653,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The location of the hotel is perfect but did not feel comfortable sleeping in the bed or using the towels that were far from white The place was not clean with mold in the shower tiles and dusty floors ,No Positive
280654,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Would have liked the room to be colder I was in room 218 and had a balcony with a view of the Gothic Cathedral Other than that the I enjoyed staying there The perfect location in Barcelona You are right in front of the gothic cathedral and a 2 min walk from shopping fine dining 5 min walk to the tour the city buses Hop on Hop Off Tour buses and a 10 min walk to the beach 6 7 Euro cab ride 
280655,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Location terrace views cleanliness size of the room and bathroom housekeeping were excellent This hotel is a perfect choice in busy and touristy Barcelona Relaxing and vibrant at the same time Would recommend to my friends 
280656,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, The bed was very comfortable and the AC worked very well keeping us cool in the summer heat Couldn t have asked for a better location central to everything but very quiet at night 
280657,Col n Hotel Barcelona, We did not eat breakfast at the hotel as we were told it was not included when we checked in however as we checked out we were told it was included Lots of little places close by to have coffee and people watch in the morning Better then sitting in the basement for breakfast at the hotel but we would not have paid for 2 breakfasts each day if we had known it was included The wine selection in the bar was not very good if you wanted only a glass of wine Bar staff not so friendly , Overall great staff clean nice hotel and the Best location 
280658,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Overpriced for the standard of rooms Breakfast also overpriced for standard and service Money grabbing attitude of hotel policy No hot water to be sent to the room as it was dangerous However you could order tea and coffee to the room for 10euro each Not tea coffee making facilities in the room , Location in the Gothic quarter right across from the cathedral was spectacular The reception and bell boy staff were friendly and helpful 
280659,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Booked and confirmed with payment for twin room was not available when checking in had to share a double bed with a friiend that was not comfortable in doing so , Location
280660,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Our stay was absolutely wonderful due in great part to Gregorino who made us feel like we were the only people in the hotel from the moment we arrived 
280661,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Not a lot Slow lift bed a little too firm, Location was fabulous right beside cathedral centre of Barri Gothic Huge room for 3 sisters so plenty of space Gorgeous roof terrace with amazing views which we didn t get to use a lovely pool Breakfast had lots of fresh fruit very healthy Lots of nice places to sit downstairs
280662,Col n Hotel Barcelona, When we came back from the opera house just after 11 pm we wanted something light to eat at the bar but the kitchen closed at 11pm so we could not eat , The hotel is right in the centre of the old town facing the Cathedral We had a quiet double room facing the back the view from the window was not good but this wasn t a problem The shower was very good the wardrobe had plenty of hangers the air conditioning was good the reception and the bar staff were polite and efficient The room as well as the public space of the hotel seems to have been recently redecorated 
280663,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The noise in the square In front of the Cathedral at 4 00am , The comfort of the room and the amenities The helpfulness and friendliness of the staff The good breakfast Very very nice hotel 
280664,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Bed could have been a little softer , The staff was very friendly and accommodating The rooms were large well supplied and clean The view of the Cathedral of Barcelona was breathtaking 
280665,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Tacky style rooms need some refurbishment cheap details No proper pool Expensive for what it is the location does not justify the fairly high rates, Perfect Location Good spa Overall friendly service
280666,Col n Hotel Barcelona, We made 3 special requests non of which were granted We requested 2 upper floor rooms and were allocated 1st floor rooms between which seemed to be the hotels water systems very noisey along with the maids storage area located opposite we were all woke early each morning The shower cublicle in the one room was so designed that towels needed to be put on the floor to prevent it getting too wet and slippery Secondly we requested best views possible for price unfortunately we looked out onto renovation works of the building opposite however the cathedral could be seen to the side of the balconies lastly our request for a late check out was not possible and we were told you use the main rest room to change for our journey home , The location and views from the hotel roof are both extremely good The spa area is very relaxing and welcome after busy days sight seeing The hotel is only about 10 mins walk from Placa Catalunya which makes travel to and from the airport very easy The staff were polite and attentative 
280667,Col n Hotel Barcelona, One of the reception staff was a little rude, Beautiful hotel right in the city centre close to the main transport routes but also within walking distance of most sights fantastic stay
280668,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, One staff person couldn t have been more helpful and friendly A second employee was rude beyond belief and positively scary Too long to write here 
280669,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Restaurant very expensive so we ate all our meals elsewhere Rooms a little dated and air conditioning did not work too well , We stayed there for the roof top deck very nice place to enjoy a glass of wine in the evening Good location in the heart of the city Wifi worked well 
280670,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, All in this hotel is meeting customer satisfaction experience requirements staff kind and efficient with unique personal touch approach rooms old fashion yes but with a distinctive charm Spa with spectacular view Spa staff with high level of professionalism you really enjoy the Spa treatments quality of breakfast Happy to have found this hotel for my personal stay in Barcelona
280671,Col n Hotel Barcelona, We booked three rooms one of them was a twin At first our third room was a double bed and double blanket We were able to move to a twin the next morning A room with a view was nice but the church bells were ringing even at night , The rooms 3 were nice and quite big Beds were comfortable Breakfast was very good with many different breads yougurts cheeses etc Coffee was supertasty The triple room was big and had a Nespresso machine The sun terrace is a nice place even to read or study Location was superb quite many nice restaurants nearby Our week in Barcelona was great 
280672,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, The hotel is located across the square from the Barcelona Cathedral It was in between the heating and cooling seasons so we were able to leave our floor to ceiling windows cracked open most of the time to take advantage of the breeze There was a musician located on the steps of the cathedral for most of the daylight hours When we came home from walking the city it was pleasant to take a short siesta while listening to the murmur of the crowd and the strains of the musician s classical guitar 
280673,Col n Hotel Barcelona, as an expensive stay i would have expected tea and coffee making facilities in the room couldn t get onto the terrace or pool area locked a bit of a let down really plenty of other hotels in the area with more accessible roof terraces, the hotel is in an excellent position that s it
280674,Col n Hotel Barcelona, At breakfast the eggs sausages and bacon were too cold Everything else was delicious It would be helpful if advice was consistent as to when the Font Magica fountains evening displays are showing We were advised there would be displays on Sunday evenings in April so we went specially to see the display and when there we were told the Sunday displays would not begin till May , The location of the hotel and our room were superb Staff unfailingly polite and helpful 
280675,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Our only issue was with HVAC The website says the hotel has air conditioning This is one of the main reasons we chose this hotel Our room had no working HVAC system and the front desk informed us it was too early to turn on the air conditioning To their credit the front desk moved us the second day to a room with a working fan that made the room bearable , The staff was exceptional From the moment we checked in to our early morning checkout the staff was helpful friendly and kind The location is convenient to all areas of Barcelona with wonderful restaurants just steps away 
280676,Col n Hotel Barcelona, We paid extra for the upgraded room with a view of the Cathedral however it did NOT include breakfast The breakfast cost 18 Euro per person which equates to 72 Euro per day for our family of four which is quite expensive for what they offer Instead each morning we went to a small caf where we spent 20 Euro TOTAL for four 4 people per day , The location is ideal staff very friendly and helpful room was quite comfortable 
280677,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Only one minor would of loved kettle in room there was a nespresso machine but would of loved to make tea, Excellent hotel in excellent location Stayed in superior room with cathedral view well worth the money So easy to get to from airport and close to all attractions Would definitely recommend and can t wait to go back
280678,Col n Hotel Barcelona, our rooms although on the same floor were in separate parts of the hotel with three young children my wife and I could have done with interconnecting rooms for the cost it was rather pricey but the location couldn t be faulted so what price for the perfect location rather a lot actually but we would stay again , location is great and the staff were friendly we did have a cathedral view from both rooms not requested that was a bonus 
280679,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, The rooms on the first floor had only just been finished 3 weeks ago and the quality is amazing Gorgeous parquet floor with big shower Great beds and generally fantastic We had a super room with a pull out sofa bed Will be going back definitely 
280680,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The room was too warm for us The heating was fully turned on When we shut it down and let in cool evening air it was ok , The room with Catherdal view 
280681,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Enjoyed the whole experience so no issues , Location was perfect for walking the city Getting a room with terrace overlooking Cathedral added to pleasure of the room Staff was very attentive 
280682,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Great location We were on the 1st floor in the newly remodeled rooms it was a large room we had a king bed and a double bed with an very large closet to unpack all and the bathroom was very spacious with a great shower We also had a small outdoor area with a table and 2 chairs but no view Would stay here again and recommend 
280683,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Decor a bit tired room facilities only OK for 4 star hotel Breakfasts a bit limited in choice , Excellent location opposite the cathedral in Barri Gotic 10 mins walk down Las Ramblas to the sea Handy for Placa de Catalunya for tourist bus and aerobus Roof top terrace good for drinks with a view or sunbathing Rooms clean and comfortable 
280684,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, This is the second time I have stayed at the Colon and I will definitely be coming back The location is fabulous the staff friendly and attentive and the views from the rooms located on the front of the hotel allocated on my first stay are wonderful Another guest complained about the wifi reception in his room which was next to mine but I could not fault it my devices worked perfectly 
280685,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The room was very warm and I couldn t sleep in the entire night If you stay in this hotel make sure the temperature is below 10 degrees since they have the heating on all the time and you cannot switch it off , Excellent location friendly stuff big room 
280686,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Don t believe anything can be done on your side but will reconsider staying there again as the shared shuttle cannot make it to your hotel Very dificult to travel with older people and carey baga as well , Attention The way my mom was treated on her 90th birthday 
280687,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Older staff at the desk were not so accessible Maybe their English was not so good And how about adding some women , Young staff at the desk were friendly and very helpful suggesting restaurants suggesting transportation routes etc Buffet breakfast was excellent lots of cut fruit and lots of carry away fresh fruit 
280688,Col n Hotel Barcelona, A more modern bar area, Fantastic location facing the cathedral and a short distance to the Ramblas and the nearest metro station Plenty of bars and restaurants nearby
280689,Col n Hotel Barcelona, do not take the breakfast there are enough cafes nearby the money to quality on that breakfast was not good, the location is great and the hotel is beautiful
280690,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Of the five chairs in our junior suite four seemed low as if for children not adults The breakfast although excellent we thought expensive at 18 Euros although we realize this is probably average for better hotels , The staff service and views were excellent if there were an even bigger smile for Location Colon should get it 
280691,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, We were upgraded to one of the newly refurbished rooms and it was fabulous The location was brilliant in a square right opposite the gothic cathedral and in easy reach of visitor attractions The staff were friendly and very helpful 
280692,Col n Hotel Barcelona, We went to the restaurant seated ourselves and had no service for 5 minutes so left The buffet looked good , The location was extraordinary across from the Cathedral of Barcelona We stayed in a newly renovated room on the first floor Very nice but would have expected a comfortable chair given the upscale decorating in the rest of the room Good wifi Just stayed one night 
280693,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The usual difficulty with these older style hotels and two people each with a full size suitcase Where to put them The rooms could do with some redecoration the carpets especially Having said that it appears that renovations are taking place at this hotel so in six months time this comment may be superfluous , You really can t beat the location It was expensive considering everything but you pay for being at the centre of everything The shops are round the corner We could walk out and find a dozens of places to eat within 10 minutes walking slowly The staff at the hotel were friendly and extremely helpful 
280694,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Nothing, Old world charm Staff was as attentive and professional I left my I pad on our arriving plane and the staff went more than out of their way to retrieve it All this on top of the location When booking hotels their are always surprises but this was a most pleasant one There will be no hotel search with our next visit to Barcelona The Hotel Colon will besutomatic 
280695,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The room was not as big as the photographs on the website suggested The bathroom floor flooded when the shower was on as there was nothing to stop the water Also the bath filled up while taking a shower , The location was excellent 
280696,Col n Hotel Barcelona, No complaints, Excellent location very helpful staff We had a beautiful room with a large balcony and really enjoyed our short stay We have stayed at the hotel many times and we will definetly be back again 
280697,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The hotel is old and does need a bit of an upgrade During my stay some improvement works were taking place on the 1st floor causing an awful lot of noise that could be heard on every floor of the hotel so not very nice as I was hoping to get peace and silence The quality of the breakfast buffet can definitely be improved , excellent location and very friendly staff The spa has great views and the massagist was excellent 
280698,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Not a thing This was my second stay this year This is a 4 1 2 star resort with roof top spa and w hot tub in house lounge and restraunt that can be sat inside or on the patio So to find something wrong would be impossible , Everything was perfect Three balcony mini suite Expresso maker Whirlpool tub Adjustable shower head Soft robes with slippers 6 pillows soft as clouds View of cathedral was incredible Front desk called to insure all was OK then asked if we needed anything else What more can you ask for 
280699,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, We stayed at the Hotel Colon for two nights to celebrate my boyfriend s birthday We booked a room on the sixth floor with a private terrace We arrived on our first night at sunset and were met with an unforgettable view of Barcelona Cathedral directly across the square The room was comfortable and well appointed with a large walk in closet The terrace however was fabulous We also took advantage of the modern rooftop pool and the steam room and sauna They were stylish clean and well maintained and afforded dynamic views The location is downright amazing the view phenomenal and the staff were friendly attentive and helpful Although the decor of the hotel lobby and our room was a bit dated it was not one bit shabby Our stay was nothing short of perfect 
280700,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Some of the reception staff were a little gruff but we put it down to it being early in the morning , The location was amazing And the bar was a lovely place to end the day 
280701,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Disadvantages nothing realy significant , Advantages 1 great location and view close to tube parking and lots of sights 2 tasty food 3 cleanlyness 4 worth its money 5 hotel gives an opportunity to fill history of Spain realy authentic and classic 
280702,Col n Hotel Barcelona, I did asked for a quiet room but on most days I could hear building work being done and it was actually quite noisy , I really liked the location and the staff The piano being played in the reception and overall character of the hotel
280703,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The room we got was much smaller than the one advertised and pictured on the booking com website Two small elevators one of which wasn t working half the time Constant construction noise from within the hotel When we complained thy said they could have put us in a higher room but by then it was our last evening Overall a real disappointment for the price , Room was nicely appointed 
280704,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The noise from refurbishment on the lower floor was annoying but as we spent most of our time out in the city or in the spa it wasn t too disruptive , Staff welcoming on arrival and they also arranged a late check out for us The rooms were cleaned and service properly each day and we appreciated the chocolates left on our pillow at night The spa is excellent Great views from the rooms that we booked Perfect central location 
280705,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Air conditioning was turned off for season so guest room was uncomfortably warm , Great location Fabulous roof top deck Charming atmosphere 
280706,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Because of the central location there was tons of street noise all night In addition to that the hotel is completely renovating the first floor which means there is a significant amount of noise between 10am 7pm We were directly above the noise and it was so bad we couldn t stay in for even a short break from sight seeing We asked for another room but they were booked so they gave us free breakfast which is 18 50 euros normally Breakfast was terrible very over priced and totally not worth it Staff were not very friendly not rude just not friendly at all I wouldn t stay here again Also they should not be booking the second floor rooms when so much construction is going on on the first floor , Great location within walking distance to several things Triple room was spacious 
280707,Col n Hotel Barcelona, I didn t love having to turn my key in and getting back from the front desk before being able to return to our room If they get busy you have to wait to get back to your room , The location is INCREDIBLE The staff was lovely the room and terrace were divine I really enjoyed the bathroom and bathtub 
280708,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The air condition was switched off in the hotel probably due to the season late October making the heat in a room hardly tolerable The washing substance used for bed linen left strong smell of desinfection antibacterial chlor not suitable for children and someone with sensitive skin , Location is just great in the middle of a Gothic Quarter and walking distance from many attractions
280709,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Just two things intermittent light scent smell like garbage or sewer smell in room Not bad enough to complain but noticeable at times Also might want to avoid rooms on the square during special events due to possible late night noise , Superb location very comfortable room nice breakfast room wonderful piano accompaniment to dinner and drinks sidewalk cafe very friendly accommodating staff with great restaurant recommendations Staff worked hard to get rooms ready early for our group especially those with small children Would stay again 
280710,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Checked in to find that our reservation could not accommodate all three of us Despite the fact that most hotels were booked up the staff made alternate arrangements with some juggling of rooms and made ours a wonderful stay 
280711,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Air conditioning goes off at night and even though it was almost October no heat at night either , Wonderful location Walking distance to restaurants sites and markets Music in the streets 
280712,Col n Hotel Barcelona, No bad experiences Lack of air conditioning with warmer fall weather a bit uncomfortable for sleeping, Superb location all old quarter attractions within walking distance Good small shops cafes pastry shops restaurants entertainment etc close by
280713,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Staff were not apologetic when on arrival they had given 2 travelling friends a room with a double bed when clearly our booking requested a room with twin beds They did not acknowledge their mistake nor did they offer an apology They just said we fixed the problem and gave us a noisy twin room on the first floor with a view of the trees planted outside the window we had paid for a cathedral view No street map no attraction brochures offered just rudeness from the staff who just talked over you and could not see why we were unhappy constantly replying we fixed the problem We left the next day to a beautifully furnished hotel with delightful helpful staff and in a better location Winners , Location
280714,Col n Hotel Barcelona, We had a couple of small queries about the coffee machine we aren t Nespresso people talk about a cannot do attitude from Reception staff fortunately there was a lovely lady in the bar who kindly gave us a cup of milk and saved the day , The location was just fantastic Easy walk to lots of sights and Hop On Hop Off bus We had a superior room with patio and cathedral views which we really loved it was all clean and comfortable in a shabby chic way Great bathroom 
280715,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Room at the back was very loud at night Air conditioning was turned off so had to have the window open but the noise was very loud until quite late in the night , Location excellent staff was very nice 
280716,Col n Hotel Barcelona, We went in October when it was sunny and around 21C 70F They had turned the aircon off for the season It was 27C 81F in the room There was no way to lower it I mentioned to the front desk and they advised to open the windows but not an option when it is such a busy spot and the guest in the room below smoked on the balcony If you don t feel the heat you will be fine If you do beware , Very clean and good location Have stayed here before and enjoyed it 
280717,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Should get duvets as bedding Spa should offer pedicures and manicures Should offer a kettle on the room for tea , That there is a spa now Nespresso coffee 
280718,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The bathroom was a little awkward with a Jacuzzi like tub and needed a little face lift , The location of the hotel was very good Within walking distance of sightseeing food and shopping Taxi bus train and hop on hop off bus stops are very close by The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful The room was spacious 
280719,Col n Hotel Barcelona, I am trying hard to find anything here except that the 8 marble steps inside the front entrance are a bit of a barrier to suitcase lugging travellers but the staff usually help, In brief location car less but culturally lively cathedral square superb accommodation even expresso coffe makers in all rooms helpful and friendly staff excellent dining room I have stayed there 4 times in different types of room and would never go anywhere else in Barcelona great next day communication by e mail for enquiries bookings
280720,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Breakfast not very good Too expensive for what it was Room was not cleaned until after 3pm, All the staff were wonderful all the time Apart from breakfast the restaurant was excellent Superior Room large with a very large balcony with wonderful flowers
280721,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Due to unavoidable last minute circumstances related to our passport we had to delay our departure from the US by one day We e mailed the hotel to cancel our first night stay but they said they didn t receive it We used the e mail address provided by Booking com We had to pay for the first night s stay even though we notified the hotel 24 hours in advance about our delayed arrival We would like a refund for the first night s room rate , Great location
280722,Col n Hotel Barcelona, people at the reception were lazy and just did the job Shower was very difficult to turn on I burned myself with hot water The driver to the city was not helpful at all Not until I gave him a tip that he help me to take my luggage out of his van , near the airport
280723,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Great location and within walking distance of many of the tourist must see attractions The hotel was very comfortable and the staff were pleasant and helpful 
280724,Col n Hotel Barcelona, the hotel is a bit pricey for drinks and very expensive for breakfast , The location of this hotel is fantastic withing walking distance to shops and great restaurants 
280725,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The hotel needs serious updating I stayed in the hotel 10 years ago and it has not changed The room was small dark with no view The bathroom fittings were old and tired and the hotel is in need of serious modernization if they wish to continue to charge premium prices , Not very much
280726,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Upon check in Georgio looked at my wife and I and then told us that I had booked a single room with a single bed and I should have booked a double room He insisted that there is no such thing as a single room with a double bed and unfortunately they were full and had no double rooms Yet after a few minutes he found a double room for 40 euros more a few minutes after that while I was planning what in the hotel I was going to destroy first he finally found me the miraculous and elusive single room with double bed at the booking com price My advice watch out for this trick and make sure bed size is specified loud and clear somewhere in the booking , The location was fantastic and the room was pretty good it was about the level of a Hampton Inn or a Marriott 
280727,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Our room was on the first floor so it was VERY noisy with a view looking inside a hostel and tavern , The size of the room was ample The view from the rooftop terrace was lovely 
280728,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Very noisy as you are in a central location so you hear all the hustle and bustle until at 2 am there is a hostel behind hotel that is loud I had no power in my room for a day I went down and said something to front desk 830 AM ish and left to give them time to fix it Came back at 10 No power Came back at 330 still no power Went back to front desk They seemed embarrassed and sent someone right way However everyone else on the floor had power restored by 9 it turns out I spent a day with not fully pulled together hair make up or a fully charged camera and was not offered any sort of partial compensation on my bill The bathroom is very dark without any power , Location Location Location The pool deck spa area It is a beautiful lobby dining room Fabulous views from roof top Get a bottle of wine and unwind up there Clean 
280729,Col n Hotel Barcelona, We were very disappointed that a very ugly large book fair took place outside the Cathedral many little wooden huts which marred the view Our main reason for booking at this hotel was the the beauty of the Cathedral in front of us as in pictures and brochures of the hotel I believe they should have let us know that this was happening and it may well have caused us to look elsewhere It also brought many vagrants and unsavoury people into the vicinity of the hotel One particular arrogant front desk person looked as though it was an effort to assist us with taxis and in a nutshell it was not the family hotel we expected , We enjoyed the fact that it was close to everything 
280730,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Only criticism would be the choice on the al a carte menu but what we had was very nice, The ambience was first class with friendly and helpful staff Location was perfect 
280731,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, We didn t actually stay there because the hotel had no water but the issue was dealt with exceptionally well they politely informed us of the issue on arrival and escorted us to a replacement hotel with equal stars and facilities a 2 minute walk away 
280732,Col n Hotel Barcelona, That I had to go home , EVERYTHING The service the location the room the breakfast A really lovely hotel with impeccable service in spotlessly clean comfortable surroundings Possibly one of the most pleasant friendliest hotels I have ever stayed in 
280733,Col n Hotel Barcelona, no bad experience but felt bar area had no atmosphere probably due to dated interior , location was excellent 5minutes from la rambla yet very quiet slept very well
280734,Col n Hotel Barcelona, They advertise that they have pool facilities but there is a charge to use it Staff are not happy there it was my birthday and we were happy to have a few drinks from the fridge when we arrived the fridge was left open and all drinks were hot we asked for an ice bucket because and they came back with a really small one we asked for another one they didn t even made an effort to come back to us Wouldn t apologize or offer to change for cold drinks they just didn t care , Location is amazing and lovely balcony in the rooms easy to find everything 
280735,Col n Hotel Barcelona, When we first arrived to check in at the front desk the representative was not pleasant He asked to see our passports without welcoming us to the hotel There was no smile or pleasantries from this individual He was strictly business The rooms are not soundproof We could hear people talking toilets flushing lots of noise from adjacent rooms and the hallway We were disappointed that there was no coffee maker or tea kettle in the room , The location across from the Cathedral was great Close walk to La Rambla and other great places and sites The room was nice Most of the staff was friendly and helpful The housekeeping staff was friendly and always willing to assist The food was good 
280736,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, The location of this hotel could not have been better get a room with a view of the cathedral and you will not be disappointed We walked to the main shopping area the beach and took the hop on hop off bus from a stop across the street The staff were helpful the spa was wonderful and we loved that there was a plaza right in front of the hotel with lots of things going on 
280737,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The breakfast was a little disappointing I like bacon and eggs and it seemed to me that the bacon was cooked at 7 am and this was not re plenished with freshly cooked bacon regularly , The location the friendliness of the staff the cleanliness of the room and hotel In fact we liked everything about the Colon and already have recommended it to our daughter 
280738,Col n Hotel Barcelona, the bed was a bit on the soft side, location was excellent as can walk down to main shopping dining area of town we got upgraded to a very nice room with a terrace and a terrific view of the town 
280739,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, The location is great to explore Gothic District and the staff made staying a pleasure It is a pretty incredible view from the terrace bar We liked it so much we came back a week later and were greeted like old friends 
280740,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The wifi in my room was dauntingly slow which under other circumstances wouldn t have been an issue but I had several things I had to do online which either took forever or didn t get done Other than that I have no complaints , The staff at the hotel were all very helpful and friendly I was fortunate enough to book a room at a discounted price and it was quite nice very clean very comfortable for one person I love the location as well as the spa and rooftop terrace which is really the only place in the hotel I could get good wifi service 
280741,Col n Hotel Barcelona, We had booked a twin room with cathedral view What we got was a double room from which only a small glimpse of the cathedral could be seen When we complained the manager was impatient that we didn t want to understand that the rooms were assigned according to availability on the day of arrival I still don t understand that it has to work like that seeing that you pay considerably more for a cathedral view and we booked a few months in avdvance , The location and the building are lovely 
280742,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Bathroom a weird shape but had all the usual facilities , Location and our balcony on the 6th floor which was around 28sq mtrs Could just lay there all day and no one could see you Room 607 was very nice 
280743,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Really there was nothing to not like, The hotel was amazing and the location superb the public parking was literally at its doorsteps It was walking distance to La Ramblas yet away from the noise of it the cathedral was amazing to see first thing in the morning 
280744,Col n Hotel Barcelona, A pity the roof top terrace didn t open until 10am and did not have any parasols as it was too hot in the sun It also closed as early as 22 30 when people might want a drink after dinner Furthermore there was no bar up there so one has to call in the order on a telephone line , Staff was very helpful Room was small but quiet and fabulously air conditioned Very nicely refurbished bathroom excellent shower and space Beautiful views from roof top terrace 
280745,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The only negative point is the wifi connection in the bedroom If you need to use Skype or Facetime you may have trouble , Very comfortable and well located nice breakfast and meals Excellent option 
280746,Col n Hotel Barcelona, The pool was very small my older kids were disappointed the water reached to the knee our jacuzzi did not work and was not fixed during our 8 days stay at the hotel , Fantastic location helpfull staff wonderful large room with a view nice roof terrace 
280747,Col n Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Room 604 Wonderful large terrace with sun loungers and drinks table and chairslooking over the cathedral square Fantastic view of the cathedral and buskers and street performers Great location for restaurants and shops 
280748,Col n Hotel Barcelona, Extraordinarily rude young front desk person who said and I quote this is not America this is Spain when I asked if he could assist in finding a high quality restaurant for dinner at ridiculously short notice something that I went to pains to say I knew was unlikely but that I wanted to try none the less Apart from the insulting commentary the fact that I am not American and the fact that I was initially very polite have had a home in Spain for years and speak fluent Spanish seems to have escaped him when I tried to explain in as nice a way as my 60 odd years have taught me to do he just rolled his eyes like I was an idiot honestly then I was not so polite as this ex CEO of major global bank might be an idiot but at least I am not a 26 year old front desk junior being rude will never stay at this hotel again and an apology from this hotel s management is undoubtedly due to me and all the American s who stay there , Location
