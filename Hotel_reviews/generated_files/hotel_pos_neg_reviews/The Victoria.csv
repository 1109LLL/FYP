22874,The Victoria, Nothing, Such a great energy and atmosphere here The staff were awesome and the food was tremendous Ask for recommendations the staff knows the food well
22875,The Victoria, Our room on the ground floor was noisy from outside the garden carpark and the room above We walked to the hotel from the train station took about 20 minutes Plenty of buses into Richmond from nearby the hotel , The continental breakfast was very nicely presented and the coffee and pastries bread delicious
22876,The Victoria, Walk back to Hotel late at night from the main road too short a walk for a taxi and whilst we didn t have a problem it s probably best to think about how what time you want to get back to the hotel , Great croissants for breakfast Great public transport links fairly close to hotel Room whilst small had everything we needed for an overnight stop Staff very approachable helpful 
22877,The Victoria, Room could do with a freshen up as the walls were a bit grubby This is my only complaint and I would certainly not put a bad mark against my stay here , It was a great stay staff were fantastic and they were all very helpful and made the stay brilliant 
22878,The Victoria, The wi fi was very patchy and occasionally gave up altogether The pub was quite a long walk from the nearest station but if you re driving they have a more than adequate car park , We stayed in a sort of chalet behind the pub It was generally quiet though they were doing some drilling during the day It had a good desk to work at and a comfortable bed The pub itself was lovely with a really nice outdoor area it was a warm day when we visited and a good selection of drinks The restaurant was fabulous a really good and interesting range well cooked 
22879,The Victoria, room is very small there is no air conditioner and the window opens to the garage also the noise of the restaurant is right inside the room it was sunday when we arrived there were a lot of kids and we couldn t rest because of the noise,No Positive
22880,The Victoria, planes were loud woke us up in morning, all in all good stay room clean and everything you needed just a little bit small but fine for what we wanted staff and breakfast good
22881,The Victoria,No Negative, This place is fantastic While it is a little ways outside of London proper it works out in the best possible ways It s homey comfortable with super friendly staff Not only that but the pub it s attached to is great A fun way to unwind from a day of touristing that s literally a step away from your room 
22882,The Victoria, Saturday 27th May was a hot day and evening it was great to have a fan in our room but the noise was keeping me awake so I switched it off at 1 30 in the morning the accommodation below us must have had the same fan on because I could theirs going round all night but it wasn t quite as loud as if you had the fan in your own room I can sleep through anything usually the noise was obviously the whirring sound of the fan going around it was also a hot night and I was nervous about walking the London2Brighton Challenge the next day which I and my friend completed in 29hrs 40 mins This is not a complaint just an observation as the room was lovely and the beds were very comfortable , Great atmosphere We loved the restaurant and food staff were great very helpful Accommodation was great too 
22883,The Victoria, 1 Bedrooms were stifling hot Advised staff we were there in hot weather 28c the heating was turned off but the pipes leading to them were boiling hot so the rooms were still heated As a result UHT milk cartons had gone off and the provided bottled water was undrinkable No fridge facility in rooms Or even a fan 2 Were clearly short staffed and at busy periods they were under pressure and seemed to be working around the clock 3 Supposedly a continental breakfast I do not consider limited cereal and a loaf supplemented by some cheese and meat to meet that definition Croissants etc were available for other customers but not for staying guests You have to ask for fruit juice only water is automatically provided Very little fruit provided just a small bowl of some fruit cocktail 4 Typical London food and drink prices speaking as someone living in Yorkshire 5 Shower not properly cleaned 6 Bedrooms are not large and have limited storage so could be an issue for longer stays , Convenient yet quiet and attractive location with car parking Good range of drinks and a reasonable selection of food Pleasant indoor and outdoor public areas Live music in the beer garden Friendly staff 
22884,The Victoria, Continental breakfast was okay not much choice would have liked some jam , Food was good parking was good the room was comfortable I liked the extras of cookies 
22885,The Victoria, Disappointed this time the en suite sower and wash basin plumbing fittings didn t function well and the restaurant menu was not as interesting and varied as we had remembered from before Also the complimentary breakfast was rather simple , Have stayed twice before and re used the Victoria because of the ambience and the restaurant food 
22886,The Victoria, Breakfast was terrible Only 1 loaf of bread small amount of jam and a small amount of fruit offered No croissants or cooked food offered Have stayed here before and breakfast was excellent but not this time Rooms were too hot , location is great
22887,The Victoria,No Negative, We had a lovely weekend in Victoria the staff is very friendly the food in the hotel restaurant is really good and the live music played one evening by the local Tom Waits make the stay unforgettable 
22888,The Victoria, Limited Continental Breakfast selection eg no croissants pastries and no fresh fruit on second morning Not a deal breaker but disappointing Room 5 was rather hot but open window let in plane noise , Small hostelry in traffic free residential location in leafy suburbs quite near Richmond and Kew Bedroom annexe has been tastefully refurbished to high standard with nice detail monogram V on towels etc and good quality food served Staff are friendly and obliging 
22889,The Victoria, I had to go looking for the waitress at breakfast to ask for a spoon for my cereal and again for my coffee Also had to ask if she could bring out more cheese as there was none left on the cheese board That said I did love my continental breakfast , The staff in the bar the night we arrived were excellent all very friendly Chef offered to cook for us even though we arrived after the kitchen was officially closed 
22890,The Victoria, The property is a little far from the tourist attractions but the neighborhood is lovely and quiet The breakfast somewhat leaves to be desired very few options that don t change from one day to the other although you have the option of ordering an English breakfast from the a la carte menu not included in the accommodation fee , We enjoyed very much the lovely garden available to guests 24 7 the friendly staff and the close proximity to Richmond Park one of the most rewarding nature corners available in a European city We appreciated the complimentary snacks water and coffee machine in the room especially the home made cookies 
22891,The Victoria, I wish they would have told me I could get reimbursed for the VAT I paid not only at TheVictoria but everywhere I shopped or dined Didn t realize this was possible until I got to the airport for my return flight and was asked if I had the necessary forms from the merchants to get reimbursed for the tax I paid This would have been over 200 pounds just from The Victoria , The staff was very friendly and helpful with questions I had The food at The Victoria was delicious While my bed was very comfortable the bed in my son s room was not I slept on it one night and it was awful Each morning we had a delicious complimentary breakfast in the conservatory The food was wonderful and the setting was beautiful On Easter Sunday we enjoyed a lovely service at the church across the street 
22892,The Victoria, Paying for a fry up is not ok European breakfast was limited no pastries No fresh juices Thicker bathroom doors needed , Was in nice location Good transport links Pub had atmosphere and garden was lovely 
22893,The Victoria, Would have liked a nice big fat English Breakfast included in the price but you can t have everything I suppose , Great little place to stay in Richmond not too far from Twickenham for the Rugby Staff really friendly rooms lovely and clean and spacious 
22894,The Victoria, Nothing really room was a little bit hot but that is clutching at straws , For the price in London you cannot complain friendly staff lovely room great breakfast 
22895,The Victoria,No Negative, Breakfast was lovely Cookies and water in the room were a lovely touch as well Staff were super friendly and even though we were early arriving there was no problem checking in early 
22896,The Victoria, The restaurant was excellent but there weren t many vegetarian options , The staff were extremely friendly and always happy to help We enjoyed the complimentary continental style breakfast which included cold meats cheese pastries cereals etc The in room coffee machine and homemade cookies were a nice touch and the private on site parking was very convenient 
22897,The Victoria, I booked 2 rooms 1 taken by our friends which was a very good size however for the same price we had a very small room along with a tiny ensuite as I booked 2 rooms expectations was they would be of a similar size Breakfast continental style was small and did not suit all and we was not offered anything else , Close to twikkenham staff very friendly along with good free parking
22898,The Victoria, Nice restaurant good food Not good for stay on business Vould not stay again or recommend Very hot on the room Open the window and from 5 30am till 7 you will get big long distance planes landing every 5 5 minutes when west wind Single glazed windows wouldn t sound proof enough anyway Included breakfast is only continental Good breakfast is when you pay 10 50 extra On this occasion service in the morning was very Very bad Corder tea you get coffee Ask for missing glass for the water and you wouldn t get it And the best at the end Came to breakfast and there was no bread and had to wait 30 minutes for the chef to arrive , Look
22899,The Victoria, Got back at 8ish after the boat race and food had stopped We hoped for something to eat before bed but that was our lack of planning and checking out Apart from that it wad a lovely place , Quaint place and lovely area Nice welcome 
22900,The Victoria, Evening meal Charging 14 for a main and then charging between 3 4 each for extras such as a salad seasonal greens or new potatoes Not advertising there was a service charge and adding an extra 5 to my bill The breakfasts were poor and inconsistent No jugs of fruit juice no pots of tea or coffee only the latter was offered and served in mugs Breakfast day one and the buffet table had only slices of cheese There were two large uncut loaves and a few croissants slices of untrimmed pineapple and melon and some half filled jars of cereal yoghurt and compote The latter was the best bit Day two there were no croissants I asked the woman serving but she said they were ready yet This was at about 8 30am and none ever came As vegetarians we had the last couple of slices of cheese off the buffet These didn t get replenished even though more guests arrived there were however sliced meats on offer that morning At this second breakfast we we were offered a glass of fruit juice I m not fussy but this was horrible The fresh fruit selection was worse than the previous day with slices of untrimmed pineapple and a fruit bowl of apples and oranges Breakfast at the Victoria is very much a token gesture at keeping the cost down and it showed I ve stayed in some far cheaper places than this and had much better continental breakfasts I m pretty fit but the walk through the maze of streets to Richmond Tube station is too far , Quiet street leafy street although under Heathrow flight path The decor was very nice The fruit compote at breakfast was nice The fish and chips were very good
22901,The Victoria, Breakfast was limited but more than happy to pay extra for the fry up as it was gorgeous Tasted amazing , Everything Staff and food are amazing Location is great if you are going into London best place to avoid the cost of staying in London 
22902,The Victoria, Coffee machine in our room obviously needed either a service or replacing Soggy croissants but otherwise an excellent continental breakfast nothing like the nasty airport hotel option , Friendly helpful staff Stylish quiet comfortable rooms 
22903,The Victoria, The bathroom needs a much needed update Very dated shower with fixtures yellowing plastic I was on ground floor next to a staff area and this was a bit noisy at times, Pretty bedroom and a lovely pub Location was perfect for Richmond Park and easy access to main highstreet just down a side street making it quieter than expected
22904,The Victoria, nothing if a special attention to the breakfast menu would be great , The cozziness of the place makes you feel good If you are looking for a place other than a hotel s hygenic atmosphere this is one of that kind 
22905,The Victoria, It s slightly off the beaten track but that s not exactly unexpected , Excellent parking friendly staff fine pub style rooms with excellent coffee tea making facilities Good food 
22906,The Victoria, The bathroom was pretty basic and a little tired Noisy people above Breakfast was just about adequate but there was no staff around so had to find someone to ask for coffee juice She was serving in the bar and made it clear she couldn t do both , Bed was a good size and comfortable shower had excellent water pressure bar and restaurant looked nice although we didn t eat here Parking available 
22907,The Victoria, My only minor drawback was that I couldn t see how to turn down the heating in my room which was very hot and also that when we came down for breakfast there was no one in the dining room for us to order hot drinks but we helped ourselves to the delicious continental breakfast , The room was bright comfortable and cosy I loved the decor and the whole place had a well kept homely feel to it I recently stayed at another hotel that had a rather clinical feel to it this was the opposite The provision of mineral water and a coffee machine was also a nice touch Furthermore the staff were happy to let us checkout at 12pm instead of 10am so that my partner and I could have a relaxing morning together The continental breakfast was also delicious with options of cereal yoghurt berries nuts seeds bread cheese cold cuts 
22908,The Victoria, Just nitpicking controlling the shower temp was a bit tricky very little difference between v hot and v cold, Staff were extremely friendly helpful Loved the traditional cosy pub with open fire Food was superb also 
22909,The Victoria, Nothing really My only comment would be that the absence of fruit juice at breakfast was a bit surprising as the rest of the included continental breakfast whilst modest was fresh and interesting , Quiet location in suburban area but only a shortish flat walk to shops restaurants Richmond Park 10 minutes walk from the station at Mortlake so convenient enough as a cost effective base for London 20 minutes from Waterloo Less than 10 minutes on regular bus route from Richmond proper A nice friendly neighbourhood pub good bar menu and separate a la carte restaurant options 
22910,The Victoria, Breakfast is basic cereals and toast only no fruit juice not given any options no offer of top up for tea and coffee cheese board empty only fresh fruit was pineapple, Room clean and tidy hotel warm staff friendly and helpful
22911,The Victoria, We were downstairs and the upstairs guests were very noisey but that s not the hotels fault just inconsiderate guests , Everyone very friendly staff excellent
22912,The Victoria, 1 Cost of the food is quite pricey would suggest to look for other eating places 2 In the room the only drink facility is a tassimo so if you like them then fine but I much prefer a kettle so I can make a decent cup of tea 3 the noise from the above room was very annoying as every time they walked you could here the floors creak You could also hear them talking 4 Bed was very hard and uncomfortable for me , It was clean and tidy A lovely couple of homemade biscuits were left in the room for us which was a very nice touch You go to the rooms through the pub where your instantly greeted with the log fires roaring away Made me feel very happy Food was very tasty As I m gluten intolerant and they didn t have any gluten free bread so they were very good and offered to do me anything I wanted for breakfast which was fantastic People very obliging and tentative to our needs
22913,The Victoria, Awkward and narrow roads to get to the hotel Narrow time frame for breakfast 7 9 am , The welcome from the staff and their helpfulness The very quiet location A convenient and comfortable hotel I would definitely book here again 
22914,The Victoria, The breakfast although good was basic however this was a bonus for the price of the room The location is a half hour walk from nearest underground or five to ten minutes walk to nearest bus route , Lovely staff Very well presented both in the rooms and down in the bar Would like to return here 
22915,The Victoria, poor lighting in the bedroom bathroom continental breakfast rough ready and dining area conservatory cold first morning We complained second morning inside pub , location car parking dinner beers
22916,The Victoria, Tassimo coffee tea maker OK but would have liked kettle option Not a complaint just a personal preference Restaurant meal very nice but found very expensive especially as I have an expenses budget which was well exceeded when service charge added Went to local restaurant on high street for meal 2nd night which cost 1 3rd less , Room very comfortable and clean Slept well Parking a little tight but nice that it was included in room package many London hotels now charge extra a lot extra to park 
22917,The Victoria, The breakfast was fresh food left out cheese gone rubbery ham dry butter looked like a half babybel wasnt easily spreadable just had coco pops, Wifi tassimo sleep
22918,The Victoria,No Negative, Very friendly staff reasonable size room well equipped with coffee machine small TV and comfy bed The pub bar downstairs has a really nice family friendly feel the food was also excellent 
22919,The Victoria, only continental breakfast served which was left out uncovered for the whole duration of our breakfast meeting 2hrs , excellent pub setting and friendly staff
22920,The Victoria, Food was nice but very expensive for what you got View from room 4 is air conditioning unit A bit noisy but fine if you close the window , Nice well appointed rooms ample parking Lovely fresh orange juice at breakfast 
22921,The Victoria, The room was sparse One light bulb no kleenex and little in the way of toiletries Also the TV was very small against what seemed an enormous wall , The location very quiet but yet close to public transport and a walk from shops and the main town 
22922,The Victoria, The invasion of children yummy mummies from next door school noise of same Arrived on a Friday evening at kids turn out time , Friendly and helpful staff Good fresh breakfast and tasty evening meal
22923,The Victoria, There was a smell of something like blocked drains through the whole bar area not very pleasant A double room rate of 121 50 that only includes a continental breakfast a cooked breakfast was extra seems expensive considering the location isn t right in Richmond , Quiet location comfortable rooms 
22924,The Victoria, Room was dusty and needed attention especially the bathroom Staff weren t particularly friendly and didn t even ask how our stay was , Breakfast was nice
22925,The Victoria, Comfortable bedroom but in the recent hot weather air con would have been good Sleeping with an open window we were disturbed by the kitchen extract fans which were left running at night , Good food we particularly enjoyed eating in the courtyard garden Excellent choice of fruit cold meats cereals pastries etc for breakfast Staff all very friendly Great pint of beer from the bar 
22926,The Victoria,No Negative, The room was very well presented and very clean All you need for a nights stop over and the towels were very clean white and fluffy very friendly and helpful staff 
22927,The Victoria, Continental breakfast was a bit disappointing , Staff were very friendly and helpful Great location bedroom comfortable with spotless shower room also the hotel has on site parking 
22928,The Victoria, Windows could do with double glazing as a light sleeper I was awoken by the planes as the Heathrow flightpath is very close by , Staff very friendly and helpful bed comfortable
22929,The Victoria, The fact that they had filming crews in at same time as paying guests I had to complain about the noise and conversations outside my room door at 12am , Liked location
22930,The Victoria, Room 4 noisy fan outside all night Curtains didn t fit right Cheap toilet roll in bathroom which is not economic Breakfast selection very bad including serving times mostly fruit No eggs or meat on the continental There was a 1 hour longer service for non residents Got the feeling guests not the priority Not service after hours for residents , Friendly and helpful staff Everything thought of Nice styling inside Room was welcoming Lots of nice extras available Most at cost but they were there 
22931,The Victoria, I was in a ground floor room and the floorboards in the room above were so noisy that there was no chance of sleeping while the people above were moving about It was really disappointing as I was hoping for a restful stay Otherwise the room was nice and breakfast very good ,No Positive
22932,The Victoria, Noise from garden bar especially screaming children was alittle irritating as it was hot we had to have the window open and it went on well into the evening Otherwise ideal location near to Richmond town , Welcome was friendly and informal It was a little difficult to know where to book in we just wondered around until we found someone to ask This wasn t really a problem Room was small but very well appointed and clean Decor and small touches such as coffee machine much appreciated Evening bar staff went out of their way to accommodate our needs The standard of the bar menu and breakfast was excellent 
22933,The Victoria, Evening meal was expensive and cold No kettle for making own tea in room only a tassimo coffee maker I do not drink coffee at all and although it had a tea option I can attest this does NOT resemble tea and was undrinkable, Location central for what we wanted Parking on site Room spacious though noisy as opposite kitchens 
22934,The Victoria, We had an upstairs double room which was small and very hot I suspect there are hot water pipes under the floor which makes the room too hot for the cooling efforts of an electric fan , Good location for access to the parks of south London 
22935,The Victoria, Room not airy enough but fan provided is good enough to cool room down even though it s noisy when operated Pillows a little uncomfortable , Excellent continental breakfast served in relaxing conservatory Friendly helpful staff 
22936,The Victoria, From rooms on rear able to hear noisy customers in pub garden but only until around closing time Did not bother us but if you prefer an early night then perhaps staying at a pub is not for you , Spent two nights here Both couples found this a very comfortable place to stay excellent staff decent breakfast quiet location tucked away near Richmond Park but only 5 minute walk to shops and restaurants Would stay again 
22937,The Victoria, Nothing , Lovely location in a leafy part of Richmond Staff very helpful friendly Rooms all that we needed comfy clean Definitely be booking again 
22938,The Victoria, Water in the machine didn t get hot enough for a decent cup of tea in the bedroom would have preferred a kettle , Comfortable bed Breakfast was great 
22939,The Victoria, Was directly under Heathrow flight path Very noisy Flights about every 30 seconds or felt like it and they started around 6am I wouldn t go again to stay purely because of this which is a shame but would eat there again if in the area , A lovely place Great food both the breakfast and evening meal Lovely setting Very clean Staff extremely helpful Loved the conservatory 
22940,The Victoria, Bedroom window glass was whited out so could not see outside Parked car under tree in hotel car park next day my car was covered in bird droppings , Nice restaurant with interesting menu
22941,The Victoria, The rooms were badly soundproofed and the kitchens were less than 10ft away Until 11 45pm and from 5 00 am we were subject to singing whistling and swearing from chefs The bathrooms are unpleasant and the rooms were a bit tired, The bed was comfortable
22942,The Victoria, Missed out on Eggs Benedict as the cooked breakfast didn t begin until after 0830, Friendly staff night and day plus amazing food at the bar available by a famous chef
22943,The Victoria, The general cleanliness and bed making was poor Pillows on bed were okay but cushions were mouldy and smelt musty Bed was not properly made But it was all very comfortable, All staff were very friendly and helpful as I was travelling alone and am disabled so needed extra help all provided with a smile 
22944,The Victoria, We dined at the Victoria on 2 nights We had read that the food was superb and that the restaurant had received excellent reviews We were a little disappointed as we found the menu was quite limited and in our opinion over priced for what it was Maybe we had been a little spoiled by other dining experiences , Our room was quite spacious and clean Bathroom had obviously been redone over the past few years and was spotless Breakfast continental was included in the room rate and offered a variety of choice 
22945,The Victoria, The walls are thin and you could hear everything, Lovely chilled breakfast and will book again The room was very clean slightly over priced But that s London prices All staff were lovely Nice quiet location for us And a five minute walk from the park 
22946,The Victoria, Bit on the pricey side but this is London , A perfect one night stay Came to visit my old school which is next door Loved the beautiful interior decorating Modern fresh and clear yet keeping in mind the history of the old building Comfy beds clean room everything we needed We had dinner in the pub The burger was so good Very good and fresh breakfast buff The staff were all very nice and accomodating Close to Richmond Park and Sheen Common for outdoor activities or Upper Richmond Rd for Shops Easy access to Richmond by bus or London by train 
22947,The Victoria, Room was basic but comfortable A few cosmetic problems which we reported to head of staff, The Breakfast was amazing plenty of fresh fruit yogurt cereals seeds dried fruit lovely fresh bread etc etc Staff extremely polite and we enjoyed being able to relax with coffee after checking out of the room Quiet position with own carpark We would definitely stay again
22948,The Victoria, When I checked out I was charged extra because apparently the check in staff charged me too little well in my world the hotel should suck it up , Nice rooms small but we ll appointed and clean 
22949,The Victoria, Would have liked a teapot at breakfast I had to chase the waitress for more tea then just got another cup with tea bag still in it , Very comfortable room
22950,The Victoria, A bit far from central London if that s what you re after Stairs will pose a problem to some people , Very cosy pub with very friendly staff Perfect breakfast in beautiful room with well chosen music background Peaceful neighbourhood Not far to train service to London Small scale hotel Very comfy beds 
22951,The Victoria, The room Very basic Websites stated home made cookies iPod docking station and complimentary toiletries There were no cookies or biscuits of any description and no iPod docking station The complimentary toiletries consisted of a shower gel dispenser fixed to the shower and hand soap by the sink Very misleading for a 4 star establishment I would rate the accommodation as no more than 3 stars but the pub its menu breakfast and staff definitely 4 stars Free parking very good , The pub Great food and outstanding continental breakfast Very friendly and helpful staff 
22952,The Victoria, No complaints, Everything The location was close to Richmond but yet set in a quiet street The breakfast was great fresh and a good variety to chose from
22953,The Victoria,No Negative, Booked as close to Richmond Park and we were running a charity race there the next morning Staff very accommodating and allowed us a late check out for no extra fee 
22954,The Victoria, Only disappointment was that cooked breakfast didn t start til 8 30 a bit too late for my purposes , Friendliness and attention of the staff cleanliness of the room quality of the continental breakfast and not forgetting the Timothy Taylor s Landlord bitter served properly 
22955,The Victoria,No Negative, The way that every member of staff seemed to care about how you were and what you were doing Everyone was unusually helpful with everything Bonus of driving through Richmond Park on way in 
22956,The Victoria,No Negative, The atmosphere very friendly and loved how the young mums came in for a coffee after dropping their kids off at school Also the food was excellent and staff very friendly and helpful 
22957,The Victoria, Had a downstairs room noise from above on the wooden floorboards a pain especially in the early hours dinner bill had to be amended 3 times , We were warmly welcomed after being blanked once or twice by staff the homemade cookies in the room we re a nice little touch steaks at dinner were lush breakfast spread very good
22958,The Victoria, The room and bathroom were rather small While one does not expect furnishings to be of a high standard bearing in mind that this is an old inn the restaurant part could have been better Two mornings in a row large parties of ladies attended a breakfast session which affected hotel guests negatively In the evening the pub area was noisy and uncomfortable due to guests allowing kids to use the area and toilets as a playing field Manager s apology to us changed little of our discomfort Staff not being from the area knew very little about the area , The staff tried to be accommodating
22959,The Victoria, The downstairs bedroom 2 suffered with the noisy creaky floor boards from the room s above, The staff were very friendly and accommodating to our needs 
22960,The Victoria, I found the bed uncomfortable and the room hot the underfloor heating was on I felt the whole place needed a lick of paint , Location and feel of the place
22961,The Victoria, Noisy accommodation fan and lights were very intrusie beds were not comfortable, Food was excellent Very clean bedlinen and towels Excellent coffee tea facilities
22962,The Victoria,No Negative, Down a residential side street and the rooms were separate from the pub so very quiet hard to believe we were in London Lovely quality ingredients for continental breakfast in conservatory Plenty of parking available the night we stayed but it was a Sunday 
22963,The Victoria, For the price you would expect cooked breakfast continental was great by the way but some travellers might prefer cooked one , Unique atmosphere lively hidden little gem great pub and restaurant
22964,The Victoria, The only thing would be that the wi fi was a bit weak in our room but since we were on vacation it was not a big issue and the wifi was fine everywhere else in the inn I thought the distance from Richmond city centre would be an issue but it was not Plenty of buses and one could also walk to the city centre through some lovely parks which we did , The staff was very accommodating When we got there we realised there was a mix up as we thought we had asked for twin beds in our booking but it was not reflected in their records They took great pains to accommodate our request regardless Aside from that the staff were really so friendly and easy going I travel a lot and recognise that it takes a lot of attention to detail to create a relaxed comfortable environment such as the one at The Victoria We really enjoyed our time there Highly recommend 
22965,The Victoria, The room was slightly small and the fan in the bathroom was loud when switched on , We enjoyed a delicious dinner even though the wine was very expensive Loved the atmosphere and the combination of pub resto hotel all in one Proximity to Richmond free parking were also handy 
22966,The Victoria, Although well equipped and clean there is no doubt that Room 6 is probably one of the smallest double bedrooms I have stayed in It should be a single , Great staff excellent burger and breakfast 
22967,The Victoria, No air conditioning Room was small and uncomfortably hot The fan provided did very little to cool room A ceiling fan would have helped Although a warm summer day the heat seemed to be coming through the floor I first thought we were above kitchen but this was not the case , Location was good and the food was great 
22968,The Victoria,No Negative, Very smart clean and comfortable rooms and lovely food 
22969,The Victoria,No Negative, CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST WAS SUPERB lIKED THE DECOR AND AMBIENCE
