363417,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Bar Long wait at 2100 on Monday 31st July no staff around and surprised when I did get served that a service charge was included for 1 order of only 2 drinks What should have been a relaxing drink after a long day quite frankly annoyed me Needless to say I did not return , Reception excellent greeting

363421,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Could have done with double glazing but I presume that will come soon as refurb seems to very high standard , A coffee machine a kettle for Tea decent size cups Good quality Tea Coffee Hot Choc 
363422,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, No beds longer than 6ft I am 6ft2 and my feet hang over the end of the bed My wife who was not with me is 6ft4 and needs a bed 6ft6 long at least I d love to come back with her but we may go for an AirBnB that has long enough beds , The scrambled eggs at breakfast were perfect Location ideal well served by public transport The museums are a 15 minute walk through Hyde Park 
363423,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, There s always possibility for improvement but overall I would visit again , value for money excellent breakfast location fast internet possibility for twin beds instead of double quiet room
363424,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The standard double room is a little bit small but still likeable , Executive Room was very nice Staff extremely helpful and kind in all dealings Room service was above expectations great food Overall experience was very positive 
363425,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Small basic bathroom Low water pressure I was on 10th floor so might explain it Breakfast area was very small got very busy and the Egg Chef was struggling to make to order , Location was great room was clean and staff was friendly
363426,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The only thing which was good the beds are comfortable and AC provided which was cold , I am not convined that the hitel js a 4 star hotel The entrance of the hotel and the lounge is nice and spacious area for sitting For the room we booked it was a twin bed room The room was too small and the furniture is old The bathroom is small too with curtains in the bath which was not enough to stop water from leaking on the floor 
363427,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, It said that you could check in from 14 00 We arrived and was told that the room wouldn t be ready until 14 30 That time went None of the staff informed us even tho we were sat in reception We were then told it would be ready in ten mins Again no one told us We eventually got in the room at 15 50 after much chasing back and fourth We felt that the service was very poor and we received no apology If the rooms are not going to be available from two then you should change the check in time , The location was really good
363428,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Rooms are small hotel is dated food is expensive and not great quality staff are nice depending on who you get , Location is great beautiful park across the road from the hotel 
363429,Corus Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, Great location and very good value for money as a 4 star London hotel goes I don t think you will do much better Exclenent Proximity to Hyde Park Paddington easy walk to Regent Street and great central location
363430,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Our room was quite tired and old The bathroom was very small and it was difficult to get in and out of the bath to have a shower I think the potential to have an accident was quite high , The food was excellent as were all staff both in dining room and other front desk etc Location was great in relation to Hyde Park West End and other tourist locations It was nice to have breakfast in the dining room and look straight across to gardens 
363431,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, We asked for 2 sandwiches and one evening and the hotel wanted to charge 20 for 2 cheese and pickle sandwiches We declined and bought 2 better choice sandwiches chocolate and drinks for a tenner from a nearby shop ,No Positive
363432,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, In the reception I specifically mentioned that I want my room with Hyde Park view But they couldnt provided that The bathroom was clean but there was no shower cabin or a tub It was the only big issue about the room , I liked the location of the hotel It was right by the Hyde Park And the Lancaster Gate tube station was 2 mins walking distance The open buffet breakfast was awesome and very satisfying The room was well decorated I liked the plug with usb port It was a very smart thing to put in a room especially for foreigners 
363433,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The bath was okay a bit compact n the bath a bit to high as I got a bit of a bad knees it was a bit difficult to climb in n out could have been a bit lower as I like to have bath instead of shower , Bed was very comfortable slept very well It serve me good for my one night stay
363434,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, You go to the bar and they add service on your bill There is no table service offered They immediately took it off when I pointed it out It is not the money but it is all under hand and sends a message to me that I am a mug and therefore they have the right to rip me off Won t be staying here again I earn my money why don t you try earning yours , Motivation
363435,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Noisy room air conditioning in others rooms could be heard I couldn t stand up straight I m 5 10 in the shower due to a slanting wall , Close to Paddington station
363436,Corus Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, Was unexpectedly able to check in at 10 in the morning as my room was ready Compact rooms but bed was comfy and a lovely bathroom and all facilities which you would need Fantastic breakfast selection so super value for money 
363437,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Hotel was busy so was sent downstairs to have breakfast and the room smelt damp and the service was poor We did get to eat our breakfast the 2nd day in the normal room and this was far better,No Positive
363438,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The bed was very small for a double my wife is tiny and took over it Rooms are very small and the bathroom very dated TV remote didn t work , Breakfast was very good The air conditioning worked a dream too Check in and out very smooth Reception very good
363439,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Bathroom door didn t close properly but this wasn t a problem , The location was excellent right beside Lancaster gate tube The hotel was clean comfortable whilst the room a twin was small it served our needs well Breakfast was tasty with a good selection 
363440,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Breakfast was very expensive and given the room rate surprising it wasn t included with the room Expensive for a tiny room where you bumped into coat racks that protrude into the room A shower that is very small on space for a very slender person so would be a problem for a heavier set person Poor air conditioning controls either full on or full off, Close to Hyde Park
363441,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Room was far too small with the amount of money Our cash was all checked to be real even though we took it out of the atm in the hotel Could barely fit in the shower and our bed sheets were dirty as well as the cutlery in our room,No Positive
363442,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The room was too small The toilet was too narrow and a pillar above the head level The breakfast was the same everyday and limited variety , The staff were friendly Location is near the Train station 
363443,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Booking com said there was parking at this hotel and there wasn t so we had to pay an additional 25 per day and breakfast was also an additional charge of 12 each, excellent location air conditioning and friendly service
363444,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The room decor and fittings were old and tired Travelodge have comfier beds The bar service was appalling having to wait 30 minutes to get a drink This is not a 4 star establishment, Check in staff were very pleasant 
363445,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Not much really The bedrooms were quite small but for a one night business stay it was perfectly adequate, Very fast wifi well above the norm for a London hotel Bedrooms were very well appointed with excellent bathrooms Breakfast was all you would want it to be Perfect location opposite Hyde Park and 2 mins walk to Lancaster Gate Tube 
363446,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Bar service very poor later in the evening Unable to cope with the crowds returning from a local concert which is organised annually Queued 30 minutes for a drink no snacks available , Room compact but acceptable everything you need for a quick stopover Tea Coffee making facilities safe provided hair dryer etc 
363447,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The shower itself was fabulous but unfortunately it drowned the bathroom floor and that didn t really dry fully at any stage so ended up walking on soggy towels , The bed was particularly comfortable with big fluffy pillows A C worked perfectly Compact room but exactly what we needed 
363448,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The standard double room was very very small but had most the facilities you would need tea and coffee ironing board safe good air con , Excellent location for hyde park Good air conditioning
363449,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Was possibly the most uncomforable bed ive ever slept in my back was killing me after sleeping in it and normally i have no problem sleeping anywhere ive slept on a concrete floor that was more comfortable think they really need to change the matress or the bed , Location was perfect for event at hyde park with the tube close by
363450,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Bar staff in the hotel were extremely poorly mannered extremely slow A lot of people waiting to get served complaining about the bar staff too , Air conditioning friendly 
363451,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Card keys didn t work we had 8 in 2 days Room was tiny The barman couldn t pull a pint charged a different price every time we went to him We paid for the room when we got there but were asked to pay when we left as the first payment wasn t taken Some room lights didn t work The shower was faulty The extractor fan in the toilet didn t work, The food was nice
363452,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Although I had booked the hotel room weeks in advance when we arrived after a long journey and delays on the train was informed that because the hotel was fully booked I had to have a basement room The receptionist then said at least it will be quiet The room was extremely hot with no ventilation It was obviously situated close to the service entrance as we had delivery lorries and bin lorries arriving at 6 am and late into the night Most disturbingly after the first night I woke to find 4 bites on my foot presumably from a flea or bed bug , good location
363453,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The smallness of the room and that when I initially book through booking com breakfast was included and when I received my invoice it was not there , The close proximity to Hyde park The breakfast there was plenty of it and staff were very helpful
363454,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Really small room bathroom No beer in hotel bar upon returrn in the evening , Really comfortable bed Great breakfast buffet Very helpful staff Fantastic location 
363455,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Everything worst hotel I ve stayed at and I ve stayed at loads smallest room in the world and they cut the power off at 10 am when check out was 12 due to the lights going off I slipped out the shower hurting myself Tried to complain but no one cared absolutely awful hotel , Nothing
363456,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The room was the smallest I have ever stayed in I appreciate that the price was good for the location but the room was tiny one night stay is all I would recommend for , The hotel is in an excellent location for the west end of London
363457,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, I had a grilled rump steak and asked for it to be cooked Medium to well done which means no blood running in the steak at all but not well done it came as a medium rare steak with the blood still running inside when cooked I didnt return it as I find when this is recooked it will only toughen up the meat so made due as it was also the rest of the meal was covered in Pepper as the chips had a coating on them and the large Mushroom with a half Tomatoe on top had pepper put between them All I could taste was the pepper and not the food it should be a customer choice if they want pepper on there food I Have worked as a butcher and Chef most of my life and have a good understanding of cooking and uncooked produce I didnt complain as it is not in my nature to make a fuss apart from that it is a excellent hotel with frindly staff and worth a visit and has hyde park on its doorstep , Breakfast was excellent
363458,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The new rooms have a rather small bathroom which is OK but it is also a wet room and the design means that once the shower has been used you cannot revisit without getting your feet wet and when changing any clothes that touch the floor become wet a fundamental design flaw in my opinion ,No Positive
363459,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, There was no top sheet on the bed and the blanket was too warm Could have used the sheet as the room was quite warm despite the fact we had the air conditioning on , Great breakfast buffet 
363460,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Upon getting to our room on 7th floor post check in our key card would not work When my husband returned to reception to get this sorted he was made to que rather than sorting immediately , Accidentally booked a twin room instead of double for me and my husband Check in member staff accommodated my request to change despite the hotel being busy Great location and very comfortable stay 
363461,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, My room was very small the shower had a boxed in area above only giving room for a 4ft person to stand and the double bed was against the wall so had to climb , Welcoming and helpful staff breakfast was great 
363462,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Disappointed with the size of the room and the quality of the bed considering the cost Needs renewing as the exposed base looked shabby , The breakfasts were plentiful with a very good choice The location was excellent across the road from Hyde Park and 100m from Lancaster Gate tube Easy walking distance from Buckingham Palace and Oxford Street 
363463,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Room size was far to small budget maybe but far smaller than I would have expected from a hotel of this standard, beautiful hotel great location for what we were in London for
363464,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Overly expensive for what was essentially a broom cupboard over 200 for a single room and breakfast was an additional 20 Room was like sauna too Shame as great location, Someone gave me an orange juice at check in
363465,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Our rooms My friends were in a room and they described it as the worst room they had ever stayed in and they travel a bit They could not fit into the Shower The room looked grubby the bed quality was poor They went to the manager and they were moved into a lovely room so were very happy with that and very happy with the room they got My room was small dated and compact The hotel air conditioning units were outside our window so very noisy and after 3 nights very annoying We had twin beds which were too soft I could feel the springs in my one and moved when I moved in the bed , Location was excellent Right at gate to Hyde Park which was Perfect Paddington area just a short walk away so lots of restaurants and bars in that area There was a bar next door to the hotel Lots on the doorstep Staff friendliness was excellent Access to the Underground Lancaster gate was about 3 minutes walk Excellent You could walk into Oxford Street if you wish it s a good walk but if you don t like the underground you could do it 
363466,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The bed was very squeaky with the slightest of movements , The attention to detail on arrival was fantastic Friendly welcoming staff with orange juice and cake The desk staff were also very happy and friendly 
363467,Corus Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, Very basic room for the amount of money we paid for 2 nights breakfast good at 12 each all u can eat but disappointed with 2 single beds and we booked a double
363468,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Booked executive double and I added a request to confirm that I want twin beds as I m there for a festival with my brother Got there and it s a double bed no twin beds available Good start Shower wasn t very powerful and a little dated Room service was none existent Got back from concert around 11pm Called room service twice to order a sandwich Nobody picked up Called down to reception Nobody picked up Went downstairs to the front desk in hotel slippers They said kitchen about to close but can order from a pizza takeaway menu After hours room service is from 10pm 6am and sandwiches only as stated in room service menu in the room Went back up to room Called down to front desk with order They transferred me to the actual takeaway place When the takeaway asked for address they said too far away and won t deliver that they are a chain of takeaways and maybe the person called the wrong shop Marvellous I called down to front desk Nobody answered again Went downstairs a second time It s 11 45pm Front desk apologised and called the takeaway while I stood there They got through confirmed the address and handed me the phone to make the actual order Said it ll be 45 minutes to an hour Again marvellous Front desk said they ll ring when it arrives 12 50am I ring front desk asking where food was Not here yet 1am Front desk called and said food is here would I like them to bring it to the room Christ alive Yes please send it up Knock on door The delivery man from the take away was stood at the door and we had to pay him there and then Good job we had a bit of cash on us We ordered chicken mushroom pasta which was bland as cardboard Open the box and no fork We had to eat pasta in our room with a tea spoon By now it s 1 45am Thank God the bed was comfy , Bed was very comfortable Espresso machine with a good choice of coffee Check in and check out very fast
363469,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Bar staff rude and unhelpful Asked for a decaf coffee and was told that they would only do cold drinks Then the person behind asked a different barman and was served a coffee Room for leisure not as modern as room I had a couple of years ago for a business trip All in all overpriced for what we got , Location was good for Hyde Park Reception staff welcoming 
363470,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, the wash room is definitely a wet room as soon as it s used everything including the toilet is wet , Room was very comfortable and would amazing views over Hyde Park in winter when the trees shed there leaves 
363471,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Being directed on our booking instructions to park at Queensway which was a very long walk dragging your luggage behind you we really did not appreciate that at all and it cost us 33 for the privelege, I liked that we were greeted with a glass of ice cold orange juice and a piece of Victoria sponge I have never had that in this country before very welcome indeed
363472,Corus Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, Room quite small not quite sure about the so called wet room as once you had a shower you could no longer enter the bathroom without getting your feet wet not sure the concept here 
363473,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, To pay 200 a night for what you think is a 4 star hotel is acceptable in London however this is more like a 2 3star hotel ok if your paying 80 a night The electric went off midway through shower so had to leave hotel with wet hair my friend cold then shower or see in our room Rooms are very small not cleaned properly shampoo bottles half empty etc dirty chairs and bedding this was after being moved from our first room The view overlooked the rubbish bins to which you were woken up at 2am and 6am by rubbish and bottles being emptied Pictures are not what they seem on the website they clearly used old photos or photos of s different hotel Rooms stank of cigarettes and damp Not what you expect for 200 a night on a week night Staff were helpful though and said they get a lot of complaints so we re happy to refund me part of he cost Needs refurbishment, Location great Staff were friendly and helpful 
363474,Corus Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, Staff were all so friendly and helpful Good location at the side of Hyde Park just off the tube station The hotel is spotless throughout Breakfast is fab 
363475,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, the breakfast was disappointing the food could have been served quicker The room was very nice but the double bed was pushed against the wall and a cloths rail had been put up in is place and made it very difficult getting out of bed, Position of hotel the reception and bar area very nice
363476,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, We expected the room to be small which we have come to expect in London but it was clean and efficient I thought the breakfast was typical and generous What I did not expect was to open the curtains and be looking at garbage containers and trash in an alleyway that was very unpleasant and really no hotel guest should have to view that scene We were only there for a very short stay or I would have had to request another room That view was unacceptable at any price , The location was the best part Walked easily from Paddington Station 
363477,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, rooms are too small, good hard mattress air condition perfect position close to Hyde Park good for morning exercise or walks in the park excellent connection to the centre by bus and very close Paddington 10 minutes by walk or metro connection to Heathrow Bayswater station 15 minutes walk
363478,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Air conditioning problems They electronically minimize the comfort levels during the night and one has to get up and turn the lights on to reset thermostat so the room will cool off Same thing every night , Breakfast buffet is fantastic but save money by booking with online reservation 
363479,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The toilet didn t flush properly in our bathroom , The location of he hotel was in a lovely area right next to Hyde park and no to far from oxford street and bus stop was location just on the main road around the corner We did not receive the room that we was supposed to however we knew this when we checked in as we was early and the staff told us this from the start The room located on the lower ground floor which we didn t mind as we wasn t spending to much time in the room the room was quite small and he bathroom was tiny but the room was comfortable and cosy we liked it 
363480,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, When I checked in I found that the attitude of staff have changed after they knew my nationality They became rude Also The restroom of the economic room is very small and there is no slippers I ll never book at this hotel in the future , The hotel is close to Hyde Park and you can walk around many different spots 
363481,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Standard double room smaller than expected remove small table will help room service late night menu unappealing breakfast not really 4 star standard coffee rubbish too breakfast staff unhelpful , Kerb appeal location clean comfortable spacious open plan reception area reception bar staff friendly free to use ATM Lancaster Gate station almost next door but was unfortunately closed during our stay Hyde Park directly opposite
363482,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, They don t have a loyalty Program which is insane and no special considerations for staying 14 nights The quality of rooms are also very inconsistent and we stayed in 3 rooms before we liked one,No Positive
363483,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, No vanity table or mirror other than the one on the wardrobe door so I had to get ready sitting on the floor in front of the wardrobe Smallest room of all three hotels we have stayed in over the course of our week in London Bar closed ,No Positive
363484,Corus Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, Great staff helped us check in early and made travelling with a seven month old a breeze The location is excellent with buses to everywhere you might want to go right outside and the park entrance literally across the street 
363485,Corus Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, Tiny room but really quiet really comfortable bed Location is everything Helped that it was sunny could enjoy great walk through Hyde Park to get my meeting the next day 
363486,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Price per night was not worth it Rooms were very small and no ventilation in the shower and bath area Rooms got steamed up quickly Air Conditioner did not work properly , Hotel has a nice Lobby Hotel is quite a distance to a working Tube station This was not disclosed at time of reservation even though I directly asked about it They knew their closest station was closed It was an added hassle every day Not good for people who have trouble walking distances 
363487,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Breakfast same food very small room and restaurant size is note enough hotel and booking website didn t mention that the nearest tube station Lancaster is under maintenance at the time of the booking , Location staff and cleanliness
363488,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The hotel is near Lancaster Gate station but this station is currently closed until July 2017 You have to walk form the next station taking about 10 mins The sewer in the shower room is blocked , Very friendly staff good breakfast quiet room 
363489,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, One of our party booked a single room which was tiny Hardly any room to move around the bedroom However our double room was spacious , Location was ideal Staff very friendly
363490,Corus Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, The service of this hotel is perfect They upgrade my room without extra charge because I bring two kids with me I would like to say thank you again to Joanna of the reception 
363491,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Unfortunately for us the closest Tube station was closed due to maintenance works so we had to walk to the next station Weather was dry so it didn t bother us too much , Fantastic breakfast choices best I ve had on a city break hotel Lovely foyer area for relaxation Excellent location 
363492,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Closest tube station closed for a refurb which meant having to walk further which we didn t realise , Great hotel in a central location Staff really looked after us with friendly service throughout our stay 
363493,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The room we had was abysmal The bathroom that was so small you could not stand in front of the basin to brush your teeth because the toilet was so close you had to stand to one side Couldn t regulate the temperature of the water in the shower Nowhere to put anything in the bathroom you had to get dressed in the room because you can only put your clothes on the toilet there isn t anywhere else If you are a larger person you would have difficulty even getting in the bathroom the doorway was so narrow The wardrobe is a joke You can t open it because it hits the bed Couldn t use the mirror they have on the inside of the wardrobe door because you CAN T OPEN THE DOOR The tea coffee they must be on rations The 3 teabags and 4 coffee sticks and 3 little milk pots were in a tin on a shelf Had to ask for more milk and used my own teabags because I couldn t be bothered If you ordered room service they charged 5 GBP a TRAY to deliver to your room Needless to say we ate out This room was for all intents and purposes CHEAP and NASTY However it was only 50AUD a night cheaper than a better located and fitted out room that we had previously in another hotel Should have gone back there , Staff friendly Lobby pleasant You could open the window a little 
363494,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The hotel needs a little modernising, Excellent breakfast and very good location I like a morning jog and with Hyde Park across the road it was ideal There is a very good Italian Restaurant nearby 
363495,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Breakfast selection was not impressive for a 4 star hotel Small room despite choosing a luxury room , Nice location right across the street from Hyde Park 
363496,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, There was not a train station that was close by as lancaster gate was closed and it is advertised on booking com as having metro access I would not have booked if it meant a 10 15 min walk with my luggage from the next nearest station , Great hotel
363497,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The bathtub is very high and there is a big step down to the floor The room is set up very efficiently but don t expect extra space They also claim to be within a 10 minute walk of Paddington Station and the Heathrow Express When I checked on a map it looked much further connecting across a couple of Tube lines and going about 5 stops with heavy luggage was not my idea of close I got a taxi at Paddington and it cost about 6 pounds , The staff was very pleasant and accommodating the food was good and the bed was very nice 
363498,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The closest Tube station Lancaster Gate is closed until July 2017 this added an extra bit of walking to the end of each day as we had to walk from Paddington each night back to the hotel No bus service on bayswater road for the first day was somewhat of pain , Nice location just a few minutes from Hyde Park arrived early and had no trouble checking in early Newley refurbished rooms although the bathroom was a tad on the small side 
363499,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Lobby furniture looked a little worn The internet access on the computer was poor , I liked the proximity to Hyde Park The breakfast buffet was very substantial 
363500,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, N A everything was spot on , The room was lovely the staff were friendly and attentive The breakfast was delicious with so much to choose from Definitely stay again 
363501,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Small room but lucky bathroom is huge 1 3 your room size Provide shower cap slippers only after made a request Old furniture flat pillows not suppose to call it a pillow lol, Location Many eateries around the hotel Hyde Park just a few steps cross the road Love their lobby with very welcoming pianos instrumental 
363502,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The walk in shower is a little style over substance Great idea but not in such a tight space Water did not drain quickly and left water all over toilet and standing area Therefore no area to dry feet Water damage to door is emerging If you need to return to bathroom then you are paddling around Shower curtain or screen may help Sound insulation between rooms and bathroom poor I could hear every intimate word good job I had the television for entertainment Wanted to charge a service gratuity fee on top of my room service tray charge outrageous The manager agreed to take this off and then found it was still on my bill after I checked out , Breakfast good selection 
363503,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, We had a room on 10th floor and shower was little awkward for my tall husband , Great location right next to Hyde Park Close to public transport Helpful staff 
363504,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Coffee from coffee machine in our room was poor room a bit small, Excellent welcome on reception and staff generally friendly Great location and comfortable room although a little on the small side for an executive room
363505,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Lancaster gate tube was closed for maintenance and i had to walk from Queensway and back , Amazing breakfast Great location As i think they have renovate rooms and baths Alrdeady my 3rd time there 
363506,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The bathroom size was incredibly small and the shower was very cramped and unusually shaped Anyone taller than 5 5 would struggle to stand straight in the shower without their shoulders smashing into a tile jut out I was also unaware when booking that the closest Underground station was closed for improvements so the walk from Paddington station was a bit more than we had prepared for after a long travel day The walk was definitely doable but not as convenient as research had led us to believe had the Lancaster station been open , The hotel was nice and the staff was very friendly The location was great directly across from Kensington Park and very easy to navigate to attractions and transportation The noon checkout time was great for those with afternoon flights but the front desk also offered to hold our luggage for us should our flight have been later 
363507,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The room was really small for 2 adults and the bathroom was so small they had an open shower next to the sink and toilet so everything was wet when you showered , It s location near Hyde Park Kensington gardens as well as within walking distance of Paddington station Also has a good selection of restaurants if you want to eat close to the hotel Very friendly staff and good breakfast buffet
363508,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The rooms are really small though nice and clean and the walls are very thin We could hear every word from the room next door Unfortunately the neighbors there kept us from sleeping but the concierge was very sympathetic and we were able to change rooms right away , The staff was very obliging and friendly there was a wide range of breakfast varieties even the possibility to order freshly prepared food like porridge or omelette and it was well organized We never had to wait for a table The service at the bar in the evening was also very good We had a problem with noisy neighbors and thin walls but the the concierge was very sympathetic and found another room for us 
363509,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The continental breakfast was too pricey and the drinks in the hotel cost nearly 9 for a large red wine , The espresso machine in the room felt spacious and relaxed and minimal noise from the other rooms cleaned daily and to a high standard Great location lovely walk through Hyde park on a morning 
363510,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Very poor water pressure for the shower but OK, Booked half price and had a very good sized double on the ninth floor liked the coffee machine and we were at the back so it was quiet Breakfast was very good On this deal it was excellent value and would book again if the price was similar 
363511,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Lancaster gate underground was unfortunately closed at this time bed little bit too soft for my liking , Good location nice personal very tasty breakfast nice room not too small either 
363512,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The outside overall look of the hotel was really good and the reception area this is where it changes When you come out of the lift to go to your room you walk down narrow corridors with lots of shabby looking doors leading to the rooms They have crammed as many rooms as possible into this hotel It needs a total refurbishment The rooms were tiny shabby and very worn the bed was the size of a postage stamp which dipped in the middle we didn t have any sleep it was so uncomfortable The extractor fan in the toilet would not turn off which added to our sleepless night There was also constant loud noises from what looked like staff wheeling big crates back and forth at midnight A very depressing room will not be going back really spoilt our trip , The location opposite Hyde park was spot on this is the only good thing about this hotel 
363513,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Cleaning service left a dirty cup on our room Coming back at about 11pm wanting to order a drink at the bar barman stressed and waiter stressed very busy and not enough staff not their fault they need more staff , Towels were awesome Room clean 
363514,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, To picked this hotel because it is right at an underground transport stop Unfortunately this stop is being worked on and cannot be used You either take a bus from Victoria station with all your luggage good luck finding it or go to a neighboring tube stop and walk better hope it s not rainy or a taxi traffic in London is terrible , Right on Hyde park so I could runn in the morning Good breakfast the women who run a the grill will make you an omelet made your way plenty of good restaurants around 
363515,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Shabby bedrooms paper thin walls Long wait to use lift Spent horrendous night unable to sleep due to antics in room next door Never again Overpriced presumably due to location Very disappointing , Only good thing about this hotel is the location
363516,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Hotel is a little tiered and needs a bit of an update Disappointing that Lancaster Gate Tube station was closed Should mention this on your web site as the closure is for six months , Good Breakfast room quite spacious 
363517,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Very expensive staff pushing for money all the time at reception it was a shame as I had previously stayed they work and it was great this time I take my family and I was disappointed, Great location
363518,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Lancaster Gate tube station was closed but we were advised through the website to use it Fortunately we had been in the area previously and knew that would not work The moral is that web sites need to be kept up to date on pain of misleading potential visitors It was expensive though no more than we have come to expect in that part of London , We were upgraded to an executive room with the associated advantages so this gave us a favourable impression The concierge service provided after checkout while we spent the day in the locality was especially appreciated Very handy for Hyde Park Kensington Gardens and the museums across the park in exhibition road
363519,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Bedroom window was filthy hadn t been cleaned in a long time Bed springs were noisy and bed not particularly comfortable , Breakfast choice was excellent and staff service very good Location was perfect opposite Hyde Park 
363520,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, My husband advised their twin room was nothing like any 4 star hotel we have used it was not modern and did not rate as well as a Premier Inn or Travelodge My husband said carpets decor etc are very old and out dated and he isn t too hard to please and he thought it would have een more modern I was so disappointed to hear this , My husband stayed here with my grandson for my grandson s 8th birthday present and I booked the hotel on line and thought I was getting a good deal for the location and star rating 4 for the hotel My husband said the foyer was beautiful and looked 4 star but this was the only area in the hotel he rated this way I was so disappointed 
363521,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The shower was very weak , Reception staff were very welcoming Room was a comfortable temperature Location was good although it was unfortunate that the closest tube stop was closed 
363522,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Do not expect a sleep in as it was extremely noisy from very early morning It is overpriced, Food good Helpful staff Attractive lobby Good w fi cover Great that we could leave luggage and collect later on day of checkout 
363523,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Breakfast should be included in the price having to pay another 12 each day was a bit much , Rooms were very comfortable and clean and to me that is very important Breakfast was very tasty 
363524,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The standard room is tiny the bed takes up 90 of the space no room for luggage or anything else Had a large bug in the bathroom window insulation is so poor had to cover it with pillows sound proofing in the room is non existent room keeping banging on the doors along the corridor every morning just an utter nightmare Apart from the location does not worth the money , Location
363525,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Room is small and the bathroom is smaller no fridge no complimentary water and if you need brush paste or other things as slippers you have to ask for it Other thing if you order food to be sent to room you have to pay extra Breakfast was not so good they need to add more international dishes they were serving Malaysian breakfast and intercontinental break fast, staff are very helpful and friendly hotel location Is good Lobby is good and comfy where you can listen to the pianist in the afternoon
363526,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, When choosing this hotel amongst others i was a bit unclear about the reason for low rating but location was a driver for our pick We occupied a room on 4th floor with the window overlooking the Hyde Park But have barely had a chance to enjoy the view since window n balcony were so dirty that was very disappointing Room was a bit small but ok Bathroom was also tiny with very inconvenient sink Beds were too narrow can not recall when i saw last time the single beds in the hotel but small room does not allow to put wider beds So overall this hotel has very nice location attentive staff fine breakfast But some improvements would be to the benefit of the hotel i think , All staff were very helpful n nice especially reception team Breakfast was very good with many choices for the exception of coffee Tea n coffee option in the room was pleasant 
363527,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, While I didn t go for the view I was on the third floor overlooking a line of dumpsters which wasn t exactly ideal The alley was noisy at random points of the night but it wasn t bad enough that we asked to be moved , The location was perfect We were right across from Hyde Park and about a fifteen minute walk from Oxford street It was great being able to walk everywhere without relying on the Tube but if you wanted to use public transit you re a ten minute walk from Piccadilly 
363528,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The room was rather warm despite putting on the air conditioning , The hotel is in a great location opposite Kensington park and other amenities The rooms are clean and the shower is great 
363529,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Lite b ttre tryck i duschen har man l ngt h r r det sv rt att tv tta h ret S ngarna r bra men lite kn lig madrass Inte mycket utrymme att f rvara kl der , Trevlig personal och n ra till den vackra Hyde Park ven n ra till Paddington s man kan g med v ska fr n stationen till hotellet om man vill ven n ra till tunnelbana och buss Tar kanske 15 20min att g till Oxford street och alla aff rer som finns d r 
363530,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, i had A few issues with my stay I told the girl on checkout so in brief the pre authorisation of my card was done to include a tab account all was fine then I was told I didn t have a tab then I received letter under the door to that fact when I was checking out the nxt day anyway A few issues with cleanliness in room towel rail in bathroom but pointed it out to the staff hotel is comfortable but dated decor on corridors in rooms but that is minor tried to regulate radiator in room as was hot no knob on it to turn down a little annoying , Location was good although closest tube stop Lancaster Gate central line closed til July 
363531,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The desk staff had difficulty explaining some charges and procedures though we were able to piece things together after consultation Hotel staff were uncertain about the status of our reservation when we checked in having difficulty in calling up our reservation so I wondered about the quality of communication between the hotel and Booking com We eventually learned that the rooms were held under my colleague s name despite the fact that she had not actually made the booking , The room was quite clean and the little touches including cookies cold water ample supplies of tea and coffee were much appreciated The staff in the restaurants were excellent extremely welcoming and able to comment on the menu selections 
363532,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Room was small and tired looking Was offered upgrade but at a further charge Was not prepared to pay any more Dressing table had hairdryer fixed underneath but no mirror Only mirror was in far corner of room where there was no lighting and dryer didn t reach , Excellent location and staff very helpful and pleasant
363533,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The furniture in the room were old and quite damaged The door in the bathroom old too There was no closet Actually for those reasons it should not be a 4 stars hotel, The location was perfect and the staff was really kind 
363534,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Room was not booked somehow I do not know it was Booking com problem or the hotel s problem Fortunately I got a room But no electronicity was there Waited hotel engineer came for ten minutes in the dark room ,No Positive
363535,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Rooms were quite small especially the bathroom , Location is excellent staff were very friendly and helpful Facilities and cleanliness of rooms were really good Group of 5 of us there for my birthday weekend and card with chocolates left by hotel in my room for me which I thought was a lovely touch 
363536,Corus Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, Beautiful building and right on Hyde park Booked a standard double room a cost of 240 inc breakfast for two and apart from staff breakfast very disappointed Won t go back
363537,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The price of the drinks in the bar no orange juice left one morning at breakfast , The fluffy towels and the soft cotton sheets on the beds plenty of hot water Great location over looking Hyde Park 
363538,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Room very small tiny bathroom bed could barely fit in two people horrible window small could hear all the noise from the street made the room super cold, Location cleanliness staff we needed to store a lot of luggage that wasnt even ours for a few hours and it was not a problem
363539,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The only thing that we were disappointed with was the size of the standard bedroom It was very small but the room was very clean , We liked the position as we had booked The Opera Restaurant so was very convenient The breakfast was delicious especially as we had a window seat overlooking Hyde Park 
363540,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Maybe our room could be just a little bigger and perhaps it could have a minibar , The hotel is very comfortable the staff was amazing with us The breakfast was also great lots of options and all of them were very tasteful I guess the location is the best part just a 7 minute walk from the train subway station Paddington and right next to Hyde Park My family and I had a great time there we d definitely recommend this hotel to anyone reading this 
363541,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, I know we were next to Hyde Park and that getting a cheaper room will not be the best but the room was awful Walls were paper thin I heard everything the next room were talking about I could hear the piano two floors down through my floor and the cleaning staff were also very noisy There was a cool breeze coming through my window as well which was supposed to be sealed The lifts are awful and as soon as you step away from the foyer the carpets were old and dated so were the facilities Very disappointed as I really looked forward to my stay , Staff were pleasant and reception nice
363542,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, room was sub par worn tired there were dirty glasses and cigarettes on the steps for day there was no ramp for luggage staff really did not care except for housekeeping who did the best they could for worn out tired carpeting etc, location
363543,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The metro station right next to the hotel Lancaster Gate Station is closed until July 2017 This was not informed prior to arrival The windows are very drafty and the bed was right under the window made for some very cold nights in winter season No bathroom curtain makes for very wet floor in entire bathroom after showering , The location was great The staff was super friendly The hotel was clean through out The WIFI worked with no disconnects All in all good value for money
363544,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, the bed was too soft One small window a bit small to see the park view and it was infested with ladybirds all over window and curtains smelt heavily of bleach on arrival and smells tended to linger as no ventilation in the bathroom, location was fantastic
363545,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, There was nothing we didn t like apart from the crowded breakfast but one can hardly blame the hotel if most of the guests decided to come down for breakfast in the same timescale , Small but very comfortable room Staff very friendly and helpful Breakfast very busy and plates were short but the food was good 
363546,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The air con was a bit hot in the room 538 , Staff were friendly Close to tube station Lancaster Gate tube closed until July but only a short walk to Queensway Quick service at reception
363547,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, but the room was too small small bed for one person I m so confused how this room is called double room Too far from elevator u have to use 4 stairs after this which was not cool with bags after long day, Good location and helpful staff
363548,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The coffee machine in the room didn t work , Room was upgraded and the view was nice We got a coffee machine in the room sadly this stopped working after one cup 
363549,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Bathroom was a total joke I could not stand up Breakfast was horrible Unfriendly arrogant staff Room uncomfortable In deep China hotels are better Ridiculously expensive for such low value I belief I paid 200 euros including breakfast How could I be so stupid as I had stayed in the hotel before so I should have remembered I normally stay in Park Grand Costs lot less friendly staff and comfortable rooms Great breakfast Never ever go this hotel This kind of hotel should not exist The only reason it is still there because so many people come to London and they can get away with this kind of lousy service They are not the only ones in London I am afraid , leaving the hotel to never come back
363550,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Have never slept in such a TINY BEDROOM Even the tiny shower room didn t have a full size door Heating air con didn t work Impossible to open window Overall horrible experience , Location good Staff very helpful 
363551,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Paid for late check out but was never noted so new receptionist on duty wasn t very polite saying there was no payment it was only 10 but it should have been that she took it what I said was right and then investigate felt like we were trying to contact the hotel out of 10 for 2 extra hours pity cos all other staff and people and hotel facilities were amazing , Excellent location great concierge comfortable rooms
363552,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The air conditioning was next to useless Bathroom was tiny and if I was carrying a few more pounds I may not have fit through the door Wardrobe space was inadequate and intrusive Staff were noisy in the mornings and was woken at 8 15 on Sunday morning , The hotel has a nice atmosphere is very clean and staff are helpful 
363553,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Awful bed Miserable lady at reception Power cut in one room Radiator had no thermostat and set in off position Towel rail fell off wall in bathroom, Breakfast
363554,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Last time we had a room upgrade and that would have been nice again but you can t have everything A fridge in the room would also be handy to keep the Prosecco chilled after a hard day shopping , The location is fantastic The beds are very comfy The breakfast is delicious Staff are friendly and helpful The room was ready when we arrived even though we were there far earlier than the advertised room available time 
363555,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Not the hotels fault but the underground station near by closed while we were there Not opening until summer 2017 , Good location Friendly staff Room was larger then many European rooms we have stayed in The outside and lobby have the feel of being a higher end type hotel The rooms are average although still nice and clean 
363556,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Room quality is terrible Window is not air sealed Wall is too thin that you literally feel like sleeping in the corridor The head air condition is a lot noisier than usual which can somehow be a good source of white noise to lower the impact of corridor noise to your sleep , Location is good Pianist playing every evening at the lobby is very enjoyable 
363557,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The room is crappy small and lacy of facilities The shower didn t have hot water at first called the reception to send technicians to fix it for three times before they agree to change my room The new room was just alright This is definitely not a four star hotel , Staffs are helpful friendly and nice The dry clean is pricey but did do a fine job 
363558,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Just for note underground station Lancaster Gate is closed since 4 January 2017 till July 2017 you can use Queensway station just 700m far from the hotel , very good location you can walk to almost all lovely and interesting places in London nice hotel helpful staff near underground station
363559,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Nothing , Excellent location near Lancaster Gate tube station Oxford Street and Hyde Park The hotel was clean the staff were great and I d definitely stay again 
363560,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Room and bathroom too small too old and not really clean No sufficient tables for everyone at breakfast , Good localization near Hyde Park and metro 
363561,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Room could have been bigger However everything we needed was supplied Didnt like the empty cold drink beer cans being emptied into the recycling bin at 11 32 pm then 1154 then the last time at just gone midnight ,No Positive
363562,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Sinking bed Cracks in bath Light comes through window No plug sockets by bed Very small rooms and bathroom Had to pay extra for upgraded room , Free breakfast which was ok Friendly staff Good location 
363563,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The staff upon first entry didnt seem to have a clue We arrived at main reception and asked if there was any type of parking as online it said there was on street We were quickly told to speak to concierge staff and rushed along to find out we had to pay a further 25 for parking around the corner or pay until 6pm and move it every four hours NOT a great start Anyway greeted by a really lovely trainee after the 30 mins of faffing sorting our parking out and walking back to hotel The male on reception taught her how to sort our booking they took a down payment on a card and then gave us our room keys Our room was 1021 We walked to the lifts and saw signs that said rooms 102 208 can t remember exact numbers were this way No sign of 1021 After feeling like a right tool having to ask where it was they told us we had to go up in the lift So we set off to the lift to hop in and go up to our room Once again there were no numbers other than floor numbers in the lift So we went back again and on the fourth time at the desk they finally told us how to get to our room Arrived in our 180 executive double room to find that the bottle of bubbly i had requested also said id pay extra for if required wasn t there We also discovered that the shower drain was blocked and rather dingy We also found our bed to be a cheap clip together on wheels bed Yes the sheets duvet and pillows were nice but for 180 I expect a bed that doesn t roll away from the headboard Anyway the room was cleanish nasty view of the back of the next hotel though can t change the view in london but when you pay 180 for a room thats supposed to be the best there you d like to see hyde park or the nice front streets not poorly made bitchumen roofs and leaking lead flashing I would of paid only 110 120 for this room , I liked that lancaster gate station was literally around the corner nice and easy to find as well with a pleasant look to it 
363564,Corus Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, Check in was so easy and even though we arrived at the hotel earlier than usual check in time the receptionist was very helpful and have us checked in All was very good 
363565,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, room was smaller than average and due for redecorating , Reception desk very friendly and efficient close to underground and 15 min walk to paddington rail station 
363566,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, We were in a refurbished room the quality of the finish and fittings was very good but it wa too small The room was so narrow that there was only about a foot either side of the small double bed The bathroom was a wet room and the only place for my wife to do her makeup was in there not ideal when everything is soaking We had to remove the ironing board from the narrow wardrobe to be able to use the few hangers Not a room to spend any time than in , The staff are very good as is the breakfast 
363567,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Bar prices were crazy 5 50 for a pint which could be had for 3 50 in the pub opposite Breakfast for one 19 50 English breakfast for two in the restaurant on the corner 16 50 , staff were excellent 
363568,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The check in was very upsetting The woman who checked me in was very rude and tried to overcharge me for the room While the overcharging could be explained by a misunderstanding I felt her attitude to a client checking in was disgraceful I complained about this on checking out and the other staff were very embarrassed and apologised on behalf of the hotel , Comfortable bed Very clean I forgot a couple of things when I checked out but housekeeping were very helpful in finding these and making them ready for pick up 
363569,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The shower There was a large boxed in area above the bath where the shower was which made it very awkward to shower standing up straight if you are any taller I m 5 5 it would be even more awkward because your shoulder wouldn t even be below the offending area The mattress s twin room were quite lumpy with springs prominent at the shoulder area however the staff were very accommodating by remaking the beds with extra duvets under the bottom sheets This did help slightly but we still felt the beds could have been a little softer A little more storage space would have been nice as there was no where to store your smalls , Great location Superb breakfast Staff friendly helpful Very clean well presented In room safe is a great feature Ideal for a short stay Great value for money
363570,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The room too small for a couple No cupboard just 1 small rail needed a step ladder to get in the small bath shower bed side against the wall , Close to Tube Bus Train and Hyde Park and within walking distance of other cafes pubs and shops 
363571,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Queueing at reception to book in whilst staff stood there filing papers Perhaps they could have served customers first and then returned to their filing wet room type bathroom was uncomfortable Instructions in room for heating controls would be helpful , Location good and fitness room was a bonus
363572,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Some rooms are new decorated but some rooms are very old When we stay at hotel wifi was very problematic Hair dryer did not work , Rooms are clean helpful staj excellent location It is very closed to metro and bus stations
363573,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, shower flooded the bathroom and bottom sheet was dirty put card out to refresh room but it was not done , Sausages were good quality comfy bed good central location
363574,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The room it was ridiculously small room 621 a larger person would have struggled particularly with the shower I am small and I couldn t turn around in the shower very easily the gap between the the bed and the wall to the shower room wasn t wide enough to walk through without going sideways Didn t like the price of a large wine over 11 we avoided the bar on our 2nd night and went to the pub round the corner instead Hand held shower by the toilet very good idea but only cold water not good Need to provide more than four milk portions at least six I think, Breakfast proximity to Royal Albert Hall the staff the decor shower room was beautifully tiled very nice
363575,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The heating didnt work and it was a cold night, Arrived 20 mins early to check in at 2 room wasnt ready untill about 2 40 was a long wait but kindly the reception staff upgraded us to the executive family room and it was fantastic An amazing hotel to stay in we always go back and would highly recommended to anyone wanting to stay in london to use the corus its right by lancaster gate station perfect for getting about and hyde park on your doorstep 
363576,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, cold dirty small tired noisy This was the worst hotel weve ever stayed in outside is very deceiving to inside the room was tiny with a very small double bed the room was that small the bed was against the wall not ideal for 2 people at all the windows let in a massive draft of which I am now poorly that s to been freezing through the nights we stayed the room was very noisy it was like there was no windows at all so we didn t get much sleep the bedding was dirty the bathroom was a joke you couldn t even stand in shower because they had build it within a wall that stuck out so every time you tried to wash your hair u hit your head the bath was too small unless you was less than 5ft walls like paper so heard noisy neighbours feel absolutely ripped off not worth half what we paid when I complained and asked to move got told we had to pay to move no thanks you ve already got enough of our money never returning, nothing
363577,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The room was on the small side and the shower did not turn off I would request a larger room in future , The reception and dining area were excellent as was the service of the staff 
363578,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, On arrival although I paid in advance To include breakfast I was asked to pay again for breakfast In the morning the family members we were with were in the upstairs dining area and myself and my husband were seated down stairs ,No Positive
363579,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Shabby room The shower was too hot and it was impossible to adjust the temperature A mere look at the air filter in the bathroom was shocking It was so filthy We arrived close to midnight and asked the hotel staff to provide us with plug adapters so that we would be able to charge our phones They basically sent us off with this request telling that they do not provide this service and recommended to go shopping Luckily we did not take the breakfast option as we would have had experienced a waiting line of about half an hour to get a table Way far from a 4 star quality, Location close to a tube station
363580,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Public areas could be more comfortable It was very busy when I stayed and there wasn t enough seating room Also we had to vacate the seating area so the staff could set up for breakfast for the following morning , The location 
363581,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Booked a twin room which was very small The shower was squeezed into a corner which made it impossible to shower with ease , Fantastic location with access to local station clean and comfortable room
363582,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The rooms are to small for today s standards in a capital city The quality of beds in Twin rooms was very poor , Staff very helpful and friendly Very good location 
363583,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Shower height might be a problem my room had quite a low shower fitment ie not good if you are over 5ft 8 and a high step over into bath if you aren t tall or have children in the room , Super location and plenty of choice for buffet breakfast excellent scrambled eggs Location to underground less than 2 mins
363584,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Freezing cold draft through window so was freezing cold all night on us as bed under window very small rooms for price they charge, Bed comfy very clean
363585,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, We had a few problems on our stay and the main one being told that as the bar was still open they wouldn t do beer on room service I am still waiting to hear from the hotel on this matter so whilst my score may appear high overall I was disappointed with my stay here especially given the cost I have stayed in cheaper hotels and received better service , A few staff were excellent at their job other not so 
363586,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Poor communication tiny tiny room no biscuits with tea coffee in room no mini bar in room sent ahead extra requirements apparently they never received email Poor customer service all round , Quiet
363587,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Check in receptionist was incredibly rude Bathroom in the room was ridiculously small Double bed pushed up against a wall Not a comfortable nights sleep at all , Location
363588,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Size of room had to look at 3 rooms Ridiculously small room first Last room had torn wallpaper and unclean carpet, Location excellent beside Lancaster Gate underground
363589,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Room was too small My partner had to climb over me to get out of bed We kept bagging our legs on the leg of the bed No hot water in shower Only tepid water came out of the shower head and even then it trickled out so we couldn t shower On cold the pressure was fine The knob on the shower was broken For a 4 star hotel to have such a small room and with no hot water in the shower is shocking value for money , Position of hotel
363590,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The rooms were a little small , Great location and we were given a free breakfast for the first day Right beside Hyde park and very close to Paddington 
363591,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Small twin bedded room for single traveller Small and rather tired generally felt like a cupboard off the corridor although comfortable , Perfect location for Paddington and central London on tube
363592,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Room is narrow The bed takes all the width The head of the bed was at the window from which there was a wind I had to turn in opposite with legs to the window Quite small shower cabin but the bathroom is lovely , Location is very good Close to the gardens and the metro The reception is very nice Quick and big lifts In the evening there is live piano music Room is quite small but nice Big bed Good wardrobe a kettle with tea cups 
363593,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The lounge area is very poor more like a corridor with some seats in The only section that is quite good is the little alcove by the piano We needed lounge facilities because we were with a family member who was staying in another room We were asked to move at 9 30 pm and had to take our drinks to the seats in the corridor This was so the two men could set up for breakfast Disgraceful This should be done during the night so as not to disrupt the enjoyment of guests We decided not to order another bottle of wine and went back to our room and made tea , Location convenient for shopping in Oxford Street and Hyde Park just opposite 
363594,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Breakfast is too expensive , Great location Decent price Didn t get the best room for view unless you like alleyways and bins but it was one of the cheaper rooms Overall very good
363595,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Bed springs on single bed Room 915 were far too prominent resulting in a very lumpy Sleep needs replacing Why are single beds always up against the wall BAD , Location Iluminated bathroom light switch a good idea in the dark Front public rooms Dining room 
363596,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Couldn t control room temp from room couldn t open window toilet took ages to fill small room Reported problems to staff to get no response , Location
363597,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Breakfast staff not sure what strong tea should look like and I don t believe I had decaf coffee Allergic to caffeine and felt sick within 30 min of drinking coffee Hotel should have good decaf or individual filter decaf Pastries cold and a bit stale in texture would be better warmed throughout the breakfast time, Cooked breakfast fairly good Bonus poached eggs cooked through out breakfast and were good with a runny centre 
363598,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Rooms bathroom rather small only one tea bag each which I though was a bit mean One lift out of order so had to use the stairs Felt the bar was a bit basic more like a canteen , Excellent breakfast and hotel conveniently situated Rooms very clean Staff pleasant and helpful 
363599,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Room temperature far too high for comfortable sleeping Sash window would only open a couple of inches and this let freezing cold November air on to your head as the bed is under the window but with the peculiar sensation of your lower half still sweltering , Good location for the Heathrow express from Paddington and for Hyde Park Kensington Palace and a walk tube to Oxford Street Half board deal reasonable enough for London and the food is decent Small but comfortable room spoiled by overheating to some extent

363601,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, For 150 per night the room was extremely small and basic the shower was impeded by the ceiling which came in to the room necessitating crouching and bending to the side to enable standing under the shower Very low ceilings made it feel like I was staying in a shoe box The grandeur of the location and the public areas of the hotel do not fit with the low standard of the economy rooms I wouldn t have minded were these to actually offer economy but they were in fact extremely pricey , The location was excellent Staff were friendly and all expected facilities were in place TV Wi Fi iron shower en suite etc The breakfast was very good

363696,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, For the price the room could have been bigger and more spacious with a view, The hotel is centrally located Lancaster Stn and bus stop is 1 min walk Paddington station is 5 min walk and you have loads of eating joints eng breakfast for as little as 3 5 pounds but tea for 1 60 Will certainly stay here again 
363697,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, elevator controls are separate so you have to press both buttons and wait which one would come first rooms size is not what you d expect for the amount you ve paid for , rooms were always clean and breakfast had a good choices
363698,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, This is not the first time we stayed in the hotel and we chose it for its convenient location However this time we were put in a very small room on the attic which was too small to acccomadate 2 persons There were about 2 m2 of free space with little room for 2 persons to pass by easily Noises from the street could be heard even with the windows closed , The location is good and convenient 
363699,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The noises of the other rooms as the rooms are very close to each other and we can hear the conversation of the guests which are in the next room , I l ked the location facilties like Wifi elevators air conditioning concierge service and the staff was friendly and helpful

363709,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The room was tiny the bed was against a wall so one person has to climb over the other to get out of bed and there was no fridge minibar The shower was barely a dribble for much of the time and the water temperature was often scalding even on the lowest setting , Check in and out were quick and easy Being so close to Hyde Park was great for running and walking The hotel and room were clean and quite quiet 
363710,Corus Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, There was insufficient information in the address on the booking com confirmation and it was difficult to find I called on an international ph standing on a street corner and was put on hold forever I called a second time and got no answer at all There are two entrances and no signage No assistance with bags so I struggled up a flight of stairs and then discovered another entrance with a ramp No one assisted me The hotel is very understaffed Children playing in the corridor at night were very noisy Room was ridiculously small 
363711,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Room was small which is to be expected for bargain price Not been thoroughly cleaned previous occupants toiletries left behind , Chose this hotel for location It was also good value for London

363724,Corus Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, Location wise it was good Other then that there was nothing special about the hotel at all Rooms were small Staff seemed to operate unaware that they were in hospitality business Overall it was a 4 star hotel in name a 3 star in pricing and a 2 star at heart

363726,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The room I stayed in was very small rather tired and certainly required urgent modernisation This made the overall stay rather poor value for money , Staff were friendly 
363727,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Rates we booked via internet were NOT the rates that we paid We paid much higher rate The staff in general are NOT good almost to the point of impolite We had many arguments about breakfast booking payments incorrect allocation of room we extended the stay by one day as we had NO choice due to flight changes etc and this proved to be a mission Wete again OVERCHARGED by far for this additional day then when we got back to the Hotel in the evening they had NO RECORD of our extension so we had to do it all again and pay AGAIN It appears the Hotel MANAGEMENT is NOT on top of their game Room was not completely cleaned dirty glasses left unwashed etc We have stayed at the CORUS many times before but after this escapade will NEVER return here again , Location
363728,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Very tired There was no do not disturb to hang on the door and as a result was woken up at 8am by the cleaners The hook on the back of the bathroom door was only useful if you were 6ft tall We did the pre pay on card to use in the hotel on our room and then the bar staff told us we had to pay , Proximity to Hyde Park The Concierge was also extremely friendly and helpful
363729,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Room a bit small and without desk as per details at reservation Nitpick with Bed duvet very heavy it was summer and a heatwave while i was there , Rooms very clean newly refurbished also Staff helpful and friendly

363732,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Old room I was given a rather tattered single room worn out furniture and poor drainage in the shower Having seen the refurbished rooms however I think it would ve been a much more pleasant stay , Great location right next to the tube station 
363733,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Wine prices , The staff they couldn t have been more helpful Location to Paddington station and Hyde Park Room was good A pleasing stay overall 
363734,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Lack of storage space Poorly designed bathroom Lift capacity not sufficient for a hotel of this size especially in the mornings at breakfast check out, Good buffet breakfast Bar open till very late Shops local amenities bars and underground station virtually on doorstep
363735,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The lifts were diabolical They are renovating one of the 3 lifts but the other two seemed to have a mind of their own If you stay there don t stay on the higher floors It is frustrating , Very convenient location and the room was comfortable 
363736,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Bed size Room was very cosy The bathroom had a glass door WS staying with my friend so wasn t ideal but even if I was staying with my partner I would still want some privacy in the bathroom , Friendly staff very welcoming
363737,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, We were put in an economy double room at the same cost as the other room we had booked for our daughter she was put in a standard twin room but this was sufficient in theory given that it was a one night stay for a concert However the shower was broken the thermostat would not adjust and the water was literally scalding hot and so impossible to use Because these rooms have only a tiny hand washing basin you couldn t even use that to wash in instead The hotel were clearly aware of an issue because the front of the shower adjustment knob had obviously been removed previously in an attempt to rectify the problem Thankfully in our case we were able to go to our daughter s room two floors below to use her shower but that s immaterial given that we had paid the same rate for a room which had no washing facilities in effect If we hadn t booked a second room we would have been stuck which was pretty unsatisfactory especially as it was a hot and humid weekend Although the staff were very apologetic no offer of recompense was made Only one mug and one tea bag were provided economy pushed a step too far I think I should also mention that the shower in our daughter s standard room was extremely limited in head height she is 5ft 5 and couldn t stand up straight Would we stay again For location yes but for the room and rate no , Location for BST festival in Hyde Park is ideal lobby is lovely 
363738,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Double room was really small which is ok but bathroom too small Hard to shower when you have an inward sloping roof above you , location fantastic near to Notting Hill and opposite Kensington Gardens

363740,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Overpriced room was too small should have been a single instead of a twin and the bathroom that so tiny it was a health hazard , The location right at Hyde Park Kensington Park and only 2 min walk from the tube station
363741,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, extractor fan in bathroom didn t work so got very steamy and sink drain was very slow to go down at times view from ground floor window at rear of the building gave a lot to be desired feel it let the hotel down as it looked lovely from the front but scruffy and dirty from window But then saying that you don t sleep outside at the back of a hotel , The staff were very helpful and friendly The hotel was in a great location for what we needed beds were comfy and good amenities Nice to have tea coffee making facilities in the room Would happily stay here again 
363742,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Tried to get room service at 10 45pm on Sunday night no reply to phone calls Don t like my card being charged 30 just in case money not returned to my account for 3 5 days this was not explained fully on arrival , All the staff very friendly and helpful Great breakfast good quality bacon and sausages Clean and comfortable

363745,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Top floor was fine but lifts were slow Room was small but it did the job However the bath sink shower arrangement doesn t work Rip out the bath and the sticky taps and plugs this will give more room for a decent shower Breakfast was a disappointment Why is a poached egg like rubber 7 staff to clear a handful of tables at breakfast Plus the chef I would say a little over heavily staffed and so not needed Carpet in dining areas needs replacing Another guest was told off for opening a window All a bit embarrassing really I could not understand one of the waiters who appeared to struggle to speak I asked him twice to repeat and after the third attempt I gave up and ignored whatever he was trying to say I may have appeared rude but I could not understand him On top floor could still hear road noise so not a quiet night , Location Easy access to tube and park Room was very clean To stay in a central location at this price was reasonable Our room was ready early which was a real bonus for us Reception staff helpful and friendly 
363746,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Bathroom the smallest I ve ever had in a hotel And was a wee bit grubby round the edges could do with a freshen up , Ultra close to Hyde Park and literally steps away from Lancaster Gate tube Staff very friendly and helpful 
363747,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Lifts were always busy we often had quite a wait Our room was fairly small Drinks were expensive with a service charge added , Located close to Hyde Park and Oxford Street Our room was ready early and was clean Staff were friendly and courteous 
363748,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Rooms were close together which meant we could hear everything in the next room including loud shouting singing and screaming at 2am , Good Location
363749,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The exterior restaurant and lobby of the hotel are renovated to a much higher level than the room we were in , While the room was not big it was perfectly adequate for a few days the hotel is in a decent location and the staff are pleasant 
363750,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Whilst the bedrooms are nice they are tiny for a couple it looks like when they refitted the rooms they halved them in size would never stay here again , nice breakfast and staff

363753,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, I requested a private room to the rear of the property but it was still quite noisy with air conditioning equipment and what sounded like a glass crushing machine running The room was well equipped beds ok but pillows rock hard which made sleeping difficult , Friendly staff welcoming hotel with good choice of food offering
363754,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Rooms a little scruffy we stayed in a standard room very compact indeed im amazed the hotel managed to get all the essentials in exce, Staff friendly and helpful
363755,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The lifts Hot congested two lifts work independently of each other More lifts required If you re on a high floor at busy times it stops on each and every floor which does get annoying when its already full and when they re insanely hot , Attentive staff refurbished rooms are nice much improved on the old rooms well done location is perfect Breakfast is standard affair in terms of choice but there s loads of it

363762,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Room was small but to be expected for central London Room had a funny smell There was a used plaster stuck to the bathroom sink we didnt notice it until the next day and room service had cleaned it by the time we came back in Bar prices are steep but again to be expected in central London, The foyer and seating areas are first class Location was excellent not far from the tube and central to Hyde Park which is where we were going for a concert Staff were very good especially the bar staff and the Concierge the beds were very very comfortable Great pub next door where they do excellent food and great breakfasts at very good prices
363763,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The service was not always good enough and the morning of having breakfast downstairs there was very little of anything left which included food cutlery and bowls despite there being over half an hour of service left , The food was delicious and a lovely choice

363773,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Expensive and not quite value for money , Staff were open minded in upgrading us to a deluxe room as it was our honeymoon It was very close to a tube station and next to Hyde Park northern entrance Very central and convenient Bed was also very comfortable Breakfast was decent and good

363806,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The bed was lumpy The room was small and poorly designed There were no drawers to put clothes Water came up in the tub when the neighbors emptied their tub The worst part was the fire alarm that went off in the middle of the night No explanations or apologies were offered the next day I found this very unprofessional False alarms can happen but at least apologize and offer some kind of explanation , The best part was the location Most of the staff were friendly and helpful but not all of them 
363807,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, We didn t find the concierge very helpful atal when asked where can we have a nice meal he looked at us blankly When we asked him about theatre tickets he told us too walk to Leicester Sq We found the shower wet room very odd , Great location Lovely hotel
363808,Corus Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, This elegant townhouse offers good quality accommodation in a good location A blend that maintains traditional features of the original building with modern amenities Being just opposite Hyde Park made for pleasant outlooks and strolls yet the bustle of Oxford Street is just 15 minutes walk away

363811,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, There were three elevators and two were out of order all the time only the third one the smallest was working and could not cope with the demand in such a big hotel There was constant queuing in front of the elevators There were no pegs in the bathroom to hang the towels after use the shower was also quite outmoded fixed in one position there was no minibar in the room , The location was perfect the room was comfortably big the staff was friendly 
363812,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Bedroom decor and furnishings were tired bath base dirty carpets stained bed uncomfortable temp of room no bottled water in room available , Location close to the event I was attending
363813,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The view we had was of a wall if we stood on our toes we could see some sky The bathroom was nice but the water preasure in the room was terrible and only just enought to wash off any shampoo or soap that you d put on Even the preasure in the taps was very poor Wasn t to keen on the housekeeping staff that decided to knock the door at just gone 9am to ask when we were leaving even though it was a mid day checkout Otherwise it did what it said on the tin and gave us somewhere to sleep and not to expesive either , The location of the Hotel was just amazing right across the road from Hyde Park and only a 25 30 minute walk to the centre of London The staff were amazing friendly and helpful except the housekeeping the room was clean and tidy 
363814,Corus Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, We have stayed in the single rooms before and found the Executive Twin to be the better room for my sister and I it faced onto the road and park but we were not bothered by noise I agree some rooms have been small and need updating but for a short stay they are adaquate We were happy with the staff and facilities the food and organisation had improved a great deal since last year when I did complain about a member of staff and the evening meal my complaint was treated sympathetically at that time Our 2 night stay in March was our 5th visit and we choose to eat our evening meal in which was delicious and we will continue to use the hotel for future visits to London Lovely location bus around the corner staff who are willing to help with directions we were more than happy Thank you

363816,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Room size was tiny Lift wait times were crazy Decorating in the hotel resulted in paint smells in the corridors Bathroom facilities were similar to a motel , Excellent breakfast spread Very close to Underground station
363817,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, wet room It had the basin almost under the shower which meant that you had to stand on the wet floor to wash your hands Even if you had shoes on you would take wet footprints into the room I am sure other wet rooms I have been in have not had this problem , Bel Canto Opera evening

363820,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The dinner ordered Thai food in restaurant Chicken was disgusting in both the starter and main course Cannot understand why you would not use chicken breast in dishes Was definitely thigh leg chicken so neither starter or main course could be eaten , Location of hotel was brilliant easy access on underground to Westfield Shopping center and Oxford Circus 
363821,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, I would not recommend staying there overpriced The walls are thin you can hear everything that is going on in your neighbours rooms and bathrooms and when someone is in the corridor Around 7am every morning we were woken because of the traffic outside not a street facing room with vendors coming in with supplies and also people walking with their suitcases The rooms are small poorly decorated and not 4 star worthy No storage in the bathroom Problems with plumbing the toilet barely flushed and after taking a bath the drainage broke For two people staying in the room toiletries were only for one important if you are travelling with hand luggage The slowest elevator I have ever been in There was a lingering smell in the whole hotel of some kind of cleaning product that reminded me of a pool but there was no pool During our check out noone seemed to be interested if we enjoyed our stay , The location was good close to a tube station and hyde park across the street 
363822,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Bath Shower is very high and needs agility to enter and exit Should replace with walk in showers Rooms are small but that is typically of all London hotels at that price level so was no surprise , Location was great Beside a major underground station We walked straight across the park to the museums Very pleasant Staff are really nice and helpful

363856,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Breakfast was not included in the price and extremely expensive , The location is excellent just few steps away from the tube and the bus stops Just one minute away from Hyde park Nice restaurants nearby Staff was friendly the room was tidy The hotel is undergoing a renovation so things look very new 
363857,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, the bedlights to high up disturping the companion if one wanted to seel and the other read the lobby and bistro bar decor is pretty poor in style kind of lost in time, the coffeemaker and coffee in the room the bed and duvey the bathroom
363858,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The rooms were shabby compared to the price I have been in same type of rooms in London for half the price this was dissapointing If the price had been the halv of what we paid the room would have been nice For that price breakfast should be included , Staff very welcoming nice and seviceminded Good reception area 
363859,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Staff were not helpful specially on the concierge side the place needs complete renovation I stayed in this hotel many times in the past and hotel standard was good but I don t think will do it again , Location
363860,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Ground floor was not a wise choice by us with building work going on outside and room was not as good as Travelodge But prices in this convenient area are consistently high , Convenient for Paddington and Hyde Park Helpful staff

363864,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The hotel is old and in reality looks much more worn off than in the pictures the rooms are small and our room s view were piles of garbage in the hotel back yard I find this unacceptable for the price paid per night , Good internet
363865,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Was given a basement room and told we would be moved the next day but nothing was properly arranged and poor communication They wanted to move us at 5pm which I didn t see the point by then so ended up staying in original room which was very small and awful view of rubbish and laundry trollies outside , Location and bed was very comfortable
363866,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Very small room impossible to open window completely dirty window small bathroom why is it 4 hotel quite old equipment, Location is almost perfect polite and helpfull staff suitable for one or max two nights stay

363869,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, the bathroom was indeed small particularly the bath shower nevertheless and because I almost did not book the hotel thanks to other comments nagging about this I have to say that it is not that bad , exceptional location next to tube and buses and 20 min walk to oxford str clean and confy room
363870,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Rooms are quite aged Curtain nets were almost black with dirt, Hit and miss thia hotel Sometimes you get a nice clean quiet room Other times you get a dirty noisy room on the lower floors The staff have no interest in helping if you get one of the latter
363871,Corus Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, Probably the most helpful staff for a hotel in Hyde Park We went at an extremely busy time however the staff were not phased by this an were very efficient Always greeted you with a smile Which is contagious

363874,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Old fashioned design of the lobby and rooms Room and bathroom were small We tried to open the window and it looked to the yard where restaurant s ventilation was fiited So it was not fresh air but smell of fish chips Overpriced hotel for such poor confort Would not stay here again , Place close to Kensington park 1 min to Metro station

363878,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The bathroom door should be replaced as it is tatty at the bottom not something I expect from a listed 4 hotel A couple of pictures on the walls would make it more homely Breakfast outrageously expensive Paying a pound to weigh luggage seems outdated and a trifle mean , The room was comfortable fairly bland but nicely decorated and well seviced by the friendly staff

363880,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, The service at breakfast would benefit from being a little more organised with guests being met and seated as they enter the breakfast room and tea coffee toast being arranged without having to wait or to ask, I frequently use this hotel for business trips often staying on my own There s always a nice friendly atmosphere at this hotel which makes me feel comfortable 
363881,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Elevators were slow and not enough for amount of guests Hotel in general smelt bad and had a very tired interior Room smelt particularly bad damp and other unsavoury smells , Location was great

363884,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, Short staffed at the desk Difficult to get calls from friends in England and abroad I understand that at one point there were two persons on front desk with full hotel etc Perhaps the need for person to deal with calls only hotel is full, Absolutely splendid breakfast helpful staff especially in the dining room

363894,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, We were on aware the exterior was under renovation so the whole of the outside of the hotel had scaffolding up We and our friends had the smallest bedrooms imaginable barely 8 foot across the bed was squashed against a wall which meant one of us had to climb over the other to get in or out The tiniest ensuite barely larger than a cupboard with bifold doors on the smallest shower I have ever seen anyone above average size would not be able to get into it At breakfast despite asking for toast twice having seen all the other tables being given it we were brought some 20 mins later as we got up to leave Also the tables were so close together you could not avoid pushing part of your anatomy in somebody s face as you tried to get to the food, The hotel decor was good and extremely clean

363900,Corus Hotel Hyde Park, I was taken aback by the size of the room I have seen larger cupboards The room itself was shabby and the shower room toilet was impossibly small to share The bed was wedged into the room meaning there was no room to get out of bed on one side We had no time to complain or request a room change as the queues at reception on our way out were considerable Not a good experience at all The public areas of the hotel were ok but the room was not value for money at all ,No Positive
