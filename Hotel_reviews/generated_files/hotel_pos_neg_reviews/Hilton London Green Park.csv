337298,Hilton London Green Park, Hotel is looking tired as compared to a few years ago If you have a room at the front of the hotel it is extremely noise at night We hardly got any sleep Would be nice for the hotel to offer hot chocolate as well as tea and coffee in the rooms , Location was good Very central to attractions 
337299,Hilton London Green Park, We had an Executive twin room but there was only one easy chair and no small occasional table There was a problem with the television it did not work at all while we were there The lighting in the room was poor for reading The Welcome Tray was meagre no hot chocolate option and no biscuits Ther was a large crack in the wash basin We reported problems to the staff a refund was not possible but they said they would put loyalty points on our friend s card who were staying with us at the hotel Very, The position was great near Green Park but off the main road so little traffic noise The breakfast was very good with a lot of choice The foyer was nice and light and spacious

337312,Hilton London Green Park,No Negative, A great location however the decor and feel of the hotel was not as high as would be expected of the area howver overall due to location it would not prevent me booking again 
337313,Hilton London Green Park, The room was very small although described as delux double the coffe tea facilities are antiquated please who has Nescaf sachets The bed was comfortable but the pillows and cover were of a poor standard The picture on the wall was banal no slippers or robes Step in bath with shower head felt dated , Location of the hotel is fantastic the staff are extremley helpful 
337314,Hilton London Green Park, We had booked a deluxe king room and paid 258 I can only presume that we were paying for location because we have stayed in far nicer rooms for far less The bed was king sized but the room definitely wasn t bed wardrobe dressing table TV bathroom all very basic no chairs and definitely no extra space so not sure what the deluxe part was A bit disappointing to be honest , The Tiger Brasserie was very good excellent food and service We ate dinner and breakfast in here and couldn t fault it All the staff in the hotel were great really polite and helpful 
337315,Hilton London Green Park, Was asked if I wanted an early morning call which I did but I didn t get one Good job I woke myself as I had an appointment As I was getting dressed a maid walked into my room NO knock prior she just barged in I had to shout at her to get out I then heard the same thing happen on the other side of the corridor I found it frustrating that I couldn t open the windows very wide at all more as it was very hot that night I left feedback on the notepad in the room so these comments SHOULD have already been logged I also mentioned it as I left the hotel in the morning The hair dryer didn t work properly The carpet was very old worn and looked dirty I would have liked a mini bar in the room , The bathroom was large and the bed was comfy Staff friendly but didn t deliver 
337316,Hilton London Green Park, The first night I burnt my hand on a light fitting I reported it but was never fixed managed rest of time without, Very basic but did not expect to much for the money we played Lots of untrained staff so some slow service 
337317,Hilton London Green Park, The room if they consider the room we had to be deluxe I would hate to see a non deluxe one The room was cramped and sloped downhill It is very overpriced for what you get , Location and friendly staff
337318,Hilton London Green Park, The room was very warm and the bathroom had steps up to it from the room which was a bit difficult for my grandmother to use The room could do with updating as there were quite a few stains on the carpet and chairs , The breakfast was nice and staff were very friendly 
337319,Hilton London Green Park, Link doors meant you could hear the occupants of the next room quite clearly , Comfy bed Spacious bathroom Delicious breakfast fresh omelette was delicious
337320,Hilton London Green Park, Room could have been freshened up a bit and no view at all , The location is definitely a huge bonus with this hotel Staff are friendly and efficient room is comfortable albeit looking a little tired in places 
337321,Hilton London Green Park, size of room this room was a single room don t remember asking for this have always had better size rooms and expect more from hilton, no breakfast included was offered this at an extra cost which is too exhorbitant for the cost
337322,Hilton London Green Park, The bed was solid very uncomfortable The rate was Deluxe double there was nothing deluxe about the room the D cor was pretty dated the TV was old by modern standards , Location
337323,Hilton London Green Park, On entering breakfast room we were asked for room number validation the two of us couldn t sit at table for four but one woman later could Weren t told what to do on entering until the last day Don t know what facilities there are or if there is a charge nothing mentioned The room was very basic nothing special which I expected at the Hilton so I wouldn t stay there again Room was also slightly noisy with heating or ventilation View from the back window was unpleasant , Orange juice was excellent Breakfast great choice Most of the staff were friendly and professional 
337324,Hilton London Green Park, The rooms are scruffy and the furnishings would be more suited to a youth hostel Prepare to be disappointed , The location is good and bar area is quite plush 
337325,Hilton London Green Park, The bed The tea tray, The bed was really hard and ended up with a bad back not enough on tea tray needs more variety i am head house keeper in a hotel and we have more in our small hotel staying in the hilton i thought would have been more luxurious for the money
337326,Hilton London Green Park, 1 broken ceiling light bulb fixed 2 broken bathroom extractor fan not fixed 3 broken standard lamp fixed 4 loose panel to bath not fixed 5 poor TV reception 6 lack of fridge, Friendly Staff
337327,Hilton London Green Park, The stay was too short , Excellent location on a quiet street but within a walking distance from the busy centre and Green Park station just around the corner Very friendly and helpful staff made us feel welcome confortable and willing to came back We had access to free wifi which worked very well 
337328,Hilton London Green Park, Hi I recently booked a room with the Hilton green park for me and my wife for my wife s birthday mr s and mrs b lambert we stayed in room 248 I paid 203 for the room which I was ok with as it is the Hilton hotel until I entered my room it was small undecorated the right hand blind did not shut properly So we had to put items of clothing in way to give us privacy also when entering the bathroom was disappointed at the size and also the shower in the bath not separate when I used it the shower head was cut into the ceiling stopping it from moving it up you have to lean forward to get under the water there was no shower curtain so the bathroom got flooded so it was a disappointment for me and my wife but will say that the staff where very friendly and also placed a birthday cake in our room when we returned to the hotel which I would like to say thankyou the restaurant was fabulous but the room was a big disappointment for my wife s birthday, The staff friendly the food excellent
337329,Hilton London Green Park, Room a little small and lacking ventilation plus we had a slight challenge obtaining hypoallergenic pillows That s it , Excellent staff couldn t do enough for us Superb location Lovely breakfast and nice atmosphere in bar area Good value for central London
337330,Hilton London Green Park, Our toilet seat was broke window sill in bathroom was dirty and had hairs on room wasn t like in photos was very small and compact TV was probably from early 2000s not what you expect in a Hilton hotel Seems small but some of the typical hotel freebies were empty Outside of hotel was hard to spot and flags looked incredibly worn and dirty again nothing like the photos , Liked the reception decor and the location was good for the trip 
337331,Hilton London Green Park, The room was past its best worn and old and a poor view of back yards and a demolished building Only worth half of what we paid , Breakfast good selection 
337332,Hilton London Green Park, The first room they put us in was shocking Cracked bathroom ceiling full of mould and there was an extension lead plugging in one of the lamps For a deluxe double we were not happy We requested we moved rooms to one that was advertised on booking com which was what we should of been in originally this was better bathroom still Not great cleaners don t come until around 5 30 6 pm just as your trying to get ready to go out for your evening meal so our room Didn t get cleaned When I asked for more toilet roll the cleaner didn t have a clue what I was going on about until I went and got one to show her Breakfast was below average would of rather of stayed in a premier inn , Location was good
337333,Hilton London Green Park, I spent two nights there The first night I was in a room with a heavy smell of smoke I told the staff and they changed me to a different room for the second night which was very nice , The bed is very comfortable and the size of the room is pretty spacious for that location The staff is excellent 
337334,Hilton London Green Park, The size of the room although comfortable was quite small and the lighting in both the room and bathroom was poor Not great for getting ready for a night out , I really liked the choice at breakfast the location of the hotel the attitude of the staff and the niffy makeup mirror and hairdryer located within the desk in our room 
337335,Hilton London Green Park, Paid for a double room was put into a room that looked like an attic asked to be moved and was put into a single room after paying for double they said they would give me complimentary breakfast but I had already paid for breakfast will never stay here again, Nothing
337336,Hilton London Green Park, Check in was very slow and not up to date on our booking had to show our written confirmation of breakfast at first on check out they tried to charge for food and drink that had already been paid for Disabled facilities were o k but door opening was poor and there was a small ramp disabled bedroom very convenient but poorly lit and not as de luxe as I would have expected with no aids suppport in the room Bathroom disability facilities good except sink very small and unprotected sill area where it was easy to lose things which were then difficult to recover , very good bar food service Good breakfast Good disabled entrance and bathroom facilities 
337337,Hilton London Green Park, The facilities are showing their age Concierge was not attentive when booking my car to Heathrow He booked it for the wrong time , Very good location in Mayfair
337338,Hilton London Green Park, One of the beds were creaky, Room was clean staff were friendly location was very good and breakfast excellent Yes the rooms are a bit basic in decor but have everything you could need for a night away 
337339,Hilton London Green Park, Nothing really One small thing was we did not have any bath robes in our room But the room itself was exelent and I m just being piccy, The Staff here were amazing really could not do enough to help you Also the receptionist made sure that there was a lovely treat in our room for my girlfriends birthday Was so nice and felt so welcome that we actually stayed and had a drink in the hotel instead of going out For a Mayfair hotel the drinks and food is very resonably priced as well
337340,Hilton London Green Park, No magnifying mirror No mini Bar No turn down Breakfast below average TV quality like something out of 1950 Uncomfortable mattress Poor shower , Pillows ok Bar staff great as were all the staff we met 
337341,Hilton London Green Park, the rooms were very small and out dated it felt more like a 2star rather than a 4 star also the floor all creaked the bed was uncomfortable and we could hear the underground train from our room at night don t stay on the ground floor if your a lite sleeper staff were friendly breakfast was great only thing was the rooms were poor ,No Positive

337345,Hilton London Green Park,No Negative, We stayed here after my wife s work party which is 2mins walking distance from Green Park Station great place to stay near Hyde Park room was clean spacious and comfortable Breakfast buffet option was impressive Highly recommend it 
337346,Hilton London Green Park, I am currently sitting in my room at this supposed 4 star hotel after managing to scrap together a measly 3 hour sleep My husband and I treated ourselves to a one night getaway as we were attending his works party nearby and the reviews of the Hilton looked perfect They couldn t have been more wrong There is nothing about this place to suggest a 4 star rooms are small the shower is average and worst of all I may as well have had the whole hotel to stay in my bed the amount of noise that one could hear I specifically requested a quiet room and yet they placed us on the ground floor opposite a busy road I was woken by deliveries rattling towards the hotel rubbish deliveries beeping outrageously as my morning alarm and the people upstairs crashing their thunderous feet every 5 seconds No soundproofing whatsoever I have paid 150 pounds for my worst one night sleep in a hotel I have ever had Should have booked a travelodge ,No Positive
337347,Hilton London Green Park, Door to bathroom wouldn t close lock Lamp was broken tv was broken Towel rail was hanging off the wall in the bathroom Kept being woken up due to strange noise coming from lift air con wasn t sure , The location was great 
337348,Hilton London Green Park, Our room on the first floor was a bit tired but adequate The bathroom basin was cracked and one of the light bulbs was out The TV was very poor with few channels available and a terrible picture , The location of the hotel is very good for Mayfair Piccadilly and the Underground etc The check in desk staff and breakfast were very good 
337349,Hilton London Green Park, The hotel had an odd smell about it in the public areas Room was tired and very hot , Breakfast was good a self service buffet although glasses were in short supply I was able to check in early which was very helpful Location is this hotels strongest point 
337350,Hilton London Green Park, The rooms are small and the hotel is a bit dated , Wonderful location in a beautiful area and close to Green Park station Great staff Rooms comfortable and clean Great breakfast 
337351,Hilton London Green Park, Location is excellent The shower was broken clock showed the wrong time the room was very hot without possibility to regulate the temperature Did not look like Hilton stuff was friendly ,No Positive
337352,Hilton London Green Park, The hotel is visibly old on the inside not all rooms are renovated The bathrooms are old and not comfortable to use small sinks leaky taps etc Breakfast buffet could be much better Overall wouldn t stay here again, Great location friendly staff
337353,Hilton London Green Park, Rooms could get a fresh coat of paint Carpets in hallways to rooms should be updated, Staff is very professional and friendly Great location in Mayfair Small enough that it feels like a boutique hhotel even though part of a large chain
337354,Hilton London Green Park, Where to start rooms in desperate need of repair and fresh coat of paint bed the most uncomfortable I have ever tried to sleep in basically hard back ached each morning and extremely tired as couldn t sleep had I booked more than 2 nights would have moved out lighting ridiculously dim toilet had no windows no fan and door on spring to keep it shut if sitting on toilet needed arms 6 feet long to reach toilet paper no suitable mirror lighting to put make up on Basically extremely uncomfortable stay Would not stay there again or recommend it Shame as location good , Location good and staff friendly 
337355,Hilton London Green Park, We booked online didn t know that each room is different in hotel so one might get a different size room than one in your party even though you booked the same kind of room an there is BIG differences in size since rooms are smaller in size anyways in Europe , The staff very helpful an nice The morning breakfast offered with our room was also very good
337356,Hilton London Green Park, THE ROOMS A LITTLE TIRED WITH STAINS ON THE CARPETS I GUESS THE FAULT OF PREVIOUS CARELESS GUESTS BREAKFAST WAS EXCELLENT, THE STAFF WERE FRIENDLY AND OBLIGING
337357,Hilton London Green Park, I wrote a review already about the bathroom issue and room issue plus the flooring making sound I am doing this one again as I missed out the part to add how great the staff were so the property needs a bit of maintenance , The Staff were great and location 
337358,Hilton London Green Park, OUR BATHROOM WAS HORRID AND SCRUFFY BITS MISSING OFF THE TAP WINDOW COVERED IN BLACK MILDEW CRACKED TILES AND MILDEW AROUND BTH i DID point this out to staff they offered to move us but having had breast surgery the week before the thought of moving was too much The mirror from the tipup dressing table was missing the curtains which were new had not been hung properly and husband did the needful there Just overall needing a good spring clean from net curtains in windows to carpets All in all we were both very disappointed We returned to our room at 13 30 and it had not been freshened up or beds made I did complain about that and it was rectified pretty quickly When we returned to our room at 2300 hours on Tuesday night a bottle of wine and some strawberries had been left with an apology but we returned the wine as were flying home and neither could we drink it late or carry it I am not normally a complainer but I felt had visitors from abroad come to this room they would have left this island with a pretty poor view , Location and breakfast both good
337359,Hilton London Green Park, Staff which serves breakfast isn t fast enough any time visiting them twice a year they do not attend me as perfect as it might be No coffee on time , Nice room perfect location generic Hilton services Liked reception staff they do have now Russian speaking person which is a plus Free adaptors eligible concierge service All is nice
337360,Hilton London Green Park, The rooms are awful during our 3 night stay we changed rooms 4 times trying to stay in one that would be better than the previous one Without success The rooms are not ventilated at all windows cannot be opened and full of black fungi on ceiling and walls both in bathroom and bedroom The entire hotel needs very urgently full renovation everything is run down dirty and very poorly maintained The rooms have cracks in all walls badly cracked paint inside and outside wooden cracking floors no noise isolation at all Old fashioned analogue TVs Rooms are awfully decorated sofas and curtains full of stains very cheap furniture insufficient lighting in both bath and bedroom We paid 300 Euros per night for this mess a real shame , The location is excellent in the heart of Mayfair After 2 days of complaints we demanded a talk with the hotel manager She eventually compensated us and refunded 1 3 of the room rate 
337361,Hilton London Green Park, The room was very very small and required maintenance due to infiltrations For the value paid for didn t match my expectations Hilton can do much better , Location and breakfast
337362,Hilton London Green Park, Didn t like the fact that my room was located on the first floor and could hear every single car travelling down the street whilst I was trying to sleep , Location was excellent for us short walk from green park station 
337363,Hilton London Green Park, We ve stayed this same weekend 2nd weekend of December Friday thru Monday for 12 years plus It s always been a highlight to turn into Half Moon Street and be greeted with the hotel s lovely Christmas Decorations along the railings and entrance This year nothing Even inside looks as though the least possible has been done for the season so that clearing away on 12th night is kept to the minimum Such a pity as it s a dull street particularly as the building next door is neglected and boarded up At least as our room faced Flemings Hotel we benefited from the view of their outside Christmas trimmings I asked three members of staff and no one knew why although I was told they had a new housekeeper Someone needs to let him her know that somethings little things can really make a difference , Bed very comfortable Good breakfast no queues Great staff Perfect location for Mayfair Hyde Park New bond street theatres 
337364,Hilton London Green Park, The state of the bathroom was shocking I stay at Hilton hotels all over the world and I have never seen such poor standard of a room will never be staying at this hotel again ,No Positive
337365,Hilton London Green Park, Rooms a bit small and very warm so had window open but could hear people outside having a cigarette in alley way below my window , Great selection for breakfast Could leave bags when we checked out so we didn t have to go shopping with suitcases Handy location 
337366,Hilton London Green Park, This is definitely not a 4 star hotel It is the worst Hilton I have ever stayed at and I am surprised that the brand has such a hotel The carpets the wall paper and the furniture is just falling apart The reception and restaurant desk personal is not helpful at all Consierge personel is however very helpful The shower and the TV are from the last century There is a really bad smell in the hotel For breakfast be prepared to have about 15 persons waiting for a table in front of you ,No Positive
337367,Hilton London Green Park, TV didn t work correctly and had to address twice with reception staff before it was fixed , have stayed before and liked the hotel and the location breakfast was better this time was allocated a ground floor room which wasn t a problem but obviously designed for disabled person which we didn t need 
337368,Hilton London Green Park, room was small bed was well used and springs were slightly collapsed on one side I did point this out to reception in the morning, the hotels position the staff and the food were good
337369,Hilton London Green Park, Room size , Breakfast was excellent great choice and lots of it Room was very small compared to most we have stayed in around the same area and price bracket Location could not be better 
337370,Hilton London Green Park, Room carpet looked old stained sink was cracked water very slow running away in sink bath room small didn t think we got a deluxe room plus we asked to have early check in we were kept waiting, Found staff very helpful food was very good plenty to choose from hotel very clean
337371,Hilton London Green Park, Whole hotel looks tired Room was very poor Carpet very old Chair had torn seat Not the quality I expected from a Hilton , Handy location for attending a dinner at Grosvenor Square

337376,Hilton London Green Park, Toilet seat was broken Standing lamp in the room didn t work Ordered breakfast to our room the following morning it was cold not very good quality Went to the bar in the hotel the next day before we went out for dinner for our anniversary we were the only people at the bar yet we didn t get served for 10 mins as staff walked backwards forwards behind the bar ignoring us not saying a word to us Then when we finally did get someone to serve us he couldn t find a bottle opener to open the wine we ordered as we sat there waiting for a further 10 mins without any drinks We ended up leaving with no drinks after 20 mins of waiting so we could make our dinner reservation Considering how much it costs 200 to stay for the night it was a shambles ,No Positive
337377,Hilton London Green Park, Outdated TV shower curtain not fitted properly resulting in water running everywhere bathroom facilities not fully replenished on arrival creeky floorboards, Location excellent staff were very accommodating

337380,Hilton London Green Park, Hairdryer cold only Shower leaked water reducing power Tiny room no view and noisy backing on to pub at rear Old tv Overall room 141 was old and dated for a hotel in Mayfair , Great breakfast
337381,Hilton London Green Park, Room was poorly maintained vents hanging off bathroom door didn t lock and general shabbyness There was also a generator next to the hotel also the windows only opened an inch and was difficult to open , It was in a good location and near a tube station They sorted the vents out without a fuss 
337382,Hilton London Green Park, Room looking tired old building so creaky floors unavoidable sink with large crack in it should be replaced as it is a health risk didnt complain as they wouldnt have replaced in a couple of days curtains hanging off runners which we fixed or the bright spot lights outside shine through quite a busy street so can be noisy with the traffic Good if you want to get up early No attention to detail in regards to housekeeping ,No Positive
337383,Hilton London Green Park, The bar prices will make your eyes water It is Mayfair but the premium charged is difficult to justify , Within 100m of Piccadilly and Green Park but in a quiet side street 
337384,Hilton London Green Park, The rooms were very disappointing Deluxe is not Deluxe as I would expect Rooms were shabby and tired The bathrooms were nice and looked refurbished but no little extra touches A memorable stay but not for the right reason, The location was ideal for us as it was close to The Dorchester where we were attending an event
337385,Hilton London Green Park, Concierge was never there when we needed assistance furniture in our room was damaged room location was poor given long advanced reservation, The restaurant breakfast and staff were very good everything else sucks

337389,Hilton London Green Park, The hotel felt a bit run down stain on carpet in room creaky floors Furniture not very nice poor quality for what I expected from the Hilton The mirror was on awful hinges in school desk type thing Kettle was secured to a tray but the cable to plug it in too short to reach socket had to move everything to put it on closed mirror top , Good location comfortable bed Nice breakfast once the staff had cleared a table for us to sit at 
337390,Hilton London Green Park, As we only stayed for 1 night nothing to improve on , Central location ideal as we were attending my daughter s wedding in Mayfair Very attentive staff 
337391,Hilton London Green Park, I booked a luxury double and was given what can only be described as a functional twin I was there two nights but my room wasn t cleaned during my stay , Central location was great Breakfast was very good value 
337392,Hilton London Green Park, Bit shabby Mould like stain on bathroom ceiling and door looked like it had had a very bad re paint The corridor smelt like someone had been sick , Location great for St James Palace and Queens Theatre
337393,Hilton London Green Park, Rooms were a little tired decor wise, Location is perfect to get to main attractions by foot we found some great eateries tucked on the side roads leading to Regent St
337394,Hilton London Green Park, Windows that can be opened for fresh air in our room the Windows could not be opened and I did request this as were painted over safe did not work, The breakfasts are very good the staff are very nice and very helpful we as usual enjoyed our stay
337395,Hilton London Green Park, To be fair we arrived early but were told we had a room which would be ready in an hour Had lunch and returned to the desk to find that our room had been given to someone else and although I had requested a room near the lift we were given one as far away as it was possible to have There were also steps to negotiate with no support The aircon broke down no explanation given in our room nor a fan On our enquiry we were told the whole of the 2nd floor aircon was broken They then offered a fan On our arrival only a trainee receptionist was on duty serving all 4 desks and the concierge desk Not good management We did get a reduction after asking for it but will not return , The girl behind the bar in the evening 
337396,Hilton London Green Park, Nothing Everything was great , Everything was really high quality fantastic location and very reasonably priced for London I ll definitely stay again 
337397,Hilton London Green Park, Beds very hard and squeaky no sound proofing I think we had a heard of elephants in the room above us Cheap loo roll, Breakfast excellent Bathrooms very clean
337398,Hilton London Green Park, The second time we came back to Hikton after five days in Paris we were surprised that our room was so much smaller than the first one given us before our Paris trip, Its proximity to everything n the very courteous and friendly staff specially people in the concierge
337399,Hilton London Green Park, The room was a bit small and the TV didn t work very well kept cutting out The lighting was bad for getting dressed hair etc , The location could not have been more central for our visit fabulous The concierege was extremely helpful 
337400,Hilton London Green Park, We were dissapointed with the room It was very small There was no plug in the wash basin We would have paid more but we were given this room described as luxury and expected something better The hotel is fine But not the room, Breakfast very good
337401,Hilton London Green Park, Only negative was our room opposite another hotel that had a generator for their kitchen it went off at 10pm but came on at 6am I thought I would sleep through the noise but it was very noisy so was awake early Staff had offered us the day before to change rooms but they had gone to so much trouble with the room Re swans petals we didn t want to cause any problems, It was our wedding anniversary there were 2 swans made out of towels on the bed with rose petals made my wife extremely happy Staff went the extra mile for us 
337402,Hilton London Green Park, I didn t like the fact that when I wrote an email complaining about my stay I didn t even get a response out of courtesy below if what I wrote in my email I did tell them I didn t want to write a bad review To whom it may concern Last Wednesday 3rd August I took my boyfriend for a stay at your hotel for his birthday Upon arrival we were informed that we had been upgraded from a Deluxe room to a Deluxe plus we thought to ourselves how lucky are we This was short lived as I was then told that there was to be a 50 deposit taken from my card which I didn t know had to happen before I arrived In hindsight this is not a problem but I have never had money taken off a card before at any hotel before and this includes other Hiltons that I have stayed in I have only ever had a copy of a card taken We then went down to our room which were most shocked to find a tiny dingy room with no natural light at all due to be two meters from another building It was also freezing when we walked in and we had to put the temperature right up from 16 to 26 to rectify this The bed was extremely creaky and really uncomfortable also In the bathroom the sink was blocked so any time you ran the tap it filled the sink right up and wouldn t drain for at least an hour Anyway we went out for our meal and came back to our room to sleep In the middle of the night around 3am we woke up absolutely profusely sweating because the temperature had not gone down like we had selected when we got back in we turned it back down from 26 to 20 when we got in at 9 30 So we tried to turn it down waited as it suggested and no luck We tried to turn it off and waited but no the hot air was still blasting out This would have been okay but you don t have any access to open a window and let a breeze in other than a small crack This reminds me the view from the Deluxe plus room Room 34 ground floor left a lot to be desired , Breakfast was good Location was good
337403,Hilton London Green Park, Oh how we wished for a room with a view It was the only but , Great customer service an asset to Hilton The Front desk staff were very efficient We were particularly impressed by the decisive leadership of Ms Harkiran Sidhu in dealing with crisis situations supported by Rovena Brazaityte Martina Menegazzo and Richard the concierge 
337404,Hilton London Green Park, The price but it is central London and perfect for the finish of the ride, Stayed during the prudential 100 ride with bikes and hotel was very accomadating
337405,Hilton London Green Park,No Negative, Great location as on quieter street just off Green Park Perfect as a base to go exploring from Room size was comparable with other hotels in this price range location Reasonable choice for breakfast 
337406,Hilton London Green Park, The only thing I would say is the price was a bit high but the wife wanted to stay here we have stayed at other hotels just as good but slightly cheaper there was no wow factor for the price but still had a lovely stay, All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and we came back from lunch to a bottle of wine and a lovely note in the room as it was out wedding anniversary
337407,Hilton London Green Park, Noisy other guests woken at 4 30am with people in room above stomping about and sounded like moving furniture around Went on for over an hour , Staff nice and breakfast good Location good very handy for getting into central London 
337408,Hilton London Green Park, The rooms were absolutely outrageous The downstairs area of the hotel certainly does not match the rooms Our room had stains over the carpet in various patches scratches on the doors and walls where the paint work had came off and to top it off A pubic hair on the bathroom wall near the door Clearly it had not been cleaned properly and this was pretty evident The cleanliness was so poor which was such a disappointment as the downstairs area of the lobby is lovely , The staff were very welcoming We only stayed at this hotel as we booked in to the restaurant The lobby area is nice and I would highly recommend visiting the restaurant Also the breakfast was lovely and a fabulous location 
337409,Hilton London Green Park, For value for money there isn t much we would say we didn t like , Staff were friendly and helpful Location was awesome short walk to many key locations attractions Underground etc 
337410,Hilton London Green Park, the rooms are very smal and not well desighned and old some the door of the bathroom infront the bed the way between rooms has many stairs up and down so it is difficult for who has a child trolly alittle of tv chanells its location good just at day because of its closet to green park and walk to other attraction but at night the district is quite alittle of resturants you have to walk, there is a tesco supermarket 3minutes walk staff is very kindly and helpful the hotel is not consider a 4star i excepte it better i give him 3star
337411,Hilton London Green Park, Horrible hard and uncomfortable bed The view from the window se photo was like in the slums in the bad part of Rio Brazil Shower was filthy , Breakfast was excellent The staff was very helpfull 
337412,Hilton London Green Park, Room was very small carpet was torn I asked for bigger and better room got king room next day Rooms not at level of 4 stars hotel, Staff was nice breakfast was good
337413,Hilton London Green Park, I never fail to be disappointed when I stay here which I do now and again because of the location The rooms are small and the staff usually seem disinterested I was given a very small room overlooking a brick wall with curtains not properly hanging down from the windows All was grim I requested another room and eventually was given a slightly bigger one I was also given a free coffee while I waited for 30 mins for the room to be made ready but not offered this at the start I feel the rooms for the price not cheap are substandard The room I had had a mouldering wall and hairs which were not mine in the bathroom You are charged 2 00 if you want the bottled water in the room no biscuits and I ve had better selections of teas in B B s The cooked buffet breakfast was not hot , It s a great location for the Royal Academy and easy to get a bus to the Royal Albert Hall Service at breakfast was very friendly and efficient 
337414,Hilton London Green Park, Room clean but decor very worn shabby plain and colourless Peeling paint and mould in bathroom holes in skirting board loose carpet with burn hole and stain Food tray left in corridor all day and teapot and cups on fire exit stairs for two days Afternoon tea in the hotel was disappointing definitely not worth the money There are patisseries nearby offering a much nicer menu at half the price, Excellent location if like us you are visiting Buckingham palace Extensive breakfast choice clean room and comfortable beds
337415,Hilton London Green Park, Nothing, We arrived in London early so thought we would ask at the hotel if we could check in early The lady on reception was very helpful and accommodating 
337416,Hilton London Green Park, The room was described as deluxe it was standard at best Decor was basic and the carpets and chairs were stained although the room was cleaned very well every day How the word deluxe was in the description is baffling and misleading , Good humoured staff Tea in the room but no biscuits have stayed in cheaper hotels and had biscuits 
337417,Hilton London Green Park, What was meant to be a de luxe room was at the back of the building overlooking a small noisy rectangle For the money charged I would have expected better The room was small but clean but nothing special Would not have wished to stay more than one night We booked the room there because we had received a gift of a Virgin experience voucher for the evening meal the same as most of the diners that night and whilst the meal was adequate I would have expected a higher standard from such an establishment We have had far better from lowlier places , The staff were helpful and friendly
337418,Hilton London Green Park,No Negative, The only thing that would have made our stay better would be a double bed but was not offered to us when I made the booking Other wise we had a great stay Thanks to your great very friendly Helpful staff 
337419,Hilton London Green Park, The room was grim London tiny and desperate for a refurb with black grout around the tub and hairs that were definitely not ours And a view of a window well of 3 brick walls And the irony is that reception upgraded us what was our original room like , The reception was excellent staff went out of their way to welcome us 
337420,Hilton London Green Park, Can t think of anything given it s not a Top hotel , Perfect location for event we attended Quiet location even though just off Piccadilly We would stay there again 
337421,Hilton London Green Park, Room at Green Park a bit too warm despite adjusting thermostat , We were not able to be accommodated for our first night but we were contacted and informed before our arrival and upgraded to Hilton Park Lane fabulous Staff very apologetic for the inconvenience Both hotel locations were great for our needs close to Hyde Park and other London attractions and within walking distance Very helpful and friendly staff Great breakfasts included
337422,Hilton London Green Park, Didn t like the head stain on my fabric headboard We had to request extra breakfast teabags for our room as we only had 2 Felt the bathroom toiletries could have been doubled One tiny bottle of each and one shower cap was never going to be enough for two people sharing a room , Fantastic location for what we needed Friendly staff Paid a brilliant price and breakfast was included 
337423,Hilton London Green Park, Was given a disabled room right next to reception so the bathroom was very inconvenient small sink no bench mirror low to ground so had to bend down to do makeup and was quite noisy hearing people come go at night and early in morning so didn t get a great sleep Were only staying one night before flying home or would have asked to be moved , Great location lovely breakfast
337424,Hilton London Green Park, Premises especially bedrooms are somewhat shabby and in need of repainting and upgrading, Staff all very pleasant location is excellent beds were comfortable

337427,Hilton London Green Park, The size of the room is very small Wish it was slightly larger No room to move around , Location It s my fav area to stay in London You can t find a better location than this Every place is walkable 
337428,Hilton London Green Park, No fridge in the room Booked room for 219 but was charged 269 instead disgusting View out the room was a disgrace Hotel is old and very dated, The area
337429,Hilton London Green Park, The hotel decoration style and the lobby too simple to be a Hilton hotel, Satisfied the room size and no extra charged for my friend the 3rd person so very happy and the extra bed was set very fast breakfast was corrected thank you
337430,Hilton London Green Park, Free wifi immediately not 48 hours after I have left I would have liked a plug in the bathroom sink I would have liked a fridge in the room The bathroom fittings were a bit jaded especially the sink and the shower tray I was given no information about breakfast or check out times I was disappointed that there was no pool The radio had very poor reception though it was good to have one , It was possible to open the window to air the room and there was a good bedside lamp The room was functional
337431,Hilton London Green Park, Wifi in all the rooms not just in communal areas, The staff were very helpful and approachable and the breakfasts were very well presented with lots of choices 
337432,Hilton London Green Park, Room was a little tired and shabby though I was told it was an upgrade to my booking A gym would have been good but I ran in Hyde Park which was a great plan B , Breakfast was fab plenty of choice and well cooked 
337433,Hilton London Green Park, I did not believe it when I asked for a martini and lemonade in the bar when I was told by the waiter that they did not have any lemonade Eventually the waiter sent someone out to get some We were told by the waiter that they had run out and was expecting an order the next day Staff who do your stock take of the bar need to be informed and to do their job better in future It was not what I expected of a Hilton Hotel , The bed was comfy but did not realise we would hear the underground rumbling along at night We were informed on arrival that we had a ground floor room but reception did not say we may hear the underground Our dinner was excellent and we enjoyed the buffet breakfast 
337434,Hilton London Green Park, The room was on the small side and the bed was uncomfortable Very Hard not to the usual standard in other hotels that we have stayed in , The location of the Hotel excellent food at breakfast lovely Staff very friendly 
337435,Hilton London Green Park, The hotel itself was not of Hilton standing to me and my wife it was more like a back packers cheap and cheerful dormitory 310 50 and allegedly that was half price for 2 nights very let down disappointed put our 2 day stay on a damper as soon as we walked in to the place never again will I go there it resembles a very poor and run down hotel absolute dump , Staff friendly good breakfast room poor standard in need of some serious renovation throughout the hotel very disappointing if your looking for 5 stars this is not the hotel for you I ve paid 20 for a b b before and got a hell of lot better Its close to the West end that s about all
337436,Hilton London Green Park, Room was small and very basic compared to other hotels I ve stayed at not nice view so poor value for mone not worth what we paid, Beakfast was quite nice Staff were friendly

337440,Hilton London Green Park, The room was very basic not worth the money really, Location excellent breakfast lovely Room location at the front of hotel smokers below our window outside and smoke drifted in to our room on several occasions Not pleasant at all Staff on reception appeared abrupt Upon leaving bill was handed over No social interaction Not even asked if we had enjoyed our stay Which would have prompted me to mention the smoking issue 
337441,Hilton London Green Park,No Negative, Nr Karuim Mouaj concierge was very helpful when we were leaving and our transfer was very late He kept calling them to make sure that they were coming and they were 40 minutes late he offered a car service to get us to airport but we did get to the airport as well I appreciated his concern 
337442,Hilton London Green Park, I was charged more money by card and I was not repaid the advance of 50 GBP The staff promised me repayment without any intention I felt let down and cheated as I don t know how to claim back, Location
337443,Hilton London Green Park, Room could do with decorating and bringing up to date Staff in the bar were not friendly and got the drinks order wrong twice When checking out we were told we didn t owe anything even though we said we did to then have money taken out of the bank a week later but not receive any notification or receipt , Size of the room and bed are good 
337444,Hilton London Green Park, the room was too small so for one person its ok for family no, i loved the location is GREAT the breakfast collection is good Staff were really nice and helpfull

337447,Hilton London Green Park, The shower over the bath did not drain very well leaving you standing in several inches of water , The staff were particularly helpful and caring when my husband was not feeling well 
337448,Hilton London Green Park, My bedroom was very tired with chipped and dirty paintwork and damp marks on the walls and on the ceiling in the bathroom The room could easily have taken a bigger bed which while very comfortable was too narrow for some one of my size, I enjoyed the breakfast room The staff were very nice and helpful The bedroom was a nice size and the tea and coffee facilities were good
337449,Hilton London Green Park, The Room being called Deluxe Could have misled others as it did ourselves Quite standard The window curtain was hanging off the rail and untidy To use the Kettle it had to be moved away from its table as there was no electric point Window looked out to a wall , Central location to the London sites of interest and close tube station Quiet surroundings 
337450,Hilton London Green Park, Seemed quite basic for the price 50 room security deposit held at check in but not taken at checkout , Wifi in the room was free for an hour Twin beds were comfy and room was clean Tea and coffee making facilities in standard room Location was fantastic

337453,Hilton London Green Park, The hotel is long overdue a refurbishment to the guest accommodation but I must say the reception staff especially who I dealt with mostly were excellent and Kiran Sidhu customer relations executive was of the highest order and dealt with my complaints outstanding good staff goes a long way to make a pleasant stay overall ,No Positive
337454,Hilton London Green Park, Tired room Needed a refurbishment Walls needed a coat of paint all over Bathroom dated and old style shower curtain Tricky half step access to bathroom Dangerous chain mechanism for operating Roman blinds Swinging loose and not attached by cleat as is required now Would never accept that at home so unacceptable in a hotel , Location good for the RA and friendly desk staff Room available early Good clean towels

337456,Hilton London Green Park, Rooms are unpleasant Small and cramped and unusable They had to move me four times Not a business class hotel Creaky floors mean major noise from people walking above your room Bathrooms tiny and no space to store your kit No closet space and dirty dingy chairs and carpet The staff was great but their explanation is that it is an old building That is fine but it still needs updating , Service was great staff is excellent 
337457,Hilton London Green Park, We felt that the hotel was a bit old fashioned the deluxe room quite small and could do with an update , Staff were friendly helpful and attentive especially in the restaurant Location of hotel was very good for what we wanted to do during our visit

337464,Hilton London Green Park,No Negative, Excellent location Attentive and friendly personnel Rather spacious rooms High quality cleaning Breakfasts various are served hot starter We ll book at this hotel and we ll recommend to another 
337465,Hilton London Green Park, Floorboards creaked a lot during the night Not so great if people are moving about a lot during the night , Proximity to Mayfair Green Park Tube station and restaurants Staff were helpful friendly and accommodating We had a great room on the first floor high ceilings 
337466,Hilton London Green Park, The location of our room We upgraded but was put next to the lift so was kept up all night form the noise of the lift and people going in out of it The quality of the room is what I would expect of a travelodge It was basic and very uncomfortable It also had very bad lighting , The breakfast was very nice The size of the room was good we had a Deluxe King Very good location Reception and restaurant staff were lovely 
337467,Hilton London Green Park, Very small room bed was uncomfortable tv was horrendous needs updating now Chose this hotel as I thought it would be modern fresh and comfortable but no real improvement to a Premier Inn Disappointed as it was an expensive trip for a young couple , Very friendly staff clean rooms great location
337468,Hilton London Green Park, They turn off heating by default Make sure you ask reception quick to turn it on for good otherwise you run the risk of a very cold night Not a Hilton standard but still ok , Great price for location Breakfast is good
337469,Hilton London Green Park, The first room next to the elevators and loud I asked to be moved and we did but even thou the room was bigger and quieter it was dated and not in a nice way The bathroom was very average mouldy and the showers and bath didn t work properly , Mayfair is a great area very central and close to everything as we were walking everywhere

337483,Hilton London Green Park, When I did my search on the booking site I entered that I was looking for a room which included parking On arrival I found that this hotel has no parking and hi had to pay to stay at the NCP overnight which cost me and additional 40 This is not the hotels fault this is due to Booking com advertising this hotel incorrectly which has left me 40 out of pocket ,No Positive
337484,Hilton London Green Park, I stayed on fourth floor When you step on the floor in your room it is not stable and have a noise It feel like you will fall down The room is not clean and have some bad smell At late midnight have some big noise from someone down on the street argue each other It is not my good experience to stay ,No Positive
337485,Hilton London Green Park, Booked a Deluxe Room and given a room on the 2nd floor which was shabby worn out and grubby No hot water to the shower bath so was re located to 5th floor room Better quality but still somewhat worn out and in need of a lick of paint , Staff were friendly and most helpful
337486,Hilton London Green Park, As we had a power cut at our original hotel green park we were moved to the park lane Hilton for one night until the problem was sorted On leaving the park lane Hilton we were given a bill with zero balance at the express check out however were then charged 56 for the mini bar even though this was never used or shown on the bill when we checked out This then meant I had to call the hotel several times to try and have this amended , Location was excellent we had a power cut on our first night and the staff handled this very professionally and couldnt have done more for us We were moved to the park lane Hilton for one night and were given complimentary drinks vouchers and received an apology letter with a box of sweets when we arrived back at our hotel The green park Hilton is smaller and the staff are much more friendlier than park lane and the location is more central 
337487,Hilton London Green Park, the 622 paid for the 3 night stay was most certainly not worth it the room was very small and the bed was very very uncomfortable pillows were the worst I ve had in a hotel and the cheek of the 150 deposit taken at the start of our stay did not help either i will be complaining direct to Hilton , The location was fantastic 
337488,Hilton London Green Park, We reported that the bed was rather hard uncomfortable and noisy which detracted from our stay somewhat However I had an email at home waiting for me from the manager saying they were looking into this problem thanking us for the comment and offering a free upgrade on our next visit also to contact him direct with email address just before we arrived and he would ensure all was OK for us , The proficiency efficiency and helpfulness if the staff could not be beaten This included advising a private limo for fixed price return journey across London which was cheaper than taxi The front desk the serving staff in the bar and at breakfast were very polite throughout Excellent 
337489,Hilton London Green Park, I stayed here twice in 2 weeks First stay the room that I was given was pretty small and I was told when I checked in that they would check for a better room the next day and get back to me but I never heard back They were however very very keen to sign me up for Hilton Honours program Second stay I was given what I think was one of the the worst rooms I ve ever stayed in ground floor at the back it was like a cave it was tiny for two people and this was described as a superior plus I asked if we could be moved which we were the next day As a consequence I was offerred a free dinner in their restaurant by the front office manager but when I mentioned this to the restaurant staff they weren t aware of it and the FOM was not there so I never got it The 2nd room was slightly bigger but certainly not what I would have expected for 400 pounds a night The windows are openable but are screwed shut so you can t get any fresh air the shower over the bath was awful no bar fridge room safe didn t work and if there are two of you with two suitcases you pretty well have to sleep with your case as there s just no space This is an old building with a lot of character in a great position but what you get in terms of rooms is certainly not good value , The position and a few staff were very nice 
337490,Hilton London Green Park, Wifi is not free and the rates are extortionate Being an old house the nboise of people moving around thumping down corridors etc is enough to wake you up at night they needed to employ better soundproofing when renovating , Location great for Central London 
337491,Hilton London Green Park, Fact that bar had a menu up that I deliberated over and then went to order Staff didn t know for a start what boeuf bourgogne wasted then told me that s an old menu and no longer available Tables far too close at breakfast Had to invade others personal space Who decides these things Embarrassing having to put your rear end in someone s face Very very poor X, Chef 
337492,Hilton London Green Park,No Negative, The situation of the hotel is excellent for commuting to a wide range of interests My wife and I enjoyed the excellent breakfasts the staff being so polite and helpful was noteworthy 
337493,Hilton London Green Park,No Negative, Greeted at the taxi and immediately helped with bags Excellent staff and room Delicious dinner and breakfasts Wait staff the best in Europe Can not wait to return 
337494,Hilton London Green Park, Food was expensive and not many choices , The front desk was helpful allowed us to check in early as soon as a room was available Nice after an over night flight The server in the area was very nice very welcoming Loved chatting with her 
337495,Hilton London Green Park,No Negative, Great value for money for such a fantastic location Nice full service hotel staff were very helpful friendly Room was large and properly equipped air conditioned and we had no complaints But you would not say it was luxury E g uninspiring outlook and functional furnishing which I think was fair for the price
337496,Hilton London Green Park, Small rooms like big cities everywhere , The staff was very nice and helpful with directions to our destinations A wonderful location a very close walk to Buckingham Palace
