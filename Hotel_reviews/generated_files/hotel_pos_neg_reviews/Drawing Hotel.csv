71274,Drawing Hotel,No Negative, I was only at the hotel for one night but wish i could of stayed longer Such a comfortable stay in a beautifully designed hotel Staff were super helpful when I needed an iron printing and specific meal option I really loved the rooftop terrace and amazing location Had a really relaxing feel 
71275,Drawing Hotel, One could possible hear noises from the corridor or service rooms , The hotel came up to all of its expectations All members of the staff were very nice and helpful for any of our demands The location is perfect for anyone wanting to experience Paris by foot and the Metro station is a corner away Two other stations are a 5 10 minute walk away 
71276,Drawing Hotel, The roof top garden was not well maintained it was so dry and all the plants were dying but to their defense it is a complete new hotel Nevertheless the roof top garden needs to improve , Beautiful and stylish hotel the breakfast was delicious They provide beautiful glasses and cutlery unlike some of the so called boutique hotels which provide cheap poverty glasses It is the place to be in Paris 
71277,Drawing Hotel,No Negative, The staff are really friendly and professional The boutique style of the hotel is different contemporary and the location so close to the Louvre and Jardins des Tuileries is a big plus for early morning runs and night life The room was spotless with all the mod comms It s a really safe place with restricted lift access I will use it for my next trip 
71278,Drawing Hotel, The coffe machine was not easy to work There was no cupboard in my room just a rack with a few hangers , It was a very nice Modern hotel I liked the influence of Art reflected everywhere 
71279,Drawing Hotel, I couldn t operate the coffee machine I guess I am the only individual with this issue It s probably due to my bi lateral knuckle replacement It did look good though The crew downstairs at the front desk were more than helpful They repeatedly offered to come to the room to give me a tutorial, Jimmmy in the bar was outstanding Although I only ordered an herbal green tea we had some wonderful conversations about nearby places to eat as well as other topics He was exceptional reminded me of one of my own kids super nice and went out of his way to be helpful 
71280,Drawing Hotel, We had a good view of the street from the first room but had to shift up another room as I requested for twin beds The view in the second room was blah much to the disappointment of my niece There was a power trip on the floor we were on the last night Restored only in the morning But didn t affect us much as i opened the window for cool air , Bed was most comfy Have stayed in many hotels including the big brands no bed in these hotels was as comfy as this one Room had excellent soundproof windows Boutique artistic feel Extremely central location the Lourve is your neighbor Probably one of the loveliest boutique hotels I ve stayed in 
71281,Drawing Hotel, I personally did not mind The rooms are small , The quietest most comfortable hotel I stayed in for my month trip The service was very helpful May my stay in Paris more enjoyable 
71282,Drawing Hotel, Hotel still ramping up opened in Feb 2017 We did not get the room serviced one day which was properly mitigated and done while we were away having dinner and shower did not have enough water pressure, Very modern recently built hotel in a great location 1 min away from Louvre
71283,Drawing Hotel,No Negative, Perfect location in Paris Two steps to Louvre
