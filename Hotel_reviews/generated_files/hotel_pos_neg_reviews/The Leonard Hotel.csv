55811,The Leonard Hotel, Old hotel and only one lift for the whole hotel The lift reaches up to 4th floor for the 5th floor which is the last you need to use the staires, Location is great friendly staff
55812,The Leonard Hotel, It shows ageing signs it can get noisy on the streets and due to the old construction the noise is not canceled out the windows were clearly not clean , I was upgraded to a one bed suite The room particularly the bed the service and breakfast quality is way above standard the staff is clearly trained and suggests to be carefully selected 
55813,The Leonard Hotel, Please go back to the old type of buiscuits that you leave in the room I enjoyed them with a quick cup of tea on the run as the new ones taste bad Thanks, The location of the hotel The cleanliness of the room The staff is so friendly and coopreative I have been using the same room in your lovely hotel for the past three years 
55814,The Leonard Hotel,No Negative, The rooms are well presented and the location near Oxford Street is ideal There was construction work next door which was very loud However the staff happily shifted us to another room and provided a complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience 
55815,The Leonard Hotel, Floor may need some improvement as walking on them can make noise , Very nice hotel with outstanding location quality services Room and bed were very comfortable The size of the room was considerable as well 
55816,The Leonard Hotel, If you book your room on the 5th floor the lift stops on the 4th floor only There was a fistinctive smell of fish around the restaurant during dinner time , Friendly staff great location 
55817,The Leonard Hotel, The hotel needs to be totally refurbished It must have been grand in its day but now it is very tired looking The wallpaper is dirty and the paintwork very chipped and scuffed Our bathroom had definitely seen better days The carpets need renewing and the furninshiings have seen better days It s expensive for what it is That said the staff are very friendly service was good and it s in a great location , Bed was comfy towels and sheets were lovely and clean staff very friendly and polite Breakfast was very good 
55818,The Leonard Hotel, Lift is going up to 4th floor but we have room on the 5th floor stairs stairs Soundproof next construction site was operating from 8 a m till 6 p m very noisy , Breakfast WiFi connection Location spacious room staff hospitality
55819,The Leonard Hotel, The front of desk staff were very rude didn t believe me when I told them that I hadn t consumed anything from mini bar they told me wait so they could go to check they thought I was a liar most eastern Europeans probably that s what happens in their country would never go to this hotel again or recommend to anyone ,No Positive
55820,The Leonard Hotel, The extra bed we ordered was terrible Could not sleep on it housekeeping was not there Had to wait for next day Room was not that clean No value for money , The location was nice Staff friendly 
55821,The Leonard Hotel, It was rather gloomy in the bedroom Probably due to the d cor which is maybe a little bit tired , The staff The room and the bed was very comfortable The breakfast 
55822,The Leonard Hotel, The airport transport service was organized poorly plus the price is more expansive than you take the taxi directly from the airport to the hotel And the room they gave us was at the basement which was really noisy at night and the air was bad too , The location is really good for shopping it is only 5 mins away from Oxford street 
55823,The Leonard Hotel, lace is old and ru down needs a refurb Plus not great been awaked with workmen making a big noise on building work next door and not informed either on booking or on checking in , Location and staff good
55824,The Leonard Hotel, We got the 5 th floor room and as the elevator only goes up to 4th floor we had to climb the final flight of stairs The room was a quite small We are aware that London boutique hotel rooms tend to be small but it s a surprise each time , Great location Walking distance to Oxford Street was a great plus 
55825,The Leonard Hotel, There was some noise in my sueit in the last 2 nights The beds wasnt comfortable as it should be in 4 stars hotel, The location of the hotel was very excellent as it takes less than 5 min to reach the hyde park oxford street and the big bus station The reception was very friendly and flexible with me especially saleem who can speak arabic and explain to me the hotel history and how can i enjoy my first visit to london Also I loved the classic style of the hotel
55826,The Leonard Hotel, They gave a tiny room that I couldn t even stad or turn on it the smallest room i saw ever actually I think this was a storage room and they coveted it to make more money, The location and the staff were amazing
55827,The Leonard Hotel, This time I was on second floor and one floor above was very loud and I couldnt sleep well I woke up at least 5 times over a night , LOcation and price
55828,The Leonard Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is five minutes away from Marble Arch tube station in a very great position When we arrived at the location we had a pleasant surprise the room had a little kitchen spot so that we could cook dinner comfortably It is not the cheapest accomodation but it was worth the money it costed 
55829,The Leonard Hotel, The air conditioner always on automatic system it seems like they care about the people who get cold only and I m always hot so I suffer every time And no one fixes it to be completely honest the last two stays was really a Tuorter to me I slept without a blanket from the heet and i had to open the window for some cold air and it was a weekend so it was really noisy and loud so I didn t sleep until 5 30 am just trying all night and thr tv wasn t working properly and no Arabic channels it s a hotel it s spouse to have at least one channel from each region because not only locals staying in also foreigners and tourists and I m a usual customer and not once I ve been given a free weekend stay I would appreciate some appropriation as a customer the marriot hotels do it also amba hotel, The rooms are really fancy but continue below
55830,The Leonard Hotel, I thinks old carpets need to cheange, I booked 2 bedroom apartment room sizes were good large living room with sofas and dining table kitchen with all you need two bathrooms and three TV s Excellent location very close to Oxford street and Hyde park 
55831,The Leonard Hotel, I expect a 4 stars as I paid fair rate but not that stand This is the second time I guess the stars on booking com are equal the internal standard, Location staffs
55832,The Leonard Hotel, Nothing really Possibly a bit of re decoration but nothing major , Good value for central London Room was clean and comfortable if a little shabby chic Staff were very friendly and helpful 
55833,The Leonard Hotel, Nowhere it was mentioned that the elevator did not go up to all the floors and the room I chose and having to use the stairs was not in my plans as a recently operated person Also the food was not the best on room service Ventilation system in the bathroom was very loud and impossible to have a relaxing bath Smell on the floors was a bit stuffy not nice , Location was great
55834,The Leonard Hotel, I d booked a suite and used the sofa bed which wasn t that comfortable , Great location and lovely staff very welcoming and couldn t do enough to help It was a good size room with great facilities
55835,The Leonard Hotel, What makes it attractive as a traditional old English hotel also bring the creaking floors and slightly run down appearance in spots but they are in the process of cleaning it up with fresh paint and wallpaper Big drawback is big construction immediately next door which will probably go on for at least a year , Great location with so many attractions in easy walking distance One block to Oxford Street shopping and Marble Arch public transportation stations Three blocks to Hyde Park Half hour to Buckingham Palace Nice restaurant and bar Warm and helpful staff 
55836,The Leonard Hotel, There were some mini steps along the corridor that lead up and down so it will be difficult for those who have troubles climbing stairs , We stayed in a one bedroom suite The location is great and the rooms are spacious It has lovely decor and enough light coming through the windows 
55837,The Leonard Hotel, The deluxe double room had 2 single beds Single beds are for children they are not comfortable and too narrow The hotel is not new it needs a touch up so the price is a little on the expensive side They requested 50 pounds be taken off your credit card in case you use anything in the mini bar when you check in , The location is really central great to get about The staff are extremely friendly and efficient The hotel has a nice enough charm and a relaxed ambiance 
55838,The Leonard Hotel, The hotel needs restoration The bathroom had peeled ceilings The room are quiet dark needs more lighting The floor were uneven , The location is perfect The staff were friendly 
55839,The Leonard Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location near the Marble Arch tube stop and Hyde Park Staff was very helpful and friendly Cafe across the street was great for a quick healthy bite and cappuccino before a day of sightseeing 
55840,The Leonard Hotel, i liked it all i was very happy there the staff were very attentive as well i have no complaints about any of it , the room was lovely and nicely decorated I especially liked the bathroom and the large bath tub
55841,The Leonard Hotel, Oven didn t work Fridge iced over Tatty kitchen units Very tatty bathroom units and decor Needs some maintainence Shower corners were filthy Bedroom doors if shut when no one in them couldn t be opened by us Staff had to unlock them and they told us not to shut them That s rediculous , Comfy beds spacious apartment 
55842,The Leonard Hotel, I stayed in the single room Though it was OK in terms of room size London hotel standards there were several problems with the room shower and toilet are in separate areas of the room not separated with xxyy but really in separate places the sink size no more than a A4 paper I guess it was intended to wash hands only Otherwise it was a joke by the interior architect the room was heated by a air conditioner So you had to choose from either a very cold room or a very dry air in the room to reach the room you need to cross several corridors each with different altitude So if you have a heavy luggage you will need to hop up down several steps on your way to your room the location of the hotel is great However the room is on the noisy side because of ineffective sound also heat insulation Hence you are greeted with complimentary earplugs on the bed side table in case you would need , the location is great price quality is good 
55843,The Leonard Hotel, You booking the most, Mattress not comfortable and i didnt take my vat back thats from booking it isnt mentioned that you could only take it when u re going for business trip onlyyyyy

55846,The Leonard Hotel, Traffic noise early in the morning, Great location close to oxford street Room was really spacious for a London Hotel with a settee 2 arm chairs and a desk with chair plus a really comfortable king size bed 
55847,The Leonard Hotel, The bed needed replacing The food was poor we refused to pay for some We had to wait for a manager to deal with a problem with food Old furniture and other items piled in front of fire exit Smoking inside hotel We will not go back , The hotel was warm 
55848,The Leonard Hotel, The only drawback creaking floorboards didn t mind it much but mostly annoyed me because we had to wake up early last day and it bothered me because of other guests being awakened by them , Everything about the hotel excellent staff fantastic location cleanliness service breakfast
55849,The Leonard Hotel, Worship in the public rooms This has no place in a secular city I am hopeful that my phone charger will reappear left in room on departure , helpful and cheerful staff good breakfast Location Personal touch

55851,The Leonard Hotel, Hotel was very in need of refurbishment the wallpapers were getting off and dirty in some places The furniture and things like alarm clock phone iron and ironing table it was broken actually were very old We were given a room in the 5th floor where we had to take elevator untill 4th floor and stairs then With 2 suitcases and tired after a loong travelling day that was not what we wanted I found the paper cover of old wine bottle on the floor There was no value for money for that money there were better hotels and even apartments where we could stay , The location was good and the fact that bathroom wasn t as small as it was in many hotels those were the only things we liked about the hotel The staff was welcoming as well
55852,The Leonard Hotel, Absolutely nothing , Loved everything about this hotel The location was great and the staff were wonderful Spotlessly clean We had single rooms which by nature in any hotel are small yet they had everything you need safe TV tea coffee facilities hairdryer even dressing gown and slippers Excellent value for money Will definitely visit again

55855,The Leonard Hotel, , Even we had bad experience I have to say the location is great only 5 min walk to Oxford street and to Marble Arch tub station The atmosphere at the Hotel is good and this boutique design lovely and most of the staff was helpful and friendly 
55856,The Leonard Hotel, The floorboards creeked when the people upstairs were in their room and they liked to walk around , The staff were so friendly and proffesional na d couldnt do enough for you We were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite free of charge which was wonderful 
55857,The Leonard Hotel, The decor is old and tired peeling wallpaper and holes in the wall , Comfortable bed and although a very small single room all the extras were there Thanks also for the ear plugs very useful in London

55861,The Leonard Hotel, High cost for such poor standard of accommodation Wallpaper ripped or peeling off painted woodwork all scuffed missing light bulbs scratched baths water leaks evident in bathrooms broken bath taps very noisy bathroom fan hairdryer not functioning correctly We were upgraded to an apartment which was unsatisfactory and then viewed 2 other rooms in a similar state before opting for the least worst Old fashioned decor the whole hotel needs a refurbishment If you are spending 250 per night you can find much better elsewhere ,No Positive
55862,The Leonard Hotel, The creaking sound of the floor typical of English cottage, Thank you to all the friendly staff We stayed for 10 days and enjoyed every minute of our stay our two bedroom apartment was well cleaned by our super friendly housekeeper The location is superb though it s near the Oxford street and yet it s quaint and quiet 
55863,The Leonard Hotel, The false advertising of a single for a double to get me to click on the Lenorard hotel and I will not use Booking com in future which I have used for the last number of years , As I previously outlined refer to my booking ref I feel my treatment due to the false advertising of a single room for a double room was disgraceful

55948,The Leonard Hotel, it s not my first time in the Leonard the ambience was loud and noisy we called the reception 3 times because there was to much noise in the above room because of the floor the room bathroom was very old you need to have a new furniture also the most upset thing was when we wanted to have a late check out for 1 of the room at least for an hour they didn t approve it was very upsetting thank you, the location and staff
55949,The Leonard Hotel, No dislikes , The staff were very friendly and helpful the room was clean and comfortable The room was surprisingly quiet for an old building in central London 
55950,The Leonard Hotel,No Negative, Family suite was excellent Loads of space for the kids and having our own room was a complete bonus Staff supper friendly we stayed in the bar after our day out for a couple of drinks kids loved it and the bar staff were great 
55951,The Leonard Hotel, The single room s location within the building was not convenient and at times didnt feel very safe, Clean staff friendly and location is very good
55952,The Leonard Hotel, Noisy room hear music from restaurant from down stairs noisy floor boards from room above Would stay in that room again but would stay at hotel in another less noisy room, Food good clean position in London near tube Friendly staff 
55953,The Leonard Hotel, Property too old and location of my room no 8 very bad I felt I am living in the kitchen and I heare noises from the ceiling I told them to change my room but they refuse I am stock bcc my rest of the family in the 3rd floor FIY there is some rooms no left you need to go by stairs only , Location staff
55954,The Leonard Hotel,No Negative, Our second stay here warm friendly and extremely helpful staff Comfortable bed and all the ammities one needs in a room A very cozy hotel that is extremely well situated Will definitely stay there again 
55955,The Leonard Hotel, Nothing I was only here on night but just round the corner to Selfridges and so excellent restaurants , Note was excellent Staff very attentive from the guy on the door to checking in Lovely lounge and the barman was really good when we came back in from dinner Bar very quiet but just what was needed after a petty noisy restaurant Bedroom No 41 was large and quiet at the back of the building Nothing to fault 
55956,The Leonard Hotel, The property is old and quirky which is pleasant but can cause issues The rooms are clean but a little peeling paint detracts a bit , Perfect location and a very good and helpful staff make this a repeat destination for my wife and me
55957,The Leonard Hotel, Water from shower was not always warm the temperature fluctuated from lukewarm to warm whilst showering , Very nice front desk people and location was great 
55958,The Leonard Hotel, Very small room for 2 people impossible to move no space for clothes etc Reception staff very polite but don t expect to fullfill any extra requests , Great location Comfortable bed Clean Good wi fi 
55959,The Leonard Hotel, Tea and coffee facilities were good however no socket for the plug could be reached unless kettle was on the floor or dangeroulsy balancing on the edge of the table One side light did not work and all the inners were burnt in the shade of the other from previoulsy too high wattage bulb I expect , Lovely quiet room
55960,The Leonard Hotel, The bedside lamps only gave light on and above the wall behind them It was impossible to use them for reading in bed Coffee facilities not properly arranged in one spot i e kettle and cups in one location tea and coffee in another Cord of kettle so short that one had to crouch down on the floor to plug it in This for people over 80 like us was most difficult and uncomfortable , Staff were very helpful and efficient Atmosphere cosy and and comfortable Food excellent 
55961,The Leonard Hotel, Location wasn t as convenient as other places but the tube was easy to use , Loved the ornate details of this room Queen sized bed was wonderful for couple after a long day of travel 
55962,The Leonard Hotel, The photos online were a little deceptive the decor the furniture in the room was dated which wasn t what I expected a bit disappointing Having said that the bed was extremely comfortable the suite was spacious Hey darling not going away this wknd now Can u Court come up Sat 4 the nite , Location Size of the suite Cafe across the road Friendliness helpfulness of the staff Quaint traditional London hotel
55963,The Leonard Hotel, Our room was on the 5th floor and the elevator reaches only the 4th floor we had to use the stairs from the 4th floor the room was small and the wall was slanted, Check in Check out easy and quick Great location steps from Oxford Street and the metro station the view was good 
55964,The Leonard Hotel, Old property so I was able to lie in bed and monitor the movements of the person s in the room above by the floor board creaks emanating through the ceiling He she got up early , The food was delicious and the ALL staff extremely welcoming and genuinely so Room well appointed 
55965,The Leonard Hotel, Lots odf little steps here and there throughout the building however it was built in 1780 so its to be expected that there will be a few quirks so if you book and you need specific access make sure you contact them to be sure of where your room is otherwise it just adds to the character of the stay , Excellent staff a warm welcome after a very long journey Our room wasn t ready we arrived earlier than expected however we left our cases and were pointed in the direction of some great restaurants for lunch When we returned our bags were already in our room 
55966,The Leonard Hotel, Sadly the shabbiness of the place is begining to out run the chic and I struggle to remember a less comfortable hotel bed in all my years of travelling DO NOT fork out the additional cost for breakfast ours was distinctly unappetising and took an age to arrive On the 2nd morning another guest had to get up and leave before his food emerged from the kitchen There are a few pretty good places to get a much more appealing breakfast within a short walk including the delightfully quirky Daisy Green just over the road , This place is in an excellent location and as other reviewers have pointed out has an air of a family concern that gives it far more appeal than some of the antiseptic chain hotels that come in at around the same Pretty expensive price The staff are among the most welcoming and friendly I have encountered in a London Hotel undobtedly the Leonard s principle asset they are crying out for a bit of hands on management and direction to turn something distinctly average into what could be something wonderful 
55967,The Leonard Hotel, Breakfast not included and was a bit expensive for what we got Air condition in room went on and off all night Bathroom a bit small for a suite , Traditional English decor We were upgraded to a suite and it was amazing spacious comfortable and clean Location is outstanding close to Oxford Street and underground yet quiet 
55968,The Leonard Hotel, Leonard Hotel was an old building converted into hotel rooms Hence there are steps throughout the hallways to the rooms Rooms on the 5th floor can only be accessed through staircase Can be tricky with big heavy bags , Great location in Central London Easy access to bus stops and tubes Shopping districts all within walking distances Selfridges Debenhams Oxford St Regent St Soho 
55969,The Leonard Hotel,No Negative, Old style boutique hotel in a fantastic location spotlessly clean and full of character Helpful and friendly staff Large comfortable room with every amenity one could want A welcome change from larger more sterile hotels

55971,The Leonard Hotel, Sorry but didn t like this hotel at all , I arrived and unfortunately was put in a very poor standard room in the basement The hotel is ols and need significant upgrading of the decor and facilities I spent 10 minutes trying to follow the instructions to get the tv working 
55972,The Leonard Hotel, Ground floor room facing Seymour Street was noisy due to old fashioned sash windows Curtains didn t close fully to block out car headlights Decor a bit tired but had character , Great location very convenient Room size well above average Staff very friendly courteous and attentive 
55973,The Leonard Hotel, The reception and the hotel is run down and in need of a facelift We had a room on the fifth floor and the elevator is only till the fourth floor The quality of breakfast was nice but it could have been more elaborate , Spacious rooms and friendly helpful staff 
55974,The Leonard Hotel, Classic double room number 18 had lovely decor but the actual bed was accessed by a set of stairs which had no railing and once In the room there was nothing to prevent you from accidentally stepping into the stairwell as only a narrow space existed between it and the bed As international travellers we had luggage that wouldn t fit in the room the wardrobe was converted into a mini bar so no hanging space was available We asked to be moved and were offered the only room available which was in the basement at 30 pounds per night extra Whilst this room was more spacious a faulty air conditioner leaked water down the wall over power points and the rug Staff advised they would have someone attend to it On returning to the room we found that the wet towel we had used to mop up had been removed Rug and skirting still wet The canvas picture I had taken down from the wet wall had simply been rehung The back of this was so filthy with old water stains and mould it was clear that this was a long term problem which they had no intention of fixing Very disappointed and felt ripped off and at a loss to understand the meaning of 4 star rating , Most Staff very helpful courteous etc Breakfast good served in pleasant dining room 
55975,The Leonard Hotel, At breakfast everything was brought to you making it a slow process, Good size room great location friendly staff 24 hour room service was handy for us too 
55976,The Leonard Hotel, There was another room connected to ours but there was no key for me to be able to lock from my side As I was with my partner this didn t really bother me but it would have had I been on my own , The room was very clean and well furnished It was a great size well airconditoned and included all amenities you would require The staff were absolutely wonderful so attentive and accomodating they really seemed to enjoy their jobs and knew what the customer wanted I will definitely visit again and will make sure that I use the restaurant
55977,The Leonard Hotel,No Negative, We booked a junior suite and it was beautiful The bathroom was all marble and spacious with a big bath and a separate shower There was even a kitchen with a big fridge freezer and a washing machine The suite was lovely decorated and it felt really luxurious Wonderful coming back to it after a full day spent walking around London The restaurant was absolutely gorgeous and the breakfast a superb affair The staff is very friendly prompt in helping extremely polite and well trained All in all it was a fantastic experience I can highly recommend it 
55978,The Leonard Hotel, Small room overpriced , I liked the stylish decor of the hotel and the quality of paper used for invoicing and others Room was small and I am from Hungary London in general very expensive for us 
55979,The Leonard Hotel, I am a regular customer of this Hotel However this time i was very dissapointed as i asked for an extention and the receptionist said that the room is booked and he can not make an extention I found out later that this was a lie I left my mobile phone charger in the room and came back at 6 pm to ask for it The room was not occupied yet and someone has went to search for it and came back with nothing This absulotely unacceptable I will not stay in this hotel in the future , Only the Location
55980,The Leonard Hotel, The hotel is very old you can smell the years in the room Not good value for price maybe a 3 star hotel not more , Staff is extremely nice and helpful
55981,The Leonard Hotel, There was no mention of the extremely loud construction site literally outside my window when I agreed to pay on the site Don t not stay here if you like your lie ins Was woke up at 6am every single day it was the worse experience I ve had during a stay in London regarding hotel experiences They couldn t even move us to a different room after telling us they had some larger rooms possibly why would you tell me that for and not come through I ve stayed at this hotel many times before it s some what going downhill unfortunately Rooms are heavily dated and worn now the tv system is dated and poor the building site next door is literally the worse thing during sunrise about 5am we also had seagals gathering on the roof and fighting which woke us up only meaning there must be scrap food on the rooftop Also any time the room next door uses the bathroom you can hear it really loud gross We fealt that we should of be wearing hi vis and helmets ourselves during the stay Vile , All about location
55982,The Leonard Hotel, I came with family and we felt the room carpet was not clean It felt itching we sat on the carpet Also it seems the floors in the hotel were made of wood as we can hear the walking steps from people in the room above us Luckliy it went quiet when it was time for bed However there was another source of noise in the room that sounded like a discontinuous extractor or fan and was noisey to me I reported that to the reception who attempted to resolve it but it didn t work So I had to wear ear plugs to be able to sleep , I liked the great location and the excellent price for the one night we stayed in this hotel 
55983,The Leonard Hotel, Wood floor and ceiling so it will be affected when someone walking in the room and talking during the night Near the street and only glass window which cannot be fully closed , Great service wonderful location for shopping and traffic and lovely room

55988,The Leonard Hotel, They wanted a further 50 deposit in case I used mini bar this was unexpected The TV was hit and miss I got help when I arrived to get to work and I am techie and after turning off thro the night it didn t work again I didn t bother calling down this tome as I was leaving soon The worse thing was the room was so hot and AC did not appear to work it was unbearable thro the night and I got very little sleep, The location and staff were good
55989,The Leonard Hotel, We stayed in a two room suite but unfortunately most light fixtures did not work The carpet was dirty as hats lighting and half broken windows Also internal and external doors made a lot of noise when closing he bathroom was very small and the ventilation is not fully operated , Staff very polite Comfort and room decor Location Excellent breacfast and meal
