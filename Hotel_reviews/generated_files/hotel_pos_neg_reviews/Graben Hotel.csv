315440,Graben Hotel, Nothing , The personnel during breakfast were some of the nicest I ve met they couldn t do enough for you Excellent range of options at breakfast The hotel could not have been more central and despite that the cost was very reasonable and the area was very quiet at night 
315441,Graben Hotel, Nothing was problematic, Everything I remember was just fine courteous accommodating well informed staff cozy room with all the basics excellent location for travelers Viennese charm The price was right for the level of services and facilities offered 
315442,Graben Hotel, Originally when I arrived after a long journey they told me the hotel was fully booked and I had no room available to me , The original problem was solved swiftly and professionally After that my stay was very good Nice room if not maybe a bit old fashioned but clean and well looked after I would stay here again 
315443,Graben Hotel, THE TOPPING UP OF JUICES SCRAMBLED EGGS IN THE MORNING WAS SLOW, THE BEDS WERE LOVELY AND THE EVENING RESTAURANT WAS REALLY GOOD AND THE STAFF FRIENDLY
315444,Graben Hotel, I am not sure if the fact that the hotel still uses keys which you have to leave at reception may be thought of as outdated by some It did not bother us in the least as we belong to the key generation , We were given only 2 low pillows but forgot to ask for extra ones before we went out in the morning We asked for them in the evening thinking they would be put in the room in the morning but 5 minutes after we got to the room the pillows were delivered 
315445,Graben Hotel, Noise in street outside late into night and early mornings by street cleaners etc Not hotel s fault but be aware with being right in the centre of the city has a price , Very helpful and pleasant staff room kept spotlessly clean 
315446,Graben Hotel, We couldn t get the ac to work so the room was quite stuffy considering it was March But the windows opened so no real probl em, Breakfast was very good with lots of options Location v central Reception staff v helpful WiFi excellent and free 
315447,Graben Hotel, It s an old building and most rooms are small but that can t be changed and doesn t matter hugely unless you have a need for rooms like small apartments However if I d paid a 4 star price I d have been disappointed with the many of the room facilities e g warm minibar small TV minimal towels few toiletries no tea kettle But then maybe if I d paid full price the offerings would have been different So given the low rate I paid which my Viennese friends could hardly believe I m not really complaining , Its great location for the opera house and its excellent breakfast I stayed here several times in the 1990s for the same reasons until it upgraded from 3 to 4 stars and became too expensive so I moved elsewhere I made the 2017 bookings because I saw rooms offered on line at an extraordinary price and knew I was on a winner 
315448,Graben Hotel, We booked a double room but were provided a twin room on arrival We were given a much smaller room when we pointed this out Room was so small that we had no space where to put luggage Also we were provided with single quilts which are not ideal for a double bed On more than one occasion I came across dirty cups in the breakfast room , Excellent location next to St Stephen s Cathedral Staff very helpful and liked the buffet breakfast
315449,Graben Hotel, A small room for the toilet was separate from the bathroom both within the room of course The problem was that the toilet room was not connected to the central ventilation system so no way to ventilate the toilet room We had to open the room windows in freezing temperatures while we were out of the room When we asked about this they were ok with us changing rooms but the entire ventilation system in the hotel was not working During our 4 night stay this was not fixed , Right at the center of town Pleasant rooms Good and flexible service Quite clean 
315450,Graben Hotel,No Negative, Location location location in the middle of it all at a great price and a good breakfast to start the day Great restaurant and a caf across the street 
315451,Graben Hotel, Staff was rather slow at check in and check out We were not warned about the possibility to be fined for just stopping the car to get out the suitcases Although the hotel offers parking service to park in the public garage it can take some time and you can still be fined 40 for stopping near the hotel Parking is available in the underground garages 20 if you parked by yourself and 30 35 if they park mind that you can lose the difference while checking the options with the receptionist parking inspectors are literally lurking from every corner There is no shower cap Towels need to be replaced , Location was great Looking at the rooftops or at the roof windows was very romantic Breakfast was rich try goat cheese it was amazing Food was very good at their trattoria Prices are reasonable Clean rooms 
315452,Graben Hotel, Room and bathroom pretty small Shower slippery and no safety handle No shower cap , Friendly staff Decoration simple but stylish Location is the best possible one for a tourist Right in the middle of Silvesterfpad The restaurant is quite good and very convenient to avoid getting frozen in the cold winter nights 
315453,Graben Hotel, Breakfast selection was awful 2 single beds shoved together for a double room and they kept moving apart every few minutes Shower kept going scalding hot and cold , Location was perfect City centre
315454,Graben Hotel, It was said that there is a parking while there wasn t It is a parking service where someone takes your car in the evening and brings it back in the morning against payment of course , The location
315455,Graben Hotel, Nothing everything was perfect , Perfect hotel very very cozy and beautiful with its special character the hotel is situated on the very quiet small street in old city two minutes walk to San Stefan cathedral the staff also is very nice Breakfast is very tasty and includes cold cuts salads scrambles eggs bacon and sausages What I ve liked the most that the combination of a very quiet street in the middle of the old center of the city No doubt that in my next visit to Vienna I will choose to stay here again 
315456,Graben Hotel, Early morning construction noise starting 7am Audible if you have a room at the front of the hotel may not be if your room is at the back , Good shower Spotlessly clean rooms Helpful staff happy to help with restaurant reservations etc 
315457,Graben Hotel, Rooms are very smal Out of the window I looked onto another wall 3 meters away The Elevator is incredible slow thus I waited 2 3 Minutes every time I can t see why this should be a 4 star Hotel , location is nice just beside St Stefans Cathedral Many choices to eat nearby Breakfast is ok though not exciting 
315458,Graben Hotel, The view from the window there was none Made it very dull , Room was excellent Nice quiet Lovely bathroom Fabulous breakfast every morning staff there were very friendly helpful 
315459,Graben Hotel, Our AC was broken and they tried to move us to another room where the AC was broken as well We were very hot , Location is good the room was a decent size The attached restaurant was great 
315460,Graben Hotel,No Negative, STAFF you don t have even to ask They each one of the staff receptionist bell boy room cleaner restaurant they ask you if they can help You see that they are really happy to help 
315461,Graben Hotel, In a perfect world cheaper, Really comfortable rooms good air conditioning in the heat found us a room when we arrived at 8am All staff were always friendly and so were other guests Nice view of rooftops from room Very central and handy but not noisy Great breakfasts too Handy to metro Lots of restaurants nearby
315462,Graben Hotel, Can t really complain about anything but I would have preferred two smaller pillows rather than a large one but that s a really small thing , Location perfect just 2 minutes away from the cathedral yet the room was really quiet The staff were really friendly and helpful the breakfast was good except the gluten free bread which was terrible but they did their best the room was comfortable and the wifi fast 
315463,Graben Hotel, Absolutely nothing, Not a classy sumptuous hotel which you would normally pay a fortune to stay but excellent in every way Location superb restaurant excellent and the most pleasant and helpful staff Would certainly recommend it for anyone on a short break Everything is within walking distance
315464,Graben Hotel,No Negative, The Graben made for a perfect holiday in Vienna I stayed there 6 nights Very central to all the sights to visit the shopping traffic free malls very well insulated perfectly comfortable bed with continental doona extra large pillows Chocolates on bed daily a real treat Staff professional extremely courteous and showed genuine interest as to how I d spent my day in Vienna Lunch box on day I left a lovely gesture early checkout before breakfast Highly recommend this hotel 
315465,Graben Hotel,No Negative, An extremely polite and helpful stuff clean rooms facilities An excellent breakfast Excellent location Right next to the Graben Karntner Strase Vienna major attractions are near by Just 1 minute walk to Stephansplatz U Bahn station lines 1 3 
315466,Graben Hotel, Noise at 7am on one of the weekdays ok its downtown , Very friendly service especially breakfast staff even minutes before breakfast ended all is topped up Oh and and it is right across Kaffehaus Hawelka They should maybe include that in the description for folks who have previously been to Vienna hehe 
315467,Graben Hotel,No Negative, Location Location Location It was located just a short walk from the station and St Stephen s cathedral The staff at the reception were very welcoming and helped us with information whenever required 
315468,Graben Hotel,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and helpful whether with booking transfers printing boarding passes or deciding somewhere to visit Rooms were very clean as was the rest of the hotel Good choice of food at breakfast and the restaurant food was very good and reasonably priced Location was fab 
315469,Graben Hotel, Bedroom window looked out onto a wall Although the bathroom just cleaned each day the floor wasn t swept during my stay, The staff were very friendly and helpful at all times Breakfast was varied with an ample choice
315470,Graben Hotel,No Negative, Located in the heart of the Innere Stadt steps away from the metro that is two stops away from the rail link to the airport Many of the major attractions of old Vienna are a short walk away Nearby are Stephansplatz Hofburg Stadtpark Albertina Volksoper and many others The staff was very accommodating and helpful The breakfast was very nice and offered many choices 
315471,Graben Hotel, The only addition I would make to the room is to have a little kettle to make a cup of tea Pretty minor issue though , The location was excellent and the breakfast had a great selection I found the staff attentive and friendly The room was comfortable and clean 
315472,Graben Hotel, Although most staff are great there are 1 or 2 which come across a little rude which might be due to language A little stricter towards dress rules for the breakfast team would be good , Great location right by the Stephansdom Plenty of great restaurants with local cuisine around the area Spacious rooms and very clean Good choice for breakfast 
315473,Graben Hotel, rather expensive taken into account conditions size of the room the window view and lack of any desk except maybe of a tiny short table The main disadvantage lack of desk during a buisness trip it may be a problem and for me it was , Vey nice staff very tidy and excellent location 
315474,Graben Hotel, I was surprised by the lack of deligent cleaning of our hotel room As we were in the room only after a tiring day of museums and sightseeing it did not matter how clean it was However our room was not cleaned each day and when it was cleaned it seemed very poor The staff was very accomdating with everything else though extra blankets provided , Superb location when you have only a few days in Vienna It was also super easy to find from different directions as it is right next to St Stephen s cathedral Delicious breakfast which is a rare for me 
315475,Graben Hotel,No Negative, The location is perfect The hotel is nice not luxurious but clean tidy and cosy The rooms are comfortable and quiet The staff is very friendly and always trying to help The breakfast is very good and the staff was bringing food until the last minute to replace everything that was running low 
315476,Graben Hotel,No Negative, The staff were unfailingly helpful and courteous The room was comfortable and well serviced Breakfast was excellent and the restaurant was very good and modestly priced 
315477,Graben Hotel, The only things I did not like were the blinds in the bedroom were too thin and allow the light through No enough English tv channels and the shower towel was a bit too small , Staff were very friendly and helpful all the time Location is excellent Breakfast was very good and the room comfortable 
315478,Graben Hotel, I still recommend this hotel but 2 minor things worth mentioning just for clients to be prepared 1 single blankets only hotel does not have doubles 2 no kettle in the room you need to go downstairs to the restaurant for tea or any other hot beverages very inconvenient during winter stay or when it s cold outside I also had to remind about getting robe and slippers, I stayed the in January 2016 and do recommend this hotel for accommodation staff was very welcoming and extremely helpful all the requests were immediately fulfilled breakfasts are good served in the restaurant which belongs to the hotel the room was very warm and comfortable and very clean location is brilliant worth staying and is highly recommended
315479,Graben Hotel, First I got terrible rooms with a view to the wall and my friend with small child I was surprise to met this in Austria and I complained at reception Maybe because i am coming from Croatia Lady on reception was not polite but change rooms It was not nice beginning of Advent stay in Vienna I will never more to choose this hotel , Location
315480,Graben Hotel, The elevator was slow and when we arrived workers were using it to move chairs and ibuilding materials to a higher floor We had to wait two trips for the elevator before we were able to get up to our room To be fair it only happened the one time however it was still annoying , The location was tops the room quite large and quiet and the best breakfast buffet I have had in a long time Breakfast staff were always cheerful and helpful 
315481,Graben Hotel,No Negative, The location is excellent The building looks 1 2 centuries old but fully renovated The room was clean and comfortable WiFi was fast and stable I liked the breakfasts too If I come again I ll stay in Graben hotel
