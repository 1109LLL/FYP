151827,Madeleine Plaza, Room on the tiny side but I m guessing most rooms in Paris are, Friendly staff good English Nice area easy to walk to most tourist attractions if you have a good map Lovely place very clean
151828,Madeleine Plaza, Reqiuired to return the key to the reception and pick it up again when coming back , Very good location Close to almost everything Walking distance to many attractions and public transportation 10minutes walk to Roissy bus to and from the airpot 
151829,Madeleine Plaza,No Negative, Incredible location Walking distance to all major sights We were upgraded to a deluxe room and would pay for this if went back Amazing big room with view of eiffel tower separate bathroom and toilet Really loved it 
151830,Madeleine Plaza, Everything was fine The only thing I suggest to the hotel is to put more attention to the minibar It is very poor the selection , The room has a wonderful view to the Madeleine church A little balcony where you can appreciate the sky 
151831,Madeleine Plaza, Water leaked out of the container of the coffee machine After replacement the coffee made out of this machine was not hot enough worked insufficiently , The location was perfect just at the back of Eglise de la Madeleine I was able to shuttle back and forth for shopping Considering this location and a price this is Paris the size of the room was sufficient with a loft equipped with a third bed The breakfast was rather generous with such basic stuff as croissant brioche baguette ham cheese beverage The recepation staff was supportive 
151832,Madeleine Plaza, We love comfy bed if that can be improved it will be better , The location of the hotel was good the metro is right next to the hotel and there are lots of shops and cafe within the walking distance We could just walk to many tourist attractions 
151833,Madeleine Plaza,No Negative, Bed was comfortable sheets were clean enough space to store clothes The staff were very accommodating and friendly Would come back for my next trip to Paris 
151834,Madeleine Plaza, The room was rather small but bright and very clean Low ceiling in the bathroom not ideal for showering but clean and bright and comfortable, Smaller hotel in the city center of Paris Lovely friendly and very helpful staff Excellent hotel for the Paris Marathon Great value for money Comfortable beds 
151835,Madeleine Plaza, We stayed on a hot day in March so the heating rather than the air conditioning was on which made the room rather warm but the helpful reception staff apologised in advance and offered a fan , Great choice for breakfast Comfortable and quiet room with lovely view of the Madeleine Excellent central location with good public transport links on the doorstep Friendly welcoming and efficient staff 
151836,Madeleine Plaza, Room super small hard to put 2 luggages and less of choice for the buffet breakfast, The Location right on the downtown and shopping area view quite perfect face to the Madeline ofcourse need to pay more to get this view 
151837,Madeleine Plaza,No Negative, We had a wonderful stay in this hotel Totally friendly and polite staffs Try to make everything possible Great view at the church Very central and safe area
151838,Madeleine Plaza, Nothing bad about hotel only downside was the price of the taxi from the train station to the hotel 85 complete rip off , Great location within walking distance to all the main attractions Great if you re a shopping fan too Plenty of nearby restaurants to choose from Room was exactly as described cosy double and staff very helpful Would Definately go back 
151839,Madeleine Plaza, Not the level of a four star The bathroom was freezing cold The carpet of the room was not clean could feel hair and other stuff on it At breakfast the tables were all squeezed not enough space to sit comfortable Definitely more of a 3star hotel,No Positive
151840,Madeleine Plaza, Maybe having a socket near the bed will be great because guest can plug in their phone for charging before they go to bed , The cheese of the breakfast is soooo good and the fresh orange and grapefruit juice are fantastic 
151841,Madeleine Plaza, Breakfast room cramped with the one and only wait staff member run off her feet for the 5 breakfasts we had Oh and a young boy using his fingers to remove the unwanted fruit from his glass back into the mixed precut fruit salad bowl , Rooms as described and shown in photos Staff very friendly and helpful 
151842,Madeleine Plaza, wanted seperate beds they couldnt do this but because the room was very small we changed room so for this reas n we are obliged to pay extra 60euro per day this was very meaningless and stupid, I liked the location
151843,Madeleine Plaza, No air con and a smell of smoke in the room We could only heat the room with the system that was in the room so we had to leave a window open and then got hard to sleep with the noise from the traffic There was always a smell of cigarettes in the room ,No Positive
151844,Madeleine Plaza, Breakfast was extra , Everything is within a walking distance Fauchon s a wonderful food emporium is next door And the bed was very comfortable 
151845,Madeleine Plaza, broken shower , helpful and polite staff clean cozy room we arrived at 6 00 and they couldn t let us check in as the room is not ready yet but were able at prepare superior room at 12 00 at no extra charge
151846,Madeleine Plaza, One of the male front desk staff wearing glasses was not friendly and helpful enough He will have black face to the customer , The location and view from the room
151847,Madeleine Plaza,No Negative, Everything Location cleanliness breakfast quality of service friendly staff and quick response to our needs requests Front desk officer who checked us in in the evening of sept 28 too bad i forgot his name front desk lady officer assigned in the morning 8 11am lady serving during breakfast and housekeeping 
151848,Madeleine Plaza, Not a bad word to sa, Fantastic location and for the price excellent Staff so welcoming and I got my first ever upgrade I ll be back for sure Thanks so much 
151849,Madeleine Plaza, The rooms have been redecorated but I preferred the previous d cor which was very French , The rooms are cosy comfortable and quiet plus the 5th floor has small balconies which are a great place to enjoy the sunshine The location is very convenient and close to the Metro many shops and restaurants This was my 2nd visit 
151850,Madeleine Plaza, The elevator was out of order We were on the fourth floor The staff seemed to think this was no big deal The wifi was very weak in strength so you were limited as to what you could do on your iPad , The breakfast was great The room was small but clean and everything you need Staff was nice also 
151851,Madeleine Plaza, Breakfast was a bit expensive for those who only wanted coffee and a croissant , The location was excellent we had a room with a balcony overlooking Place de la madeleine The room was just ok for size but the bed was really comfortable and the bathroom was very good 
151852,Madeleine Plaza, Breakfast room a little cramped , Excellent location for both Metro and walking into central areas Comfortable room especially for the price in the location Very good breakfast 
151853,Madeleine Plaza, Only one staff at reception at check out time so the service was slow , The location was excellent and suit us very well The air conditioning was superb They had it on throughout the day to battle with the summer heat 
151854,Madeleine Plaza, There is a valet parking facility nearby that is much less expensive than Indigo parking and no one told us The room is small but adequate, Perfect location in centre of Paris easy for car parks tour buses and Metro 
151855,Madeleine Plaza, Breakfast area a little small , The staff was nice Great location close to Metro and hop on hop off bus Breakfast was good We have two small children and were able to have separate connecting rooms 
151856,Madeleine Plaza, We paid extra for a Eiffel tower view room but didn t have any view of it at all except for a tiny tip at the top over the back of some ugly buildings that are being renovated The room was very over priced it was small dark and very much in need of updating We have asked the manager to contact us about the fact that this is not what we had signed up for but haven t had any communication with him at all Very disappointed indeed which cost us e750 for 2 nights for the room only for that price we would expect to have much better facilities and a far better room and at least what it says on the advert , The location of the Hotel was perfect and staff friendly 
151857,Madeleine Plaza,No Negative, Great location and everything is walking distance from the hotel Lots of restaurants and brassiere just round the corner from the hotel Highly recommend it

151859,Madeleine Plaza, Every thing was fine , Everyone was very helpful with Paris directions and friendly I especially liked my room with its abundance of light The location was perfect for me especially since I usually stay for four years now on rue Royal I now have a new location for my future trips that is more affordable thank you for making it a delight 
151860,Madeleine Plaza, Broken aircon and constant air vent on Doors made the room really cold until a separate heater wass supplied Also construction beam or piping just inside door not making the room preferable for tall guests Room 504, Location and staff 
151861,Madeleine Plaza,No Negative, The room overlooking the facade of the church Proximity to the Bd Haussmann and several restaurants in the area Have a nice breakfast Sympathy and promptness of staff

151863,Madeleine Plaza, Not a bad experience but in the room I prefer parquet than wall to wall carpet, Katia receptionnist was an outstanding nice and helpful person Nice room and bathroom with a beautiful view
151864,Madeleine Plaza, The front desk staff was fairly rude and unhelpful I asked about a breakfast nearby and they dismissed me without a suggestion They also refused to even consider having our room cleaned any earlier than 2pm even though we arrived at 8am after a long flight For what we were paying I was expecting friendlier service , Wifi was excellent location was great bed was incredibly comfortable Overall we had a great stay
