287935,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, There has been some partial renovation going on during daytime There could be some disturbing noise for rooms nearby Apart from that everything was excellent , Perfect facilities with good shopping locations 
287936,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Breakfast was extemely poor food quality just wasn t there and vastly over priced Basic room amenities shower cap plug adapters etc were not readily available No drinking water in the room not even for purchase internet connectivity was not included in the room price and was on a pay as you go basis service once connected was extremely slow warned of this by the hotel staff this property is in no way a luxury property embarrassing to advertise itself as such we would not recommend or re book , the location in the centre of Mayfair is terrific and the staff in the Polo Lounge hotel bar were very friendly and accommodating 
287937,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Staff was generally very unfriendly and miserable at reception with exception of consierge which was kind even tho I asked for an early check in weeks in advance the room was given to me at 4pm The size is so small decor dated and not fresh and room are facing a little street full of rubbish bins Products in the room were never refilled no espresso machine no complementary bottle of water in the room when I asked for it they said it was only for best costumer no spa I just think when you pay this amount for a room you should receive a service that matches your expectation , Location was wonderful but I really don t get how this hotel is a 5 especially part of Luxury collection 
287938,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, It s a shame there is no spa but that is about it , Great location and friendly staff The Alyn Williams restaurant is a must for me whenever I visit Great for and great wine 
287939,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, We could not get the television to work the instructions were not that clear, the service and attention from all the staff was second to none very impressed
287940,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, No free wifi, We have been staying at the westbury for a few years now and it gets better every time We had an upgrade to one of the newly refurbished rooms on our latest trip and it was beautiful Great staff very friendly especially the guys who stand at the doors to welcome you to the hotel 
287941,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Nothing , superb beds with comforters rooms could be larger but general manager upgraded me compliments of the hotel Absolutely nothing was too much trouble for the staff It is without doubt the best service I have ever had at ANY hotel 
287942,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, WIFI not included in the Booking com booking I asked for a quiet room it was just next to the air conditioning units Breakfast is not very exciting no yoghurt or fruit on cereal bar set up its extra bread is sliced no sourdough or interesting cereals Come on Westbury raise your game not everyone wants a basket of croissants , When we asked to be moved to another room this was executed without fuss and very efficiently 
287943,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Wi fi charges are ridiculous in 2017 for a so called premium 5 hotel I missed this point when booking the hotel as if i had seen it I definitely would NOT have booked Small bathrooms out dated Air con heating system Room was cold despite heating on MAX setting , Location that s the only thing going for this hotel 
287944,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Bed was hard and housekeeping did not resolve Tv controller did not work Mix up with room service on tea order Would prefer in room tea facilities so that water can be boiling and tea hot, Had one feather pillow which was lovely and soft 2 would have been nice
287945,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, gym was not good at all Extremely small Used Fitness first gym which was in walking distance Size of the room was small but its London , Location is fantastic great restaurants all around Great staff and very good decor 
287946,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Bathrooms still too small No tea coffee making facilities in the room, All staff charming and very helpful Refurbished rooms very nice although a little dark Location excellent 
287947,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, The majority of staff good the desk staff helpful doorman excellent very abrupt and unpleasant female manager in restaurant Would not go again would not expect staff like that in a 5 star hotel , Very comfortable bed spacious room 
287948,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Wifi price is absurd even for a hotel of this category Pricey breakfast too but there are many alternative places nearby A few electric plugs outlets close to the bed would be nice , Great location and friendly welcome Staff is very helpful rooms are comfortable and well furnished Ours was recently refurbished so just perfect 
287949,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, We had booked two rooms Both the rooms were really old The bathrooms had cracked tiles Didn t make me feel comfortable staying in a hotel like that, Liked the situation and the staff
287950,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Should have tea coffee making facilities in the room When booking a Deluxe room one would expect complimentary WIFI and water at the least WIFI is complimentary in most hotels these days and in 5 star hotels one fines that water is also complimentary Most 5 star hotels also have coffee machines , The room had nice view over Bond Street The renovation is nice the bathrooms are much nicer than before though still on the small side The staff are also very polite and helpful The location for me is superb hence why I continue to stay at the hotel despite the shortfalls mentioned 
287951,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, The hotel feels very high end but signs of wear are everywhere in the public spaces worn carpets stains brass polish chipped or worn off completely in the elevator The rooms are in great shape though We stayed here twice over the weekend a Friday night paid for by a client then Sunday night on our own dime The Friday night room was a suite but the experience was checkered The internet which is costly worked only 10 15 minutes at a time before requiring a modem restart to work again I only learned this trick and where the modem was hidden in the room from the concierge who came up to investigate the first time I called down After quickly getting tired of re booting 4 times an hour they sent maintenance to have a look Of course when he arrived it was working and he said to call the next time it went off so he could send my exact IP address to the server in Greece to lock me onto the network But I was leaving for an event so couldn t wait around for it to kick me off again I would have much preferred just a replacement modem to solve the problem or some similar resolution but ended up dealing with it for the 18 hours we were there Then at 4 30am we could clearly hear the neighbors awake and having a lively conversation through the wall We eventually called down to the front desk to ask them to politely quiet them down But nothing came of it and by 6am we were up anyways But why the soundproofing was so non existent is a bigger question , The location is excellent and the room service was very good The bath products in particular were high end 
287952,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, There is no privcy I can hear both rooms talking and i listen to the tv very clearly the walls are thin i think, The location is the best thing in mayfair the room service is 24hour and is great
287953,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, No tea making facilities in the room No water in the room only in mini bar costing 3 50 for a small bottle, Location was brilliant so central Staff very nice and helpful

287955,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, I feel it s a shame that we still have to pay for WiFi in this day and age more so considering the class of this hotel The 4G coverage is good and fast w EE so avoid paying extra money for a slow and insecure WiFi connection if you can avoid it Breakfast is way too expensive Walk 10 minutes East and you ll find many decent places for breakfast for a reasonable price , The location couldn t be better The hotel has a charm of its own and is well maintained The staff is really helpful and friendly The beds are comfortable depending on the size of your room you might feel somewhat cramped but it remains comfortable Bathrooms are spotless I ve stayed here several times over the last 10 years and it s still one of my favourite hotels in London 3
287956,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Ask for ice twice but never receive and would ave liked tea and coffee already in room and included with no extra cost never had to pay for tea and coffee before in 5star hotel I men how much is a tea bag, Staff all very friendly like that windows opened and had view

287958,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Breakfast was so so We seated in the over flow restaurant for breakfast the service somehow is lacking , The location is superb and employees are friendly and very helpful 
287959,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, For a 5 star and expensive hotel i find it ackward that you have to pay for WiFi and breakfast and no coffee in the room , The location was great
287960,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, There was a serious noise problem They started banging on things at 8am both mornings They offered to move the room but now I m awake Also there was an Internet problem , It was beautiful and the location was great 
287961,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Staff at front desk are unaccommodating no newspapers no bottles of water and NO wifi No tea or coffee station , Location and excellent bar The Polo Lounge 
287962,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Awoken at 6am by incredibly loud noises above us strange as we were on the highest floor 7th Sounded like the Carpets were being cleaned by an industrial machine Was very disruptive and of course ruined our sleep The staff needs to work on their service with the exception to the doormen and porters The man who checked us in was not friendly whatsoever he was very cold and dry , The porters and doormen were very friendly helpful and pleasant 
287963,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Oh London traffic kept me awake this time Not the hotel s fault can t the city actually go to bed The bathroom is dinky good job we are slim , The lovely Polo Bar my daughter and I nearly walked into Michael Douglas Great Cocktails and friendly staff 
287964,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Thermostat for the hot cold water wasn t working properly and there was a lack of hanging space in the small wardrobe, The staff are a credit to the hotel always pleasant and keen to to solve any problems The Polo Bar is a must for cocktails and relaxing
287965,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Wifi costed 24 extra per three days and didn t work properly I told about this when paying the bill You have to inform about this duriong your stay when they will shut the wifi down and start it again , Good location
287966,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, I m pretty sure I was double charged for drinks and food but no receipts 500 for 3 burgers and 2 hours drinks seems steep Would be nervous and careful in staying there again ,No Positive
287967,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Tea making facilities should have been in room on arrival if ordered previously in my opinion , An impressive extensive breakfast menu Excellent staff in all areas 
287968,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Beds a little hard Really disappointed no tea or coffee facilities in room Expected to use room service or pay 3 95 for use of kettle Sure these facilities were there last time I stayed , location excellent

287970,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, We could hear the TV and people chatting in in the next room and the shower door did not work at all , location is perfect and reception and bar are beautiful 
287971,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, They charge far too much for wifi and films over 10 for 24 hours and 10 plus per film for out of date movies is just too much , I have stayed at least 10 times and it is very good and the the japanese restaurant is first class 
287972,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, WIFI kept dropping out Bit pricey Internet radio didn t work Bit tired overall but I am assuming the whole place is gradually being refurbished , The refurbished room was a vast improvement The concierge service is excellent So was the valet 
287973,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, No smoking rooms I do really can t understand why do they treat the smokers in this way At least other hotels do offer smoking floor for the smokers , I do really loved the location and the staff all of them 
287974,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Minor quibbles only Didn t get our newspaper and if you are arriving by foot it would be helpful to know that the hotel entrance is not on Bond Street It s actually on Conduit Street , Nice and quiet with very good firm bed 
287975,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, BAD Treatment from staff and very small dirty room three days the house keeping is not putting tissue in toilets and when we asked them later the said sorry we don t have stock now they brought latter imagin I paid 445 pounds And I got such services, Its only location is perfect 
287976,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, I didn t like the way they dealt with my wife and kids I have booked two rooms for all of us via booking com However the second room was booked for me when I arrive later after them Any way when they arrived the refused that one adult my wife and 3 kids can stay in one room My wife told that we have booked second room but later when I arrive Any way I can understand there point and enforcement of having the second room BUT what I don t like the rate they give her almost double what we had form booking 446 pounds per night for one room and the room was tiny small with a very noisy sound of AC like a turbine Really found this very bad as my wife was alone and arrived late and tired and they enforce her to take the room for this high price Although I m staying with them almost 10 nights one room 8 nights the second room , Location is very Good
287977,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, junior staff concierge door staff are a bit uppity, Reception reacted very positively to the only complaint I had and offered a more than adequate solution
287978,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Room was tiny when we told them this they offered to move us but they moved us to the same room jus on a different floor wouldn t say it was 5 no irons available no bottles of water at side of bed had to pay 3 out of mini bar our friends room was next to staff room or laundery room and they kept slamming there door which Kent the bed shook We told staff but they didn t seem bothered they had our money they where happy, Location and breakfast
287979,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, The tv remote control was dodgy although this is often the case in hotels , We enjoyed cocktails wine and an excellent light supper in the Polo Bar The birthday cake for two in the room was a nice acknowledgement of my mothers birthday 
287980,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, I have been coming to the Westbury for over three years 3 to 4 times a year Each time they don t have my file on record and we go through the details each time I travel about 100 days a year and every other hotel that I stay at as often knows me and my preferences,No Positive
287981,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London,No Negative, The room was a little bit dated and tight for space as their were two of us sharing but the location of the hotel is excellent I found the staff to be friendly and helpful and I would definitely stay here again 
287982,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Deluxe King Room had bathroom with floor space Less than 1 metre squared The smallest bathroom I have ever experienced in any hotel not to mention a hotel that says it is five star Very disappointing given the rate For this reason we will never return ,No Positive
287983,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Breakfast room is so small you will almost certainly have to wait 20 to 30 mins for a table ridiculous in this class of hotel No feedback to this at checkout Croissants are TINY , The staff were helpful except for checkout when there was a total lack of feedback to our comments Room was very good

287986,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, They could have offered us the suite to start with after all the London marothon was on and i m sure they would have let the room on the Saturday I also would not like to see the original room we booked for 274 a night , We booked for 2 nights and could only stay for 1 The hotel would not refund the second night but said they would give us an upgrade The upgrade was a room with 2 connecting doors We could here drilling going on and the conversation next door We complained again and where given a suite with full breakfast in the room the next morning 
287987,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, There was nothing I didn t like , The staff were brilliant there were always lots of people around to greet you serve you at reception concierge and help you with your bags etc I was very impressed Loved the location too as you feel like you re in a nice area and really central too 
287988,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Alyn williams Very enjoyable excellent staff and food presentation A fine dining experience But chat with chef and ask him if he would have eaten the mutton undercooked too that I was served pretending to be lamb It reminded me of school dinners Fatty gristly and completely unacceptable for any restaurant let alone a starred one,No Positive
287989,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Room was on the small side and the walls quite thin as we could hear the occupants in the room next door having a conversation early in the morning , Exceptional staff a real credit to the hotel hotel was perfectly located for our needs it was my fianc es 30th birthday weekend treat and the hotel did not disappoint we will most definitely be returning 
287990,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, No free internet , The hotel upgraded us with a suite because of the noises in the next room The handy the smart phone offered free from the hotel it was really helpful
287991,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Bed too firm Breakfast should be included in price 52 for breakfast for us both No kettle in room 5 99 for tea , Good staff good location very clean 
287992,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, There are no facilities to make a drink in the room Which when you re early risers like us you have to wait until Starbucks opens at 7 30 or pay 5 25 plus an additional surcharge Also as there is no kettle would be useless for travelers with babies like we normally are as there is no way to warm a bottle or sterilise We asked at reception for a mug of hot water for my husband before he ran the marathon they refused , Nice room comfy bed great location We travelled up for the london marathon so this was a great base for us They were great with our luggage on both days before we could check in and after we checked out 
287993,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Only a minor thing no tea coffee making facility in room , On check in the staff were lovely and even upgraded our room as it was a trip for my partner s 30th birthday The room was very nice and after returning to our room a little later on a beautiful chocolate dessert with fruit had been left for us with the message happy birthday Very thoughtful The location is brilliant 5 minute walk and you re in Piccadilly Circus with plenty of restaurants things to do Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely return again 
287994,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Didn t like that there is a fee for wifi You can get free wifi on buses these days Didn t feel like a 5 star experience as been in other hotels that have been just as good, Comfy bed and good location
287995,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Tv and wifi not for free you need to buy it it s little old hotel, I call day before to make sure everything is ok when i came I didn t fine my booking request as i ask and double check breakfast was really good and the location also
287996,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, No tea making facilities The first hotel I have stayed in regardless of star rating that did not have tea making facilities in the room Awful hair dryers Old fashioned tube that are no use especially when you have long hair No free wifi Paying guests had to pay Outrageous Had staff knock on door and then wait for a few seconds then walked straight in Did not allow you chance to answer the door Twice this happened, Location
287997,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, The furniture needs updating The parcking as the door man stated is 50 a day which is a quite expensive compare to many around the area There is no Halal food for Muslims The menu is also very limited The Arabic channels are so limited too My credit card was charged 1000 regards to a claimed carpet damage with out my authorisation They even did so after paying the complete amount at the last night of my family stay at the hotel However I made a despute and got my money back This issue won t forbid me from staying at the hotel again sometime , The location was very good Most of the staff are friendly and helpful The hotel clean compare to many in the same level of stars 
287998,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, The staff wasn t very helpful and the amenities i had requested prior had not been fulfilled and the staff didn t seem to bothered The location is what saved it for me and the F B their staff was amazing and the food was great too other than that i wouldn t say this is a 5 star hotel , The location 
287999,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Needs renovation Old and ugly decoration Bathroom so old without separate shower and very small No coffee pot in the room luck of 5 star amenities And please change Windows old and dis fictional , Location the best Bed comfortable 
288000,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Tea coffee making facilities would have been appreciated The room size was ok but a little on the small size , The bed was very comfortable the furnishings and decoration were of a good quality 
288001,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, I could hear the TV from the room next to me like it was in my room Really bad Elevators look old and outdated Very expensive breakfast , Maybe the best location in London right in the middle of Mayfair off Bond Street and 2 minutes walk from Regent Street Very nice bar The Polo Bar for relaxing drinks and food Nice sushi restaurant inside the hotel Good value for money in London 
288002,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Very small room given the price , The room was beautifully decorated loved the lighting particularly Extremely comfortable bed And the doorman was so friendly and helpful 
288003,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Drilling in the next room was so loud Despite asking and bring promised there would be no works going on the next morning we were woke up by workmen hammering , Amazing location Lovely room
288004,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Very dated rooms Lobby I expected more for a 5 Star Hotel Price is defintely to high , Great Location Perfect for business and leisure Polo Bar is great 
288005,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, No free wifi No tea and coffee in the room The double bed was actually two single beds put together which is horrible and uncomfortable Tiny bathroom for the type of room, Location was great
288006,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, The first room we were allocated was small and rather dreary but the second room on level 7 was a big improvement The tasting menu at the A W restaurant was we felt not as good as on a previous visit the choice was rather limiting , Excellent staff very friendly and helpful Our request to move to another room because of the noise from work being undertaken and also the size of the room was swiftly done Excellent breakfast 
288007,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London,No Negative, On arrival at the hotel I was told my reservation had been upgraded from a deluxe King room to a junior suite I was pleased about this as I had paid a premium rate for my room as the hotel was heavily booked The suite was located on the 4th floor and had just been refurbished It was extremely comfortable The staff in the hotel were all courteous and helpful A great place to stay in the heart of Mayfair 
288008,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Small room although called a superior room Shower was below standard and needed replacing Nowhere to hang bathrobe TV all too complicated didn t need a whole keyboard just a remote Thin walls Could hear exactly what was happening in next room which made me uncomfortable Rather aggressive receptionist on check in No instructions on room safe it was not as other hotel safes Very poor internet at very high charge In room tea or coffee facilities would have been nice as I do not sleep well and a warm drink usually helps but I was not about to call room service for a cup of warm water , Location
288009,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Our room was cosy verging on small The bathroom was also a little tight for space but was well appointed apart from the rather disappointingly feeble shower Extras were all very expensive 12 for tea for two in the caf and nearly 4 for a Mars bar in the minibar , A luxury hotel in the heart of the West End Although the Westbury is not a well known hotel it has a load of charm Attentive and charming staff provide great service We booked on a special weekend deal and it was a bargain 
288010,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, They really should have free Wi Fi in all areas This is 2016 and this is a 5 star hotel Would also to be nice to have tea coffee making facilities in room , Great location and helpful staff My husband forgot his toothbrush and within minutes of request a dental kit was brought to the room 
288011,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, The showers could be updated , The Service was exemplary and the beds very comfortable food fantastic location perfect Overall I highly recommend this hotel 
288012,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, they charge for wifi at 200 a night for a room this is just fleecing the customer whereas the breakfast and drinks etc are good and not overpriced probably just a throwback but i have spent more on my stays last year than my home broadband for the entire year , Great staff Quiet international london vibe Cool sophistication in bar but also good for business i have stayed loads of times and probably the easiest decent hotel for business with a bit of shopping thrown in Efficient non intrusive and the sushi bar is actually in my top 3 for london 
288013,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, We found this hotel substandard in most respects The Superior King Room was not superior quite the reverse The room service was disappointing The charges for many items were excessive especially on the breakfast menu We found this hotel very disappointing and inadequate in all respects especially the manager s response to our email of complaint which was dismissive and not worthy of what used to be a good hotel An apology would have sufficed Someone in senior management needs to take note of what many people are reporting about this hotel in our opinion in no way should it carry a 5 star quality rating In no way will we be back , The Location 
288014,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Even though its Christmas time reception stuff were rude and generally all stuff were not helpful Difference in room menu Prices than when placing order Room was very small , The LOCATION 
288015,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London,No Negative, since I cannot express myself with regards to the breakfast service I would like to suggest a buffet same as in other hotels of the same standard and as it used to be before at this hotel 
288016,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Noise in the room with building works in what seemed to be next door Out late into the early morning didnt expext works to start at 10am, Staff location and the bar
288017,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Expensive food and drink and no tea coffee facilities in room Rooms very hot , location location location Rooms spacious comfortable and clean Staff friendly and helpful 
288018,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Compact bedroom was a kittle disappointing didn t quite fulfil our 5star stay expectations , Perfect location for our intended designer shopping experience As we travelled by car the excellent value for money valet parking service was a must Service was what we would expect from a 5 star hotel great atmosphere within the hotel 
288019,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, The table charges if you order room service And there is no coffee maker in the room , Just amazing location very very professional and helpful staff I wish I ve stayed there earlier But I will always do m best to get a room in it in the future 
288020,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, We had to pay for a kettle wifi and some bottled water in our room First time we ve had to do this in this quality of hotel, good location
288021,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, We occupied room 322 workmen were drilling in the room above until 17 00 started again at 08 45 the following morning I do not think any hotel should give customers a room under or adjacent to a room which is being renovated ,No Positive
288022,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, I asked for an early checkin but there were no rooms available because it was urgent I had to upgrade to a larger room only to pay an extra 40 which I didn t think was fair , Amazing location for shopping
288023,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Our excellent room was a little tired eg cracked wash basin should be on the list for a refurb perhaps , Consistantly comfortable and welcoming throughout we slall return 
288024,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, I find it strange that in 2015 an hotel charges 12 5 GBP a day for connection to WiFi instead of providing this for free This spoils the overall enjoyment Also a small touch such as a bottle of water in the room at night would be welcome , Location is great Room large Bed comfortable Quiet Staff polite and helpful Breakfast good 
288025,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, There is only one thing that I don t like that they don t have a free internet access, The staff was very friendly as usual but this time they welcomed me much more warmer and for the first time they were aware and mentioned that I am staying there very often They also said which room I like and usually prefer to stay in It was good to have been remembered 
288026,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, There was no complimentary water in the room which we usually get in any hotel we travel in around the world The shower fixing was leaking the bathroom door was difficult to open and the tap was not working properly Very disappointed in our stay this time , Concierge very friendly and helpful
288027,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, My only concern was the service at Breakfast on our 1st morning we waited nearly 40 mins for our breakfast second morning after waiting over 10 mins for our order the service after I could not fault plenty of staff but they do not seem organised, The staff in the Polo Lounge Reception and Housekeeping we brilliant and so efficient The room was great helpful doormen really enjoyed our stay
288028,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, Having stayed at this property many times it is astonishing that not once have I found a friendly affable member of staff Surly doormen self important front desk clerks and generally very unfriendly It is obvious they are used to dealing with a certain type of clientele and their attitude is arrogant and unhelpful There are plenty of hotels to opt for and we are grateful not to be obliged to stay at Westbury , Location is very central 
288029,The Westbury A Luxury Collection Hotel Mayfair London, The hotel was very dirty and I had breakfast in the restaurateur in ground floor the resturant was smil bad and the food took long time to be ready I changed my room three times from 424 to 620 to 402 because of the noise I really very upset because the bed were very dirty and I felt my body was eiching me The Wifi were not free while most of the hotel provide it free of charge The laundry service were very slow and some times they are not answering the phone In general I left the hotel with very bad feeling,No Positive
