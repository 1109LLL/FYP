453252,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The staff could me more friendly it was very noisy at the hotel bathroom door was transparent and didn t close properly, The subway is 2 steps away from the hotel very convenient
453253,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, View was boring building wall Parking garage was expensive 22 one night and there weren t parking space for our car outside Area was mainly full of asian markets or restaurants , Nice n clean hotel Executive floor rooms were big Staff were friendly helpfull and they spoke english Breakfast was good lots of options 
453254,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Had dinner at the hotel the first night and the food was not good I would recommend eating elsewhere the food is better and cheaper at restaurants around the hotel , Location was perfect for me right across from Metro station and easily able to access places in the city 
453255,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Insulation between rooms is very poor there was a door that seperated our room from the next room and we could literally hear each movement and sound from the next room Location is another problem jf you are planning to walk arround vienna as it is almost 25 minutes walk from the city center , Clean friendly staff great breakfast
453256,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Small rooms Thin uncomfortable door to the bathroom We had to take two double rooms as there were no family rooms We got rooms in the quiet part of the hotel so tourist groups didn t disturb us The sorrounding of the hotel so so but it is Wienna , Nice staff car garage clean Air conditioning close to the center and good connection with Schenbrunn Room was street view but quiet if you don t open the window air conditioning 
453257,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The Walls a little bit dirty , Very close to the center City about 20 30 min With a big parking a specious room and a very cosy bed I ll be back
453258,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, This hotel has different management types some are younger patriots of the hotel Others are core of the hotel the gang of mixed Asian nations The restaurant spoons and forks have been repeatedly not clean enough so was the staff and we requested return of the money for breakfast that was done with some small pressure , This hotel is just good for one day visitors to Vienna by bus and then one would never notice those details Ideal location is the major factor of choice by the way for many Room was clean Internet fine cleaning staff very nice selected staff people extremely good 
453259,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Bathroom had a leak that flooded the floor and after several mentions nothing has been fixed The forth night on a five night stay after one more mention they proposed to change our room and upgrade our stay After the upgrade and despite the better room we had one more bad experience a small amount of cash was missing , The location is great is right opposite the metro underground station There are a lot of cafes and restaurants in walking distance Quiet neighbourhood 
453260,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, AC was extremely noisy and was starting by itself even if it was switched off Problem wasn t solved after complaining probably it was hard to identify it if not keep it under surveulance for 30 40 minutes Room was very dark Outdated Furniture Having 2 small botle of Water in the room one still and one sparkling and nothing else in the Minibar with no procelist you expect that the water is complementary , Great Location near Metro station 
453261,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Rooms are very small congested Since it s a big hotel my room was quite far from the elevator There is no good view from the window Would loved to have more lights in the room , Very friendly helpful staff and the hotel is very near to the Tram station with proper local transport connectivity Very nice breakfast with loads of varieties Bathroom was quite big Good wifi connection Value for money deal 
453262,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Bedroom aircon extremely noisy and impossible to turn off for more than a few minutes automatically came on again even with the window wide open Had to wear earplugs to sleep Poor pillow too Felt that the hotel needed general refurbishment , Straightforward no nonsense place Good breakfast spacious bedroom friendly and helpful staff 
453263,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, I was given a sort of a corner room which might have affected its size and set up This upset me a lot since it was my understanding I pay for a regular room of the class I was renting The bathroom was cramped you can hit the sink with your head while sitting on the toilet apologies for detail When I just arrived to the room I found hair in the bathroom and on the bed The bar had nothing from the list it supposed to have except for 2 small bottles of water it would be nice for the hotel to offer as a courtesy a free bottle of water especially in summer I don t plan to stay again there it has to be mentioned though that the price offered by the hotel was among the attractive on average in the city at the time I searched though not low It seems to be a mass hotel and that is definitely affecting its quality for instance the trash was not taken out of trash bin after the first day , The staff was helpful though after I insisted upon receiving assistance the first reaction was to tell me I could not be helped 
453264,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, I wish they had told us at check in that for an extra 10 we could have upgraded our room This would have given us more towels bathrobe tea making facilities and a late check out for 3pm which would have really suited us We found out as we were leaving the hotel , Good size room and bed Functioning TV Small shower but plenty of hot water 
453265,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien,No Negative, Great hotel in a easily accessible location Lovely and well furnitured room Very good breakfast which gave a good start of the day The Staff was very friendly We arrived with our baggies a bit early and they provided room for us We spent 3 days here with our good memories 
453266,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, We did not like the bathroom very small The shower could not lock properly it was small and much water leaked out on the floor There were no hooks for the clothes The price for the breakfast offer is high The breakfast selection is average Coffee from the machine is poor The breakfast hall is large crowded and very noisy We did not have good morning feeling from it We would choose place to eat out for example Naschmart a famous market with many stalls and restaurants offering products from different countries It is about 10 minutes on foot from the hotel There is also Billa supermarket round the corner , The location and the access to the hotel by the underground is the best thing about the hotel The room was clean and we could adjust air conditioning although it was a bit noisy We recommend the room overlooking the inner yard You can mention it when doing your reservation The room was quiet even if we opened the window The staff at the reception were prompt and very polite too You can pay by all types of credit cards They have a locked storage room where you get your baggage labelled so it is safe As for the underground travel the best way is to buy one or more day tickets which allows you to use all public transport There is a nice cycling path close the hotel 
453267,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, It was not warm welcome at all I booked double room and they gave me twin room And the excuse was anything else is already full While I was booking there was exactly said double room not an option Finally someone else from reception found a double room Anyway it was annoying to argue with them after long journey Also other guests had problem with parking because they didnt had free space and guests had to park on the streets and pay for it extra , Hotel location was next to the metro so that You can go anywhere with that Without metro it was not so easy to walk anywhere You have to pay extra for the breakfast 
453268,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien,No Negative, I congratulate the personnel of the hotel that contributed to a pleasant stay in the hotel I thank you all for recovering a ring I forgot in the room Congratulate for the excellent training of personnel 
453269,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Our air conditioning only worked when we took the key card out of the slot that enables the lights to turn on In other words if we wanted to keep cool we had to do without lighting during the night We reported this on our second day of our four night stay and were told they d send somebody to check it out but we never heard anything more and the problem continued , Nice people good breakfast very good location just steps away from the Underground stop and the Karlsplatz was just two stops away 
453270,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, It is noisy but places with good transport connections tend to be so My Visa was not accepted and it worked perfectly in other places First night at reception I ask is breakfast included in my price yes they say At check out another man says it was not, The hotel looks very good perfectly clean next to metro station In 5 minutes by metro U4 you are in front of Opera And it is half the price of the hotel rooms in the very center of city
453271,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, no thing don t like , Nice location nice location the best location So close to metro station just in front of the hotel door Metro station is almost close to the city centre sight see place Facility is OK room is big bath room is big and nice the staff ask us to with bath room or shower room we choose bath room Staffs are also nice and provide a lot useful information to us 
453272,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Not very major points but Bathroom doors doesn t give you much privacy and airconditioning keeps weird annoying noise , Thinking about the public transportation the location was excellent as hotel was right next to metro station Good breakfast Clean Comfortable beds There are a lot of restaurants nearby Easy access wit public trasportation to all over the city 
453273,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Among disadvantageous is poor wifi connection in the evening it is just impossible to connect to wifi even with mobile phone Breakfast is good but quite simple Business center works 24 7 what is good for discussions but computers there are very slow for work , Overall impression of the hotel is very good Among main advantages is hotel stuff very friendly always eager to help fully corresponds to four stars hotel service Hotel location is not the most central one but still very convinient 1 minute from underground station nice calm area shops and restaurants are around Business room is available 24 7 with possibility to print documents however the internet is very slow and hardly possible to edit documents The area for breakfast is very big 
453274,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien,No Negative, This hotel was perfect for what we needed Rooms are a good size and the staff is very helpful Right across from a metro stop too Luggage storage was a big help too 
453275,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, For sure not a 4 star hotel the air conditioning was probably broken I was not able to make it stop And the shower drain was not functioning well Also the breakfast variety and quality were not 4 star Also parking problems reported by others were annoying but I was already prepared , The position of the hotel is fine pretty close to the city center the room was clean the bed was comfortable and the breakfast was sufficient however the variety was limited and quality average 
453276,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, For breakfast I can give it a rating of 8 was clean staff was good plenty of space however because Im a big eater I would of been happy if there were more selection for the morning , The hotel at first I thought was very far from the city center however after learning there was a metro stop right in front of the hotel and the city only 2 3 stations away this made me feel good about the location 
453277,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, We booked an executive suite which was not so impressive or worth the extra expense Usual amenities slow wife nothing special But clean and comfortable No special view , The location was great right beside the Naschmarkt And right beside a U stop 
453278,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Extremely overpriced hotel Small rooms small bathroom nothing in the minibar Definitely not worth the money they sell their selves on booking com not mention how ridiculous are walk in prices The guy at reception insisted that must have booking com voucher printed the offered to print it for me and finally figured out that he could do the check in without voucher Bathroom was filling with water while showering, Apart from location nothing else to like
453279,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, There is almost no service in this hotel No room service almost no amenities even no bottle of water , Good location Just in front of metro station and very close from shopping 
453280,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The front staff could have known a little about sightseeing , This is a very nice hotel It is located right next to a subway line which makes it easy to get down to old town Yet because it is not located in old town it is in a quiet neighborhood The Internet is fast but requires logging on frequently Our room was modern and the shower was great The front staff seemed too rushed to help us with questions it would be nice if they knew something to help the tourists I would stay here again We arrived via the train station It is too far to walk but easy to get to via the subway the tube From the train station look for line U1 and take it towards Leopoldau the direction of the L name for two stops to Karlsplatz Change trains to U4 in the direction of H tteldorf the direction of the H name NOT the He name for two stops and get off at Pilgramgasse The hotel is across the street on the south exit Easy Use the U4 to get into old town or the other direction to go to Schr nbrunn Castle We found it cheaper to get the 48 hour transit card from the dispensers in the subway stations rather than the 48 hour Vienna tourist card We then got the Sisi Pass from the Sch nbrunn Castle or the Imperial Apartments for entry to three locations 
453281,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, We didn t have the air conditioner work in the room we were in , Location was great and parking was excellent We were to have air conditioning and it did not work in the room which than made the location extremely noisy since we had the window opened but was ok 
453282,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The rooms are quite small in size Had I been travelling for a longer period I would feel myself constrained at some point Also the room service was not available in the evening because all the waiters were busy at the restaurant nevertheless this is a minor complaint that did not affect our stay , Although all the rooms with double beds were busy at the time of our check in the reception provided us with a free upgrade to a room with an even bigger bed and a breathtaking view on the hills over Vienna s rooftops The hotel itself is very fresh and airy the design of the rooms is timeless and hotel guests are a very intelligent publicum 
453283,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, It is actually an enormous hotel quite used I would definitely not classify it as a 4 star 3 would be enough , Quite central situated metro station nearby parking at the property 
453284,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The breakfast selection could be a lot better It would be nicer if the fruit selection was fresh fruits and a bit more variety in the cold food section but saying that it is handy having breakfast before you head off for the day , They had gluten free bread on request for breakfast The underground was outside the hotel door and it was really easy to get anywhere within Vienna from the hotel The staff were friendly and very helpful 
453285,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The hotel serves big groups of tourists which is not bad but breakfast area and lifts will be sometimes overcrowded , The Hotel is very clean big and comfortable Staff is very helpful and polite Public transport station is just opposite the hotel so you can reach the City Center within minutes as well as walk to Mariahilferstrasse but the direct neighborhood of the hotel Naschmarkt personally I did not like it that much 
453286,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Tiny room the most little bathroom i d ever seen Aircondition lives on its own , The only posutive thing of the hotel is a breakfast Really good 
453287,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, No gym, Very close to the center with great and easy transportation options great breakfast big and comfortable room very friendly staff worth every cent 
453288,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, A little detail the water tap is situated in the middle of the bath so if you go in before it s filled the hot water poors directly on your body The minibar only contains two bottles of mineral water that are charged if you use them The place was crawling with Asian tourists The lobby bar and restaurant are not very attactive to spend some time, The hotel is ok Nothing more nothing less Glad there was a seperate breakfast room without the numerous Asian tourists 
453289,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Very old hotel dated reception and lobby area Room seemed somehow renovated but you still feel like everything is old and used not pleasant the bathroom was ok seemed as well recently renovated and it was clean Definetely not a 4 hotel could have been in the past ok but now looks more like 2 , Good connection with the metro and easy reach to airport train city express 
453290,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, We took a standard room Room was clean but a bit shabby we also noticed some black stripes on the walls probably left by bags WC was OK quite old but still functional they forgot to put some soap though Minibar had only sparkling water which is strange for 4 star hotel So our the verdict is if can have a good deal on the room go for it otherwise you may can be disappointed on quality price since the hotel is charging quite a big price up to 600 euro for a room A would probably give the hotel 3 stars not 4 , The location is perfect Close to U4 Pilgramgasse which is only 2 stops from city center and 4 stops to Schonbrunn castle Bed is good and comfortable 
453291,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien,No Negative, Room was clean the hotel is located just across the metro station where you can easily go to anywhere in the city easily Within half an hour walk you can reach the heart of the city The staff was nice
453292,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, If you make few reservations 5 rooms in my case they will not might but they will take your money for all booked rooms upfront with no warning or agreement from your side Very unpleasant especial if you have other plans with this amount On top we got second time the smallest corner room on top of the U bahn underground station , Breakfast could be better Not poor but sure not rich enough 
453293,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Hotel is often very crowded with group tour group reservation Though not really a big deal for me, Location is just across the underground station A very short walk to the hotel And the location is 4 stops away less than 15 mins metro ride to the Rathaus city center 
453294,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The rooms are really old and not maintained On my room the ceileing was flooded and not repaired The paint on the walls was all scratched and the floors were horrible I could compare them with the ones you find in public institutions To me this is not not a 4 star hotel I ve been to better 2 start hotels in Wien Bathroom has a glass sliding door which cannot be completely closed Parking was terribly small and overcrowded I was taxed extra for the parking but they didn t told me that , The position inside Wien is good 
453295,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Bathtube was really narrow struggled to move inside, Very good location no more than expected no less than expected fair price ideal for a traveller close to public transportation
453296,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Shower cabin is somewhat tiny , Central location right next to Pilgramgasse metro station Nice clean room windows can be opened if you try to avoid using AC all the time Friendly professional staff 
453297,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The bathroom actually does not have a door and it is the biggest disadvantage of this hotel Even if you travel with a very close person the door to a toilet should be possible to close it is not a door but a simple sliding something which just slides and does not provide any isolation or privacy , Location 
453298,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, I ve added a comment to my booking made in advance saying that I would be grateful for a clean and quite room as my wife is pregnant and she would like to sleep well and the hotel gave us the room closest to the elevator and in the very begining of the corridor which means that every single guest on the whole floor was passing our room which is not quite at all This is a mockery The garage was full on the day of our arrival so I was forced to search for a parking lot nearby Doing so at midnight was not conveniet at all Extremly crowded hotel Hundreds of tourists are arriving by bus checking in and checking out One or two buses are staying in front of the entrance all the time Very basic food Difficult to find anything tasty The apple we took one was rotten inside The cleaning staff does not care about overall cleaness of the hotel so much that once we saw cleaning quipment left in the elevator that was laying on the floor of cabin for hours and nobody took it On the day of our departure we knew that we had a separate from the crowd restaurants for the breakfast we had two breakfasts before and nobody mentioned it The food is the in all areas in a restarant and in canteen Both electronic keys stoped working on a second day Requires re innovation No slippers in 4 star hotel We paid 400 euros for 3 night stay in a basic double room and I have a strong doubt that hundreds and hundreds of tourists constantly arriving by bus and departing paid the same amount I had a feeling that the hotel earns it s margin on tourist like us who travel not within a company and those who travel by a large company enjoy the rates at least 2 times less This hotel never again and would not recommend to anyone Price did not match the quality at all and on response for request of a quite room the hotel gave us the worst possible option , Very convenient location 12 euro taxi ride to all main tourist attractions 12 
453299,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, I had to change subway twice but was conveniently easy switch after 2 minutes walk , The location was very convenient by the subway station It has many shops and restaurants walking distance 
453300,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The breakfast must suitable for Arabs Muslims Should have Turkish coffee , Despite the hotel hired many employee from the arab countries put that didn t reflect on the breakfast the breakfast must be suitable variety for Arabs Muslims 
453301,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Some noise from the road and from the entrance the window was on the main entrance door , Smiling Friendly staff Especially Mr Mina at breakfast service we arrived late and he was very helpful and friendly 
453302,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Mineral water should be for free as in many high standard hotels , Welcoming staff decent hotel in a good position with decent value for money Recommendable
453303,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The hotel and the room are old The staff is not really friendly The last day on the morning at 8am someone knocked at the door she was shouting housekeeper behind the door I opened the door and the woman asked us what time we will check out I was a bit surprised and I answered that we will go around 11 30 am Its the first time it happened to me , This hotel is closed to the underground You can easily go to the center and to the castle Good breakfast buffet 
453304,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Some of the staff didn t answer our questions properly We had to move once from the initial proposed room because it was too close to the street At the restaurant the lady that sarves the coffee didn t remember twice our request Overall it is a good hotel but the prices are very high relatively to the value that was offered there,No Positive
453305,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Extremely smoke filled lobby Horrible , Great mattress in the room Hotel is right next to the U4 line making it super easy to get in and out of town 
453306,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, I will never choose an Austria Trend hotel ever again Staff was rude and not friendly the rooms were only OK the minibar was empty no toiletries not even a shower cap breakfast was poor Got there asked to pay for parking in the hotel garage put in all my details went to eat came back and I was denied entry in the garage because it was full I will never book this again ,No Positive
453307,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The rooms lack comfort you d expect at this price we stayed on the 7th executive floor especially a shower instead of a bath a tiny and chilly bathroom being stingy with toiletries a plastic can of gel stuck to a wall no cotton pads or anything No kettle , Various and well organized breakfast quiet room comfortable bed plenty of tv channels in a selection of languages friendly and helpful staff great english at the reception right across the metro station 
453308,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, WiFi speed could be improved as well as the WiFi connection which was sometimes discontinued , Very clean quiet comfy and friendly Highly recommendable 
453309,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, , Located at metro station not far from city center Staff were very polite rooms are clean wi fi excelent During weekend parking is free till Monday 10am in streets around hotel what can realy save you around 70 All together realy good value for money 
453310,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The view from some rooms have to be made nicer green roof terrace etc , Good location to the city comfortable rooms and large open spaces in the hotel 
453311,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The rooms were a lot smaller than the pictures made out thought they were small for the price you paid No room facilities for coffee or tea which was disappointing Bathroom was very small had to close door to get in shower , Breakfast had a good choice and was satisfying staff were very friendly and helpful Not happy with our first room but we were moved and upgraded after speaking with reception the upgrade was however the same size room and layout just a better position and decor 
453312,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien,No Negative, Very large room convenient location just in front of the metro station and 1 stop to Naschmarkt It s not the most charming but very good value for money 
453313,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, It was the average apartment in the big hotel We had very small room with ants in the bathroom on the floor , The location was very nice the breakfast was decent the staff was helpful and nice 
453314,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The hotel has 4 stars but it does not correspond to this level The mini bar was empty but during the check out we were asked if we did not take anything from there Cosmetics in the shower are very cheap and substandard There are no slippers no shower cap only soap and shower gel shampoo , The location is perfect 
453315,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The room wall was all scratched and asked for immediate repaint this was the first time I witnessed anything like that at a four star hotel Other than that nice hotel , Nice and friendly staff who speak excellent English Kettle is provided upon request and after payment of 20 EUR deposit refundable on checkout This hotel is located literally seconds walk from U Bahn station Pilgrimgasse and two stations from the heart of Vienna 
453316,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien,No Negative, Very good choice Close to C center metro buses clean very nice staff Room size just enough not very large but for the purpose to have where to sleep enough 
453317,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, First day the showercabin was yellow and smell s urin and two of the 4 towels were dirty one with blood I cleaned the showercabin by myself on 22 30 as we arrived Second day after complains to the cameriere the room was OK Tha aircondition opens automatically in the night every night although it was set to off and it was noisy , Very good location near to the center The metro station is about 20 m Very friendly reception 
453318,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien,No Negative, The breakfast is excellent Staff is very nice very helpful and they offer excellent quality service The hotel location is brilliant with direct access to public transportation a supermarket very close and streets around are alive yet enough quiet for sleep And off course the value for money 
453319,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Only thing checkin at 14 00 and check out at 12 00 We had to leave very early the room when we could not go at the room before 14 00 Also the fabric at the one wall was dirty, The room was very warm and cozy near the metro outside the door to tell the truth reception helpful and also wifi very good
453320,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, As I traveled with my mother of 50 I feel obliged to include her opinion as well She was disappointed in the toilet paper I kid you not and that no toiletries were provided Breakfast was good but could have been better in some aspects for example the Br tchen rolls buns were horrible All in all she expected a little more from a four star hotel I guess What we both noticed was that the cleaning staff was out very early every morning They were very talkative which really is not great with the doors being so badly soundproofed The same goes for some of the other hotel guests but you cannot blame the hotel for this , The staff is very friendly and helpful the bed was extra comfy and the bathroom was new and always clean Location is fantastic just across the street from a tube station but no traffic noise even with open windows And only a short ride into town Check out is until 12 am which is very convenient Breakfast is included and covers different sorts of bread also crossaints and Aufschnitt cold meat cream cheese some veggies a small selection of cereal sausages and eggs a fruit mix and yoghurt I do not remember whether there was any jam I f 25 was pretty content with everything my mother duh 50 only had some minor issues 
453321,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, First time Im leaving such a bad review for a hotel Website left a false impression of the hotel We booked Executive double room Looks like the room was a double room before and they basically shoved two beds together The light switches were right in the middle of our bed rest which was very uncomfortable We were a couple that s why we booked a king size bed but they ve given us seperate single duvets Room was not fully prepared on arrival even though we arrived 2 hours after check in time Tv would not svivel sideways so you can t watch it properly while you re in bed as it was facing the opposite wall Soft drinks were complimentary but only one bottle of coke and a juice even though there were two of us And these were not replaced the next day we would only get the fizzy water and sometimes coke and juice bottle There was only one door in the closet No coffee or tea making facilities in the room Mirror opposite the bed was weird The room was really plain for an executive room and not very cosy there were no paintings or any cosy details apart from one bamboo stick on the table Shower was way too small and the fan on the bathroom did not do it s job at all Wires sticking out from the hairdryer socket Not acceptable View outside the window was tolerable Walls had very strange pattern and were torn bulging out dirty and oily in many places Stains on the chairs No mini bar in the room at all No room service either Slamming doors in the morning quite loud Big gap below the main door Breakfast was included in our room price was pretty boring bland or over seasoned in most cases Everything was very salty Breakfast fruit was basically chopped fresh fruit with conserved fruit mixed together and was overly sweet and disgusting No other fruit available not even an apple No bacon either the scrambled eggs were undercooked and watery , Staff was friendly 
453322,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The plexiglass shower curtain in the bathroom was not tight Although the staff was informed during the whole stay the bathroom floor was permanently wet including floods after every shower ,No Positive
453323,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, garage is ok when hotel is not full otherwise it s hard to park and the garage cannot be reserved in advance, decent breakfast nearby underground station good choice of tv channels in the room friendly staff
453324,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Dinner in the restaurant was fairly ordinary, This hotel met all our expectations and then some In particular the location worked perfectly for us Car parking on site was reasonably priced and generously sized which is not always the case Metro station just across the street made getting around the city very easy 
453325,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Glass door bathroom, Location is great It s right in front of subway station Staff is very helpful I would definitely stay there again if I visit Vienna 
453326,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The rest of our room was a little tired A coat of paint and some tlc would have made the world of difference, Great location next to metro station Great staff and very good breakfast Very nice bathroom
453327,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Vienna is a very expensive city Not good for X Mas as lots of places including restaurants and shops are closed , very good hotel very clean 2 metro stations from the city center metro is near the hotel 
453328,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien,No Negative, The location was great just outside of the subway station Staff was nice however they kinda messed up all our bookings The night we stayed there water was stopped in the middle of the night probably too many people at the same time though the water came back the next morning 
453329,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Internet was very bad Pillow is too thin They gave electricity adapter for 20 Euro deposit Shower was weird it gave cold water every while , Just steps to the metro
453330,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The cleaning service did not change the glasses daily and slippers weren t provided for use in the room , Big and comfortable room very nice wooden floor no odors from carpets thumbs up and really comfortable beds 
453331,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, We just wanted to spend three days in Vienna relaxing The hotel was noisy okay that s not their fault but even the room was noisy due to the heating We had to stop the heating for the night Then the room became cold And it became colder when the cleaning lady left the windows open in freezing cold But she forgot to empty the trash And there wasn t a gesture saying oh we re sorry Beds are soft very soft not good And on the last morning I had this altercation with one of the hotel staff I closed the door to the business centre so I could work and it was very cold in the lobby But he told me in that the door needs to stay open There was no one else in the centre and there was no point ot this We did not feel like we re in a four star hotel , At least the curtains were fine
453332,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, uninstructed dining room personnel they behaved like it was their first time in a restaurant taking plates while guests still eating spilling staff allover the table etc grumpy faces front desk young personnel LIE to us repeatedly regarding parking that is just unacceptable Trying to take advantage of customer s lack of knowledge is a ripoff We did find eventually an elder mid age front desk guy pointing us in the right direction but we felt completely insulted and we didn t expect that What a shameful policy to earn a few extra cash pfff basic same breakfast , not a bad position close to the underground station and even to an certain extent within walk range of the center clean bathroom and premises nice historical building in good shape without any age inconveniences and with all modern facilities good WiFi coverage lovely ambiance nice decorations room picture corresponds to reality except they look a bit bigger in pics maybe No major big unpleasant surprises

453337,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, I won t recommend this place because if you will need something they will be too busy with other people to help you according to their words I couldn t open the door problem with the battery of the card reader The team in the reception told me about it since the first day but didn t try to fix it during my 4 night stay I went to the lobby everyday few times a day to ask for new keycards and was demanding a technican which never came I don t think that I should have shout at the staff but maybe I should have do that because they was indifferent and unfriendly I think that it s outrageous that I came few times a day to change keycards instead of just changing the lock Besides that for a 4 star hotel I was expecting differences in the breakfast each day but it was always the same everyday without many options , Good location Nice room

453354,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Be better if they had a laundry service not just dry cleaning as we went to a laundromat and it took up an entire afternoon of our two day stay in Vienna which could have been spent looking at the great city , It was really clean The Metro located right outside was handy 
453355,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Rougher crowd homeless people a block away but you can see this anywhere downtown like most big cities , Within walking distance of the Vienna Market which is interesting to walk through We had our best meal there Also about a 30 minute walk to the Opera House The hotel is across the street from the metro station in a residential area We felt safe walking but a slightly rougher crowd by the McDonalds a block away which is also where the the metro entrance is Very convenient for taking the train out of Vienna That station was about a 20 minute walk The hotel itself is clean and comfortable When we arrived around noon our room wasn t ready so they offered us an upgrade very decent

453363,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, This was the worst 4 star rated hotel I ve ever been to Smelly room poor soundproof isolation so you could hear the elevators all the time and also the nearby metro trains very small bathroom with even smaller shower From toiletries you get only universal liquid soap The mini bar had only 2 small bottles of water Not very polite stuff Didn t expect that Not in Vienna at least, Except for the good location I can t think of anything else

453369,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, I stayed in a classic double room I wish they had offered a kettle so that I could make coffee tea any time I needed to Also it would have been excellent if a light was placed above the main long mirror or if the desk had a mirror so that it could double as a writing dressing table As such I d have had better lighting and would have been able to sit whilst applying my make up Unfortunately one of my many towels was not very clean but as said one of many , The location exactly opposite an underground station is very very ideal It was also close 2 mins walk to shops and supermarkets and I could quickly get my toiletries and snacks that I hadn t carried due to weight restrictions It was very easy to access with cars and it s only just 3 4 train stops from Vienna s city centre without the city centre price Even though all these amenities are close by the area and hotel on a whole are quiet and pretty classy I ll surely use this hotel again and I ve already recommended it to friends The staff were very helpful polite and professional

453388,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Limited space in underground garage with no possibility of reservation so if you leave the garage during your stay when you come back in the afternoon you may loose a place in it and then you must find some of the public garages Nobody of reception desk staff will tell you that so you should be aware of the potential problem The closest public garage is 1 3 km away Staff at the reception seems like bunch of uninterested and disorganized young people They just don t know how to give a polite smile In mini bar there was only water Potentional risk of flood in bathroom since the bath tub door don t hold the water right TV set is ridiculously small , Location is convenient near metro station Underground garage Breakfast was nice with wide variety of food

453391,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Bathroom sink thingy which was before the drain was not working properly water drained very slowly Bathroom door was from glass and in the night using the toilet lit the whole room just a bit inconvenient Airconditioning turned out to be just with fan function , Perfect location in terms of public transportation one undergorund stop was literally before the hotel door For people who like walking the Rathaus was approximatly 25 minutes of walking to the hotel Nachtmarket was 7 minutes walking distance Rooms to the courtyard were really silent wifi was working the entire stay week room cleand every day Small groceries store was on the next street bakeries nearby In our room there was a bath which we also found very nice 
453392,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Nothing apart from the aircon was noisy and the position of the shower was very odd which resulted in the floor getting soaked, Good location right next to Pilgramgasse underground which meant the city centre was only 10mins away Hotel is also close to several local restaurants Bibbi supermarket just 2 mins walk away Room was clean and bed was comfortable 
453393,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Location was poor the area wasn t very nice lacked good restaurants and the nachs market was not a nice place to visit The breakfast at the hotel was terrible it was like a cattle market we ate only once there the rooms were tiny but clean not worth the money It was a very busy hotel coaches were dropping people off all day long they stayed one night then went the next day very noisy on the corridors , It was across the road from the underground 
453394,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The reception is not helpful The air conditioner is not working and nobody comes to fix this urgently I request a room change but not allowed , Nothing that I like in this hotel 
453395,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The breakfast could have been a better for the price, The location was really great there is a train station 2 min from the hotel The market was also just 10 min walk from hotel 
453396,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, It was loud during the night due to younger people running around Could have some sort of noise control policy in place in the room levels But aside from that I have no complaints , The bed was comfy the staff was lovely and helpful and the location was perfect The breakfast is worth buying as well good value for money and a nice range of things to choose from 
453397,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Very disappointed with our stay in this hotel Room was basic and didn t deserve its 4 star rating when comparing to previous hotels we had stayed in on our trip After experiencing a dreadful nights sleep due to an extremely loud drilling noise apparently coming from the air conditioning which we did contact reception about and were advised to turn it off which made no difference as the noise continued to consistently interrupt our sleep at various points throughout the night we complained when we was checking out Although the member of reception staffs manners were excellent our complaint was not taken seriously at all and was basically dismissed No details were written down or recorded and when we showed the reception staff a video we had recorded of the noise he proceeded to speak to his manager who unfortunately did not have the time or even manners to come and speak to us personally We were then offered a breakfast as compensation even though we had just walked though the breakfast room and it was being cleared away as breakfast was finished so we declined as we felt we were entitled to some form of financial compensation or discount This was not entertained or even considered by the hotel and we were given a voucher for two small drinks which was basically a joke and thrown in the bin The recording of the abrasive noise is available on request and will be attached to my reviews Overall a very disappointing and underwhelming experience in this hotel and we will not be recommending anyone to stay in a Trend hotel ,No Positive
453398,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, I didnt like the Check out day there was one Staff a man who take care of our luggages another one My Partner wanted to set up the bags on the bike so that he brought the bike in just in front of the luggage room but the guy started to shouting that this is a Hotel and you guys cant bring the bike in and keep being RUDE which i didnt expected The first day we boths brought the bike in the hotel front of checkin counter with actually no problem I mean actually if its prohibit or something you guys should at least speak with respect not like we are asking you for money or food we PAY for that so , I like the Hotel Location it just right in front of the U bahn station so its not hard to find at all the Staff on the check in day was really NICE we came with the bike and they offer to take care the bags for us Cleanliness eveything is very clean and the woman comes everyday to clean even if u stay more nights we enjoy our stay 2 nights in Vienna D
453399,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The room was small dusty with old furniture The bathroom was even small and basic with no ventilation Poor internet connection The reception staff was awful unprofessionally No more than 2 stars hotel terrible experience , I didn t like the hotel avoid the place 
453400,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, I ve stayed in several hotels in Europe For this particular hotel I can t say something negative , The hotel baroque style is clean quiet and comfortable Excellent staff Very good breakfast and service Free wi fi without user name and password Free computer and printer beside the reception The hotel s location is one minute from the metro line U4 Using the subway lines you can go easily everywhere Very good quality for price If i go to Vienna again i ll stay in this hotel

453404,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Cost of the dog per night was more than the adult price per night Not impressed when the dog has to take his own bed We were informed of pet price by email but had already left the UK Main thoroughfare was between open plan bar and restaurant so very noisy, Breakfast was good
453405,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The breakfast should have more fresh fruits and pastry I don t like omelet and bacon, Very nice hotel big comfy clean rooms near the metro station very good price

453409,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Shower doors could have closed better but was not that important as the water did not go out of the shower extremely soft pillows I know that tastes differ but I believe the hotel should try to accommodate various necessities in this area and should provide somewhere in the middle pillows in terms of softness and not go into the extremes very soft or very hard , The location right at the exit of the Pilgramgasse U bahn station just across the street the room was large clean and quiet big flat TV capable of reading USB stick content clean bathroom good breakfast with multiple choices including hot products as well omelette sausages spacious breakfast room helpful staff 
453410,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, the structure of the bathroom is a little bit inconvenient, very good location just in front of the underground station the rooms are spacious and clean the staffs are friendly and helpful 
453411,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Rooms are ordinary and not great but bed was comfortable bathroom was too small and anyone who stays here can make out its definitely not a four star by any standards One can accommodate such small bathroom and others but we were very offended by the staff at reception They seemed to care less and one of them was even rude to me The air conditioner was not good and was just throwing air even when we did 15 degrees There was no luxury toiletries except like in two stars a soap bottle in toilet Last night was horrible as some construction trucks were around making noise right in from of my room Though part of policy for small child bed through out my Europe trip where i stayed for so many nights this was only hotel who insisted to charge us and did charge us All other hotels did not , Location is very nice as it is well connected by a 10 ft away from hotel The station connects to the top spots Also next to hotel is the bus stops just a block away Backside of hotels is lots of cafe and restaurants and BILLA S Market

453415,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, staff should be briefed on basic policies and authorized to work more independently so that they do not need to check with supervisor on everything shower space is tight and unique strange plush toilet, excellent location next to U4 which takes to city centre central train station and the station with connection to the airport clean and quiet room with good size
453416,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Breakfast good choice but not necessary to my liking but that s just a personal choice My wife loved it , Nice hotel great access to U Bahn and to the city Close to Schronbrunn palace
453417,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Breakfast s menu could definitely have had a better quality and more variety In addition we had a trip through different cities and decided to stay at hotels with the same rating value and stars category In all the other cities we found the rooms to be quite comfortable and the hotels in general had better buffets Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien is not the worst place ever but we consider its quality and what it offers are overrated , I liked the attitude of a couple of employees at the reception They were quite helpful whenever we asked them for some information

453425,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Parking in the garage was a nightmare Had to park for a night but there was no place though the parking attendant was helpful and helped me poke the car into a non existent slot , The rooms were small but they had an extra bed as requested Check in and check out was easy the staff could communicate in English and the location is absolutely brilliant Just off the Pilgramgasse U Bahn station Walk out of the hotel into the station Made travelling from the Airport CAT to Landstrasse U4 line from there to Pilgramgasse a piece of cake We were also able to extend our check out to 2 30 rather than at 12 00 without any issue or extra charge Furthermore they kept our luggage in a locker from 2 30 till we picked it up at 7 00 pm The entire thing was seamless and stress free 
453426,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The layout around the coffee machines could be considered with a view to minimise the log jam when clients are waiting for coffee whilst others are trying to get food, Variety of foods that were available 
453427,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Wi Fi was not working well The single room i was staying is like a cell You feel like in prison there No balcony I had breakfast once Immediately after I returned to the room form the restorant I got a bad case of diarrhea The restorant cleanliness was questionable Mostly chineese personell But I have to admit that when I complained at the reception and said i don t want to pay for that breakfast they resisted for a while then canceled it So I didn t have to pay for that Obviously this is not 4 star hotel May be 2 or 3 star as a maximum It is low budget hotel that happens to be located conveniently No good value You can get better hotel for this money bigger room closer to the city centre and normal breakfast , The room was clean The linen got changed after 2 days This hotel conveniently located 1 min distance of walk from the metro station Staff was attentive Good air coditioning

453443,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, There were 2 requests to the hotel from my side 1 was automatically done via booking com 1 double bed another one was related to our early check in None of those requests were completed As for early check in no problem sometimes there are probably no available rooms But double bed it was written in the room offer So if there was a rating for customer service this hotel would get 6 as a maximum Breakfasts are pretty humble for 4 stars , Cleanliness Location hotel was quite far from the center but it was cross the road from the U bahn station
453444,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, It was strange that one could not have privacy in the bathroom WC The door was not sound proof , Breakfast buffet was gorgeous quite a big selection of different products and dishes There are many people staying at the hotel but there are neither queues nor chaos we ll managed

453451,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Glass wall in the bathroom was little bit inconvenient for using , For me the stay in this hotel was comfortable and good Due to the business trip I choose the hotel to be very close to the office and to the center from the other side And my choice was really successful The room was also very good clean quiet window to the yard and with reasonable price

453455,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Breakfast could be a bit more extended with hot choices only scrambled eggs available Shower in bathroom has only a tiny protecting glass against spatting water resulting in the floor getting wet all over A typical group tours hotel so prepared for noise coming from corridor or other rooms , Perfect location right next to metrostation and 2 buslines into city center Clean and comfortable room and beds

453464,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, More staff at the foyer would have been helpful during peak check in times or a member staff available for information for tourists, Such a great last minute deal for a double room and the room was very clean and the decor was comforting The city is absolutely beautiful will definitely visit again Above all the people of Austria are very polite and speak English Which was extremely helpful

453470,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Wifi was really bad in the room I understand bottled water in Europe aren t free but there were only 2 bottles of water and nothing else in the refrigerator so it lead me to think they were free in other hotels they would actually be many things in the minibar fridge However they were not and quiet pricey as well They should have mentioned it somewhere at least , Location was really good

453477,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, The bathroom s door is the most unpractical I have ever seen It is a glass door which doesn t isolate at all the bath from the rest of the room You don t feel comfortable in the bath because every noise you make is heard in the room the same with smels steam from the shower etc But a better door could make a good difference ,No Positive
453478,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, I believe the hotel provides breakfast to many tour companies and this makes the lobby and breakfast area extremely crowded The lobby also smelt slightly of cigarette smoke The hotel just seemed a little beat up for example the scuff marks on the floors and walls in the room Also there is no wifi in the rooms and while I knew this when booking the hotel it seems very odd that this isn t available especially for such a large hotel Lastly the bed was very firm , The location of the hotel is perfect There is a metro station across the street so there is easy access to everything The staff were all very helpful The local area also provides many options for meals and shopping

453482,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, We could hear everything in the adjoining rooms The holder for the shower head was broken so we had to hold the nozzle during the entire shower which was not very comfortable The scrambled egg in a glass served at the breakfast buffet was tasteless and dry , The accommodations were meticulously clean The breakfast was ample and tasted fine The underground was only a few steps away how wonderful 
453483,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, Bathroom had a sliding glass door with no ventilation or window inside and it didn t shut down properly The breakfast is good but we never set on a clean table Lack of waiters , Location is perfect very close to the city center one minute away from the Pilgramgasse subway station which is 2 stops away from the Karlplatz Friendly stuff Ok for the money we paid

453490,Austria Trend Hotel Ananas Wien, It s not a bad experience as such but the hotel clearly mainly caters for mass tourism We mistakenly used the tourist breakfast room on our first day and it was pretty basic no tables laid we had to ask for decaf coffee croissants were a strange consistancy a large buffet to negotiate However the next day we found the Executive breakfast room which was much better We prefer smaller hotels , Location right by Pilgramgasse station was very convenient Good rates by Viennese standards for the standard of the room
