280354,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Breakfast buffet was very expensive Parking may be a challenge if you are an American and are used to larger spaces , This hotel offers so much for the rate offered The staff was very friendly rooms were nice and the spa was very very good An amaxing pianist played in the main lobby during aperitif time Dinner in the cafe was tremendous Truly a great hotel especially for the nightly rate 
280355,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Staff was extremely nice and accommodating The premises were kept in the state of immaculate cleanliness Everything was top notch Would definitely stay here again 
280356,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Nothing to dislike , I have absolutely no faults with this hotel The receptionist was the most accommodating we could not have asked for better service from the staff All staff were very friendly and spoke good English The area was somewhat quiet construction was taking place next door Public transport was very easy to find use around the site we weren t too far from the city center beach We would definitely return to this hotel and recommend to any friends and family looking to travel to Barcelona Thank you for making our stay so memorable 
280357,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Rooms were not soundproof at all and so you could hear everything Hotel was a little far out from the centre for us , Room very clean and bar terrace fantastic Staff very helpful Facilities good tv and iron etc 
280358,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, The water in the shower was not great Every so many seconds the water would turn scalding hot It was very hard to take a shower Our friends had the same thing even though they were on a different part of the hotel The location was OK We were very close to a bus and 10 minute walk to the metro But we had to use public transport to get anywhere of interest , The rooftop bar and pool were great They bartender made amazing mojitos Breakfast was very good as well 
280359,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, The cleaning of the room was a bit poor as a tshirt that was on the bed was flung onto the side table Only the bed was made and the tables were not touched and still had old glasses and rubbish on it, The front desk service was very helpful and answered all questions that we had
280360,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Temprature of the shower changes all the time from a regular temprature to very hot a few seconds Maybe this was just temporarily , The bar and small pool on the roof are a great addition to this hotel Staff is really kind and helpfull
280361,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Could have included a better supply of tea and coffee in the bedroom Our bedroom was beside the lift which was a little noisy at night but not too bad after midnight, Excellent roof bar and pool cheap drinks friendly and accommodating staff
280362,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, There was major building work next to the hotel which was so noisy , Bed was so comfy staff were friendly everything was excellent Excellent location for Sants I would definitely stay here again 
280363,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, This hotel is great The structure is really cool rooms are beautiful and really comfortable and there is a roof bar The hotel can be reached with the tube it is about 40 45 minutes from the airport The hotel is located 15 minutes walk from the city centre it is in a good and quiet location The staff is super friendly and multilingual rooms are really clean Definitely a great hotel in Barcelona I highly recommend it 
280364,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Only one person on the reception and we have to wait a fifthteen minutes On foot is pretty far to the avenida La Rambla , Breakfast was very good Staf in the pool restaurant exellent Very important was that there are a bicyle for free 
280365,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, The rooms are not as soundproof as they should be in a busy hotel The rooftop terrace closed at night , Conveniently located within a 15 minutes walk from the city center in a well circulated and safe area of the city Several supermarkets nearby With a tastefully decorated interior the hotel is most welcoming and the staff is very helpful good English which is harder to find in Barcelona promptly helped with our luggage upon our pre check in hour arrival and stored it until we returned from the city booked in advance a taxi for our departure The hotel creates a story around local artists and contributes to Barcelona s artsy vibe Clean rooms quality toiletries daily replenishment of coffee and tea bags in the room for the kettle The pillow menu was a nice unexpected touch Huge comfy bed 
280366,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Great friendly staff excellent breakfast with a huge variety of food fresh cakes and drinks including cava The hotel is a fair walk from las ramblas but we enjoy the walk when its sunny outside plus it meant it was quiet overnight essential when travelling with young children 
280367,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Most rooms look out onto a busy intersection so the traffic noise may be an issue for some despite the double glazed windows which do not seem to seal properly The internet speed in my room was very slow , Nice four star hotel delicious breakfast with real orange juice and freshly made coffee polite staff 
280368,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Hope they don t charge people extra mistakenly It has a great location but also quite busy street , Very understanding helpful people at reception Hotel made a big mistake with my expenses this people did their best to compensate that mistake It was a headache for me in the beginning 
280369,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Although not great inconvenience there is no public bar in winter months December for our stay and only the roof top terrace bar open in summer Rooms at front are on busy main road and noisey , Great breakfast friendly staff and nice idea having all the artwork throughout 
280370,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Nice small gym but the Manager dictated what channel the TV was on to It was obviously linked to his office Minor detail really , Loved the Terraced Roof Top Overall I enjoyed my stay here Lots of building work going around but the windows and doors were pretty soundproof Air Con and Wifi were excellent Statf were fantastic 
280371,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Facilities were clean comfortable Tamara at front desk was very helpful has good local knowledge is multi lingual English is good Complimentary bottle of water Free wifi Public transport to city closeby 
280372,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, It was far from the city center and the underground especially for nighttime The swimming pool extremely small Staff sometimes treated us less than the others cause of our young age The bicycles do not work well however if you have them stolen it s 200 of charge mind you they re not worth 50 Problems on the room regarding the lightning system the toilet and the water in the sink , There is a taxi point right on front of the hotel Very good breakfast People at the reception very kind and available Comfortable room although a bit small for 3 It s a nice hotel I enjoyed my stay but I don t think it deserves 4 stars it is a 3 stars as maximum 
280373,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Only 4 sun beds We and other people had to put towels on the floor Flavoured water in reception was a nice touch but was always empty Security didn t ask to see our ID or room cards when returning late at night , The hotel was beautifully decorated Staff at the pool bar were excellent especially Yam who made a real effort to make us laugh Very attentive Drinks were a great price 12 for a bottle of prosecco we thought was a bargain and the cocktail of the day for 6 was great too Beer was only 2 3 Location was a short walk to the main train station and there were lots of good restaurants nearby We mostly used taxis to get to the main part of town because we were a group and it was only a 4 6 ride away but I think the underground was only a short walk and a bus stopped straight outside We also got the tourist bus from the train station which was handy 
280374,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Room service food excellent in the middle of the week Dont try on weekends as it is terrible 3 missing ingredients which were rectified after we complaine told by waiter it was first time he had prepared this Then told us he couldn t make dessert we d ordered as he didnt know how to We asked if anything else off dessert menu could be ordered He said no We were totally shocked by what we experienced This is simply not good enough for the price paid for this hotel , Breakfast good
280375,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Basic facilities on site Distance to stations Room decor was a bit dated Pool is tiny can t be used for swimming, Access to a number of stations but each required a 10min walk Helpful staff Choice of pillows Good views from roof top Lots of locals in the locality
280376,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Reception staff went missing when the lobby was busy with guests looking to check in and check out We waited ages to check out with only one receptionist on duty We expected the swimming pool on the roof to be quite small but we didn t expect to touch both sides at the same time It was barely big enough for two people For a 4 hotel we didn t expect rust on the side of the bath or the door frames be be badly water damaged The cleaners were very stingy with replenishing the soap and shampoo we had to go out and buy our own , The breakfast room was very pleasant and comfortable 
280377,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Not a lot to mention here except the breakfast was good but could be improved The hot food was limited and only contained two types of egg and bacon but no sausages Definitely need sausages on the menu Also a lock on the bathroom door would be useful especially when sharing a room with family friends , Excellent staff members on the desk who are very helpful Hotel was clean and rooms were tidied up very well every day Beds were comfy and the bathroom was modern and tidy Air conditioning worked really well Terrace bar was great It had beer on draught and also served great cocktails There was also a good comprehensive room menu which I did not try Location is ok but will require walking about 10mins to the nearest Metro station or to decent restaurants not a problem for my family as we enjoy walking All in all an excellent hotel I would definitely stay here again 
280378,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, The wifi was awful extremely slow and rubbish connection Also considering I paid almost 1000 for 9 nights I did find the actual duvet was stained and the fact not even one channel was in English was sad I found brown stains on the carpet around various areas in the room Despite all these issues I must say the friendliness all staff from the cleaners to the waitress that we met in the morning made it difficult to complain , Staff particularily were so helpful and so friendly which made such an impact to the entire trip 
280379,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, A very honest staff I forgot my jacket hanging in the hotel room closet I called several hours after having checked out and the jacket was still there The receptionist assured me it would be safe until it was picked up the next evening 
280380,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Hotel layout was open and airy There were several public areas to sit in where we were always able to find a quiet spot Call buttons in these areas meant service was easily available without staff always being there Location suited us as we were within easy reach of the main tourist attractions without being in the busiest areas 
280381,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, The noise hotel being built next door so rooms were very noisy with drilling and building work , Excellent staff great roof top bar and pool lounge area Small but affordable food menu 
280382,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Noise from next door neighbours but asked for a change of room Immediately I was offered one in a quieter floor Thankyou Xx, Loved my stay here once again Staff were fantastic as usual Will be going again in 6 months time Thankyou had a lovely time at your Armister xxxxx
280383,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Location is not perfect as it is 30 minutes away on foot from city centre and about 12 minutes walk from the nearest tube station , Breakfast was good and Hotel was clean Room was nice and sufficiently spacious with a nice bathroom 
280384,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, 1 poor internet connection was like a bad joke 2 the rooms are noisy because of bad design from noisy doors to poor isolation 3 pillow covers were dirty even after replacement 4 water from bathroom travels to the room because of bad design, the hotel is near the Sants train station
280385,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, As a regular visitor I hope that says it all Everything you would expect from a 4 star and more Just liked to mention the domestic staff really friendly nothing too much trouble Thankyou to the lady who looked after our room 
280386,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, No complaints, Lovely welcome as we entered the hotel Requested the same room number as on our last visit which was great Couldn t fault anything more than you would expect from a 4 star Thankyou Armister see you again next week Along with Pepper my African Grey Xxx
280387,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Breakfast Time ago was much better but with the time worst and worst Come back to the service before If you offer this kind of breakfast it s not worth to take it, Service location
280388,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Facing onto the main road Avenue Roma so some road noise for very light sleepers Hotel next door going through a total refurb so unsightly but was not disturbed by building noise , Located away from the busy La Rambles area but close enough to walk to the main station for trains and tour buses Nice rooms big beds and tea coffee making available in the room Nice decor throughout and friendly staff 
280389,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Minor point of criticism every 30 seconds or so the shower s temprature went to up significantly Then after 10 seconds it returned to the set temprature This was inconvenient but not very disturbing , Clean rooms kind and helpful staff Most of the time we were out of the hotel so we did not enjoy that many of the facilities and can t really give an honest opinion 
280390,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, There was no water on the Saturday and I felt the hotel could ve called and warned us about it instead of us waking up to it and calling downstairs a bunch of times the phones weren t attended regularly during this mishap The breakfast was really really poor for the 18 we were charged Nothing was hot warm and the coffee was lukewarm at the most , The Staff was generally friendly Location was okay wouldn t really say it was too central 
280391,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, When you book a room for 4 people there is a king sized bed and a sofa bed which can be suitable for kids but a bit uncomofrtable for adults , Nice staff very kind and very helpful No problem to leave the suitcases behind when we checked out The hotel and the rooms look amazing and gives off a very good vibe 
280392,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Music in the corridor starts at 8 00 together with housekeepers who start at the same time making noise with their equipment work as wake up call and can guarantee that you never oversleep, If one is OK with walking location is very good about 20 min walking to the downtown Staff friendly and cooperative They provided us with comfortable feather pillows after request Quite spacious room and bathroom 
280393,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, bar staff on roof terrace quite rude and value for money for a glass of wine , lovely hotel staff on reception bedroom although a bit small for 3 bathroom was excellent 
280394,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, Breakfast was ok but have had better the waitress was slow to replace food that had run out and I had to keep asking her to do so The roof top terrace was lovely but the bar never seemed to be staffed and although we were offered a complimentary drink we never got it due to the bar appearing to be closed whenever we went , Lovely room we were expecting a triple but it was two rooms with a dividing door perfect for our needs 
280395,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, I was not impressed by the cleanlinesses of the room Flush was broken and toilet was not very clean Pool area was not very taken care of and I found the pool menu very unimpressive Also The hotel called a taxi for us which charged us 45 euros to the airport when they told us it will not be more than 35 , The location of the hotel was great Nice big double bed and a very comfortable room 
280396,Sercotel Amister Art Hotel Barcelona, It was a long walk into Barcelona The view from my daughter s room was of 2 walls no natural light at all , The Hotel was modern and the rooms had everything you would need including drink making facilities free safe free wifi and fridge The roof top pool was great The hotel is within walking distance of the main train station
