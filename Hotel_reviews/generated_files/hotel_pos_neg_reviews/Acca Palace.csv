477806,Acca Palace, Me and my friend each booked a room for his family I have 2 infants and my friend has one infant and 3 small kids When we arrived at the hotel we found out that both of us got exactly the same room which had queen size bed and a bed sofa He had to pay double my price only because they had put bed sheets on the bed sofa That was really unacceptable and we feel that we have been deceived , The hotel is very nice and their breakfast is excellent

477812,Acca Palace, Malpensa Airport to the hotel is a fair bit away taxi to hotel and back cost around 200 which is expensive especially if you arrive late evening to the airport and leave early morning aswell to go Would of taken the train but not suitable for our times booked Trainline still closed during early morning There is no gym or swimming pool at this hotel if you plan to book , Good room size for family of four 2 adults and 2 kids Friendly and helpful staff Nice restaurant on the corner of the road which is less than a minute away Fair selection for breakfast Free wifi Metro is about 5mins away and the trainline goes directly to Doumo train station for Duomo Cathedral 
477813,Acca Palace, Road signs were easily visible to the hotel however there is a quicker way by foot Signage saying pedestrian access this way would enhance the experience even further , The staff were excellent kindness and consideration The location is very convenient to a metro and supermarket yet was quiet The room was beautifully serviced The shower had rain and jet options also We had breakfast included in the deal we got It catered to everyone s needs vegan option fresh juiced fruit and carrot extras of flaxseed sunflowers etc to add to muesli selections of yogurts fresh fruit There were various fresh breads and a cooked selection I requested a cappacino each daily and it was never any trouble The breakfast area opens to garden Daily newspapers are available through a web link

477818,Acca Palace, The surroundings of the property Few restaurants to choose from, Convienently situated near underground station which takes you down town in half an hour Very skilled and friendly staff throughout our stay With the private parking space this hotel is the perfect base for exploring Milan 
477819,Acca Palace, We ve booked 2 rooms but for the second room we were able to check in only at 4 pm and none of the stuff seemed too affected that we came from a night flight and that we especially requested early check in so we could get some sleep Second day we leave the Do Not Disturb sign on the doorknob but the housekeeping totally ignored it and came in They even went through my personal stuff which I find very disturbing I ve talked to the receptionist and he told me that was kind of my fault because you need to put the sign on the door and also tell them personally that you don t want your room cleaned What s the point of the sign then I didn t like at all the staff s attitude they seemed like they don t care about the guest s issues at all Too bad because the place looks really nice, The overall experience was as we expected it to be The rooms were huge clean comfortable we also had a balcony that we ve enjoyed being smokers The breakfast was very diversified the food was very tasty and fresh 
477820,Acca Palace, I booked 2 rooms for 4 nights When I came to the hotel the manager told me that they had an electricity problem and asked us to the spend the first night in the other hotel To make it clear I wrote to the hotel beforehand that I will be arriving late and got the confirmation that they were waiting for us I had 2 eldery mothers with me who were tired after the trip The most unpleasant moment was that the hotel obviously was overbooked and they lied to me about some electricity problems I didn t want to scandal and went to the other hotel but at the reception of the hotel where they put us I checked witht the reception lady and she said thet we were the only ones who were relocated for the night from Acca Palace If the hotel is 4 star and wants to be a boutique one it is absolutely unacceptable to sell more rooms that are available Plus my rooms were not just booked they were fully prepaid , I liked the style of the hotel The room was nice but the bathroom was tiny not what you expect from 4 star hotel It was nice to have a balcony The breakfast was good with large variety Perfect hot croissants Lots of fruits fresh juices etc However last breakfast was a mess There were no glasses cups and plates The staff was not quick enough to replace the missing items had to wait for water for 15 minutes The hotel is situated in the nice area close to metro A huge supermarket is nearby The staff is very well trained and any request is immediately realised

477840,Acca Palace, Although reception staff are professional and friendly but I didn t like the Manager in this hotel He doesn t know how to deal with customers This is a hotel and should be customer oriented , Very clean and near to the office I have meeting with 
477841,Acca Palace, Was overcharged by 69 61 Rude Staff Contacted Hotel said cannot find reservation number and couldn t assist me Contacted Bookings and they ve contacted the hotel and returned my emails mentioning reason for overcharge was due to loss of key which was untrue the key has a damn weight on it and you have to return to reception every time you pop out Bookings are being unreasonable and siding with the hotel even after I have submitted many forms of proof showing that I have being overcharged Asked for a double room received to single beds with dirty duvet Was shown i would get a view from balcony instead received a room on the second floor looking at a ghost town Shower was overly disgusting AVOID Bookings staff are unhelpful and couldn t care less about the customers honestly use someone else as that exactly what I would be doing Bookings can thank Acca Palace for loosing a very frequent booker , Only considerate thing was the WIFI

477848,Acca Palace, Would have liked the balcony to be a little bigger Not enough room for 2 chairs but this is just my personal preference Room was advertised as having a kitchen but the kitchen was locked We could have asked reception to open it but it wasn t too much of a problem , A lovely hotel 5 mins from the tube station 10 mins from Central Milan Room was spotless with lovely toiletries that were replenished daily Clean towels every day Breakfast was superb Will definitely book again when next visiting Milan 
477849,Acca Palace, Bathroom shower was incredibly small and inconveniently arranged The location is not luxurious in a residential area so our view included mostly balconies with clothes hanging out to dry , Very decent hotel with pretty good breakfast buffet value Clean great staff Close to a nice grocery store for snacks and a short walk maybe quarter mile to metro train station
477850,Acca Palace, hotel is very far from city centre in a residential office building area practically no restaurants in the area if you arrive late you should eat before you go to the hotel apart from the fresh juicer breakfast was a bit dissapointing, very friendly and helpful staff although quite far from the city centre the hotel is five minutes walk from the metro station loved the juice maker at breakfast to make fresh carrot and apple juice

477863,Acca Palace, The Internet connection was unavailable to several of our devices for several hours due to a saturated and poorly configured network which was a big problem for our work but what s unacceptable is the way one of the front desk employees talked down to us Because of that we didn t extend our stay and wouldn t come back ,No Positive

477880,Acca Palace, Cappucino for breakfast was the worst i have ever had in Italy Lost an expensive torch in the room too Hotel management is insincere and callous Accidentally double booked hotel room and requested for refund Hotel gave alot of bull reasons and refused to refund us even though it was a genuine mistake Originally mentioned that Booking com doesn t allow them to refund Pressed with facts from booking com changed their story to something else Not a credible and honest hotel The 4 star ratings is overrated The 2 star ones we stayed in Florence and Rome were even better than this No complimentary drinking water and drinks in a room Unacceptable for a 4 star hotel Location was near to nowhere other than a Metro station Biggest disappointment for hotel selection in Italy Stay at your own risk Okie only if you don t need to interact with the staff Majority of good reviews on this website belongs to travellers with minimum interaction with staff DO NOT expect the staff to go the extra mile to understand your plight Protect your belongings when leaving the room , Good spread for breakfast Big room 
477881,Acca Palace, It s not located at the town centre Not many choices at the breakfast room , The room is spacious even stay with bulk luggage Facilities are complete with nothing missing and the bed is comfortable 
477882,Acca Palace, Hotel not fully enclosed When you step outside your room or front desk area you are outside It is covered but you are subject to the outside temperature The rooms more than make up for that The rooms are VERY NICE No reflection on hotel fly into main airport not Linate Take metro rail to hotel I flew into Linate There is no metro rail there Got ripped off by cab for 75 euros price to hotel Costs 45 euros to get from hotel back to airport Milan metro rail is excellent and tourist friendly Rail would have cost me less than 5 euros round trip Will fly into main airport next time , Everyone on the staff great and very helpful Very close walk to M3 AFFORI CENTRO rail station grocery market restaurants western union etc Great wine shop across the street Rooms are very nice and modern Safe neighborhood 5 minute walk to M3 AFFORI CENTRO metro station 10 minute rail ride to DUOMO central downtown main tourist and sites district I would stay at this location again when I return to Italy Breakfast food and dinner restaurant food excellent quality at reasonable price The place is very clean and well kept 
477883,Acca Palace, I booked the room they made me change the first night at another hotel and when I went there in the morning I have waited almost 2 hours to clean a room , The breakfast was so good hotel easy reachable by the metro station and a very quite place I would go again 
477884,Acca Palace, Can t complain about this as i knew already where it was but the only downside is the location that is a bit far from at least where i had to go for work But very well connected with metro bus etc so that s no problem at all , I loved everything Staff was really great room was fantastic breakfast very nice Food was great and nearby i found an amazing Pizzeria as well as a really great Sardinian restaurant 
477885,Acca Palace, internet drops too often no carpets bathroom too for shower head full of scale making water to shower in all possible directions, Espresso for breakfast juice machine large room
477886,Acca Palace, The heating is very strange as we did not manage to lower it even though we put it on 17 degrees As a result if we let it on it was too hot and if we turn it off it got cold during the night Prepare for the city tax which is payable at the end of your stay and it is 5 euros per day per person Too much in my opinion , The room was very big and it had nice new furniture The breakfast was very good The bed and sheets were super comfy The room was clean and we basically had everything we needed It is in a quite area but close to the metro station The staff was very friendly 
477887,Acca Palace, pity it s so short , Acca Palace is few minutes walk to the metro and about 15 minutes train ride to milano centrale The staffs are helpful they clean the room every day There s a big supermarket near to the hotel They have a luggage storage if you are unable to check in early The room was spacious amazing mattresses Fast wi fi We were on the first floor 
477888,Acca Palace, The airconditioner seemed not to function properly as it became too hot and needed to open the balcony door As away from main areas there are no amenity shops nearby and would be difficult had we didnt have our own transport , The room was spacious Hotel location away from busy main roads hence quieter Ample sized shower room and not cramped into a small room 
477889,Acca Palace, unfortunately there s no aircond or a fan for ventilation of the room , the staffs are helpful they clean the room every day the hotel is 5 minutes walk to the metro and 15 minutes train ride to milano centrale there s a big supermarket near to the hotel which is very helpful they even have a luggage storage if you are unable to check in early 
477890,Acca Palace, We did not like Americano coffee during breakfast It was not warm enough every morning and you can see the guests who are ordering coffee because of this problem probably , the breakfast was really good We enjoyed the Italian hand made cakes every morning It is a clean hotel and wifi works fast You need to walk apx 3 minutes to Affori Centro Metro station and on this line you can reach to main railway station and Duomo without changing line And another plus at our room is that there was a microwave to warm your foods 
477891,Acca Palace, Heating is managed centrally by the hotel you can t adjust it yourself in the room at least it was not working in the room we stayed So when you are returning back to the hotel in the evening room feels like sauna We had to open all windows to cool it a bit down otherwise it would not be possible to sleep However when we called the reception hotel staff decreased a bit the temperature specifically for the night so we could get proper sleep, Hotel is located a bit far away from city center and main attractions however is situated nearby the metro station which is at the same metro line as Duomo and Central Train Station so connection wise location is very good Breakfast is nice with lots of choices warm food snacks fruits fresh juices Staff is friendly and helpful

477894,Acca Palace, The location was quite far from the center of Milan Upon arriving with luggage we took taxi It cost the equivalent of 20 US Used metro next day about 10 minutes walk from hotel and eight stops to Milan center At night streets were empty with hardly anyone around for help, Staff polite helpful friendly
477895,Acca Palace, The tables for the breakfast in the restaurant room inside were not sufficient for the gests So we had to move outside and there was a little bit humidity in the garden in the morning , Appartment Duomo 2 was perfect for our 20th wedding anniversary Big bed soft mattress Breakfast with great variety Staff very helpfull and polite Very close to Metro station 
477896,Acca Palace, While it was close to the subway it was a little out of town , A quick walk to the subway Check in was easy Staff were very friendly helpful and fluent in English We had a triple room which was spacious with a balcony 
477897,Acca Palace, It is a bit far from the centre but I guess you can t have it all , Very modern hotel amazing mattresses I have never slept in a more comfortable bed and this is essential after a couple of days of extensive sightseeing and walking Breakfast was very good the staff gave us all help needed and good recommendations perfect stay 
477898,Acca Palace, Rooms needed some refreshment especially the bathroom Parking spots are very narrow The location in a not so nice area in Milan , Breakfast was good 
477899,Acca Palace, It is located far from the main area to see things It is only a two or three block walk to the subway but it is quite a ways from things to do , They had a great breakfast and the room was very comfortable for our family of four 
477900,Acca Palace, Not a great area for restaurants but that s hardly the fault of the hotel , Good welcome and prompt attention from reception Convenient for Metro to city centre Duomo room on the top floor spacious and comfortable
