491403,Ramada Plaza Milano, Bit too far from the milan centre but still easy to get there by metro 5min walk to it not much to do around the gotel area, Super the hotel is awesome rooms are clean staff helpful and friendly pool area is a good idea for the hotel in summer time would come back someday to this hotel 9 10 
491404,Ramada Plaza Milano, Breakfast was average one room made a lot of noise closed and opened its door 50 times during midnight for 2 nights hardly sleep one elevator didnt work during our entire 3 days stay the staff was average location is 10 min walk to the metro station and then 20 min to duomo, Room size
491405,Ramada Plaza Milano,No Negative, Slept like a baby very comfortable beds Breakfast buffet is extensive and the hotel is close to undeeground line station that takes you directly to Duomo 
491406,Ramada Plaza Milano,No Negative, The staff not helping and there are very firm and aggressive when my iPhone stolen from me and ask for some helpful to call plice or guide me to police station not give any assistance
491407,Ramada Plaza Milano, Nothing to note One appoint some problems to pay SPA by card as they are two different management structures and it ran out of fruit , Nice stay good breakfast and really comfortable beds The shower is really great and the view even if there are a few blocks around is nice The SPA is quite cool to be a 4 hotel Tip on Wednesday there is the local market near by ant is i fun to walk around and in summer they organize some happy hour aperitifs with live music near the pool 
491408,Ramada Plaza Milano, Behaviour of some of the guests who were there in a coach party especially unsupervised older children around pool area Cleanliness around pool area and supervision, great location friendly staff
491409,Ramada Plaza Milano, The room smelled like mold The hotel either doesn t have a ventilation system or the system is too weak to absorb the humidity Horrible bed uncomfortable you might as well lie in a ditch THE MAIN problem with the room was the AC It s not just a central system with climate control neither is it a regular AC set it s 2 sets blowing air in the direction of each other One was located right in front of the bed the other one behind it So the system blasts cold air in your face the whole night There are no remotes to turn off either of them When called the reception I was advised that it s either ON or OFF both of them Milan is way to hot in the summer to sleep with AC off so it brought quite a dilemma to suffocate in the heat or to freeze in the cold Also the staff said that all the rooms in the hotel are designed exactly the same so moving to another room wouldn t solve the problem Never ever have I seen air conditioning units positioned like that the interior designer must lack basic skills knowledge and the project managers were not even looking at the end result before approving it for the guests to start using the facility I DISADVISE you from staying at this hotel unless you want to experience everything I had to go through The only positive moment was that I was allowed to check out early due to all the problems without paying for the rest of the nights , Decent breakfast
491410,Ramada Plaza Milano,No Negative, BREAKFAST IS NORMAL BUT OVERALL CAN ACCEPTED ABOUT ROOM THE BEST TOWER IN TOWER A B AND C IF YOU PREFER KITCHEN AND ROOM MORE BIGGER OF COURSE TOWER E IS THE BEST CHOICE IT DEPEND ON YOU FOR ME THIS IS MY FIRST TIME AND THE LAST TIME TO STAYING IN THIS HOTEL 
491411,Ramada Plaza Milano, We have studio with kitchenette but without equipment which was for an extra charge , Nice and clean room a pretty garden with a small swimming pool 
491412,Ramada Plaza Milano, Some staff was rude when we checked in They weren t attentive we booked a suite for goodness sake She was ok but didn t greet us properly was just out right rude Just sort of threw the cards on the desk said here you go Never explained about the restaurants or cafe hours Just wasent a warm welcome that I ever want to go through again This will prollably stear me away from staying at this property again , The restaurant and the breakfast in bed 
491413,Ramada Plaza Milano, The swimming pool was shut both days due to rain it did not even rain was just cloudy why was it included in the price if we were not even able to use it this was dissapointing The sound outside I guess for the air conditioning or swimming pool was annoying we had to close balcony doors because of the sound we stayed 2 night second morning around 8 am the staff started to cut the grass the sound was terrible so that woke us up and was really annoying as we were on holiday and wanted to relax We have ordered food rooms service and the cessar salad was the most disguisting I have ever had there was dry salad no souce or anything the chicken was raw it was disguisting not had even a single piece out of it it s 12 Very dissapointed this is not how the cessar salad is made The breakfast was ok ish the bacon was cold there were no patatoes left at 9am We would come back to hotel just because the rooms are nice tidy but overall did not like the food services staff was not very friendly did not smile and were not that helpfull , The room balcony room was spacious and fully air conditioned was extremely tidy and very modern the spa was nice very quite and relaxing The hotel was not too far from the station The hotel was not too crowded 
491414,Ramada Plaza Milano, Location bit far but still it s 15 minutes walk to the train station , Overall good it s furnished services apartments perfectly suited for families traveling and staying for few days with their families we stayed there for few days but was great and rooms are very well equipped 
491415,Ramada Plaza Milano, The eggs to order were an extra charge Scrambled eggs were the only option on the breakfast menu The hotel was slightly outside the city, Great room and facilities

491417,Ramada Plaza Milano, Although we had booked a mini suite we weren t provided with anything to use them i e no kettle cutlery plates bottle opener etc When we enquired it would have been an extra 20 non refundable Would have been useful if there were even basics in the room kettle etc to be able to make the complimentary coffee and tea , Room was excellent spacious and clean beds comfortable towels and toiletries plentiful 
491418,Ramada Plaza Milano, There was a disgusting unpleasant stink of sewage coming up from the toilet It was barely possible to have a quick shower because of this constant smell I ve complained twice but nothing else than a touch of deodorant was done They haven t offered me to change room neither a discount at the check out Sun chairs at the swimming pool are for a fee sounded me like a Ryanair pool where you have to pay frills , Modern hotel with modern rooms Nice Garden and bar Nice location although not in the city centre 
491419,Ramada Plaza Milano, Smell in bathroom noisy air conditioner , Good breakfast clean room quiet location but far from downtown you need car or to use subway Relative pleasant staff 
491420,Ramada Plaza Milano, I had to experience uncomfortable moments due to the way of a few of but not all receptionists to address my questions as a guest It is pity that sets of conversation as such ruined the overall good impression of the hotel , Room facility was excellent daily cleaning service was done in professional manners 
491421,Ramada Plaza Milano, There is nothing negative to say about this hotel , We booked the executive room and this was really nice everything was provided dressing beautiful bathroom king size bed terrace free access to the wellness There is a fitness wellness swimming pool The breakfast also met our expectations everything was provided fresh fruit yogurt hot dishes dolce The service was very good and the Staff at the welcome desk was very friendly 
491422,Ramada Plaza Milano, There wasn t any AIC certified gluten free restaurant I had guest with this need and we had to go out of the hotel to eat The price was 10 more than forecast on booking com but the place and services were very good so it s ok, The room was extra super clean pretty merry happy new large with an Amazing landscape view The same applies to all the common spaces hall hotel desk reception path to rooms gardens everything The staff was very kind and very focused and ready to care every request
491423,Ramada Plaza Milano, The room was nice but the thing is my room was suite and there s no suite room for grarden view for me it doesn t make sense, The room was nice location is quite good Also breakfast was good 
491424,Ramada Plaza Milano,No Negative, About 600 meters to the metro station quiet far from the touristic zone of the city but it takes 15 min from the centre to nearest metro station and it takes maximum 10 mins walk Biggest problem for us was we couldn t go out late in the night not that it was not safe but there was nothing arround and metro is closed at 12 30 Nice hotel by the way very nice staff and very clean
491425,Ramada Plaza Milano, the bad sheets curtains and bathroom appliances should be cleaned more thoroughly The dishes in the breakfast area are not clean The breakfast area is too small for the high number of rooms, The hotel is close to the Turro metro station The rooms and balcony have a good size the bad was comfortable the rooms are very well sound proofed the surroundings are ok
491426,Ramada Plaza Milano, In the bathroom was constantly a bad smell, The staff here is really great they even gave us a city map and nice tips The bed was large and very comfortable and the breakfast rich and tasty The parking was to our surprise free based on availability in front of the hotel 
491427,Ramada Plaza Milano, No one came to pick up luggage from taxi Food and beverage charged with Euro 5 extra per order NO iron in room Though recd after request , Value for money property 
491428,Ramada Plaza Milano, The breakfasts were rather disappointing The cooked food was not well prepared The jams were very basic Some of the fruit was tinned One would expect better in Italy We did not shave lunch or dinner at the hotel So maybe this would have been better , The hotel was located 5 minutes walk from where the family live and 6 minutes from the metro very convenient for us 
491429,Ramada Plaza Milano, I reserved a suite I assume the most expensive room in the hotel Behind my bed there was a housekeeping office The first morning at 8 30 I was waken up because they were doing a lot of noise When I went for breakfast I told this to the housekeeper and she started arguing saying that it was not her fault that she had to work and that this made noise I went to reception and asked to see the duty manager The receptionist said that he could help me I insisted that I wanted to see the duty manager Ha asked why I said that he wanted to complain When I explained him the situation his answer was I need to check because they start working at 9 00 This means that he doubting of what I was describing I understood that there was nothing else to say The next morning I was waken up at 8 40 Not with so much noise but on a Sunday you pay a room to sleep not to be waken up The hotel has huge terraces but not a single chair outside , Car parking
491430,Ramada Plaza Milano, We had a fantastic room with a fantastic balcony but there wasn t any furniture to sit outside and have a glass of wine beer and gaze over the city , This hotel is fabulous and very easy to get to from Malpensa Airport T2 Get express train to Cadorna then change to red line Metro Sesto and it s about 11 quick stops The breakfast catered for all hot food pastries cereals cold meats and cheeses fresh fruit tea and coffee The spa facility is amazing too and well worth finding the time to use although please note it is closed on Monday s Staff were very welcoming and friendly 
491431,Ramada Plaza Milano, there was a noise coming from the garden it was electricity room noise like a motor working The noise lasts 24 hours a day A very troubled situation for those with sensitive sleep I told the hotel staff They were said that they needed to work it ,No Positive
491432,Ramada Plaza Milano, Bit of a walk to the nearest metro station , Staff were polite and helpful Executive room was very clean and spacious Lovely walk in shower and massive bed 
491433,Ramada Plaza Milano, WiFi was not working We had to resort to a LAN cable or to the Staff s private WiFi The dinner at the brasserie was definitely overpriced Table service was poor , Room was large bed was comfortable bathroom was good 
491434,Ramada Plaza Milano, They have provided coffee tea sugar and 2 cups however no coffee kettle available When I requested the kettle they said your room level can t have one I said then why you provide these facilities they couldn t answer The location is not near the center nor the shopping facilities , Staff smiling faces
491435,Ramada Plaza Milano, Horrible odor during our entry to the hotel since the drainage was being cleaned Other folks were also running to their rooms to get away from the foul smell No cutlery in kitchen have to pay extra making the kitchen useless, Good spacious room with comfortable bedroom
491436,Ramada Plaza Milano, Everything is perfect, Location is good 15 minutes to Duomo by metro red line It is easy to anywhere Taxi 12 Euros from Centale There is a shuttle to loreto for passing other metro lines also to turro M1 Staff is really helpfull They provide great service Breakfast was also good Rooms are big and comfortable 
491437,Ramada Plaza Milano, Breakfast was poor Did I say the breakfast was poor , Relaxed atmosphere Transport to Milan centre was easy And to get back to the airport was easy Great little restaurant 300m away the receptionist told me to go there mmmm good food and not expensive 
491438,Ramada Plaza Milano, The facilities are a bit old for a four star hotel especially the sound insulation During the last night we stayed in the room that they transferred us to but we can hear the baby next door crying the whole night My sleeping quality was really bad Maybe they should separate the guests with kids to those rooms with better sound insulation , The staff are very friendly and helpful When the TV in our room was not working they came to help and transferred us to another room when they could not fix the TV at once 
491439,Ramada Plaza Milano,No Negative, We stayed at double room It was well furnitured and wide enough The bed was really king size and confortable even 4 people can sleep on it We didn t hear any noise Sound insulation is really good The hotel is located at 10 minutes walking distance to the nearest metro station Breakfast was successful Homemade cakes were very delicious The room and bathroom were very clean The shower was very usefull everything was good Thanks 
491440,Ramada Plaza Milano, If you are going there to shop its a little bit far and the only way is by taxi 20 euros back and forth , The location of the property is good if you want to stay near the train station its about 20 mins from the milano centrale station They do offer a free shuttle to the train station I love their breakfast the selection was good The room size was also fantastic its really big and the we had a terrace I love that it had two restaurants and a fitness area as well as a pool Its very good for families The place was lovely very comfortable and the staff was polite and very nice 
491441,Ramada Plaza Milano, When booking it seemed like a better location It was disappointing the indoor spa was closed and the outdoor areas during mid late march when the weather was warmer , The hotel itself and staff were lovely
491442,Ramada Plaza Milano, This has been the worst hotel that we ever stayed in we ve been to over 500 hotels so far in terms of service rooms Customer orientation The aircon was broken we had 32C in the room with our 2y old child Nobody cared Spa pool wasnt open They cheated us with taxes that we had to pay twice by check in and check out Stay AWAY from this hotel , The only good thing was the nice asian roomlady who cleaned the room perfectly and the driver who droves the free shuttle bus to the city 
491443,Ramada Plaza Milano, Wifi is working really slow or sometimes just turns off Location is really bad as it is too far from the city centre and information on website is not correct it is about 15 min walk from metro station instead of 5 Overall was not pleasant experience nothing special and I don t recommend this property ,No Positive
491444,Ramada Plaza Milano, Poor service Poor room Jack and Jill connecting room wasn t told this by staff not what I paid for Noise from neighbour pointless staying in a Hotel rather call it a hostel Told staff nothing done Trying to be a posh Hotel but failing in all aspects No privacy always had bad experience at RAMADAS Even the Birmingham UK one is Poor , Nothing At 2am walked out 
491445,Ramada Plaza Milano, Far from Metro Station Turro First hotel I have ever been in the entire world 3 4 5 where you have to pay if you want benedict eggs at breakfast very strange this approach for a hotel expensive enough , Stuff cleanliness very quiet area
491446,Ramada Plaza Milano, The spa area was closed but the lady at the reception mentioned it was written on the website Just could not find it at booking com, Everything was great except the spa area was closed
491447,Ramada Plaza Milano, I don t have any complaints Anyway I didn t spend too much time in the hotel , The room and bathroom were clean and the bed very comfortable I liked the selection of the products for breakfast various and very good products The members of the staff were friendly and helpful

491449,Ramada Plaza Milano, Everything The staff and security were rude and arrogant The facilities were dirty there was rubbish outside that resembled a tip The pool was shut the spa was broke The lights in room were faulty , Nothing It was truly the worst ever hotel I have ever stayed in 
491450,Ramada Plaza Milano, many rooms depends on which block you stay don t have direct access to reception and restaurant you have to go outside and walk cca 20m through the courtyard not very comfy in winter or bad weather, great breakfast large room
491451,Ramada Plaza Milano, The fact that I had to get out of the main building to go to the bedroom B building but then I realized that there are 5 different buildings but this does not really effect the product, The total product was good in comparison to other similar and the price was good
491452,Ramada Plaza Milano, The reception staff was not present for assistance when i came at 2 00 and they had no phone to connect to it was a little ridiculous for a hotel like Ramada not having reception staff in night ,No Positive
491453,Ramada Plaza Milano, We paid for a Studio with kitchen the kitchen had no utensils etc when we asked reception we were told we had to pay 35 for the use of the kitchen We were given 2 tea bags for the 3 day stay However we had no milk or even a kettle Staff were ignorant and obnoxious Paid for something we didnt get ,No Positive
491454,Ramada Plaza Milano, Going Home love Italy so much, We actually liked absolutely everything about this hotel please please don t be put off by the negative comments on here we nearly cancelled our booking because we read such bad comments but are so glad we didn t we are very particular and stay at hotels regularly and we were very happy The hotel is very clean the buffet breakfast was exceptional with lots of choice including a hot breakfast choice offering bacon sausage eggs etc and the chocolate and custard croissants were delicious it definitely sets you up for the day The metro is literally at the end of the road so if you go out of the left side of the hotel you just walk to the end of the road and you will see it there so easy We stayed here from 28th Dec for five nights and so were there for new year and they had a New Years Eve Party and for 70 euros you had a five course meal and red nad white wine included which was off a very good quality we were also given a bottle of prosecco at midnight to do a toast it was a great evening with live music If you go to the bar early evening there are complimentary snacks which I think is a nice touch All the staff on reception were really lovely and the young girl Jessica in the restaurant was really helpful and a real credit to your staff The room we booked was a suite and was perfect in every way spacious and the bed very big and comfortable also complimentary toiletries We went to Lake Como and didn t book a trip so asked reception for directions which is so easy and you save a lot of money We did do the Bernina Express which is a train that goes to the Swiss alps which was really fantastic The hotel also provide a free transfer to the central bus station in Milan regularly through the day which is really great We will definitely return to this hotel in the future loved it 
491455,Ramada Plaza Milano, I asked for an upper floor and I always got like second floor without any explanation twice The location is not good you need to travel a lot and the neigbourhood is not nice either , Nice spacious apartment clean I liked the Nescafe coffe maker in the room 
491456,Ramada Plaza Milano, A little bit far away from center thought we had car and was kind of 15min drive , Very nice room suite really worth the extra money All people where friendly 
491457,Ramada Plaza Milano, The location wasn t walkable to the city centre but very easily accessible by metro , Room and bed were super comfortable Facilities were good Breakfast in the morning was great large selection 
491458,Ramada Plaza Milano, We were charged extra 10 euros because we stayed in the lobby I don t know why , The room was great We were given a king bed as requested amazing Rich breakfast the food was fresh and tasty Good location 
491459,Ramada Plaza Milano, It was impossible to reduce the amount of heat that the air heating system was bringing into the room We ended up with opening the window We don t smoke so we didn t appreciate the nasty smell of tobacco smoke which was coming most of the night from the ventilation system ,No Positive
491460,Ramada Plaza Milano, Except for two tea cups and two tea spoons there was nothing else in the kitchen no kettle no plates nor kitchen utensils of any kind There was a microwave and a ceramic cook top but there were no containers which could be used to prepare food The manager in the lobby told us that kitchen facilities could be provided for an extra charge of 35 euro per day It is not clear what kind of facilities you will get for that price , We stayed in an apartment in the tower D It had brand new furniture was very quiet had a large balcony 
491461,Ramada Plaza Milano, Till now the whole amount is withholded in my credit card although I have paid on premises with another visa They did not tried to help me after all , King size bed and comford facilitation
491462,Ramada Plaza Milano, The area where the hotel is doesn t seem very nice , It was a warm modern hotel with a very good service and facilities It is worth the money sb pays for It has a shuttle bus both for the airport and the city centre We used the one for downtown and was very conviniet As for its breakfast it very good 
491463,Ramada Plaza Milano, We used the Spa facilities during our stay and we were not impressed The Jacuzzi was cold there were two steam rooms and one wasn t working and the other one was barely warm There were a few experience showers but not much of an experience Don t book this hotel if you are after the spa facilities but apart from that it was a comfortable stay , We stayed in a double room with a King Size bed for two nights during our visit to Milan The room was very spacious comfortable and well decorated and we had a giant balcony There was also a mini fridge where we could keep some snacks The breakfast was good with a range of hot breakfast items scrambled eggs bacon and sausages and cold food items like yogurt bread croissants cakes and fruit I ve stayed in quite a few Italian hotels and this was the only one which had a few hot breakfast items 
491464,Ramada Plaza Milano, But far from attractions But the subway was easy to use other than that really good hotel, Really well presented great bed with a nice room layout Great bed and great shower Fairly nice staff The women at the reception was gorgeous lol overall really good hotel
491465,Ramada Plaza Milano, the walls or especially the doors were not soundproof we stayed in one side of the family room and you could hear everything through the door what people were doing on the other side quite disturbing , location was good close to metro station room was clean and bed was huge and comfortable staff was friendly 
491466,Ramada Plaza Milano, nothing on the balcony only 1 chair , large rooms with a big balcony and a wonderful bathroom from the bed you can look right through the large windows on the city and the sky service excellent shuttelbuses in to the city very nice driver thanks again to the staff we had a great time in ramada plaza 
491467,Ramada Plaza Milano, Studio apartment means it comes with kitchenettes but there s no cutleries nor kettle Called the receptionist asking how do I boil the water and she ask me to boil it using microwave Which I think its absurd Anyhow If most of you haven t informed Milan hotels around will charge you city tax per person for each of the days you re staying in So make sure prepare some extra cash , We stayed in studio apartment It is clean and it has a huge balcony The staff is friendly the receptionist staff There s free shuttle bus to the centrale station which is good 
491468,Ramada Plaza Milano, If you do not want to use metro or taxi to go to the city center you may want to think again Taxi charges about 25 euros between the hotel and Duomo Other thing is they close the bar at lobby midnight Other than that you will like it , The reception staff was very friendly and helpful The room was comfy and modern If you can t decide where to stay this is it 6 minutes walking to Turro metro station and Toasteria mi Casa is very close for a nice breakfast with lots of toast varieties coffee and croussants 
491469,Ramada Plaza Milano, The breakfast was plentiful but average Given the extraordinary amenities of the hotel a little more attention could have been paid to breakfast But again it was not bad , The hotel s facilities were excellent We stayed in a suite to provide extra space for our 1 year old to walk around in It was far more space than we had expected There were 2 separate balconies as well as a walk in closet that was the size of an entire hotel room in a downtown location Sure it s outside the city center but with just a 5 minute walk to the metro this value could not be beat 
491470,Ramada Plaza Milano, Did not fulfill the expectations Room the use of the kitchen ia a paying option the bed is noisy In the morning the cleaning staff was making noise and enter our room without checking To go to the gym or restaurant we need to go outside which is quite unpleasant when is cold Gym no one at the reception no water Empty no service towel and not an extensive list of equipments Location There is nothing around restaurants convenience stores , Room size close to metro station 5 min walking and the minimum facilities facilities are available e g gym minimum equipment swimming pool restaurant 
491471,Ramada Plaza Milano, Nothing like pictures no table on balconies as advertised Spa closed on Monday Most of the facilities at the spa closed No outside room Poor breakfast menu, Clean rooms with free wifi
491472,Ramada Plaza Milano, Breakfast items did run out at times but the hotel was quite busy The subway was over a 5 minute walk but not a problem for us, Our suite was fantastic Everything was first class 2 balconies walk in wardrobe sofa excellent facilites
491473,Ramada Plaza Milano, The location is in a neighbourhood kind of area Time to central abut 15 mint by taxi and it would cost 20 to 25 euros , Big rooms with balcony the interior of the rooms and everything about the room was just too fantastic Rooms are well equipped Near to train station 7 to 10 mins by car Very near to metro and bus stop Supermarket just across the road 
491474,Ramada Plaza Milano,No Negative, In walking distance to Turro subway station on M1 it works perfectly as a base to start exploring the city Located in a quite area impressive cleanliness good breakfast 
491475,Ramada Plaza Milano, A bit far from the city center but the metro was 5mins walk from the hotel and 20mins to city center from there , Clean rooms spacious and staff was helpful
491476,Ramada Plaza Milano, We did not have nice welcome and seems they still have to learn what service to customers really means It s a shame but it is so that first impression you get is the one you will retain Spa half the equipment was not working Yes there is big terrasse but no chair no table so you do not really benefit from it just standing there may be in summer they have Restaurant we did not find it so good or special We asked pasta instead of potatoes for one dish and the waiter almost had heart attack saying the chef would never accept etc I will not go back nor recommend unfortunately , Size of the room and the big terrasse the little park which must be pleasure on beautiful days we went in October 
491477,Ramada Plaza Milano, The room service is absolutely dreadful and extremely overpriced was easily the worst food I had in Milan, The staff are very friendly and helpful and the room was lovely and clean and a decent size with lots of storage
491478,Ramada Plaza Milano, Over powering smell of paint resulting in swollen eyes and head ache TV not working cold room heating only operated at reception asked for another room where the shower leaked all over bathroom floor however after a long negotiations with manager we were given a free a night, Rooms spacious clean
491479,Ramada Plaza Milano, The reception service could be better We were asked to pay upon our check in The reception employee told us that the card we made the reservation did not work when they did a pre check the day before our arrival but it was the exact same card that they accepted next morning when we checked in Not really nice , Nice hotel in alocation not too far away from the city center but not too close either Breakfast was very good and the rooms very clean and comfortable and spacious A few nice restaurants located near the hotel 
491480,Ramada Plaza Milano, Unfortunately the restaurant in the hotel does not serve dinner Fortunately nearby are the local restaurants , Good communication with the center and short way to the metro station Nice hotel for rest after the intensive day in Milano 
491481,Ramada Plaza Milano, The location was a little further from city center than we liked but the subway got us there without a problem , I liked our balcony and the breakfast was very good 
491482,Ramada Plaza Milano, Attitude of staff It was worst in my life They was trying to cheating me with payment I will not go there anymore and not suggesting to anybody to use this hotel ,No Positive
491483,Ramada Plaza Milano, Kitchen cutlery missing seemed weird But we ate out most of the time so wasnt a huge inconvenience But as they advertise a kitchen it should have the basics to eat with , Great service and good breakfasts Clean and modern with all the facilities Easy access to metro and city shopping etc The Kitchen let them down as NO cutlery and two plates So couldnt really use the kitchen It is modern with ceramic hob and separate bench top grill even pots and pans But no knives or cutlery to eat with 
491484,Ramada Plaza Milano, It s kind of located in a sketchy part of town We stayed here because it was cheaper than staying in the heart of milan and we had a car It s about a 10 15 minute walk to the nearest metro and then a quick ride into the city The walk to the metro felt a little unsafe but that is possible in any big city Also the front desk staff weren t very friendly or helpful , Room was very large with nice balcony Bed was also big and comfortable Hotel was very clean Also free parking and breakfast were a plus 
491485,Ramada Plaza Milano, Far from the city center not an easy commute, Nice staff Eventhough it is far form center they have someone who takes you to a nice restaurant nearby 
491486,Ramada Plaza Milano, Poor Wi Fi but good enough for a social application on a phone or tablet , Generous and varied breakfast Quiet neighborhood and close enough to the city center by metro line underground 
491487,Ramada Plaza Milano, The hotel is a long way from Milan s centre Despite the act that the food in the restaurant is outstanding I was there for 3 nights and only eat there once as the service was terrible Having to ask 3 or 4 times for anything becomes a little wearing These are minor complaints and do not detract from this being a very good hotel , A very good hotel with 1st class facilities and staff Rooms are spacious and very comfortable The food in the restaurant is excellent 
491488,Ramada Plaza Milano, They don t have good channels to serve the Arab people and thers no even English channels for movies, I like the the price and the quality of clean in the room
491489,Ramada Plaza Milano, For such a lovely room it was surprising that there was only one chair at the desk table so it wasn t too good for room service Also we booked this hotel for the balcony and view as seen in the photos on booking com we were looking forward to ordering a bottle of wine and some food for the night to eat out on the balcony The view however was of the apartments across the road and there was no furniture on the balcony We went into the center of Milan to eat instead , We got an upgrade which was a nice touch and the room itself was incredible About 14 to the centre of Milan in a taxi which is OK and the hotel will call it for you or you can get the metro down the road The room was spotless and the staff were really friendly and helpful
491490,Ramada Plaza Milano, location is not top although close to a metro station one toilet in hotel lobby was not clean But this might just be a temporary issue I guess , Very helpful friendly staff swimming pool garden gym putting green bikes shuttle
491491,Ramada Plaza Milano, Location this hotel is located in a not too great residential area north of the city centre and is a good 10 minute walk to the nearest metro station There s little of note within the immediate area although we did find two restaurants on the main drag via Monza to eat at which were OK but nothing special When we first arrived on a Saturday afternoon we had to walk for 20 minutes South to find a reasonable street cafe where we could sit and have a beer and a bite , Up to the expected standard of a city centre four star Ramada in a Western European city Free shuttle bus transfer to the main railway station each hour was welcome Staff that we interacted with were all efficient and courteous
