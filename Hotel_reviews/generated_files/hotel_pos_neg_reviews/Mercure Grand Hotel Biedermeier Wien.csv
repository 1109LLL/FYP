366236,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, My first impression about this hotel was spoiled at the reception when checking in The staff was polite however the policy of the hotel seems over commercial At the moment of checking in when you are tired and all you want is get in the room you have booked they provide you with a numer of offers First they offer you a special offer for breakfast Then there comes offer to become a meber come on how can I decide to become a member at this point in time if I haven t even seen my room then there is an offer for a meal in the restaurant A bit too much Then they explain that they reserve more money from your card in case you damage something or use extra services I would recommend the hotel to shorten the amount of information given at the check in Wifi worked well but logging in was again in a special procedure and therefore longer than usually The room was quite dark Walk to the city center is a bit too long better use metro for getting around the city The closest metro station is short walk away , Huge comfortable and clean standard room I loved the design of the room and the hotel Nice area Close to Vienna Mitte station which is very convenient for travelling to Vienna airport I used cheap S7 train instead of CAT to get to the airport and metro use 
366237,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, It is not easy to access the hotel from the main street especially if you have luggage The pathway leading to the hotel is long and bumpy Expect to loose the wheels of your luggage The first room that we were offered was on the 1st floor It was nice but with inefficient A C so we changed it with another one on the 2nd floor The water pressure in the shower was weak and the tub s sink was partially blocked Guests have to walk long ways to reach from the lifts to to the rooms Blankets are very thin and uncomfortable , Being near to the train station Staff were friendly and informative Room was of average size comparing to Vienna As it was our anniversary the hotel showed a nice gesture by placing a free bottle of Champaign although we don t consume alcohol but it was a nice thing of them 
366238,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Restaurant Breakfast is boring for 5 days we used the restaurant for brekkie Should have wide selection Fresh fruits The waitress is not so attentive COFFEE is not hot at all So disappointing , Location is very good Accessible to everywhere U Bahn Bus Drugstore supermarket cofffeshop and etc Enjoyable walk to the Centre it was easy with kids 
366239,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, In general there could have been a better warmer personal relationship between the staff of the hotel and guests My impression was that there was some staff shortage , It was a quiet hotel in the middle of Vienna in a historical building which kept its authentic atmosphere We had to walk only for 5 minutes to the equally excellent Vienna public transport system It was the ideal combination of a refuge while being at the same time connected to the local neighborhood Infrastructure around the hotel was excellent regarding restaurants coffee shops shopping opportunities parks museums and culture 
366240,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, sauna was switched of ealier than stated in the hotel information, very good breakfast nice restaurant terrace in a beautiful backyard with many plants and trees loveley situated in several old buildings separated by a small private alley with restaurant caf centrally located tram and underground station in walking distance Biedermeyer stile furniture and interior very classy nice sauna area
366241,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien,No Negative, Great place with great location 5 min walking from wien mitte with all the transportation that needed The staff was very nice and kind and we had a great time The place located in a nice passage with restaurants and coffe places the hotel also have it s own reataurant and bar with very good atmosphere
366242,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien,No Negative, The hotel was clean and friendly The room was spacious well decorated and furnished clean and bright The bed was sizable and comfortable the bathroom was cleaned well each day and everything provided for It was well located to the centre of the city and key points of transportation to travel throughout the city The breakfast is not cheap 16 euros but is an excellent spread of cereal fruit cold cuts cheeses bread juices and yogurts The courtyard where breakfast is served is beautiful The hotel is quiet and the staff friendly 
366243,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien,No Negative, The hotel was clean and friendly The room was spacious well decorated and furnished clean and bright The bed was sizable and comfortable The bathroom was cleaned well each day and everything provided for It was well located to the centre of the city and key points of transportation to travel throughout the city The breakfast is not cheap 16 euros but is an excellent spread of cereal fruit cold cuts cheeses bread juices and yogurts The courtyard where breakfast is served is beautiful The hotel is quiet and the staff friendly 
366244,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Air conditioning was not up to much and it was very hot when we visited in late May , Hotel was excellent very clean comfort beds and we had a large room Very good restaurant attached and breakfast very varied to suit all Easy walking distance to public transport or into city centre about 15 mins 
366245,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Tiny shower recess no fat person could enter Gave bottle water first day asked but no avail Second day 1 1 2 L next door 19 cents cheap Bastards Asked for second soap can t do , Good location and breakfast very helpful waitresses
366246,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, WIFI was quite slow and the room was a bit smaller than expected, every thing was perfect except for the WIFI it was quite slow and the room was a bit smaller than expected
366247,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Unfortunately this hotel is a little tired round the edges and although holds a nice old charm to it the room was not overly clean and in need of refurbishment , A well located hotel within our budget to explore the city 
366248,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Rooms were a little small Understand it is an older hotel in heart of city but felt cramped Restaurant service was not up to par Waiter brought wrong entre for me Gin Martini was horrible Could not taste any gin Tasted like dishwater ,No Positive
366249,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien,No Negative, Great location Wien Mitte station is a very short walk away so its easy to get in from airport Possible to walk to dowtown attractions or 2 metro stations nearby if short on time Good room helpful staff shopping right around the corner Seems like a pretty good neighbourhood
366250,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Too far from main tourist attractions A daily start of 15 20 mins walk each day becomes tiring , Comfortable bed Very quiet at night for a good sleep
366251,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, A bit long and narrow corridor from lift to our room but it was not a big deal , Warm welcome I could check in since arrival at 8 00 am That was so great 
366252,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, The place is OK but Already paid for the room and still aske for credit card 50 Euro deposit Therefore I expected a fully stocked minibar However in fridge there was a note If you pay 12 5 Euro we will stock the minibar and give you high speed internet The hotel chain maybe a good investment for your savings but is not my first choice when it comes to spending my spare time , Close to Wien Mitte good for early morning flights 
366253,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Rooms are not soundproof you can hear in the hallway but other wise the area was very quiet , Spacious room comfortable beds felt very new and clean big bathroom and tub super location to the train station for the airport 
366254,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Soundproof could be better Breakfast is pretty poor and tables with food spread around whole restaurant its a little bit confusing where you can find some dishes , Really quite place with own garden Big rooms and quite good gym Located just 5 minutes from central station 
366255,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, The bed was hard as a rock and room a bit outdated but it was clean and well kept a classic room for old style hotels I understand , Location and helpful friendly staff accommodated my early arrival which was great after a very long flight 
366256,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Perhaps a sign on main street highlighting the location of Hotel entrance, Hello guys I m from Ireland and was in Vienna on a short conference trip Staff were exceptionally helpful I had to print off my outbound boarding card and asked at reception was there any near internet cafe place They said they had facilities for quests with free printing and PC s and stuff and showed me where it was I had issues using Firefox as this is not my default IE but the girls changed it to Chrome and the language to English I knew I was annoying them but they never lost patience with me and stayed until I was sorted The free wifi was very good and I was able to skype to my beautiful wife to be and watch youtube video s and the RTE player etc Room and facilities were perfect for me and I couldn t fault anything Location of the hotel is perfect as it is city centre and 3 mins walk from Wien Mitte where you get off the CAT from the airport Nearby shopping facilites and even an Aldi store on the street around the corner As I hadn t much sleep travelling over I have to emphasize the location is at a right angle to the main street landstrasse and is accessed via a cobbled street so it s very quite 
366257,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, The entrance was a little hard to find , Room was super quiet clean and spacious with a nice view of an inner courtyard The staff was friendly and helpful 
366258,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, The room was super warm We had to have the windows open at all times even though it was 3 outside at night Beds really lumpy No english channels on the TV When we checked in they reserved almost 60 EUR on our creditcard something we hadn t been informed about in advance This was in case we ordered something to our room or dined at the hotel resturant Been to lots of hotels and never had to pay in advance for services we knew we wouldnt use Although you get the money back when you check out we had 60 EUR less to spend on our holiday Not ok , Good location nice staff and good service at breakfast Subway and trainconnections are close Lots of nice cafes around 
366259,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, This hotel will suit you if you are 93 years old and travel across Europe as part of a pensioner s discounted bus tour group , The one good thing to be said about this place is the central location 
366260,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, The cleaning of the room was terrible By the end of our stay there had been no attempt to dust the room We wrote our name in the dust on the desk shelf No cleaning of the bathroom floor at alll You get one bottle of water on arrival and no more even though we were there for eleven days There was no provision for supper on Christmas Eve You had to have the 65 supper or go without All restaurants in town were closed We could not get a light bar snack nor room service I am sure the same situation existed for New Year s Eve but we bought in snacks so we were protected from being ripped off , Friendly front office bar and kitchen staff
366261,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Service charges on everything from water in the rooms to high service charges for delivering it to the room Room electronics can be improved to save running around and lighting or shutting off lamps , Close to Wien Mitte secluded and peaceful 
366262,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Double room was very tiny cramped for two people Located on a corridor it was noisy one day my room was not cleaned , Location is good very convenient for city centre and good shops around 
366263,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, The shower was leaking so that was a bit uncomfortable , Nice rooms great location nearby train subway station but also walking distance to centre 
366264,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Better lighting needed in sitting room area where there were too few lamps and reading in the late afternoon or evening was difficult , Great location easy walking distance to city centre and the Christmas markets yet off the beaten path enough that you were not in the thick of the crowds all of the time Excellent beds rooms very generous Buffet breakfast extensive freshly made omelettes made for a great start to a day of exploring 
366265,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Wifi was very slow For this price you would expect a little more in terms of comfort in general , Location was convenient building itself is old and provides a nice atmosphere breakfast was good
366266,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Stuff rarely smile rough treatment they hardly can make simple calculations very poor about using proper English , Room space was perfect bed is so comfortable bath room was clean Breakfast was great
366267,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, The room needs a renovation old furniture wood windows and the heating system was not working properly We finally managed to get a small heater in the room and it was fine after that , Great location very good breakfast and the staff excepting some waiters were very nice 
366268,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, The room was quite small The heating system blew hot air to the room even though the temperature was already over 26 degree Celsius The thermometer broken The instruction given was to shut down the whole system , Great milieu good breakfast and comfort beds Excellent location 
366269,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, There were two things I did not particularly like about this hotel First one was that they blocked 400euros from my bank account in case my credit card was fraud I believe that almost 150euros per night in a 4 star hotel should get me a better treatment than you might be a thief so just in case we re blocking money from your account without even telling me about it It would probably be okay if they told me in advance and did it diplomaticaly not that I had to find out for myself The staff should also refrain from telling me that it is because I might be a fraud Second inconvenience was the small breakfast restaurant Some people had to wait in a rather long line for it in the morning , Wonderful location beautiful buildings very cosy and spacious rooms tasty breakfasts 
366270,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Nothing it was perfect , A beautiful and typically Austrian style hotel with high standards and very attentive staff Spotlessly clean and very warm and comfortable Great breakfast Highly recommended and we would have no hesitation in visiting again 
366271,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, The room was very small and very award bathroom was so old and white tiles were brown and corners were looking scary old look where you had the feeling is is clean or is this because it is very old The bed was put directly on the wall where you need to go around the bed to get in to First time ever i saw something awkward like this The furniture was just put there without any taste somehow somewhere When you enter the room you feel like Oh nooo but i stayed one night and didn t want to bother just passed that one day , The location is very good the staff came across as friendly
366272,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Not enough number of plugs for charging phones and ipad only 2 It took a longer time to get warm water in the bath maybe because it was rhe 3rd floor , Comfortable bed warm in the room good location
366273,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, , very close to the center of the city very clean rooms very comfortable bed and appliances very good Wifi signal varied options for the breakfast very well cooked and tasty food 
366274,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Temperature control wasn t working room was terribly overheated Fortunately I could open the window , Excellent location on a tongue twisting Landstrasser Hauptstrasse a few minutes walk to Wien Mitte Station with two subway lines and CAT train to the airport It takes about 20 25 mins to walk to St Stephens The hotel is in a lovely historical building The room was equipped with all the necessities tea pot mini bar safe I didn t use the hotel restaurant opting instead for a traditional St Martin s goose at Weissgerber Stube in front of the hotel 
366275,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, our 3rd visit at the hotel within 12 months we arrived in the evening and were given our room which turned out to be very very small room maybe o k for one night stay we were booked for 6 days our complanint was immidiately taken care off and we resetled in a very nice comfortable room ,No Positive
366276,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Room on the small size Main dinner restaurant menu limited although Stube good value, Breakfast having good range to meet all tastes Breakfast staff attentive and helpful Easy access from air terminal station Wien Mitte
366277,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Staff during breakfast could be a bit more attentive in clearing tables and ensuring crockery cutlery and coffee are replaced more promptly as we had to ask for these items every morning during our 4 night stay , Friendly staff clean hotel and very good buffett breakfast Location of hotel excellent 10 mins walk to Wien Mitte railway station for connection to the airport Recommend the S7 line rather than the CAT as it s half the price and only takes 10 mins more 
366278,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, No feather duvets and pillows which for Austria is very unusual Requested them but only synthetic available , Lovely building with a lot of character Well situated
366279,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Small details only no refill of bath gel and shampoo noise at the bathroom that was not repaired Otherwise, Cosy charm great location only 10 minutes walk of the main attractions affordable good breakfast nice restaurant For Vienna for sure I will return to this hotel
366280,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, I have no major complaints just small quibbles Breakfast was a little dull with a cramped breakfast area unless you found a seat in the garden Some of the bedrooms could have done with refreshed paintwork and carpets , The service was very good and genuinely helpful The rooms were mostly very good with a few minor quibbles The beds were exceptionally comfortable Although not in the very centre of the city it was a 10 15 minute stroll from the hotel so no real effort
366281,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Tea and coffee poor at breakfast The Toaster needs replacing, Couldn t be better placed for the CAT and the main city sights Food and service in the resaurant excellent and reasonably priced service good too 
366282,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, The air condition did not seem to work properly The room was always too hot as compared to the hallway where AC was working nicely We also had some troubles with internet from the beginning , The hotel is extremely well located for people who want to explore the city by foot as well as for people coming by a plane The Mitte station with a frequent connection to the airport is 5 minutes far by a walk Our room as well as a bathroom were spacious and clean quiet and comfortable We have tried also the hotel restaurant and the food was tasty and for a reasonable price 
366283,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, It s not cheap , The location is ideal a bus stop opposite that is one stop from the Wien Mitte interchange mall However the layout of the hotel means that the rooms are away from the street and really quiet 
366284,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, I think the hotel should create rooms for families with 2 kids in parents room Eventually it was quite expensive to book 2 rooms due to this lack of option Also the shower s doors and properly fit so much of the water leaked and created a pool outside annoying , Good location close to The underground and outskirts of city center The reception is a bit far from the street so walking with luggage is uncomfortable The staff is very nice There was a bit of a problem with the reservation but the staff fixed it 
366285,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, I didn t like that the iron and ironing board was provided at the end of the corridor and not in the bedroom A bellboy would be a great help to handle the luggages from the street entrance to the reception it was bit hard but manageable , I liked the cleanliness of the hotel the good size of the bedroom and easy check in check out We stayed only one night to catch our flight on the next day the location was convenient The hotel is gorg little gem 
366286,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, The room was much smaller than the photos on booking com especially bathroom was tiny that one cannot enter shower cabine without being extremely flexible , We needed just 5 10 minutes walking to center the hotel was clean and the stuff were helpful even when we ve arrived to the hotel late the street of it still lively We could live our luggage to reception for free
366287,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, The furniture in the room was a bit old not just vintage style it needs a renovation Still it was fully functional clean and pleasant , It s close to Wien Mitte which is quite useful The building itself is very elegant and monumental The staff was very helpful and kind The prices were reasonable 
366288,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Phone system did not work No list of Tv channels in the room , The staff were extra helpful We used to live in this neighborhood 1999 2001 and always used this hotel for our guests Now that we visit we stay there ourselves 
366289,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Contrary to what the photo s suggest the hotel lacks character The bathroom especially the bath needed a thorough cleaning and the shower was broken The service and staff are not up to standard for a four star hotel Housekeeping entered the room rather early in the morning on both days while we were still getting ready The parking garage costs 19 euro s per day breakfast is 16 euro s per person per day and you have to give them all your personal information for the free wifi , The location of the hotel is good within walking distance of the center 10 15 minutes The room was spacious and the bed was good 
366290,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, No complain , The location is easily acceptable to metro airport tram and city center Supermarket and shops are near from the hotel The hotel is clean and bed is comfortable to stay

366292,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Maybe a little difficult to find since the reception is someway from the street , Tea and coffee in the room A very nice hotel I would certainly go there again 
366293,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien,No Negative, I was upgraded to a suite on arrival The room was lovely and spacious just what I needed after a long haul flight The staff were courteous and helpful I wish my stay had been longer I would definitely stay here again 
366294,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, The design of the room was a bit creepy I didn t like how there were 2 mirrors in the room and full of paintings I feel like it was trying to give out a cosy atmosphere but it ended up doing the exact opposite , The staff was always smiling and very friendly The hotel location is perfect 2 minutes away from the Landstrasse station which is 2 stops from Stephensplaz which is a major tourist attraction With a Vienna Ticket you can easily travel to and from the hotel for free 
366295,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien,No Negative, Staff very informative helpful Restaurants the one in the hotel and the one across the walkway both very good and not overly expensive Breakfast buffet extensive 
366296,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, The shoe polisher on our fourth floor did not work , The peace and quiet of the room and its location ALSO PLEASE NOTE I did to have my ACCOR card on me card number 3081032 13789540 4 Checked in 07 May checked out 12 May 2016 5 nights Please update my card records correspondingly Thank you
366297,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, There was mold in the shower , It is a super nice hotel in a very nice area of town I particularly recommend this hotel to international tourists because the building is very nicely decorated on the insight and the alleyway where it is located is amazing I liked to see the people sitting outside in the restaurant it was a very nice view Bed was really comfortable I loved to hear the pigeons in the morning 
366298,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Besides a leaky shower not much to complain about , Nice and quiet simple but comfortable room Helpful reception Inner city sights are walking distance away 
366299,Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier Wien, Could be a little hard to find when you just land but that s not a big problem , It s clean and comfy it s not too far from the center everywhere is walking distance away
