448418,Hotel K nig von Ungarn,No Negative, Bed was very comfortable and the room was clean Bathroom was clean too Location was great and staff was helpful Loved the hot breakfast Overall great value for money and would recommend this place very highly 
448419,Hotel K nig von Ungarn, The lift was a bit slow in appearing I wouldn t have liked to be dependent on it if I was in a hurry , I can only comment from my experience I had a single room with small dressing room wardrobe ensuite facilities If you want to experience a little bit of old Austria then this is the place The facilities were very modern suberb shower safe fridge etc but the decor which was clean and fresh reflected an older period Right in the middle of Vienna next door to the central cathedral yet on a quiet street with one way through traffic Breakfast is cooked and served to order with a buffet for the usual fruit bread etc etc 
448420,Hotel K nig von Ungarn, No complaints , Everthing A block away from Stephensplatz within walking distance of a number of great restaurants as well as the Stehphensplatz U Bahn stop Room staff ambience breakfast you name it the hotel nailed it 
448421,Hotel K nig von Ungarn,No Negative, Fantastic location right in the center Ambiance of the butic hotel with proper character of old premises with modern ammenities Friendly personnel very helpful with getting tickets taxis late check out etc Good food 
448422,Hotel K nig von Ungarn, We had an evening meal at the hotel which was very pleasant but there was only one other couple which meant there was little atmosphere , We had a lovely spacious room with sofa and chairs and a large bathroom with double sinks The location couldn t have been better as it provided easy access to the whole of the city centre and its palaces churches and museums 
448423,Hotel K nig von Ungarn, Can t think of anything we didn t like but I suppose our room could have done with a teeny bit of updating , Our friends collected us from Vienna Airport and we arrived late afternoon The hotel staff were really friendly and helpful We liked the fact that this hotel goes back to the 1740s and had a real warm and cosy feel The room was lovely and big with bathroom and separate toilet We requested a room overlooking the lovely courtyard and small bar which is quieter than street side but that wasn t too busy either The hotel is less than a minute s walk to St Stephens Cathedral and all the bars and restaurants so it s perfect for exploring the City Centre Also the underground is about a two minute walk which is great for going to the various attractions We didn t need help with tours or information as our friends are Viennese so they showed us around However there was a lot of information in the foyer at the hotel The staff are very helpful and will tell you everything you need to know and would probably help you to organise your day My friend asked how much we paid for our accommodation and she said that it was really good value being right in the 1st district of the city We had a lovely time in Vienna and at this hotel and were sad to leave 
448424,Hotel K nig von Ungarn,No Negative, Great location room large and comfortable The bathroom was modern and spacious The breakfast was good The chocolate left in the room at night was a really nice touch The staff member helped us find a great concert to go to and changed our dinner reservations to another restaurant so that we could get to the show 
448425,Hotel K nig von Ungarn, Taking a seat in the lobby bar area and expecting a waiter to immediately come and take your order is expecting a bit much It sometimes took a bit of searching to find someone to serve you there A bit more proactive approach to bar tendering might be helpful , Right in the middle of Vienna s centre just behind Stephan Cathedral Everything you want to see in walking distance many nice restaurants in the area Hotel is not ultra modern but in a nice traditional Viennese style as you might expect Though most people will want to explore restaurants around town the restaurant in the hotel is really good many traditional dishes well prepared staff very kind and helpful 
448426,Hotel K nig von Ungarn, It was an extremely firm bed Window view on to narrow street was of offices opposite , Extremely convenient location most tourist sites were walkable distances No real traffic or other noise very quiet Excellent breakfasts One meal in restaurant was OK but not special All staff extremely friendly and helpful Oldest hotel in Vienna and hence in keeping d cor Mozart lived there at one time Air conditioned No hesitation in recommending 
448427,Hotel K nig von Ungarn,No Negative, Excellent hotel The staff and amenities were excellent including the spacious stately rooms the courtyard for relaxation and cocktails and the restaurant The staff was extremely helpful in recommending restaurants arranging excursions with private guides and purchasing Opera tickets for us We enjoyed our stay at the hotel The Rowlees
448428,Hotel K nig von Ungarn, There was absolutely nothing about this hotel that I could fault , This small hotel has a lot of character due to being in an old building with lots of nice features Just off Stephansplatz it is central easy access to Vienna s excellent underground and tram system but separate from all the noise of the main square They have a modern section which has been tastefully done We stayed in one of the modern rooms very spacious it had a nice large bathroom Breakfast was good try an omelette they are wonderful The coffee was also good We ate in the restaurant also the breakfast room one night and the food was good Every single member of staff at all levels was friendly and helpful We fell victim to pickpockets on the Underground beware young slim women in pairs asking directions and the front desk staff helped us with directions to the nearest Police Station and in contacting the Lost and Found dept of the Underground who speak only German which we do not On a more cheerful note they have wonderful recommendations for local restaurants all within a 5 minute walk from the hotel tucked away in side streets We went to several and all were either good or superb I would not hesitate to return to this lovely hotel 
448429,Hotel K nig von Ungarn, The bar could be improved There was no real atmosphere to incent patrons to enjoy a beverage after a long day of sightseeing , The hotel is located in a great area not in the middle of the busy St Stephen s Cathedral traffic noise but a very short walk there Easy walk to train station shopping and plenty of restaurants Staff was very friendly and helpful The bathrooms have been renovated and are beautiful They re spacious and well appointed with rainfall shower separate tub as well as a second private toilet room The restaurant was very good for breakfast with an assortment of foods to please pretty much every type of appetite We did not have dinner there Overall hotel was great We would definitely stay there again

448462,Hotel K nig von Ungarn, As an old hotel it is beginning to look a little jaded and the restaurant while reasonable is outshone by many much better close by Our room overlooked the street which could have been a problem if we had wanted to sleep with the air conditioning off Vital to insist on a non street room , The hotel is located perfectly for walking to most of the points of interest in the city centre It is welcoming and reasonably comfortable

448511,Hotel K nig von Ungarn, I have nothing bad to say about this hotel whatsoever though I would have preferred one or two more child friendly items on the menu , The hotel has incredible charm and character The service is excellent and the location couldn t be better being a 30 second walk from Stephansplatz in the heart of the old city The room was stunning and the beds were extremely comfortable 
448512,Hotel K nig von Ungarn, Beware of making reservations in this hotel via internet bookingcom as there is a risk you will not get the room you reserved as it happened with me and my family The explanation of the front desk attendant was that the hotel provides the best rooms in category to their regular guests who books rooms directly by phone or e mail all others who use internet will get the worst rooms In spite of a fact that we stayed in the hotel twice before at the beginning we were proposed a room in the other part of the hotel which definitely needs renovation and looks very poor for the money hotel was going to charge us after our refusal to stay in it the front desk man suggested we leave the hotel and go somewhere else to look for accommodation Finally he proposed a room in the main building but it was smaller than the one we booked though the cost was the same Moreover the attitude and overall behavior of the front desk attendant was very rude and unacceptable for a hotel which is 4 stars rated , Location 
448513,Hotel K nig von Ungarn, The only negative was that the beds were very uncomfortable no cushioning uneven and the springs could be felt surprisingly even our kids complained about the quality of the beds Perhaps the hotel can invest in mattress toppers to make the beds better for sleeping which would then make the hotel ideal , Perfect location nice staff spacious family rooms good value for the money and nice restaurants nearby The only con was the poor quality of the beds which affected our sleep 
448514,Hotel K nig von Ungarn, Would have been good to been to make tea or coffee in the room but no big deal Excellent breakfast included , Very good service from all aspects of the hotel staff team excellent location and lovely historic building

448519,Hotel K nig von Ungarn, Not applicable question for such a hotel , It s a fantastic hotel with a fantastic staff like a beautiful extension of Vienna or may be even Vienna is an extension of K nig von Ungarn And everything is extremely balanced people rooms atmosphere breakfast nothing to change just to keep it going as it is
