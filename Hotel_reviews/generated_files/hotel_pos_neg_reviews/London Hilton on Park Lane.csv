109798,London Hilton on Park Lane, Really didn t like experience at all Extremely overpriced, I arrived at reception and there wasn t anyone to greet me for at least 10 mins they offered to upgrade our room but it s didn t seem to be anything spectular We ordered room service the food wasn t really anything too exciting at all The chips were cold I didn t enjoy burger at all We ordered breakfast next day and I ate mine barely but my partner refused after looking at mine Very well travelled and first time at Hilton Safe to say it might be my last
109799,London Hilton on Park Lane, The room was old in previous stay room was better I suspect that the upper floors have been refurbished while the lower ones weren t , Ideal location walking distance to almost any tourist destination 
109800,London Hilton on Park Lane, The only negative was the first room I received was right up against the building so the view was blocked but the next night they gave me a wonderful upgrade and I would definitely stay there again , I loved the way they took care of me when I had a problem and went above and beyond to fix the issue and make sure I was happy thanks to the staff and management 
109801,London Hilton on Park Lane, Disappointed with the service the cleanliness and the facility Not a Hilton Property They made me pay 4 for requesting empty plate at the room Bed skirt was dirty and bed sheets and house keeping were not properly done I paid someone 10 to get me an additional baggage deck who never showed up I had to pay for drinking water as there is no complementary bottles Not Hilton Standard In the bathroom shower cap was never replaced In regards to the facility bathroom is way too small , I liked the location
109802,London Hilton on Park Lane,No Negative, The room was not like how it was described I had to change the room and the bathrooms in both rooms were reall bad I was promised that a manger would come and see me Stayed there 4 days and no one bothered to show Ordred 2 bananas and they charged be GBP 7 3 c mon is that fair Again will never go there and also do not intend on using booking Com as the way room was described it was not like that 
109803,London Hilton on Park Lane, The room which was prepaid had to be ready and clean for me at 12 00 I checked in at 16 30 still they were cleaning it Returned at 18 30 still were looking for my room as it was not ready At last they gave me a room with a great view but totally dirty Awful floors dirty toilettes and asked for an adaptor and requested a credit card The towels in the bathroom should have been cleaned and replaced whereas the toiletries were the lowest quality No Crabtree Evelyn The entrance of the hotel was so dirty you could hardly see it Room service awful the concierge was not even responding in the phone Asked for sbody to come pick up my luggage at the check out and even after 20 no one showed up I used to stay in this hotel in the past no comparison to how it was A true disappointment , 
109804,London Hilton on Park Lane, Some simple errors made st check in and on checkout Attention to detail would have helped but they did work hard to resolve the small issues , Good and good value for this part of town The room was again good and clean 
109805,London Hilton on Park Lane,No Negative, Perfect location for shopping etc good size rooms with tea coffee iron board facilities in room Very nice toiletries and a fabulous gym 
109806,London Hilton on Park Lane, Though I had made booking 6 weeks ago and requested Hyde Park or Knightsbridge view but it was not given And staff at counter were not convincing as to why requested room was not given ,No Positive
109807,London Hilton on Park Lane, The cleanliness of the toilets needs attention , The staff was very good and coperative specially while checking in The lady Ms Ishita did everything to make us feel good 
109808,London Hilton on Park Lane, Used the tour group that hotel recommended and our tour was unorganized and felt throw together but the sights we saw were good , Location Location Location Walked to hotel from train station Breakfast was very impressive and great service 
109809,London Hilton on Park Lane, It was my birthday treat and my husband had asked for some champagne to be in the room on arrival as a surprise This didn t happen and they blamed the fact that we booked via booking com as the request made at time of booking doesn t get passed to the hotel The member of staff was very matter of fact about this with no apology at all We paid extra for a room with views of London this we did get however the windows were filthy , The bar on the top floor is really good with excellent cocktails and the staff are very friendly and efficient 
109810,London Hilton on Park Lane, They couldn t find my booking Room was okay missing blinds made it very light in the morning Breakfast choice was limited in the exec lounge , Location and the comfort of the bed was good 
109811,London Hilton on Park Lane, I did not like the lobby the corridors smell bad the rooms are okay but not that amazing for a 5 star hotel, The location is nice but the hotel stinks and needs renovation
109812,London Hilton on Park Lane, No negatives at all , Everything in this hotel was first class Could not fault the room or staff Unfortunately had to cut break short due to illness Cannot wait to re book for a later date Any person who find faults must be extremely hard to please 
109813,London Hilton on Park Lane,No Negative, The room sizes for the prize not large enough The lounge on the 1st floor and services therein should be better Closes early Boring
109814,London Hilton on Park Lane, We needed to print some tickets off and had to buy internet time to do so At 355 for a one night stay I would expect this to be free , The staff were great when we wanted to change rooms there was no argument 
109815,London Hilton on Park Lane, Nothing in mind but maybe they take a bet long time to clean the room , I liked the stander and the quality of the room and the location of the hotel was just perfect The breakfast was nice too i would stay there every time i go to London for sure 
109816,London Hilton on Park Lane, The room we original had was poor The curtains did not cover the window and the blind did not keep the light out The room needed updating and looked shabby in places I had to wait four hours after three phone calls to housekeeping to get a rollaway bed delivered to the room for my son , The breakfast is fantastic the view is great from upper level floors Location is amazing 
109817,London Hilton on Park Lane, Always had to queue for breakfast however staff were always friendly and smiling when obviously under pressure , First impressions very good warm and friendly welcome by receptionist All staff courteous and a credit to the hotel 
109818,London Hilton on Park Lane, The lobby is not great few sofas in front of the lefts The hotel rates are exaggerated The hotel recently refurbished but still furniture is outdated The sign in front of the lefts asking people to be quite was not appropriate some might see it even as disrespectful , Location of the hotel is great and it has amazing views of Hyde Park might be the best feature of the hotel make sure to ask for Park view Also the city views are good and you can see London Eye The Shard and many other landmarks Very close to many attractions in London and perfectly situated for shopping as its near Oxford street Knightbridge and Harrods Some of London best restaurants are within walking destance from the hotel Concierge services are excellent 
109819,London Hilton on Park Lane, My only Small issue wit the Hilton on PL is that it does not have a coffee lounge There is a small one in the executive lounge for about 12 people The Intercontinental has a great area on the ground floor where you can have short meetings and be served tea coffee etc so i go there for my meetings , I stay at this hotel every month and its like having a London home The staff are the best bit Juao on the Door Richard Tiago Boris in Windows all a credit to the Hilton 
109820,London Hilton on Park Lane,No Negative, So many hard working folks to name a few include Tabitha Monica Bob and Jesus All area valuable assets to your company and should be recognized for their hard work and customer service Thank you for a job well done You are appreciated Suite 2418 was the best 
109821,London Hilton on Park Lane, Staff are not smiling They do not greet guests at all The night manager Sandhya Chaganlal was very impolite and felt like she was actually doing a favor attending me at the time of check in There were no porters at midnight to assist you with baggage , Theh hotel location was good
109822,London Hilton on Park Lane, It was very pricey for example breakfast set us back 60 but it was a special occasion so won t complain too much , Loved the view the bed the lounge the gowns the lights and the window seat And absolutely loved that we were upgraded it was our wedding night so it was lovely to have the surprise thank you Can t afford to stay here again for a very long time but we would be back 
109823,London Hilton on Park Lane, My room number was 612 Very bad room it was smelling very bad despite of the parfummes sprayed Position of the TV were uncomfortable No any Turkish TV channels available Wireless connection is too poor you should refresh your settings every 10 minutes , Location
109824,London Hilton on Park Lane, Towel had large hole bathtub had hair bathtub was dangerously slippery with the bathmat charged for slow WiFi while other 5 star hotels do not the WiFi was so slow that I could not complete my airline changes online and had to make international calls comforter was very thin tv had sound but no picture got better deal for a taxis with fixed rate going to the airport by our other hotel s staff concierge that went out of their way for us London s city view unattractive Basically this is a tourist hotel and for the average class The upkeep of the hotel shades a motel 6 , Friendly staff upgraded apparently but I don t think so really quick to respond to most complaints listed here hotel looks new taxis stand was out front location is good high rise provides views of the city or park

109927,London Hilton on Park Lane, honestly it dosnt worth to say it is 5 star hotel as i travel a lot and always stay in 5 star hotels and comparing to others this property absolutely dosnt worth 4 stars the housekeeping cleaners start from early morning closing doors and opening doors aggressively that make noise at the corridor without caring that some people are still sleeping secondly they knock the door once or twice and they enter the room without permission in addition 3 nights i am calling the room service late night and they never pickup and i end with the reception answering me and i ordered through them moreover at the day of check out at 9 30 am we have received a call from the reception saying that your check out today yes i know that my check out is today but why do they call me early morning so i woke up thirsty and tried to open the fridge and it was locked because i am checking out today but still it is 9 30 am we have till noon i called the housekeeping to get me some water because they didn t put the night before bottles when they cleaned the room and the housekeeping answered me with full confident we don t have water we distribute after 6 00 pm is this a service we get in a 5 star hotel finally at 11 00am the girl from reception called me to say that you are checking out today and i am trying to withdraw from the card but it dosnt authorize i dont know who authorized her to take from my card and the bill was full of mistakes when i went down and reviewed my bill this is absolutely not normal for a 5 star hotel and i dont understand why is the price for rooms are so high and the service is too bad it is not insulting to your staff but really this property should train their staff up to the standards of 5 star hotels staff should serve the guests , i have upgraded to a room that has balcony and the room was fair in size
109928,London Hilton on Park Lane, its not possible to sleep tight in this hotel doors are slapping loud when cleaning service is going through the rooms they let the doors close on its own and you hear it in your bed everytime worst sleep i ever had in a hotel , location was good close to mayfair and in the of the center

109955,London Hilton on Park Lane, This what I really didn t like that at first they gave us a very small room then I had to change it Secondly there was a noise coming from I don t know where but I think from outside non stop noise like zzzzzzzzzzzz I really don t know how to explain it but it was too annoying and whenever we open the window we had to close it and open the AC instead Thirdly I have a membership in Hilton and am eligible to get water every day but honestly I had to call them every day to ask for the water Actually am comparing everything with the hotels in my country we have real 5 stars hotels like when u pay the same amount we paid in Hilton we get s bigger room new furniture cleaner and much better services And I hope things could change in London s hotels as they are 5 stars and the level of everything must be really 5 stars, I was with my mom this time and when we reached the hotel after a long flight I asked them to see the room before paying the full amount to ensure that we will get a good room but they refused they said that we have to pay fully When we went to the room the room seemed to be very small and narrow and I my aim in this vacation is to let my mom feels comfortable and enjoying everything and the room was really too small so I had to go down again and I asked them to show me a better room as before I booked a room with the same category but it was much bigger than this So they showed me another room with the same category but it was better than that room The thing is that in this room the cabinets was near the toilets and not like the previous room when the cabinets were near the bed and there was no space for us to move So from the beginning they had to give us a good room as they saw me with my mom and at least they had to think about doing their best to let her feel comfortable in the room
109956,London Hilton on Park Lane, I feel the rooms are a little bit over priced for what they are I also found that the pay to view movies were very over priced , Really nice hotel great place to stay great views of Hyde Park Green Park and London Staff really friendly and went the extra mile and the service at the restaurant on the 28th floor was fantastic 
109957,London Hilton on Park Lane, Very poorly managed hotel Carpet was dirty in the lobby with stains very visible at all places My toilet seat was broken and flush didnt work properly Shower didnt have much pressure in it The bed was wobbly and even my 1yr old son can push it to move With this big 5star hotel you would at least expect a free Wifi but NO Podium restaurant was awful Flies around our food all the time Uncomfortable chair to sit on while eating food The staff is untrained and the waitress kept spilling water over the table whenever she served water , Just the view and to be honest NOTHING ELSE Absolutely NOTHING ELSE 
109958,London Hilton on Park Lane, Dirty aspects to room Not vacuumed under chair when moved Stains on net curtains Coffee stains down fridge Unclean windows Mattress was awfull Shower head in need of replacement Not being in your real restaurant for breakfast Bed sheets for tablecloths, The bar on the 28 th floor Breakfast choice for veggie vegan not to bad The lifts Lobby area
109959,London Hilton on Park Lane, Checked in told would have breakfast in executive lounge when we went the card didn t work no one answered the bell Then when we had to wait at reception to sort the cards once we finally got in no one to seat us no seats and no full breakfast We then just checked out RUBBISH service Also said parking would let us out I had to beep loads to get someone to let us out even though I was told someone would be there waiting for us don t get me started on the dreadful rude concierge we hadn t planned to stay and so didn t have a phone charger Having kids we wanted to make sure at least one phone had some charge until the morning They said they would call back then nothing waited up for their call nothing when they finally picked up a rude man answered and told me they didn t have any and he was about to call me back he then said he would check again why check again if you already claim you have Then just stayed there breathing down the phone and was really rude when I asked why he bothered doing that for effect DREADFUL service they only get money for the location I wouldn t pay ever again for Hilton so much for diamond membership AVOID plenty of other nicer hotels for the money , Nice clean room that s about it 
109960,London Hilton on Park Lane, I find it ridiculous that a 5 star hotel doesn t even offer complimentary internet There is so much competition out there that little things count Although we are only talking about 12 per day the irritation and feeling of being ripped off is enough that I will not stay there again I travel to London at least once a month and always stay in that area , Location 
109961,London Hilton on Park Lane, Dryness in dealing and inflexibility and providing hospitality in the fullest They were interested in obtaining the money without providing the required service,No Positive
109962,London Hilton on Park Lane, Bathroom was very small and never had fool stock of the bathroom products every day something different was missing No second sleepers were placed and no additional water The breakfast time was always too noisy too many kids as for business hotel, The view of my room was amazing
109963,London Hilton on Park Lane, The negative point was the service during the breakfast , It was an exciting experience to stay at Hilton Park Lane Staff was very friendly since the check in with Mr Sergio I pay for a upgrade and the room was large with an amazing city view It worth to walk around mainly at Hyde Park which is front of the Hotel Close to a tube station so you can reach almost the entire city and it attractions Near to Oxford street and Picadilly as well as Mayfair with nice restaurants and stores I would repeat the experience At rooftop the is a two star Michelin restaurant Thanks a lot to all staff 
109964,London Hilton on Park Lane,No Negative, The view from the room was fantastic The breakfast was nice and the executive lounge was quiet allowing me to get on with some work As one would expect from a hotel of this class the the service was attentive and professional throughout I would stay at this hotel again 
109965,London Hilton on Park Lane, I have not seen a Hilton with older carpeting and bathroom appliences Yes everything is working but I didn t even want to shower in that bathroom I will not trust that this brandname will provide a standard to my accomodation anymore They charge your card rightaway with an additional daily extra 50 day which I think is rude and to prevent people from checking out the next morning ,No Positive

109976,London Hilton on Park Lane, The bathroom was not as clean as it could have been considering the reputation of the hotel On entering the hotel the staff were not as personable as other Hilton hotels They pointed where the lift was with no offer of help with bags etc Very quick and eager to get me gone from the desk For a 5 Hilton in Mayfair I was surprised , The rooms were reasonable polite room service staff quick service with food excellent bar with friendly bar staff beautiful building

109979,London Hilton on Park Lane, The First room on the 8th floor had broken window there was a massive gradient of temperature between the window and the AC fan in the ceiling They called an engineer at 2am who said the building is 60years old I could also hear the traffic from outside I was moved to another room on the 10th floor The king size bed was actually assembled from two single beds The balcony at the bar on the top floor was not accessible for some weird H S policy When I complained the stuff was so generous to take 5 off from the minibar I would not recommend this hotel It s overrated , Location
109980,London Hilton on Park Lane, I didn t find reception concierge particularly friendly or polite the hotel seems quite outdated and the interiors were worn off pictures there were cigarette joints by the window the tea spoons weren t properly washed the pictures are for the upgraded executive room , the breakfast was very good room was clean and comfortable room service was quite good and fast

109983,London Hilton on Park Lane, The room we were checked into was small and cramped The view was overlooking horrible dirty buildings When I spoke to reception they were not very helpful and took a while to find us another room which was on the smoking floor and we do not smoke This has been the first time I booked through booking com so not sure if I will book again as obviously they are not I offered good rooms , Usually rooms are quite spacious but not on this occasion

109988,London Hilton on Park Lane, The rooms are clean but dated the bed was about as comfortable as sleeping on the floor the only light in the room was by way of a small window in the corner and a couple of floor lamps Couldn t have been further from the bright rooms featuring lots of light I thought I had booked , Location was great and the staff were polite
109989,London Hilton on Park Lane, I booked for a deluxe double Queen room but we a were initially located in a probably single room which was very small As I am staying to this hotel for the last 12 years I know very well how the room I booked should look like I asked for an immediate change which they did but because it was not ready we had to wait for 1and a half hour Then we waited for our luggage and have taken too long so I asked what happened and I realized that the did not know where they were located At the end and I was really feeling awkward how this could happen in a five star hotel they were found The manager on dutie asked me how they could compensate I did not ask for anything and he offered us a drink which we did not get it not because of them but because we did not find the time , Excellent location amazing view divine breakfast
109990,London Hilton on Park Lane, Too much money for not a lot car park is alful Very nanrow small spaces to park your car Very nanrow driving down to car park as you have a cerb each side of you as we felt the wheels of our new 66 plate get scapped 3 times A lady that was leaving car park did the same but worse to her car she couldn t get out of her space and in the end I had to help her move her car As she was moving off she hit the side and wheel of her 16plate merc Not a happy time as you can imagine Don t think I would stay there again due to this, Free wifi

109993,London Hilton on Park Lane, The worst Manager ever seen his name is Benny V he wasn t very helpful and cooperative as he should do in his position it made me feeling like there is a kind of racism by how he is acting when I complained to my friends they said don t go to him better I like the Hilton hotels specially Park lane one but with this guy am not happy to stay there , Everything from facility point of view

109996,London Hilton on Park Lane, With just 4 lifts it was chaos when a large group checked in It took 10 minutes to get into the lift from the lobby From the floors the waiting time was longer and the only option was to ride the elevator all the way up and then come down With a computer deciding which lift will stop on your floor your patience gets tested , Location Rooms with great views
