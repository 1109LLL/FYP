259893,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, The hotel is in a bustling neighborhood with many shops and restaurants Although this is one of the quietest streets you will occasionally hear happy and loud tourists yelling on the street , Completely charming romantic hotel with history Comfortable lobby stone walls wood beams excellent continental breakfast very friendly and helpful staff I suggest going at least one level up in room from the standard Worth the extra money My room had an ultra high ceiling with wooden beams so spacious feeling for the size I have also stayed in the larger executive rooms and they are amazing My chamber had a beautiful tall window where I could peer out on the street with black out drapes if you need a nap AC that regulated the room well to a good temperature and beautiful decoration with a nice marble bathroom The hotel is situated in one of the liveliest neighborhoods in Paris directly off the RER B from CDG I highly recommend this hotel I have stayed multiple times and plan to return many more Try a walk along the Seine from Notre Dame to the Eiffel Tower In the past few years barges and beer garden style outdoor restaurants have multiplied along this route Greats runs are possible along the Seine If you wake in the middle of the night the nearby piano bar Aux Trois Maillettes is open until 5 am and the even closer cafe Le Depart St Michel a few tables have a Notre Dame view is open 24 hours The hop on hop off Seine tour boat Batobus has a stop nearby you are feet from the metro and RER right next to Notre Dame the Louvre and Luxembourg Gardens and between the Latin Quarter and St Germaine Location location location

259916,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, Having to leave after 2 nights we ll be back , No need to say anymore on the location We were in room 56 on the top floor which is very quiet and very cosy Very good new bed 180 cm which is often not the case in French hotels Cute room with a small mezzanine nice antique furniture The decoration of this room is plain no colorful wallpapers which is the way we prefer it Although the renaissance wallpapers fit the 15th century house very well 15 Breakfast is good value for money if you don t only want a coffee and one croissant Lots of fresh bread and pastry cereal and joghurt and a choice of eggs ham and cheese Mr Henri will be happy to help with any advice action or restaurant reservation you need If you just need a glass of wine and a little tapas try La grande cremerie a couple of streets away run be a French Californian The night portier is very friendly and helpful too Offers you a free coffee and madeleine if you have to leave at 6 a m as we did

259918,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, The bed mattress didn t suit my partner Pierre And the photos of my preferred room were photos only in my mind I had waited 9 mths for that romantic room and it went to someone else , Henri was marvellous with many tips for great restaurants best ways to see Paris Everything was possible nothing was too much trouble He is a gem 
259919,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, Nothing except the tiny lift , The staff especially Henri were very helpful and friendly Breakfast was excellent and good value The decor was beautiful and our room very spacious 
259920,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, The bed could do with a topper The breakfast was delicious and very good value but the area breakfast was served in was too tiny to offer a reasonable atmosphere it would almost be better to put one table and lots of chairs around it encourage travellers to share , The staff were very helpful and friendly definately going the extra mile and seemed genuinely focused on making sure their patrons had the best possible time The hotel is stuffed with gentle aristocratic charm and very elegant in a very unpresumptious way Fantastic quiet location so close to the centre 
259921,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, Lack of drawers for clothes in the traditional room we booked the smallest room in the hotel , Henry the manager I s most helpful and very friendly Room and bathroom are comfy and clean Location is perfect for RER b and sightseeing on foot 
259922,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, We didn t try breakfast because at E15 per person we thought it was a bit expensive Lots of little cafes a short stroll away for a coffee and croissant , Lovely boutique hotel in the Latin Quarter about ten minutes walk from Notre Dam Very near the metro station so easy to get to it The staff were pleasant and helpful When we visit Paris again we would be very happy to book this hotel 
259923,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris,No Negative, This hotel is the quaint Paris experience we were looking for Henri is right out of central casting for a Parisian hotelier and was incredibly helpful It is located right in the middle of everything and has easy access to the metro Staying at this hotel made for the actual Paris experience we were hoping for when we made our plans A quaint hotel with modern conveniences 
259924,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, Watch out that the breakfast price does NOT include taxes which add a bit to the cost Also at check out was not able to pay by credit card in Euro so had to pay cash to avoid a very poor automatic exchange rate , great location very helpful staff good value for money 
259925,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, It would have been nice to have been able to get just a cup of tea in the afternoon or in our room Breakfast was a bit more than we needed or wanted to pay since one croissant an espresso was all we needed , Henri at the front desk was very friendly helpful The beds were comfy the rooms were perfectly cleaned each day Location was the best 
259926,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, Cannot find fault with this wonderful old hotel , We have stayed here before and will again The location is fantastic whether going to and from the Airport CdeG spending time watching activity in the left bank area or using the metro to get around Paris The staff are fantastic and very helpful Rooms are beautifully decorated and furnished in period style 
259927,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, Only thing was that it is a little bit noisy at night but that is Paris , Lovely old hotel in a superb location but the very best thing about staying here is how lovely all the staff are sometimes a rarity in Paris Lovely breakfast Spacious room with charming decor 
259928,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris,No Negative, All of the staff were amazing friendly and very helpful with securing museum passes helping us with train booking and general information The hotel was so conveniently located 1 2 block from the Seine right across from the Ile de la Cite on the left bank We could walk to everything If you didn t want to walk the metro stop was a half block away There were copies of the International NYTimes in the lobby every day The Vieux Paris is a small more personal hotel which is what we like I would definitely recommend it to anyone staying in Paris and wouldn t hesitate to stay there again myself 
259929,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, If the elevator had been larger it would have been appreciated However given the age of the building even a small elevator may be a miracle , We found that the staff was superior in the help that they provided They were friendly courteous knowledgeable and willing to spend extra time making sure that our needs were met The location of the hotel is superb 
259930,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, Only downside was some banging noises in the morning and construction outside but we still had long sleeps in the morning despite the mild inconvenience Rooms are small but that is Paris Sliding door into bathroom didn t allow full privacy but ok for a couple , Had a fab stay excellent location and staff were so friendly and laid back especially Henri may have got the wrong name he was such a friendly man Had a great stay We didn t have breakfast but it sounded fab and good value I will be back PS great little restaurant beside the hotel called Le Lutin sans Le garden It was amazing and recommended by the hotel

259933,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, Everything was excellent, This is a great little hotel We stayed there May 18 25 this year and will stay there again the next time we are in Paris Staff is very helpful and speaks English They have tickets to the major museums at a small premium which eliminates need to stand in at least one line Our room was small but comfortable and the bathroom was modern and hotel and location are quiet But best aspect is fabulous location only one block from the Place St Michel in the heart of the left bank Easy walking distance to most of the major sights and very close to Metro 
259934,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, Sadly breakfast looked awfully poor so I went out to get some The proximity of the Canadian Pub and the Irish Pub on each side of the little street means that on weekends it can get rowdy , Super outstanding location Room decently sized for Paris housekeeping very good staff quite lovely 
259935,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, Nothing in particular , Location One cannot wish more 5 min walk to Norte Dame about 10 to Louvre Interiors are very interesting on my opinion our room had a wonderful combination of wall textile and dark wood Comfy room friendly staff everything was very nice 
259936,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, A little expensive unfortunate building works close by , Great location bed very comfortable staff very friendly and helpful Would be happy to re visit on another occasion 
259937,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, I liked everything , Lovely bedroom gorgeous wallpaper so very French Also very friendly staff and owners super handy location between St Germain and the le 
259938,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris,No Negative, Incredible location close to every landmark and bars and restaurants on your doorstep The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful A beautiful boutique hotel 
259939,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, If anything the fact that the door to the bathroom didn t shut properly so it was a bit intimate But no worries we have been married for 49 years , Yes the croissants were extra flaky and the breakfast was excellent The bed was wonderful 
259940,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, Only thing was the tiny elevator but we managed , Friendly helpful staff thank you Henri Very central location especially with first time visitors to Paris Darling newly refreshed rooms Interesting historical building 
259941,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, Disadvantages Very small rooms Breakfast selection is very poor only drinks and some pastry, Advantages Location within walking distance from Notre Dame De Paris and Louvre Numerous restaurants around Close to subway Friendly staff providing helpful advice to tourists
259942,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, The bathroom door did not complete shut The hair dryer is ancient a Hoover on the wall job with very little blow , Location was fantastic Room was very quiet and tastefully decorated 
259943,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris,No Negative, The location was excellent extremely close to the Seine the Metro RER and Notre Dame The staff were courteous helpful with recommendations including a vegetarian restaurant that was a few minutes walk away and spoke English which was my biggest worry The rate was affordable and the room suited our needs rarely in the room anyway 
259944,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, The other front desk staff member was not particularly friendly , Room was great and the breakfast was great One of the front desk staff was extremely helpful and friendly 
259945,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, There is no breakfast buffet and breakfast is rather simple consisting of coffee tea or chocolate fruit salad joghurt 1 glass of orange juice half a baguette 1 croissant and 1 chocolate croissant cereals 3 different types of packed cheeses and various jams If you ask you can have a boiled egg Ham or sausages are not served What surprised me a bit was the attitude of the receptionist When I checked out I wanted to buy a metro ticket which normally costs 10 Euros and he wanted to have 11 for it When I told him that the price is 10 he replied Well 10 or 11 Euros what is the big deal for you After I told him that I will buy the ticket at the station he sold it to me for 10 Euros nonetheless This left a sour smack that the staff tries to screw up guests on an otherwise positive impression of the hotel , The rooms are very nice provided that one likes sort of antique rooms The rooms are nicely decorated clean and have a nice flair The room rate was 199 which is high for what is offered but it seems normal hotels of this category in St Germain Breakfast is served from 8 12 o clock The breakfast room is rather small but nice The hotel is located next to St Michel Metro station which offers a very good and cheap connection to the airport Charles deGaulle 
259946,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris,No Negative, This small hotel is full of character Ask for the book about it s history Rooms are small but have everything you need the shower even had Jacuzzi jets The hotel is just south of the river from Notre Dame It is convenient to the metro However much of Paris is within walking distance The nearby street St Andre des Artes has almost every choice of eating places you can imagine The manager and his staff did everything they could to ensure we enjoyed our stay 
259947,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, The people working at the reception are by far the slowest clerks I have come across Nothing was digitalized and they made mistakes constantly We left for meetings twice and came late because of reception taking too long with customers One couple had to check out before us which we had to wait for 20 minutes for and our check out took 20 25 minutes It felt like Fawlty Towers and for this reason I cannot recommend the hotel if you don t like waiting for what seems to be no reason, Great location and very nice rooms 
259948,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, The lift is very small but we didn t mind You can only fit two people inside and is a squeeze if you have lots of luggage , The staff were very friendly and always willing to help us advising us of places to visit and assisting with travel arrangements The local area is lovely with lots of cafes restaurants and shops The river Notre dame and a tube station a few minutes walk away We visited all the main attractions using the metro we never travelled for more than 20 minutes so this is an ideal location The room was small but fine for the two of us and had always been cleaned when we got back in the evening 
259949,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris,No Negative, Excellent location Close to St Michel and handily placed to explore Paris by foot or metro but quiet Our 2nd visit to this boutique hotel Helpful staff and a very good breakfast 
259950,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, The room itself was a bit cramped The chairs were scary to sit on We felt that these items might unexpectedly collapse at any moment , Staff desk and chamber tried to help in every way they could It was clean Breakfast was fine 
259951,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris,No Negative, Location is very central to major Paris sights Staff are welcoming friendly and helpful Room was compact but comfortable had everything necessary for a few days in Paris A great base from which to enjoy Paris 
259952,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, The room we were allocated was quite inadequate We had asked in advance for the same room as we had stayed in previously but despite the hotel being very quiet were told it was not available The room we were given was small at the back of the hotel with a shower toilet room only separated from the bedroom by a flimsy sliding door We do not believe that can be acceptable in a not inexpensive 4 Star Hotel During our stay work commenced stripping the wooden floors throughout the ground floor including the breakfast room using a noisy smelly industrial size machine so that work continued around us without any explanation or apology We were very disappointed We will not stay at this hotel again , The Location at St Michel on the Left Bank is very good for reaching most parts of Paris The hotel is in a very old property with considerable character We ve stayed there before and enjoyed it
259953,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris,No Negative, the room with its authentic beams made one feel part of old Paris Friendly staff Chopard toiletries excellent location near St Michel RER Metro Buses 
259954,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, The pub was too close so too easy to drink too much haha, The Staff were delightful and spoke slow french so I could understand They were overly helpful and even upgraded us The location is perfect the seine to one side and the small cobble locked streets of st michel to the other The decor was beautiful relaxed like an old wooden cottage in the middle of nowhere Incredible Home in the middle of Paris 
259955,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris,No Negative, Location was excellent Very proximate to the metro a short walk to Notre Dame and the river cruises Friendly staff Henri was friendly and very helpful with advice Lovely room 
259956,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, We did not purchase the breakfast package too expensive at 15 per person , The was a beautifil place to stay loved my room The staff very friendly and helpful with attractions to visit could even sell tickets to many placrs
259957,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, The room was clean had everything we needed The wallpaper was a bit extravagant for my taste and made me think of Oscar Wilde s famous last words but was charming in its own way The blowdryer in the bathroom is not very good so if you want to dry your hair fast bring your own , The location was excellent the staff especially Henri was very friendly helpful with restaurants tickets The hotel s history as the Beat writers hotel with photos of Allen Ginsberg William Burroughs in the reception gave the place an added charm for me 
259958,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, No unpleasant experience, A charming well located hotel Small rooms as is typical for hotels in Paris especially in the popular tourist areas Some reviews we read online had concerns over cleanliness Our room was clean and nicely Appointed Staff friendly and helpful
259959,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris,No Negative, Staff was very helpful and accommodating recommending restaurants and helping us with directions They also sell museum tickets at the front desk so you can avoid long ticket lines at the Louvre and Musee d Orsay and sneak right in 
259960,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, Rooms are small but we were 1 person per room so this wasn t a problem 2 would have been a squeeze in the rooms we were in , Quiet interior rooms staff made afternoon tea on request ordered taxis and recommended v good local restaurants that weren t touristy

259967,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris,No Negative, The Vieux Paris is a small charming hotel gem located within a few blocks of the St Michel metro the cafes and shops of the Blvd St Germain and just across the Seine from Notre Dame and the delights of the Ile de la Cite and the Ile St Louis Its side street location makes for a very quiet and peaceful night s sleep after which you ll enjoy a delicious breakfast of coffee freshly squeezed orange juice croissants baguettes yogurts and cheese Amiable and knowledgeable Henri will cheerfully greet you and help with any recommendations or reservations you require This was our 2nd stay at Vieux Paris and will not be our last

259969,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris,No Negative, fantastic location near Notre Dame yet tucked away in a quiet street Very characterful and cosy hotel But note the lift is tiny and the staircase is a tiny spiral staircase so not really suitable for disabled access particularly in case of fire Bathroom very well appointed but compact and again it would be difficult to climb into the shower if mobility restricted 
259970,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, Good stay However small things like one host at the hotel could be more flexible especially when the client asks for things that are reasonable i e checking total bill one day before departure and small things like this did not like attitude Clients do rule sir especially when they ask things nicely and politely Cleaning lady has to put everyday shower gel etc as these were missing or ad hoc U also need to get out of your room by noon everyday in order for yr room to be done as otherwise cleaning lady is not there afternoons Not a pbm if u know this beforehand very very small lift that does the job though but overweight people with luggage not sure But this goes with how old the building is part of the charm Attention is needed to repaint bottom doors and skirtings to keep the look being great aside from above good stay Love the look of certain rooms Breakfasts in the room were very nice You can ask what you wish Very romantic and the rest of the staff was helpful Would return , Excellent location and liked the look of my room with beams on the ceiling One of the reason I chose this hotel Top top rooms can be clostrophobic as window only opens from the roof down 
259971,Relais H tel du Vieux Paris, Absolutely nothing , The staff was really helpful despite our lack of speaking French This hotel was centrally located and within walking distance of everything we wanted to see though we did use the metro because of its convenience The B line goes straight to a stop close to the hotel from the airport and it was easy to use Make sure you get the right B train on the way back to the airport by using the overhead monitor I read where a client thought the room was too small For a city this size and from growing up in NY the room was a little larger than I expected I would highly recommend this hotel It was very cute and the room well appointed and close to Notre Dame and several cafes
