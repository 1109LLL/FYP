469740,NH Amsterdam Zuid,No Negative, It was a really nice stay at NH Amsterdam Zuid the staff are extremely helpful and friendly with special thanks to Roxanne who was very informative I just wished that the hotel had allowed early check in without a charge like most hotel especially since the room was already available Very convenient 10 mins walk to tram and metro which went into Central and within walking distance to a new Geraldplien shopping mall with lots of restaurants unfortunately we only discovered on our last day Also within walking distance to Amstel Park which was great for kids 
469741,NH Amsterdam Zuid, I ordered a pizza from room service expecting a home made pizza considering the price was 11 roughly and got a pizza clearly from a box and was burnt I ordered a goat cheese salad which was said to have pine nuts and grilled zucchini which didn t have either of them Was ripped off and over priced, The room was nice and was very modern 
469742,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Elevators are old I ended up walking as I was concerned it would stuck No welcome bottle of water that s really upsetting when checking in late, Breakfast is good staff is friendly internet is good
469743,NH Amsterdam Zuid,No Negative, We had breakfast and for some reason it was not written down onto our room When we later told this on the check out the lady told us that it is ok and that we don t need to pay 
469744,NH Amsterdam Zuid,No Negative, Very spacious comfortable room with ensuite We stayed 3 nights and found the hotel very quiet the beds were extremely comfortable which meant our stay felt very relaxed Fantastic range of food for breakfast definitely something for everyone and it all tasted great 
469745,NH Amsterdam Zuid, The room itself was a bit tired and not spotlessly clean some hairs on the chairs etc though the bedding and towels were absolutely clean , Room facilities were excellent and parking outside the hotel was free which was great It s also free at weekends in the surrounding area which is also useful 
469746,NH Amsterdam Zuid,No Negative, Hotel is easy to get to Tram 4 from central station and bus 62 from station RAI Rooms are finished to a high standard and beds are really comfy The buffet style breakfast is great value 
469747,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Small rooms that can take 3 people max We were traveling with 3 kids We had to jam in a suite and pay the difference , Great service Close by the airport and the city center Great breakfast 
469748,NH Amsterdam Zuid, No coffee machine in the room Also you have to pay for every extra hour even I only ask for staying until 1 pm , The room is clean and the breakfast is good with lots of choice 
469749,NH Amsterdam Zuid, We had expensive stay 130 night without breakfast The price quality ratio was not so good as the hotel is slightly outdated and no more special than average hotel , We slept and rested very well in the room it was dark and silent at night and the bed was just perfect Everything worked fine Breakfast was complete and delicious although it was not included in the room price Good connection by public transportation interesting surrounding 
469750,NH Amsterdam Zuid, 1 Breakfast while generous was expensive relative to what was available at restaurants within walking distance from the hotel 2 We were surprised at the amount of additional taxes added to our bill upon our departure This should have been indicated at the time of booking in order to make a fair comparison to other hotels as well as different types of accommodation , Staff were helpful with our questions and the rooms were comfortable and quiet We were also happy to be allowed early access to the rooms 
469751,NH Amsterdam Zuid,No Negative, Good hotel reasonably close to airport Staff were really pleasant made me feel very welcome and valued Excellent service and tasty food from their restaurant area 
469752,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Hotel is a bit outside of city centre though one can get to the tram after about a 10 minute walk , The room was clean comfortable and modern Breakfast was good and fresh Professional conference facilities as well as organisation 
469753,NH Amsterdam Zuid,No Negative, Hotel very modern and comfortable enjoyed the spacious rooms and king size bed did not realise how far out from city centre it was Would have booked another NH hotel in city centre if we had realised However public transport and being able to walk about easily made it easy to access the city centre 
469754,NH Amsterdam Zuid, 1 please fix toilet pan in room 305 even after cleaninig our room some unpleasant smell comes out of it 2 please notify your guests more clearly how order for laundry should be requested I left it in the room as usually do in other hotels instead of bringing downstairs as it turned out in NH 3 please ask cleaning lady to pay attention to table desks 4 Read invoice at check out attentively some duplications in charges might happen , Refreshments at lobby area fitness center and sauna Though 20 minutes are not enough to warm sauna up notification 20 mins in advance is required 
469755,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Can t open the window to the room A C was stuffy, The room is exactly what a business traveller needs has a good desk and chair and a socket for all things that need charging The staff at the reception was friendly and attentive to all my needs When I asked for a late check out they immediately gave me until 4pm without extra charge 
469756,NH Amsterdam Zuid, When I arrived in the hotel at 23 45 the staff informed me that there was a leakage on one of the floors and they were unable to rent out the room They rebooked me to NH in Amsterdam city centre It s oke if you have a problem that s out of your control but then it s all about how you manage this problem They failed miserably with this They didn t call me which would have been much better as I just came from the centre I got a smaller room in the city centre and I lost 1 hour of sleep They barely apologised for the inconvenience Apart from this the bed is terrible It s like sleeping on a rock The shower barely worked and the breakfast is bad value for money Wouldn t recommend to stay here ,No Positive
469757,NH Amsterdam Zuid, I booked four rooms at this hotel for my family and friends I was extremely disappointed with the level of service they provided Because of the incompetent staff we wasted a lot of time with issues that were rather trivial 1 In general the communication with the staff was very poor Almost every request e g extra bed faulty cooling system needed a follow up because either the staff forgot to address it or it wasn t completely understood Even when I asked for the manager of the hotel the staff at the desk seemed puzzled and somewhat reluctant to my request 2 Prior to my family arrival I double checked with the hotel that everything was paid and in good order However on the evening of their arrival my family had to wait 1 hour to check in late in the evening because of the incompetent staff who couldn t find the evidence of my payment , 1 Located relatively close to the Amsterdam Zuid train station the hotel is quite easy to reach from the airport and it takes just 15 minutes by bike or tram to get to the city center in the Leidseplein area 2 The rooms are very spacious relative to the typical Dutch hotel rooms in Amsterdam 
469758,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Bit out of the way but the tram metro was only about 8mins down the road , Massive bed nice bathroom bikes on site to rent and welcome fruit water was nice Helpful staff
469759,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Completely over priced for what it is Hotel itself felt like a throw back to the 70 s I believe it was a converted school Rather depressing feel to it ,No Positive
469760,NH Amsterdam Zuid, There was a mix up when I added the breakfast at the time of check in I was chased up by the lady at the breakfast counter to pay up for my breakfast I believe that you only charge the guest when they check out As a result I was late for my business appointment and had to rush to get there in time I think this hotel needs to have a process setup in place where there is proper communication between the reception and the breakfast counter However I was offered a day s complimentary breakfast This is a good gesture from the reception staff manager but it doesn t change the stress I had to go through to get to my business appointment in time I would think twice before staying here again I would definitely stay at the Crowne Plaza which doesn t have anyone charging you before you check out , Location was good and the bed was comfortable 
469761,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Quite a distance from city centre We used Uber several times cost 10 20EU taxi from city centre , For a good value hotel we were delighted It is extremely modern spacious and brilliant showers Wi Fi was excellent Didn t eat at bar or restaurant but it looked very nice 
469762,NH Amsterdam Zuid, I know the NH Hotel chain very well but this tone was a total surprise for me Check in was fast and ok but later on I had two rooms in order to accomodate my kids Their room had issues heater didn t work out and shower was not working properly either Both issues were communicated to the front desk but only the shower was repaired I asked twice for the heater to be serviced but no feedback and no repair either In front of this hotel there are many parking lots but be careful They look to be property from hotel but they are not I got a fine 39 Euros from the city I am sure lot of people do the same mistake I saw other 8 cars with same yellow paper on the windshield Why don t they ask if you know about that in the check in , Breakfast was good 19 euros per person but warm foods are not kept warm There are not warming lights or fire under them Once they are on the display they cool fast Check out was fast 
469763,NH Amsterdam Zuid, We encountered one problem We needed an extra bed in our room so we ve contacted the hotel a few days in advance We thought that we sorted it out However at the hotel it seemed nobody knew about our request Moreover there were no extra beds at the hotel as it was fully booked Nonetheless the staff sorted it out got us a bed from a nearby hotel and everything was well in the end Also the price given on booking com doesn t include the city tax , The first thing I want to point out is the exceptional work of staff The receptionist made us feel welcome from the second we entered And they solved the problems that arose with a smile The room was spacious and beautifully decorated The facilities were state of art And the beds were pretty comfortable The wi fi speed was great And to top it all the welcoming drink water with mint or lemon made us feel truly welcome As to the location it is 20 minutes walk from Zuid Station The neighborhood is quiet and has a beautiful park It is about 30 minuted from RAI convention center 
469764,NH Amsterdam Zuid, The toilet was left in a dirty state Drinking glasses in the room were not cleaned properly The breakfast was much too expensive and we had to pay extra because we had booked with Booking Com and not with NH , The hotel was well situated in a good area Meals were reasonably priced and of good quality though the menu was limited In general the staff were friendly 
469765,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Rooms were not practically designed for ladies the hotel is located really outside Amsterdam and the neighbourhood is quite boring , Breakfast was good
469766,NH Amsterdam Zuid, The iron ironing board is often a bit ropey and they don t seem to patrol the halls in the evenings so it s not uncommon to find room service trays lining the corridors all night until housekeeping come in the morning , Clean modern hotel close to the business district which was good for me Go back several times a year Food in the restaurant is good and staff friendly 
469767,NH Amsterdam Zuid, The bed was a bit hard the staff member who checked us in was quite judgemental as we are young Other hotel guests were very rude as we are young lots of stares and comments Even stares from the table directly beside us every morning at breakfast Other guests saying comments like are they going into our hotel In a rude manner The hotel charges your room service directly to the room we paid the young man cash and he didn t change this on the system Basically if you are here for business and aged over 30 eat salads and not the bacon then you will fit in here If you like pancakes and bacon and are aged under 30 were jeans and not a suit or dress be prepared to be judged , The hotel was quiet The room was spacious and the bath was perfect The staff at breakfast were great and very quick to clear and clean tables after guests left although I felt rude not being able to put my own plate off the the side 
469768,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Not many English channels on TV Hotel s kind of in the middle of nowhere No beans or fried eggs for breakfast, Huge comfy bed Blackout blinds Lots of space in room Extremely helpful friendly staff
469769,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Im a lazy walker so might be the distance , The conditioning and the view from upper floor Minibar in the room and small shop downstairs open during the night Room service Beautiful 
469770,NH Amsterdam Zuid, I have found the breakfast price quite high We had to book the room without breakfast but we had our breakfast at the hotel and saw that it was 20 EUR person , The room was comfortable and clean staff were helpful the breakfast was quite rich 
469771,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Not only this hotel but I wish they would offer a continental breakfast option of just a coffee and croissant rather than charging 17 per person for a range of foods I m not wanting , Located a little way out of the centre but the advantage being that there was free parking available The room was large contemporary modern style with tea coffee facilities Very comfortable beds 
469772,NH Amsterdam Zuid, WiFi was not as good as expected for this kind of hotel I assumed it is related to the amount of guests at the time Breakfast is buff but I missed a broader selection of healthy food , Easy to reach and very comfortable room I really like the idea of having a big table which I can use as desktop during my stay 
469773,NH Amsterdam Zuid, I am triple sure i checked the breakfast included on the booking com search this is the reason i selected the hotel breakfast was not included they charged 17 euro extra per person per day lol at that money i would select another hotel , clean good view at 6 floor restaurant at the hotel was perfect low price good food excellent staff except for breakfast 
469774,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Hotel staff did not tell us about the free shuttle bus that they had running to Amsterdam central and we only found out about this on the last day of our stay by other guests Staff were a little rude in the sense if you wanted their Assiastace it felt like they did not want to help you Also the room service pizza is 12 50 per pizza the make of the pizz is Chicago Town which range from 3 4 50 to buy so they know how to make their money And they weren t even cooked Staff also failed to inform us that there is different times for breakfast each day They only told us for the following day Room was freezing and the hot part of the air con wasnt very good Hotel is clean and near a tram station ,No Positive
469775,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Way too far from everything the staff was not so helpfull and it was really expensive for what the hotel offers first night we had to sleep in twin beds because the hotel didnt had any other double bed even though we paid for double they charge an extra 50 euro deposit which they returned after the check out still this was never mentioned anywhere felt they were shaidy ,No Positive
469776,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Cleanliness in the room could have been better the other nh hotels are much better My tablets was thrown my cleaning staff and also a long time for a checkout , Peaceful good shower and a decent size of a room
469777,NH Amsterdam Zuid, I had a different person staying with me for the last day of the stay made announcement about this on the receptions and the sheets have not been changed , Staff is great and helpful rooms are cosy breakfast is rich and tasty
469778,NH Amsterdam Zuid, I was told that the location was close to the city centre this couldn t be more untrue We spent most of our time on a tram travelling On 3 4 nights we stayed we were woke from our sleep with horrendous noise from the rooms next door which is totally unacceptable as I was told I had a quiet room area The food was horrible ,No Positive
469779,NH Amsterdam Zuid, nothing, Staff is super helpful and kind Rooms are big and spacious Breakfast was amazing 6 different juices eggs made on request different kinds of bread lots of fruit veggies gluten free corner 7 kinds of cheese and I could go on and on Just amazing 
469780,NH Amsterdam Zuid, That since some of us arrived on an early flight from the U S we could only check in after 15 00 unless we paid extra since we all stayed for a week and i ordered 4 rooms i think they should have been more understanding not charged me, The service was very good and very friendly Loved the breakfast 
469781,NH Amsterdam Zuid, I ordered room service When I finished my dinner I called to pick up dishes from my room But never pick even though tomorrow morning Shower water power is very low , The room was upgraded the highest room automatically 
469782,NH Amsterdam Zuid,No Negative, Great Hotel big rooms helpful stuff The hotel is a bit far from the center but it was still great to stay there 5 6 minutes walk you can reach the tram or metro which will take you directly to the center we enjoyed our stay if you have no problem to stay a bit out of the center its Highly recommended
469783,NH Amsterdam Zuid, The window in the room was broken and fixed with duct tape whaat Heating A C in the room was living its own life The hotel is too far from public transport and center During check out they mistakenly charged money for second time , Nice interior The room is big and comfortable 
469784,NH Amsterdam Zuid, WIFI was a bit quite slow I mean it s free so I guess it makes sense that it was but you could maybe add some channels to ur tv for better selection like sky channels may boost the level of the each individual room , Room service was quick and the food was wonderful had great staff and access to Amsterdam was easy peasy Will always come back here no doubt
469785,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Noise at night kind of ventilator or something working until late then early in the morning from 6am ohhh And then coffee machine not working such a good recipe for disappointment ,No Positive
469786,NH Amsterdam Zuid, I felt the cleanliness in my room was poor due to finding long hairs on the duvet cover in the wardrobe and on the bathroom floor This was disappointing for a 4 star hotel, Nice modern interior of hotel and room The shower in the bathroom was powerful and bed was excellent Nespresso machine in the room was a pleasant surprise
469787,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Air conditioning in rooms room walls need maintenance location not ideal for tourists but for business community breakfast lunch being limited tasteless, Reception team being very helpful good gym condition proximity to business centres work desk and bathroom in rooms
469788,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Maps and staff don t inform you the 5 tram can take you straight to the centre of Amsterdam It is a 8 12minute walk from the hotel Finding the hotel was difficult Also the locals seemed to be unaware of the hotel within the area as they were unable to point us in the right direction they almost sent us back to the centre of Amsterdam , Spent a few hours trying to find the hotel so the room was very refreshing upon arrival the colours really helped after walking all over the city trying to find the way there Room was very clean mini bar was stocked Very open room and a beautiful view 
469789,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Nothing, This hotel saved our anniversary weekend after the horror show that was the Art Gallery hotel the staff couldn t have been more helpful the food was good and the public transport links were great 
469790,NH Amsterdam Zuid, 1 The fact that we could not make changes to the reservation approx 10 days before arrival was a problem 2 The shower head fell on me twice whilst in the shower it s quite a big one I have a big blue bruise on my shoulder 3 I phoned reception to order food and the the receptionist advised us to order out This bill was 27 euro s for two pizzas after I only wanted to order something from the hotel menu for 15 euro 4 we did have burgers on another day at the hotel and they forgot to put our eggs on the burgers 5 the staff was very friendly but I wont recommend this property Its to expensive for what it is There as no USB charge point in the rooms the blinds are old and we could not block all the light off as we tried to sleep during the day coming from an American flight and was exhausted we were charged 6 euro s per person city tax per day 6 we asked for a wake up call that never happened this was one of my many stays in Amsterdam but it was the one I liked the least I think the hotel needs work on the rooms and they need to rethink the cost of their menus and service Dieter Eric Emma were lovely staff though ,No Positive
469791,NH Amsterdam Zuid, I didn t like that the location was a bit far out than I thought it would be I got taxi everyday was nearly 25 a time from NH zuid to red light district , Walk in shower was great Room was also Really big and bed was big Really comfortable aswell Staff were also really helpful when I asked for taxis to places or when I needed help 
469792,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Receptionist was busy doing wake up call when checked us in didnt even explain the total fee just handed us the card machine we need to ask first beforehand , Nice and friendly restaurant staff great continental breakfast too Ms Sunarni made sure we had everything we need Superb service 
469793,NH Amsterdam Zuid, not very close to the center of the city , the hotel is very inviting the rooms are very clean and was great staying there I will definitely come back 
469794,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Our double bed was very much too singles pushed together They moved apart very easily But it wasn t major They were very comfy , The breakfasts were absolutely amazing Never seen so much variety They constantly brought out fresh food Loved the little touches like the baby toddler station will teddy bear plates and cutlery and puzzles etc The staff couldn t have been more friendly or helpful We travelled with a disabled father and 2 young children Access was brilliant First holiday in Amsterdam so we had all sorts of questions the staff we fantastic 
469795,NH Amsterdam Zuid, I dont like the following i am not automatically linked to my rewards system all the time i have to check and verify with staff if i dont say anything i dont get the points i had a discount of 15 that o could not use because i made the booking on booking com If i made it on nh com i would have arrived with the 15 off at the same price as on booking So where is the advantage is like making fun of customers i wanted to use my reward points was not possible because again i made the booking on booking com lack of information to customers and resistance from Spanish staff high price for renting bikes 16 euro when in the city is 3 5 euro , clean enough space
469796,NH Amsterdam Zuid, It was hard to get the temperature right in the shower Kept going from boiling to freezing at the slightest adjustment The bed wasn t the most comfortable , The room was very modern looking Clean and inviting Lots of space Lovely bathroom 
469797,NH Amsterdam Zuid,No Negative, All the employees were exceptional gentleman and exquisite maddames Made me feel incredibly comfortable and will never forgot Very hard working and genuine Thank you very much for a wonderful experience 
469798,NH Amsterdam Zuid, The night staff are so rude not allowed to order food but there is a 24 hr room service I am a hotel manager and let me say I have never come accross incompetent last night staff The outside seating area was empty and full of glassware at 2400 and all the same glassware was there at 0800 ,No Positive
469799,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Air conditioning system is not doing its job The air in rooms is not fresh and the aircon mostly makes noise rather than cleans and freshens the air Windows do not open Also picking up food at breakfast is not straightforward and quick All food is disseminated at different locations which are not immediately noticeable and it is not easy to instantly see what is available The process takes time which is a bit annoying , The bed is very comfortable The showers are very good Breakfast is nice 
469800,NH Amsterdam Zuid,No Negative, Staff very friendly helpful and professional Room clean stylish and comfortable Breakfast was impressive having variety of soya gluten free products as my daughter being vegan Good transport link to the centre Gave us some macaroons wrapped in a bag as a check out gift excellent idea 
469801,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Location is a bit far from things to do, Beds were comfy Good selection for breakfast that was extended till 12 on sunday We were able to pay to check in early 
469802,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Cleaning could have been better Was stains on the window sills bathroom tiles needing a clean people s toothpaste all over Air conditioning was annoying couldn t change temp COLD and asked for it to be switched off as the noise was annoying and they didn t when they said they would ,No Positive
469803,NH Amsterdam Zuid, The air conditioning was not cooling enough and when we complained we were provided with a small table fan As they were unable to lower the temperature below 25deg C The housekeeping in the room was appalling Stayed here for 3 nights but everyday noticed that only the beds were done and the garbage bins cleared Nothing else besides this Don t think the room was even being dusted or swept as bits of paper n dust used to be lying around in the room The same bed linen was used even though it had stains on it Toilet bowls were not cleaned It s a long walk 15 20 min to the metro and another 25 min by metro to the central station If traveling by tram it s even longer , Breakfast was excellent however there was no change in the menu for the 3 days we were here Bus stop is just at the front door 
469804,NH Amsterdam Zuid, The pillows could be a bit harder , We enjoyed the breakfast The room was big nice and cosy The staff was helpful in giving directions and other things that we asked There is a park near the hotel where you can take a walk or just relax 
469805,NH Amsterdam Zuid, they ask to block 50 at your CC at check in before you had allready payed all IT S TOTALLY ILLEGAL and it s not writed any place WATCH OUT , Thiago
469806,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Airconditioning did not work properly in one of our rooms and was very noisy I asked personnel to look at it but it could not be fixed somehow, Breakfast was excellent and gym was good with drinks and towels Good beds even extra bed Spacious rooms for Amsterdam standards
469807,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Even though we love the neigbourhood its located a little far from the center 20 30 min depending the station you go for , This is our second time in Nh Zuid Musica we enjoy the calm green neigbourhood Hotel has a decent size basic modern and clean room Wifi works well and there s a kettle for having some tea or coffee in the room There is a jumbo market next to the station von Boshuinzenstraat the hotel is 10 minutes straight walk away 900m Acces to from the hotel to schipol is very easy You take a bus just in front of the hotel than take the train in Zuid station 
469808,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Extremely bad internet connection for the full 4 days we stayed there Today Internet should be a must in hotels even if it s free it should work properly Water pressure really low we were at the 4th floor , Very nice staff at the reception especially Samuel who was very helpful and professional 
469809,NH Amsterdam Zuid, The hotel was very expensive there should be more tourist information available for around the area The 50 fee was also not returned to us , Beds were comfy staff were very helpful short distance from train station and bus stop outside
469810,NH Amsterdam Zuid,No Negative, Breakfast with a lot of healthy choices and lots of fruit Room pretty spacious Location is very friendly and easy to go to the city just a bus and a tram away 
469811,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Breakfast was not included , Very quiet spacious room Beds are great Large bathroom with bath and shower I would recommend a room at one of the top floors I had a room at the 6th floor Personnel is very friendly and helpful 
469812,NH Amsterdam Zuid, The Internet is free but slow , Super nice team any of my requests were fulfilled I liked that there is a caf kit Air condition refrigerator and very comfortable bed Location train and bus within proximity to the airport and the city Very quiet area 
469813,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Wifi is a bit slow , Big room and very clean fully renovated The best feature of the room is the erfect and enormous bed Bathroom is also big clean and very modern 
469814,NH Amsterdam Zuid, The staff at the reception was in training was the excuse they made when they charged 50 too much for the breakfast we didn t take for the city tax we already paid via booking com and for the mini bar which we didn t use Fortunatelly we saw it before we left and they tried to make a refundment although it was really hard for them to do that , Clean bathroom parking excellent sauna fitness available and there is also a refreshment for everyone lemon water and mint water 
469815,NH Amsterdam Zuid, The location is not so good No restaurants or shops near by Restaurant in the hotel is not good Overall the value for money paid is not good, The room was clean and spacious Good beds
469816,NH Amsterdam Zuid, A bit far from the happening places, The room was spacious and clean There was a confusion as I had not mentioned while booking that our kid also is accompanying us however the staff was extremely supportive and managed to provide us a room with extra bed 
469817,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Find Breakfast prices high choices however are varied good Canadian breakfasts not quite so exspensive , Comfy rooms spotless housekeeping near to Metro easy access to Central Quiet area a short walk along the canal through small parks to the delightful Amstel park 
469818,NH Amsterdam Zuid, The AC was noisy and no possibility to turn it off WiFi signal was slow on the 6th floor , Very nice modern hotel Located not far from metro station so no problem getting to the center Quiet neighborhood Great breakfast 
469819,NH Amsterdam Zuid, We ordered dinner on 4 nights and 2 dishes that we liked came out in different portion size presentation and taste on 3 occasions , Location is closer to metro station away from the city so less traffic Easy to get to city center due to metro Around 10 mins walk from hotel to metro Tram 
469820,NH Amsterdam Zuid, The view could have been nicer and furthermore that there was a need to pay extra insurance and city tax on arrival This should have been made more clear when booking , The breakfast was really good the bed excellent and the space overall very good 
469821,NH Amsterdam Zuid, The restaurant was an interesting mixture of meeting place and bar No real opportunity to sit and eat in peace as I would expect in a restaurant There was a football match and a few beers going down REALLY too close to where I wanted a quiet meal I could have gone to my room I guess It is only a small criticism I will go back , The hotel delivered what I expected It is clean very interestingly and thoughtfully decorated I don t mean a design hotel which is all design and no hotel of which Amsterdam has many The staff are friendly efficient knowledgeable and make everything run smoothly As a business traveller this is what I want and this is what NH provides 
469822,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Room service prices put me off ordering at the hotel but that wasn t a problem as we ate out every night, The rooms were very modern clean and spacious Shower room was very nice and staff were excellent 
469823,NH Amsterdam Zuid, A bit too far from town but that s to be expected from a more business oriented hotel , Good choice of breakfast Very friendly and helpful staff Convenient for public transport into town 
469824,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Horribly expensive just for room service and dinner Ridiculous pricing no wonder no on else are there should have known And the breakfast prices were not shown properly which was annoying And they even forgot my sausages and bacon until I called up , Easy to get into town and nice area and great hotel 
469825,NH Amsterdam Zuid, While I understand it was probably a busy check in and check out time 15 people the staff at the reception was unhelpful and unwelcoming The room had marking of an old water leak which was cleaned The TV did not work When asked to fix it they say they will send somebody We asked at the check out time and they then told us it was WE so they had no technician Double bed come with two single duvets , The value for money and the location are good for Amsterdam The easy parking in the area is also convenient The Bathroom is nice and convenient 
469826,NH Amsterdam Zuid, We ask for double bed and we got single ones we should pay at the reception but they took the money straight from the account and we had to pay a deposit about we don t know about it and for the parking they was charging 15 euro even on the website was saying is free, The room was quite big and the bathroom had a bath 
469827,NH Amsterdam Zuid, The door lock was terrible the key card was changed 3 times The faucet was poor quality there were two options hot or cold shower No toilet brush a possible cause of unpleasant situation for a quest , Nice helpfull colleauges at the reception
469828,NH Amsterdam Zuid, I couldn t smoke inside had to go out of the hotel every time I wanted to smoke, Every time I travel I look for a comfortable bed and the surrounding areas so as far as area was concerned I couldn t have asked for more
469829,NH Amsterdam Zuid, It s far from the centre of Amsterdam and also hard to reach by public transport while this would be the best way to get into Amsterdam city centre as driving and parking in the centre is no fun , Nicely designed room and nice breakfast 
469830,NH Amsterdam Zuid, I liked everything about the hotel, The staff were really nice and very understanding they were very easy to talk to and gave us lots of travelling advise
469831,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Very low pressure on water Slow check in and out Staff were having internal meeting when there were long queues to check out and staff did not really show an interest in the guests , The no surprises when visiting NH Always know what is there and it is normally always a pleasure being a guest at NH 
469832,NH Amsterdam Zuid, Staff at the Bar was a bit annoyed when we entered with an empty Coke Even when I told him that it was empty and I am gonna order from his drink list Later he brought the wrong bill far too much was charged when we told him about it there was no sorry or thank you do not go to the bar Room was clean but I found many hairs in the bathroom , reception was friendly and uncomplicated I would say even very flexible when we asked to change rooms etc very good
469833,NH Amsterdam Zuid, you cannot open any window so no fresh air only ac which makes the room dry and stuffy It is a bit far out Tram to city center is a walk of 20 min s , friendly staff good and clean room
