23038,Pullman London St Pancras, It wasn t central and would have loved to stay more within the city Hotel was good and we had a family room but the hotel is more suited for business travelers For the price we paid there is no entertainment option for kids in and around the hotel , The breakfast was really nice

23041,Pullman London St Pancras, The price 270 for one night not including breakfast I could have stayed at the Waldorf Astoria in Versailles for 240 euros But this is London where most of the hotels are overpriced The restaurant is more like a caf bar and not very accommodating if you want to eat after 10 00 , A stylish hotel with comfortable spacious rooms Very well placed for St Pancras station and a 15 20 minute walk to Oxford Street

23052,Pullman London St Pancras, The room I had was at the back of the hotel on the first floor overlooking the back yards of another apartment building I did not mind the lack of view as I had not booked for this However because of this the room was a bit darker than normal and lacked character It needed a bit more wall and furniture decor for it to feel a bit more welcoming than just a basic hotel room, The best thing about my stay was the excellent scrumptious wide range of breakfast every morning I was especially pleased at the wide array of fruits berries and yogurts creams as well as the full english breakfast breads and wonderful pastries and muffins The room was clean comfortable and well equipped with extras bathrobe slippers and extra toiletries 
23053,Pullman London St Pancras, The room was adequate but just like any room in a city hotel not as nice as we expected rather boring really , Handy location for our train to Brussels 
23054,Pullman London St Pancras, I was given a room for a disabled person It was not mentioned on booking or check in I have already mentioned that this should be highlighted at the time of booking as I am not happy to stay in a room for a disabled person Room for gigantic for obvious reasons but not comfortable,No Positive
23055,Pullman London St Pancras, Not much to criticise really Quite expensive , Lovely hotel clean comfortable very friendly and helpful staff Location right next to kingscross etc but not noisy Good views of London 
23056,Pullman London St Pancras,No Negative, Stayed two nights hotel very light and airy with very pleasant and helpful receptionists De lux room was very good and well appointed Breakfast was a Pleasing experience with everything you need hot or cold Hotel near Kings Cross and St Pancras 3 minute walk Aldo the tube is two minutes away All in all very good only gripe is the price which I know it is London but is still a little steep 600 for two nights ugh 
23057,Pullman London St Pancras,No Negative, Nice modern hotel sat between Euston and Kings Cross station The rooms were great modern clean and had everything we needed The view from the 12th floor was first class who needs the London Eye The reception and other areas were also really good I travel a lot and stay in many different hotels few I would go back too but I would definitely go back to the Pullman London 
23058,Pullman London St Pancras, Felt like a posh premiere inn really don t understand how the price commanded represented what you got Rooms were boring towels were tired and not at all luxury No way a 4 star Cancelled breakfast as the queu to get in was just ridiculous and the restaurant over crowded , Reception area nice 
23059,Pullman London St Pancras, Only bad mark the brioche were stale An oversight I guess they have been great when I stayed in the hotel before , The staff were intelligent polite helpful and friendly The views were stunning though for a London girl who remembers the area when it was run down and dirty and the hotel when it was the public Library it was a bit surreal Excellent breakfast except brioche see below 
23060,Pullman London St Pancras, It was pricey , Conveniently close to King s Crossing for Eurostar underground Starbucks across the street Room comfortable Modern decor Lobby very inviting to hang out with a drink 
23061,Pullman London St Pancras, Deluxe room but was not informed that the drinks and snacks in fridge would be extra money on what we had already paid this was only advised when we came to checkout , Location perfect for Kings Cross station and underground Our visit was for concert at wembley which was a short tube journey away We had a deluxe room with robes and slippers provided Bathroom with large walk in shower Breakfast was plentiful and you had an excellent choice Staff helpful and friendly 
23062,Pullman London St Pancras, There was a receptionist who had a thick French accent we struggled to understand Noisy reception Breakfast was 20 which we didn t choose to have For the price we paid for the room 20 extra was a RIP OFF BIG Time Noisy slamming doors in corridor Hey , Bed ok Views from top of lift on floor 16 
23063,Pullman London St Pancras, For some strange reason someone thinks it s a good idea to have frosted glass doors into the toilet in the room so you can see when someone is on the loo , Great location to attractions and transport Friendly efficient staff in a well run hotel 
23064,Pullman London St Pancras, no complaints, the location of this hotel within easy walking distance of St Pancreas and Kings Cross was a big plus for us the staff are excellent very welcoming and nothing is too much trouble our room was a good size with plenty of space especially for a central London hotel the buffet breakfast is more than adequate and of a reasonable quality with plenty of selection from continental to full English we were only here for one night so we didn t really need or try any of the extra facilities available but if you need a good quality hotel with good transport links to both main line and underground I would recommend the Pullman we will definitely stay here again when we next visit London and by the way although our 4th floor room overlooked the busy Euston Rd it was well soundproofed and we couldn t hear a thing 
23065,Pullman London St Pancras, Although the tube station is only 5min walks away it takes around 30 min to get to Central London but this is not an issue if you are prepared , Lovely breakfast with a great variety to choose from The rooms are spacious with perfect temperature Although you are literary on Euston road the double glazing windows do an amazing job Black out curtains available which block out the light 
23066,Pullman London St Pancras, Service at the bar was disappointing Took our order of 2 glasses of wine then carried on helping a colleague with their order of a selection of cocktaila After a while said colleague was alarmed and suggested he serve us first We had paid over 10 per glass of wine so we re disappointed with the service , Location and views 
23067,Pullman London St Pancras, The only disappointment was we didn t get much sleep because of the noise from outside because we had to sleep with the window open because the heating thermostat was broken and was stuck on winter mode according to the maintenance engineer we called out twice to fix the problem on the second time the engineer came out we was told to leave the thermostat for two hours to see if the problem was solved if the problem is not solved he said we would have to move rooms When we arrived back late in the evening it was hotter stuck at 27 degrees the reception had no knowledge of the problem and was to late to move room We was very disappointed and on our departure we told the reception of our concerns , staff view
23068,Pullman London St Pancras, We arrived in a heat wave It was 34C and we had trouble with the air conditioning but they happily moved us to a better room , The staff went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable The restaurant was superb Only a few steps to catch the Eurostar Perfect 
23069,Pullman London St Pancras, The shower floor was very slippery and we had to put a towel in the shower , Beautiful comprehensive breakfast Large array of fresh juices from carrot to kale Everything you could think of in today s diverse diets 
23070,Pullman London St Pancras, It was very busy on arrival and although there were three reception staff on duty there was an inevitable delay in getting checked in , Our room was extremely quite with a very comfortable bed and a lovely shower room The staff were most attentive and very helpful and courteous We particularly liked the lounge area where we were able to relax with a drink with our daughter and son in law who also happened to be in London 
23071,Pullman London St Pancras, I would like Paleo options provided at breakfast ie almond milk I would use this with your seeds and nuts as my cereal , Helpful and couteuous staff The breakfast was excellent but I would like paleo options available 
23072,Pullman London St Pancras, Confusing temp control I think hotels should think of incorporating bidets Was given sparking water instead of telling them I only need still The 8 PM knock on door entry if not locked or DNB tag outside is annoying just to give a piece of chocolate Room service menu was very limited Mini microwave helps Larger tea coffee cups The coffee machine wasn t hot enough Room phone loses charge quickly TV doesn t have many channels working, Quick Room Service Good housekeeping Secure Staff was helpful all the time
23073,Pullman London St Pancras, The mini bar prices were rather on the high side , The bed was huge and very comfortable We were made to feel welcome by the staff As it was just a stopover en route to Paris we didn t use the facilities but they looked very luxurious
23074,Pullman London St Pancras, Fitness room is too small and not to much fitted , An excellent hotel in great location staff is welcoming and give an excellent service Great breakfast Value for money is fair as the hotel is quite expensive 
23075,Pullman London St Pancras, Room was pretty small no mirror dressing table area to do hair and makeup tea and coffee tray not great not enough tea milk and glass mugs not practical ironing board useless had massive hump in it creaking bed view from room top of a roof which actually could be made to look good with some artwork toilet seat highly uncomfortable , Location and staff great funky decor and a good powerful shower
23076,Pullman London St Pancras, A very nice place but a little pricey for the square footage of the room , Very convenient location easy access to St Pancras and Eurostar Check in was very friendly easy and room was ready at 2pm Room was very clean and the breakfast was exceptional 
23077,Pullman London St Pancras, Too few staff available on the morning I had breakfast and cappuccino was of poor quality , Taster plates were very good when I entertained friends but staff need to be a little more attentive in terms of if there are 4 guest don t provide a plate with only 3 items 
23078,Pullman London St Pancras, Maid service a bit late in turning room around although excellent work when they serviced the room , Friendly and helpful staff very good breakfast selection Good bar

23080,Pullman London St Pancras,No Negative, Less than 1 4 mile from St Pancras Kings Crossing station so chunnel access great along with Piccadilly line to Heathrow Also immediately next to London British Library really a must see for historically significant documents free with museum style dining available Only there one night so neighborhood not throughly examined but not what you would term quaint with variety of dinning shops Staff great not the cheapest around but very comfortable 
23081,Pullman London St Pancras, More variety for breakfast It was the same thing every morning , The location was great Two blocks from all of the main Tube lines which take you all over the city Also within walking distance to cute local restaurants and coffee shops that are off the beaten path 
23082,Pullman London St Pancras,No Negative, Excellent choice very close to St Pancras Wonderful staff and doorman Stay was spoilt slightly by an unpleasant supervisor in the dining room whose treatment of her staff was appalling Hardly an exercise in leadership I felt moved to speak to her about it Other than that it was a great stay Thank you
23083,Pullman London St Pancras,No Negative, This hotel is a very easy straight 3 min walk from King Cross station We were traveling to stay for one night to attend a boxing match at Wembley and the hotel area was perfect The staff could not be more accommodating and friendly the couple we were traveling with were celebrating their anniversary and the staff upgraded them with a bottle of prosecco and a lovely chocolate display congratulating them This was at no extra cost or effort The hotel is spotless and the bar area is very modern with a great drink selection The rooms are beautifully finishes and very spacious the bed is HUGE and extremely comfortable All in all a wonderful hotel and we can t wait to visit again hopefully for a longer stay

23085,Pullman London St Pancras, Very good shower but no bath Having to pay 25 per night upgrade to have a room with a view , Excellent choice for breakfast Friendly staff Central London position Free wifi 
23086,Pullman London St Pancras, Noise in reception made booking in with staff difficult Busy reception and background conversation in seating and bar areas Superior room overcrowded as sofa takes up an area and then area around bed in tight Other rooms more spacious Breakfast area doubles up with bar area and sitting on sofa type furnishings is not comfortable to eat breakfast , Location near stations is benefit 
23087,Pullman London St Pancras, The shower had a tendency to go hot cold whilst showering which made you do a little dance when it suddenly goes cold , Stayed here a few times A little pricey but it s always comfortable and clean Great location for Kings Cross and the Eurostar Breakfast is good although you may prefer to pop to a local cafe Wifi is decent and room service is fast

23091,Pullman London St Pancras, No drawers in the room for clothing We lived out of our suitcases No large wastebasket only a tiny one in the bathroom Shower hard to figure out at first and the floor was very slippery because of the material it was made out of No hand holds and one of those partial glass walls with no door Nothing to hold on to at all I had to put a towel on the floor to keep from slipping , The staff was excellent and helpful Computer access in the lobby was very convenient Good bar Convenient location Fast readily available elevators Right across from the British Library Good eating establishments directly across the street including a Starbucks and Pret a Manger and Pizza Express A few blocks from Euston Station which made transportation very easy 
23092,Pullman London St Pancras, Was asked to eat my breakfast at the bar because the dining room was full and I was alone I did this willingly but of course it s not as comfortable as being at a table The bathroom door closes in on your knees when sitting on the toilet if you re tall like me Had a few problems working out how to switch of the air conditioning finally worked out that you have to take the key out of the slot , Allowed to check in early at midday in fact Very friendly front desk staff Nice shower with plenty of space Comfy bed and good sized TV

23094,Pullman London St Pancras, Bathroom door is see through Very awkward when travelling with family Not everyone is on a honeymoon and would like some privacy Staff unable to communicate in English Terrible communication on the most basic of things from checking in to service in the bar and restaurant Awful Lots of people standing around unable to do the job effectively If there was half the staff who knew what to do it would be the same thing if not better , Beds very comfortable Hotel itself has nice facilities Great location but not picturesque Very urban with little local feel Good price value for comfort and location proximity to St Pancras and underground buses etc 
23095,Pullman London St Pancras, Booked this hotel as it said it had parking however this was not the case there were car parks within a 10 min walk but they weren t owned by the hotel we ended up paying a fortune for overnight parking the main reason I booked this hotel was it said it had parking , friendly staff short walk to Euston station
23096,Pullman London St Pancras, Elevator was on modification waiting time for available one took a while Booking through booking com cannot accredited hotel loyalty program, Great location with good English breakfast meal
23097,Pullman London St Pancras, Nothing really, Close to kings x station hotel modern clean and excellent breakfast and even though busy outside inside quiet and peaceful certainly recommend
23098,Pullman London St Pancras, 10 Service charge added for every drink you bought We bought 7 drinks and it was nearly 90, Liked everything about the hotel Staff great breakfast great room great 
23099,Pullman London St Pancras, I had to ask about extra towels and slippers for 3 times at first day Sofa bed for the kid was like a paper on iron nails Not possible to sleep on it , Just clean 
23100,Pullman London St Pancras, Traffic noise surprisingly noticeable on our room on 9th floor at the front of the hotel , Well located for Euston and Kings Cross St Pancras Helpful staff allowing us to check in as early at 11 30am The bedroom was compact as is the London style but well equipped The fitness facilities are excellent

23105,Pullman London St Pancras, if I had to be picky not keen on glass petition walls in rooms especially if youre not sharing with someone you know Not much sound proofing with them Alot of banging doors but you get that everywhere would have been nice if we could have checked in at midday but not essential, Comfy bed quiet air con location cleanliness good pillows express check out
23106,Pullman London St Pancras, Arriving back to Hotel at 12 15 am after a lovely night out with husband wanting a night cap before bed going to bar and being told they had no Smirnoff Vodka and no Bacardi For a Hotel which is undoubtedly 4 star this came as a shock whoever is in charge of beverage ordering needs a good shake up Pull your socks up Pullman , Bedrooms very large and comfortable
23107,Pullman London St Pancras, As is seemingly the way for all but the best hotels the extra glass mug and robe were forgotten for when the room is made up for 3 Not the end of the world as basics like Towels and pillows etc were catered for and couldn t fault anything else , Room 112 had excellent arrangement for a family of 3 or 4 with 2 separate sleeping areas each with their own TV 
23108,Pullman London St Pancras, Lack of storage space if there had been two people staying there would have been arguments Had difficulty accessing wifi but that got sorted out by a member of staff A problem that I find with all hotels the walls are too thin why can t they be noise insulated I would pay extra not to hear my neighbours antics , Good breakfast with everything to satisfy any traveller Very large comfortable bed with a choice of pillows I had a room high up at the back so wasn t troubled by traffic noise Very clean 
23109,Pullman London St Pancras, Far too expensive for what is offered No pay TV in room possible Staff in breakfast area are untrained do not know the difference between a Cappuccino and a Flat White Other than that the coffee is lukewarm Too little for 27 GBP for breakfast, Location is the only criteria 
23110,Pullman London St Pancras, The airconditionner was too cold then too warm not really handy to use the adjuster I was missing information in the room from the facilities and timing it should be much better for a hotel of this standing and name , Breakfast very large choice of quality gym and sauna
23111,Pullman London St Pancras, WiFi can be a bit temperamental until you get it to work , The breakfast at the Pullman is worth every penny and really it s the reason I stay there over and over The hotel has a great selection of bread meat cheese and cereal They also have great healthy juices cappucinos and a selection of honey I think the hotel keeps hives Also the chef makes wonderful omelettes and fried eggs and porridge on demand The French bellevaire yoghurt with fruit of the forest coulis is to die for 
23112,Pullman London St Pancras, Hardly any , Their staff are wonderfully nice and thoughtful especially Kait and Tomas my daughter like them a lot Will definitely recommend this hotel to friends The hotel s location is great too lovely view of St Pancras station nearby sites like Regent Canal and Central St Martins water fountain are our child s favourite

23116,Pullman London St Pancras, They seats and sofa in the foyer were very low too low for anyone with mobility problems including my 84yr old mother in law fortunately there were other seats available , All staff we met or talked to were so courteous and helpful nothing was too much trouble and we felt really welcome Everywhere was very clean and the room had everything we needed the bed was very comfortable and the shower was very roomy The restaurant was very pleasant for dinner and the food was very good 
23117,Pullman London St Pancras, Only price to quality ratio , That s a very comfortable hotel up to the best standards of 4 star hotels The location is great and the rooms are nice and modern 
23118,Pullman London St Pancras, I was not crazy about the location The street in front was very busy lots of sirens Several homeless people sleeping on the sidewalks which were strewn with litter The hotel itself was lovely and chic Friendly staff , The hotel itself was nice Cool lobby I liked our room 
23119,Pullman London St Pancras, It was a little expensive The breakfast for example was delicious but over priced for children The food options could be more varied to accommodate snacks etc , Stunning view Breathtaking 
23120,Pullman London St Pancras, I was told on the day of arrival that my booking was cancelled for no reason despite that I made the booking several months ago It was a bit disappointing after a long flight all the way from China , The location is excellent and the modern decor is appealing to the eyes 
23121,Pullman London St Pancras, The hotel was very noisy especially the bar and breakfast due to a large business meeting going on Breakfast was a little disappointing with only a buffet and no a la carte options The buffet itself had a lovely selection but the hot food was overstocked so the food was not of the best quality eggs rubbery sausages dry The coffee was over held and stewed , Decor is very stylish Room comfortable Ideal location if arriving from the North by train Staff friendly and helpful 
23122,Pullman London St Pancras, the restaurant for breakfast is bit small , location is excellant highly suggest guests to take bus to travel around city since bus stop Britiah Library just few steps away from the hotel That can save time to go down for underground 
23123,Pullman London St Pancras, Price but its unavoidable in London, The Breakfast and food in general looked amazing There was an excellent selection of fresh fruit and pastries at breakfast and overall the food was excellent 
23124,Pullman London St Pancras,No Negative, I always enjoy staying at the Pullman all in all it s one of the best hotels in London excellent location warm and friendly staff decent wifi reasonable rates

23126,Pullman London St Pancras, Paying after every beer or snack I had at the bar was pretty annoying , Excellent hotel great breakfast cozy and spacey rooms good bar Reasonable proximity by foot to the city center good access to public transport Magnificent view from 12 floor 
23127,Pullman London St Pancras, The view wasn t great from our room just looking out onto the back of the hotel However I wouldn t let that put you off everything else about our stay was brilliant , The room was a great size the bed was very comfortable and the staff were all lovely A 5 minute walk from Kings Cross too A great stay 
23128,Pullman London St Pancras, Room quite dark Being automatically put on an email list, Breakfast though almost turned away our kids and said only one breakfast per double room This was really insulting 
23129,Pullman London St Pancras, Our visit was fantastic and the hotel and staff couldn t have been better we can t wait to come back , The Pullman hotel was easy to find and right next to st Pancras station From the moment we arrived the staff were friendly and helpful and even gave us an upgrade and a birthday gift of macaroons and fruit as it was my husbands birthday The room had beautiful views over London s skyline from 14th floor and the bed was big and comfortable Breakfast was a varied selection of food which filled us up for our pounding the London streets 
23130,Pullman London St Pancras, No biscuits in room lol, We visit London quite a lot and stopped in a variety of hotels depending what were there for the Pullman is the best to date for quality and value see you soon
23131,Pullman London St Pancras, I don t have a problem with the hotel but on booking com website it said there is a swimming pool so maybe up date the booking com description to say that there is no pool , The staff where very friendly and helpful Breakfast very good selection 
23132,Pullman London St Pancras, The Lifts were being serviced and upgraded which will be fine once complete but as there was only 1 customer lift for the whole hotel getting to and from the room was rather frustrating ,No Positive
23133,Pullman London St Pancras,No Negative, It was my mums birthday weekend and the staff were kind enough to give us an upgrade and even a birthday Suprise of macaroons to our room It was a wonderful stay and the hotel staff and facilities were all a big part of that 
23134,Pullman London St Pancras,No Negative, The staff are so very friendly Kate on reception couldn t do enough for us then the person who delivered room service and witnessed my daughter knock over the wine red was soooo lovely that he put my reaction to shame and literally all the that we came into contact with made us feel so welcome and we re all so chatty and friendly Many thanks 
23135,Pullman London St Pancras, We requested early check in 12 00 1 00 but was told before we arrived that it could not be guaranteed and was dependent on availability We arrived at 1 00 and indeed the room was not ready The hotel did hold our luggage but when we came back at 2 00 the room still wasn t ready and we had to wait another 15 minutes Because of this delay we ended up having to cancel plans for 3 00 , The location was great we had easy access to the underground either way we walked Breakfast was wonderful Staff was very helpful

23239,Pullman London St Pancras, We stayed on the 9th floor The room was cold and we couldn t get the room to warm up for the whole night Room service got our order wrong and it was too late to change it The pillows were hard and not of high quality for a 4 star hotel We also booked a classic King room and ended up with a Queen size bed Check in and check out was slow and when we advised of the problem with the heating reception staff commented that they had received a number of complaints about this If this was the case the problem should have been resolved a long time ago Despite being in a convenient location I would hesitate to recommend staying at this hotel The hotel is overly priced , The views were nice the facilities were good and location was a 5 min walk to Kings Cross St 
23240,Pullman London St Pancras, The linens weren t very soft and some of the pillows were rock hard so the beds could have been more comfortable It was a very cold weekend and a bit of chill did seem to get through the window frames The hotel is good value but I prefer the vibe of the Renaissance St Pancras , Traveling with two young children the pullout couch was small but sufficient and I liked how it had a separate space and TV Room was clean and modern Location is great Staff were very friendly and helpful 
23241,Pullman London St Pancras, The thermostat on shower didn t work properly the room thermostat was difficult to get working too Small room where to put suitcase s , Friendly Clean location modern fab breakfast
23242,Pullman London St Pancras, Promise not kept Was told would be able to check in early at 11am when booked over the phone How ever when I got there I was told I had to pay 50 to upgrade the room to check in early, Pleasant staff
23243,Pullman London St Pancras, Pillows were the most hideous I have encountered in years and I travel A LOT They were like rocks overstuffed and hard By the time I tried them it was late at night and too late to wait for replacements , Gym great and breakfast also
23244,Pullman London St Pancras, For the price I do feel that this place is more of an indulgence every once in a while rather than the must stay hotel when you re in London But hey if you have the money why not , Amazing stay Particularly like the lounge near the lifts the floor to ceiling view is spectacular Everything is well thought Breakfast buffet is impressive The stay was actually a birthday surprise for my husband and they did arrange a little surprise for him some macarons with a warm wish from the manager I think Emily I m not usually fussed about toiletries but here the toiletries smell so divine it s worth a mention Can t recommend this place enough especially for special occasions Tips Get down to breakfast early The queue can be quite long later in the morning 
23245,Pullman London St Pancras, The floor in the shower is very slippery We had to ask for a shower mat , excellent and attentive service good breakfast and excellent grill resturant 
23246,Pullman London St Pancras, Aircon did not work 24oC all night instead of 18oC way hotter then outside Windows do open but we were on 1st floor overlooking a main road so very loud and smelled bad I specially asked three times not to have the night manager visit because my son was ill and had finally got to sleep but still they knocked to come in on two occasions after I rang asking for advice on whether there was a way to check or reset the aircon and where the instructions were ,No Positive
23247,Pullman London St Pancras, Having to wait in a queue for breakfast being served a cold coffee The warm breakfast didn t seem to be that varied and the guys at the kitchen didn t seem to be the friendliest so asking for an omelette or some pancakes didn t seem like a good idea , The location the room size the warm welcome by all the staff the modern design of the interior the attention to detail throughout the hotel room and site The guest relations manager even came out to give us a warm welcome and there was some complimentary macaroons in the bedroom and drinks as it was my birthday 
23248,Pullman London St Pancras, Termostat was difficult to figure out It was a chilly night and the airco remained on even after i turned the temperature up to 22 degrees , I loved the bed and the 4 different pillows with various degrees of fluffiness to choose from 
23249,Pullman London St Pancras, They seem to have removed the fresh gluten sugar free options from the breakfast buffet , Excellent free Wifi modern and newly furnished room with plenty of space heating air condition easy to handle 
23250,Pullman London St Pancras, because we were staying in a family group my daughters had to sleep on the sofa bed which was really uncomfortable glad I was in the big comfy bed , excellent location near to train underground stations staff friendly and helpful food lovely 
23251,Pullman London St Pancras, Disappointing how uncomfortable beds pillows are for a hotel of this stature Nicely decorated and sharply appointed is great on the surface but I d prefer a great bed to sleep on, Everyone professional helpful
23252,Pullman London St Pancras, The bed and the pillows were like lying on rock The bathroom was cold and all that grey slate so depressing It was impossible to shower without water flooding over onto the bathroom floor , The welcoming checkin staff The amount of seating in the foyer to relax in 
23253,Pullman London St Pancras, Didn t have breakfast as out of price range but I suppose it was fairly typical for London First key card didn t work and had to go back to reception Asked for replacement bathmat as soaked floor trying out the lower shower but it never was replaced, Bed was massive Rain Shower was utterly glorious View from top floor was amazing Only one bathrobe in room was very quickly rectified Arrived a little before stated time but Room was ready upon arrival Left bags at Hotel upon check out while we went to Matinee in the West End
23254,Pullman London St Pancras, problems with the lifts had to walk down 7 floors to reception do not take a car the car park is actually 15 minute walk away which is a real pain with luggage and rain all for 25 a day beds mattress were worn and dimpled , location was good clean and good condition room 
23255,Pullman London St Pancras, Maybe the price , Super friendly staff very helpful considerate and always taking time to chat with all guests including kids Great breakfast rooms are great for a major city 
23256,Pullman London St Pancras, My room was on the street side and extremely noisy I double checked that the window was shut because of the volume of noise from the traffic below , The location is the biggest factor in my choice The entrance is big wide well lit and I feel safe as a single traveller 
23257,Pullman London St Pancras, Nothing at this price, On Bookings at 165 this was a real treat as that s a big big saving Wouldn t score so highly at 300 not that there is anything wrong it s just 165 meant it was great value Very high quality Inc very comfy bed

23262,Pullman London St Pancras, The only minor negative was that housekeeping came to clean the room very late I had to go and find them at 4pm to find out when they were coming But this was resolved quickly by the team and followed up to make sure that everything was completed properly , The hotel has an excellent location next to the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras so also close to Kings Cross and Euston It s very comfortable and the staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful 
23263,Pullman London St Pancras, I could book 2 rooms with a good discount otherwise I think they are way to expensive A number of restaurant costs were booked on our room which we did not consume After discussion at the desk on checking out these charges were cancelled After almost 2 weeks the 200 pound pre charge 50 pound room night was still reserved on my credit card , Great breakfast Very close to Pancreas station and metro lines Just a short ride to the center of London

23268,Pullman London St Pancras, There was no bath in the bathroom Showers only not suitable for a lady having just had her hair done How about relaxation after a long day out Poor for a hotel of this standing that you have to specify that you want a room with a bath Classic rooms are small and decor is cold Climate control difficult to operate varies from too hot to too cold and very noisy for a modern system Bathroom grim colour scheme , Personal attention at reception 
23269,Pullman London St Pancras, I once stayed at this hotel back to 3 years ago For some reason I got a good memo thus checked in the hotel again with my husband as first stop of our honeymoon Yet I didn t get any impressions this time Wifi signal is bad And I am surprised to find that there is no Chinese option in TV language menu And that is a 3 page menu Breakfast is plain I checked in at weekend for 3 nights when asked the lady in reception for breakfast time she told me as 7 11am So the third day morning when I got to the breakfast area by 1035 the breakfast got closed already And when I asked another hotel staff she said yes for weekend we open until 11am but for weekdays as 1030 And she only said sorry without any other actions Of course I didn t argue either but just left Given I paid over GBP270 per night the price didn t justify the qualify either Not recommend on the basis , Ok hotel with average level of services Location is nearby metro and King cross train station

23271,Pullman London St Pancras, Breakfast was not explained well it was quite a complex setup There s an HDMI port in the room that does not connect to the TV by design and therefore has no purpose There aren t enough lifts for the amount of traffic in the mornings Would be fine if you could use the stairs for lower level rooms but these do not lead to reception Tried to access the gym and my card failed Lift s were too busy to bother going to reception to fix the access card , Great breakfast with lots of options Comfortable and huge bed Quiet despite it s location Amazing view from 16th floor Simple checkout

23275,Pullman London St Pancras, The bed needs replacing Could feel the springs Pillows very hard The room was cold and not a comfortable environment to be in Felt grubby Could not sit on a chair as stained Just not nice Will not stay again Definitely not worth the money , Staff were friendly helpful
23276,Pullman London St Pancras, Got to the hotel and they requested a security deposit of 50 which I wasn t aware of Wasn t advertised at time of booking I had already paid the room fee in full so the long conversation with the manager and numerous phone calls was just all so unessercary in my opinion After about an hour they said your free to go to the room As you re not paying a security deposit you are banned from the hotel bar and restaurant Crazy Never again No mirror in my room either which sucked For the price it was terrible avoid , Nothing 
23277,Pullman London St Pancras, Service in the bar and restaurant was slow at times, Excellent sleep in King size bed and loved the overall interior design location was brilliant and breakfast very good
23278,Pullman London St Pancras, Been questioned with regard to my booking Poor communication between Pullman reservation and booking com Felt embarressed , Cleanliness Good breakfast selection and choice 
23279,Pullman London St Pancras, Worn and plain business room could be anywhere While London hotel rates are quite expensive found this extremely poor value based on the quality and condition of our actual hotel room Our bathroom shower had very poor water pressure making for a less than enjoyable rinse On the floor we stayed there were burned out light fixtures a broken call button for the lift chipped paint and stained carpet Bedding was worn bed quite hard and uncomfortable the ventilation a c lacking and poorly placed inadequate number of electric plug outlets for our iPhones and laptops There are better options in London certainly for the price we paid , Check in and front of house staff provided welcoming friendly and attentive service Lobby and public areas very nice Location in proximity to St Pancras Eurostar service very convenient

23283,Pullman London St Pancras, Parking is not possible in this hotel and was recommended to park at another rental Parking lot available at Ibis Hotel nearby which took 30 minutes by car in a horrible traffic Jam Dragging carriers to and from the Rental Parking Lot remains bad memory which screw my travel up , Clean rooms and Breakfast
23284,Pullman London St Pancras, Small matter but no information folder in the room so I didn t know what no to phone for housekeeping and other services if required and I wasn t aware of gym facilities until last day Guess there is an assumption that you have checked this out on the Internet , Staff amazing and very helpful Room lovely and the breakfast fabulous 
23285,Pullman London St Pancras, This review would have been a 10 except for one only one waitress at breakfast time who seemed a little harried and lacked patience , Lovely rooms really excellent breakfasts super friendly and helpful staff Location was good too close to a major underground and rail station 
23286,Pullman London St Pancras, The bed in 921 was awful I awoke with back pain and had a very disturbed night The mattress compressed down when you sat on it We run our own lettings business and firmly believe you should never give your tenants or clients anything to sleep on that you wouldn t sleep on your self I reported this at reception , Friendly staff rspecialky the rxcellent Kait in reception and design of hotel
23287,Pullman London St Pancras, No real negatives about the stay one observation was that even though the mini bar had limited content it was not free with the stay If I were paying full price for the room I would have expected it to be free , We had a free upgrade to a Deluxe Room very spacious and comfortable As we used the underground during our trip it was an ideal location for the tube from either St Pancras or Euston Station

23294,Pullman London St Pancras, Breakfast brioche was dry the bacon over cooked plus no crockery available bowls and no staff to ask for a while It was very busy Once staff were located they put it right , Bathroom was super and clean plus shower was powerful 
23295,Pullman London St Pancras, This seems fairly standard in hotels but the disabled room had a bath rather than a walk in shower Although the bath was low and had grab rails my wife cannot use baths and had to stand in it to take a shower and there are no grab rails provided for that activity Consequently I had to support her whilst she washed Some hotels provide a shower seat so she can sit down whilst washing in these circumstances The transfer in and out of a bath is extremely hazardous for someone with mobility problems especially when the floor is wet , Bed very comfortable Wide choice of food at breakfast with decent tasting sausages Proximity to transport hubs such as the underground at St Pancras and the bus network Only a 1 3 mile from Euston You can leave your bags at checkout giving some freedom to go out and about when you ve checked out 
23296,Pullman London St Pancras, After too much travel delays instead of getting in the hotel at 8pm we arrived at 12 30 am Unfortunately for us we are extremely tired and the receptionist on duty was taking his sweet time checking us in and trying to print the parking instruction He was unsympathetic But the following I was ready to argue with anybody who will give a bad service but everybody were professional friendly and efficient so to sum it up it was a brilliant stay, I love the decor and ambience in the lounge The location was excellent Good room and bed size clean and comfortable pillows Quite

23303,Pullman London St Pancras, The service is standard but not hospital enough I plan to leave the luggage in the hotel for several days but the hotel cannot keep it overnight except that I have new reservation The British are so realistic The German Pullman is much better , The room fee is fair

23306,Pullman London St Pancras, It was hard to adjust the cooling The hot breakfast was too much like the other buffets Room service meals not extensive enough , The courtesy and efficiency with my issues 
23307,Pullman London St Pancras, The a c was not working well There was a clug in the shower The pillow cover in the closet smelled sweat The scramble eggs during breakfast were awful, The location
23308,Pullman London St Pancras, having to put my own top sheet on when i requested for a change Also the plumbing was out when we arrived home from a dinner function at the savoy so we were unable to shower until the next morning, Hotel was well appointed but gaining access to our room was a dilemma due to the fact my partner arrived before me and she had to use her cc instead of the one they had on record that i booked with and then i was charged along with her CC for the night i was not there and she was

23313,Pullman London St Pancras, Breakfast felt very chaotic Definitely need more staff to cater to the huge number of guests in what I can only describe as a mega hotel I was quite disappointed by the service and lack of attention to detail Defiantly need more catering staff over weekends, Location staff
23314,Pullman London St Pancras, Very expensive for what it offers The rooms are extremely small so comfort is affected , The staff is very friendly always willing to help you Location is excellent 
23315,Pullman London St Pancras, If you like soft pillows don t stay here as the pillows are like sleeping on a rock , A nice hotel next to St Pancras Stn so ideal for Eurostar Very friendly staff and a good breakfast in the morning

23318,Pullman London St Pancras, The drinks service in the reception area lounge drives me mad I always have to go and find a member of staff and then have to go and remind someone as the drinks rarely arrive This happens at least once every visit and I generally have 3 4 meetings per day in the hotel , The staff interactions are always exceptionally professionally at the Reception Desk and in the Breakfast Room
23319,Pullman London St Pancras, Maybe the bathroom could be a bit bigger but this is London so space is precious , Best hotel in London I never go anywhere else now when I m there Awesome personnel delicious restaurant great breakfast comfortable rooms and a great smell throughout the hotel just like in Vegas 
23320,Pullman London St Pancras, Very strong artificial fragrance in the corridor perhaps more ventilation is required Should make available at least two down pillows in every room and make sure that sufficient number of bathrobes and slippers are provided before checked in the guests Had been requesting for upper floor rooms for two successive years but to no avail hope to have better luck next time , I stayed here at almost the same time last year and although I didn t get an upgrade to a suite as I had before the experience was still very satisfying The room was spacious and clean and staff were friendly and helpful really appreciated their effort in obtaining down pillows when only one was found in the wardrobe and even after the reception told us that they had run out of supply Convenient location good breakfast ample copies of newspapers and magazines all pluses and will think of returning next year 
23321,Pullman London St Pancras, Lack of a bit of privacy with the way in which the restaurant tables are set up , I normally never dine in the hotel I am staying in and so was pleasantly surprised by the excellent food I had on both the nights I stayed at this hotel 
23322,Pullman London St Pancras, The lifts were a problem at busy times There was no other way of getting down to the ground floor and very long waits to be able to get down Frustrating when you are on a low floor and could have gone down the stairs in seconds , Great central location The room was very quiet considering we overlooked a main road Didn t hear the traffic at all Beds were comfortable and a good sized room Breakfast was just amazing 
23323,Pullman London St Pancras, The restaurant service left me disappointed both evening and morning service We were left waiting for order to be taken for bar food and I eventually had to ask to be served Wasn t much better the following morning the table wasn t set and I had to ask for a cup and then cutlery Definitely not well organised The food however was lovely , The room was amazing and had this best shower I ve been in

23330,Pullman London St Pancras, Not really anything to dislike except perhaps dining bar facilities were a little noisy and no restaurant lunch options for Sat Sun If you want intimate private dining you will have to look elsewhere Didn t like the pork sausages at breakfast which is a shame as I like my breakfast sausages , Excellent location with great accessibility from three Mainline Stations especially when travelling with luggage Very easy 5min walking access to three tube stations to get just about anywhere in zones 1 and 2 Great cleanliness upper room views and reasonable comfort and price Decent and varied breakfast

23333,Pullman London St Pancras,No Negative, The attentiveness of the staff when I had made a special request was really something else I was leaving for 3 months so I asked them to just do a simple request for when I came into the room with my boyfriend Instead they called me up and asked me what he liked ended up making delicious brownies for us Absolutely amazing what they did for us Its quite simply put that the Pullman is one of the rare hotels that really cares for its customers 
23334,Pullman London St Pancras, Check in took nearly 20 mins because the auto check in was not working and reception seemed to take a long time with the people in front of me In the evening 2 out of the 3 lifts were not working 1 in maintenance and 1 broken down given there are 15 floors or so it took forever to get a lift going up , Very convenient for Shaw Theatre and for northern rail stations We had a bedroom at the back and it was very quiet for a central London hotel Bed was very comfortable the bathroom was very clean and well appointed but overall the room was a little austere I think the hotel has recently been refurbished because everywhere was very clean and well maintained Breakfast at 20GBP seemed expensive but there was an amazing choice of good quality food so you just had to tuck in to get value for money and you could take time over your meal too The staff were very polite attentive and helpful

23453,Pullman London St Pancras, We booked two rooms with one for 3 people The rooms were only set up for two and we had to ask both for the additional bedding and towels separately I would have expected this to have been in place since it was clear from the booking This is a minor gripe which was very quickly remedied without question on request , Great location with excellent rooms and breakfast 
23454,Pullman London St Pancras, Breakfast seemed expensive for what was offered though I didn t eat there so can t comment on the quality, Location for travellers to Euston is excellent
23455,Pullman London St Pancras, Lots of noise when went to bed on the first night Some special occasion which didn t finish until 11 30pm This wasn t special since I had to be up early for work and I was on the first floor above the function room in question Could have been advised to take a higher floor level but wasn t Next night no problems and bliss full sleep from 11pm onwards , The whole ambiance from the time you enter the building great service here opening doors when I was kitted out with baggage to the check in with the helpful friendly staff The room was as good and even better than I expected Everyone on the team was great 
23456,Pullman London St Pancras, If turning the rain showers in full swing water cannot drains out efficiently Staff in the restaurant were very busy and always forgot what I have ordered Room service menu is a bit too much for me I prefer something light when I feel hungry at night And not much choice for a vegetarian Sign post on Euston Road is not obvious we missed it twice , The corner room was big and I appreciated the room has self adjusting air conditioner Bathing water runs very well

23459,Pullman London St Pancras, The room cost 285 and had no window At no point during the booking process was I told this When I complained to the staff they said I should have asked if I wanted a window as some of the rooms at this price have windows I said I generally assume that for 285 a room comes with a window and I should not need to ask for one I should be told if a room does not have a window during the booking process like I am with the low cost hotel providers in the city A bad start to a family holiday Utterly disgraceful hotel and staff giving my favourite city a bad name Travel to London but avoid this hotel , The location was convenient for the Eurostar
23460,Pullman London St Pancras, Sluggish service in bar and at dinner table in evening also we had a bottle of champagne sent to our room as a gift from friends no note was attached so we did not know who it was from our friend had to phone the hotel a few times to try to sort this out the message card was sent to the room later that day ,No Positive

23464,Pullman London St Pancras, Check out we confirmed our booking was prepaid and we had not run a bar bill etc the night before our early departure When we handed the keys back we were told we owed for the second night receptionist clueless and caused stressful early morning delay, Location for onward trip from Kings Cross station
23465,Pullman London St Pancras, My sister had a disappointing experience with one of the receptionist when she asked assistance to mail out a postcard The receptionist abruptly told her they can t and don t do that service and advised my sister to proceed to the station across the hotel it was already 6pm at that time When my sister mentioned that from her experiences in her multiple stay at Pullman Hotel in Hong Kong her request to mail out letter and even packages were accepted with courtesy and she always pay for the postage fee The manager gentleman who was passing through at that moment heard my sister s comment and he quickly took the postcard and very nicely offered to mail it for her without charge Now that s the kind of courtesy service we expect from a Pullman Hotel the lady receptionist should attend more seminars to correct her poor manners The beds were a bit too soft , We were a big group and some got rooms bigger than others so there was a mixed reviews The breakfast is very good everyone liked it Some of the staffs in the reception were friendlier and helpful than others
23466,Pullman London St Pancras, Nothing , We had a room upgrade as requested at time of booking which was lovely as we had fabulous views The hotel was quiet and the smell Throughout was gorgeous staff very friendly and helpful excellent location
23467,Pullman London St Pancras, The sound proofing between rooms is bad We were woke up by the noisy toilet and chatting sound of next door early in the morning The service for breakfast is very poor There was long queue of guest waiting for at least 5 10 min which is unacceptable for 4 5 stars hotel There are a lot of tables reserved but the guest did not turn up for 30 min We asked for tea and juice and need to remind it again after 10 min ,No Positive

23470,Pullman London St Pancras, Pillows were awful very uncomfortable and the bar service at the table was very poor we waited for 10 minutes for our second drink and then 15 minutes to order a third which we never received and ending up cancelling the order this situation was not caused by a shortage of staff just extremely poor customer service, Location
23471,Pullman London St Pancras, Room was small, Bar area really plush but room was small cramped and nothing special No bath shower ok Tea coffee facilities average Full price for our room was 450 and you wouldn t want to swing a cat it would hit all 4 walls 
23472,Pullman London St Pancras, We didnt like the fact that there was a 50 fee as soon as we got there which we didnt know about and we didnt know what it was for either Also didnt like how almost everything was aditional charge We were too worried to have tea coffee water or use the tv facilities incase we were charged extra for this , Loved the setting of the hotel and where it was based so quick and easy to get around hotel was beautiful and room was amazing the staff were really friendly and the free wifi was a bonus 
23473,Pullman London St Pancras, I think it s a great location for getting around the city via the tube but it s not in the heart of downtown London which they don t claim to be just stating a fact , The staff was incredible from the moment we walked through the door to the moment we walked out The room was very spacious and comfortable Wifi was excellent and the breakfast was a vast spread of both hot and cold delights The steak at the Golden Arrow the hotel restaurant is also one the best filet mignon I ve had in the UK The hotel manager was a delight she went out of her way to make our stay extra special 
23474,Pullman London St Pancras, The hotel does not have a clear stairway case At a busy morning when all elevators are in use this was quite annoying , Very quiet in rooms with good beds and internet connection pay per view movies Some pubs accross the street but underground few minutes walking connecting to a lot of different lines Loved the breakfast with a large variety of food and treats 
23475,Pullman London St Pancras, Nothing really , Great location for eurostar and attractions in London as so close to Kings Cross station Staff were great especially Elaine who sent some macaroons up to us which was a lovely touch 
23476,Pullman London St Pancras, The toaster It was replaced on the last day of our visit The limited menu for dinner we actually ate out because of the limitations, The size of the room The location of the room 9th floor The range of the breakfast
23477,Pullman London St Pancras, Due to expected power checking and it made the whole building s tap water hot water supply were out of order Some room s power also were cut off and elevators either Elevators and tap water were back to work till 11pm but hot water was till 6am in the second day Staffs services to this problem also poor , Excellent location and cleanliness

23487,Pullman London St Pancras, High price for drinks and food available in the restaurant Although I would very happily stay here again would not eat or drink in the restaurant , Very helpful friendly staff High standard of cleanliness Great selection at the buffet breakfast
