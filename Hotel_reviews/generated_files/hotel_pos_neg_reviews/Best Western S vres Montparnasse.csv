61456,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Small lift, Beautiful room although small had everything we needed and very comfortable The man at reception could not help us enough he made our stay perfect if only we could have stayed longer Thank you 
61457,Best Western S vres Montparnasse,No Negative, Excellent metro acccessible location Clean comfortable great value for price The staff was super friendly and the breakfast was excellent highly recommend 
61458,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, We reserve for 4 twin beds What we got were 2 twin beds and 2 cots with barely enough space to move around , The breakfast is good for the price they charge The croissant is tasty 
61459,Best Western S vres Montparnasse,No Negative, Hotel is a reasonable small 3 star hotel Standard rooms do have a japanese size but are clean and ok Second pillow is available Breakfast is fully OK incl bacon and eggs Not far from Metro station Japanese restaurant next to the hotel was brilliant with great food and a nice price The bar LE 150 in opposit to the hotel offers a cheap beer for only 3 50 where you have to pay 7 to 8 in the hot spots Not to much to see around However we started our walks directly from the hotel 
61460,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Dark dingy rooms corridors breakfast smells spreading upstairs to 2nd floor Dining room disgusting breakfast prepared in side kitchen in full view of diners kitchen manned by 1 person kitchen units looked broken and not cleaned for years room safe broken a very low budget hotel that is totally different to the website description and not cheap either , Nothing
61461,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The rooms are very small and the a c doesn t work so well in the rooms Other than that we were happy with the hotel , The hotel was clean and the rooms have been updated The staff were extremely friendly and helpful The metro station is very close which made access to the attractions so easy Would definitely stay here again 
61462,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, everything i like the place small but nice the breakfast even i m asian but i enjoyed very much, very nice when i was there everything was very comfortable for me
61463,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The guy at the reception didn t even care to stand up from his chair to welcome us just handed us the key The reception itself is the simplest desk I ve seen in a Best Western hotel , Very close to Montparnasse train station few steps away from many restaurants especially many with Asian food Rooms are quite spacious for Paris standards and continental breakfast is of very good quality We liked the bathtub and the speaker on the bathroom that allowed you to listen the TV We were lucky to have a view to Les Invalides and a glimpse of the Eiffel tower 
61464,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, WIFI had to be reconnected each time you wanted to use the web seems unnecessary much better to have the log in remain in place for the duration of your stay , Good location away from the hustle bustle 
61465,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, That the breakfast wasn t included Otherwise I will give it a 10 , Well located accommodation close to the metro lines and walking distance to Jardin du Luxemburg Good restaurants nearby Quiet street Excellent costumer service 
61466,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The size of room and corridors, The hotel is clean and well equiped The rooms are small like probably in many hotels in Paris but when we moved a bed to a wall it was much more space for 2 people living there The personel was very nice and helpful Tasty breakfast with a decent choice of products meals Hotel in a close distance to Montparnasse station and even closer to another metro station Close to a few restaurants and shops 
61467,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The pending operation in my credit card Not a pre authorization but a non confirmed operation that leaves an open possibility for future charge and double count , Beds are comfortable
61468,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The bed was not comfortable The hotel is located above the metro lines so you can feel the building trembling when trains are circulating I was finally attributed the room at the ground floor with the view on the street the same one I was offered when arriving early in the morning could not check in before 3 00 p m which I said I din t wan t because of the noise the room is at the entry of the hotel and surrounded by lavatories with windows on the street The breakfast is correct except the fried eggs which are awful , The staff is nice Well located next to Orly shuttle station It s a correct hotel for a quick one night stay or for really tiny budgets 
61469,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Breakfast space quite small Only 4 5 tables , Very quick and efficient checkin and checkout Small room but with all possible facilities Very comfortable bed Quiet and good WiFi 
61470,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The hotel is really small breakfast is average the rooms are very small, Everything is average receptionanist is very helpful they are really nice
61471,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The design of the room meant it felt very cramped The shower also had a corner cut out of it which made it feel extra small Free tea coffee should have been provided, The location was excellent as we had to take the TGV from Gare Montparnasse the next day There are a lot of shops and restaurants in the area The room was fairly newly and attractively renovated was comfortable and had good wifi The hot water jug and mugs were great An easy and pleasant walk to Jardin du Luxembourg and the Montparnasse Cemetery both well worth a visit 
61472,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The only thing I can complain it s about the distance between the hotel and Montparnasse station , The bed is very comfortable everything it s very clean and the bathroom was above of my expectations The guy works at front desk it was very nice and helpful 
61473,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The shower screen inadequate causing mild flooding of bathroom floor , Easy to find good location central and close to public transport Not overly commercialised tourist district yet handily placed for all attractions and amenities 
61474,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, 1 The receptionists are not professionals One day before the checkout I have asked the night shift receptionist to proceed with the payment for the reservation The told me that the payment has been taken through booking website At the time of checkout the morning shift receptionist told me that the payment has not been done yet He refused to contact booking com to make sure He kept insisting on paying the reservation regardless to what I told him Then he has been trying to join the night shift receptionist by telephone Finally the night shift receptionist had responded He claimed that it was a pre authorisation He did not apologise about this mistake I think that the night shift receptionist was not in wood to work so he had fabricated the story of the payment The funny thing is the morning shift receptionist kept saying it is not the problem of the receptionist he did not apologise about the behaviour of his colleague and he refused to give his family name I asked to join the manager he also refused 2 There was no place in the hotel to leave the bagages for a coupel of hours after the checkout because the available room to keep the lagauges was full of covers and blankets 3 The receptionists do not give a damn to whom enter the hotel even at night time So it does not seem secured , The bed was comfortable The room is clean There is a coffee bar 
61475,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Maid stole 20 from my wallet because I was nervous when I get out from elevator and saw all her cleaning equipments messy at narrow hall I was here 5 years ago and I will never come back ,No Positive
61476,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Was told it s a non smoking hotel but soon as I entered the room it was covered in cigarette smoke which had imbedded into the beds not recommended for family with children s,No Positive
61477,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The elevator was too old and stairs are too tight May be a better decoration in the reception and in restaurant In general nothing really discosting, The kindness and serviability of the staff was really great and extraordinary
61478,Best Western S vres Montparnasse,No Negative, The bed was big and very comfortable the room was small but cozy new furniture and bathroom which is not easy to find in Paris The Montparnasse underground station is very close to the hotel 2 min walking 
61479,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, I originally confused this with the BW Montparnasse which is closer to the station but this is only a short walk further on, We had both a kettle and fridge Good selection of both hot and cold items for breakfast
61480,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Expensive optional breakfast and room was a bit too small , Really wonderful location in Montparnasse The airport orly shuttle left us very close 6 minute walk to the hotel From there you have two subway stations close by to get to know all of Paris but seriously when in Paris try to walk as much as possible Besides that staff was friendly and helpful 
61481,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The shower does tend to get most of the bathroom wet so be careful , Comfortable room in an excellent location both for the metro and the main line station Outstanding value for money for Paris
61482,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The wifi was a little difficult always logging in Also had water issues on out carpet In room had no idea where it came from Smoking in hallways and other rooms And taking a shower completely socked the bathroom floor, We loved the staff and location 
61483,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Only one english TV channel if u need it , Small but cozy hotel Small room bathroom with walk in shower but sufficient for a sleep or to have a short rest Breakfast exceeded in terms of different options avaiable in really small available area Really kind helpfull Hote stuff Location near metro 300m max 
61484,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The bed could be a bit softer , Nice little hotel in a convenient location walking distance from Montparnasse and Rue de Rennes The room was small but felt cozy They were kind enough to lend me a US FR converter so that I could charge my computer 
61485,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Bedroom space is small the feeling of having a big furnitures for such a small space Towels are only fluffy the first day Breakfast was 9 not bad but not the best , The reception guys are the happiest people I ve seen in the hotel They re very helpful as well The hotel is 10 mins walking distance to the Montparnasse train station which is nice if you worry about traffic in Paris One thing I love is their bathroom and bathtub its clean and its brown earth color of the walls give a comfort feel 
61486,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, the metro station was far away from the one mention in the booking com instead of that exist enother metro station nearest When we arrive we had to carry the laggagies until the next metro station When eating breakfast i didn t like to see the cupboards in the kitchen and smell kitchen liquids The kitchen door shoulded me closed ,No Positive
61487,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The room was a bit small and the bathroom tiny The location is a bit far from anywhere a tourist would want to be , I wanted air conditioning and I got it It was 36C outside and 20C in my room The staff were fabulous all spoke English and were very friendly and helpful I didn t have breakfast but it looked good The bathroom was very neat and well appointed There was a small refrigerator which I appreciated on such a hot day There is also tea and coffee kit and a bottle of water The bed was comfortable and the room I had was silent I liked the WiFi too 
61488,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Even if we asked for one double bed we still received two beds put together and they were not secured to each other so my bed was shifting along One of the two rooms that we had was very small and the bath was just a shower incorporated in the room , The location is good as it is close to the Metro so you get easy access to all of Paris The hotel is nice and cosy and the stuff were great We had two rooms at the top level one big and one small The bigger room was nice and clean and everything was working properly The breakfast was good and at a good price 10 Euros person day 
61489,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The double room was extremely small and it smelled like an ashtray Also when we told this to the front desk we got no reaction from them They should ve offered to change the room clean it better or some type of compensation , Triple room was better clean and spacious enough 
61490,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Every moment when we stayed in this hotel was perfect except that we found our room half open when we went black one night Probably it was the housekeeper that forgot to close the door tight Nothing lost luckily The receptionist immediately promised they would check the camera though , Comfortable bed thoughtfully designed room helpful and friendly staff good location wonderful breakfast 
61491,Best Western S vres Montparnasse,No Negative, It s really a nice hotel and the location it just 3 minutes walk from the metro station The area is quiet The price is really awesome Staffs are nice too
61492,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The hotel was a teeny bit far from any metro station , The room was very clean sheets and towels were changed everyday Staff were very friendly and accommodating too 
61493,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, It s far away from attraction Elevator enough for one only All hotel is three floor Small roam for one person Don t recommend for families ,No Positive
61494,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Minus points for us where the neighbourhood close to metro but not a very nice area to walk to the hotel in the evening The breakfast enough variety for French standards but croissants where stale Every day That s a pity in France there are so many bakery s with freshly baked croissants every day , The bed is fantastic rooms and bathrooms are tidy and clean Devices to make coffee and tea are there Rooms are small but cosy and noise from outside stays outside Service from the host very good and friendly speaks English and helps with maps and advice 
61495,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The bathroom was small Being a bigger woman I kept knocking the hair dryer off the wall , The breakfast was GREAT There are two employees that were fantastic and helpful and remembered our names One was Ray and the gentleman worked in the evening 
61496,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The rooms are quite on the small size but cosy , The location is very good mainly because you are near to 2 different Metro Stations for 2 different routes through the city so everything is very accessible second i would like to mention the Kyobashi Japanese restaurant next to the hotel here one can serve lunch at resonable prices about 25Euros 2Pers with alot of appetizers and salat included plus home made ice tea the food is very tasty and there is a quiet and calm atmosphere all this after being disappointed by the over priced 25 Euros for a breakfast of 2 Croissants a marmalade bread and 2 Coffees and mostly over priced French brasserie type of Paris restaurants 
61497,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Staff didn t seem to know much about Paris Metro or general information, The staff was nice the rooms were small but the house keeping staff was excellent The breakfast was good 
61498,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The room was very small and tight but given the location and it is summertime the price was good , They had my room ready when I arrived at 9 30am from Australia What a bonus A hot shower and a snooze before hitting the streets of Paris The room was very quiet and had all I needed including a kettle to make a cup of tea 
61499,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Wished I had booked a longer stay , Staff were all amazing very helpful as I don t speak French location central and plenty bars restaurants close by Eiffel Tower within walking distance around 10 15mins walk hotel clean 
61500,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The guys at the front desk offered their taxi service which was cheaper He was only trying to help But he forgot to mention i was not going to be the only occupant so we had to drive round paris to pick 4 other people before heading to the airport , nice and helpful staff hotel was clean bathroom was lovely
61501,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Our room was the smallest I have ever stayed in Basically a single room with a smallish double bed Very noisy from the kitchen early in the morning And the smell from breakfast although tantalising wasn t welcome at 7am , Room Was clean and staff friendly
61502,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, WiFi signal was not strong enough to reach to 3rd floor room could only use by visiting the lobby , I wasn t feeling well and the front desk person gave me some chamomile tea bags which was very thoughtful
61503,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Before my stay I called hotel and explained them that I need wifi for working They confirmed free wifi in all aera but it was very poor Wifi only facebook can work It was impossible for me to work from my room All restaurants near the hotel have normal wifi ,No Positive
61504,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Breakfast and common hotell area , Location near the nice area of Montpernasse and Metro Walking distance to the Eiffel tower evan with kids of age 8 and 13 Very nice and helpful staff And you have to love the weird stair 
61505,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, This is not the place to stay in Paris for any reason We got a room not in the building but in the back yard right next to the cleaning storage very noisy Plus the room was way to small You have no space beside the bed to walk around if you have 2 lagguages you can place them anywhere the bathroom was as small as not possible imagine you can t wash your teeth not to hit your arms at least 5 times to the wall The carpet was ugly dirty and smells like sh t we check out a day earlier , The guys at the reception were very kind
61506,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The rooms were a little small , The reception staff were extremely helpful They even helped us with sorting out our transfer back to the airport for a reduced cost The location was also perfect and close to metro stations 
61507,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, This hotel is an absolute no go Not only are the rooms incomprehensibly small for a 4 hotel but at 8 in the morning we were awoken by construction work strong high pitch drilling noise not on 1 side of the room but on 2 sides It was such a strong drilling noise that I recorded it I can make it available to whomever wants it Impossible to sleep to work or basically to stay in the room I called the reception and the guy there told me in a very impolite way that it wasn t his fault and when told that it was not correct to rent such a room he answered that he wasn t supposed to know about the construction work and that I could complain to whomever I wanted it wouldn t change the problem After investigation quickly it appeared that it wasn t the first day of the said construction work So they basically rented the room to us knowingly At a high rate , The place was clean 
61508,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Shower water overflowed out of shower The work men s noise in the hotel from 8 15am And also in the afternoon , Bed comfy Breakfast too expensive Bathroom really small 
61509,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The single large bed was in fact two beds with a cover on top very uncomfortable Also the smell in the lobby is quite bad During one night the staff member was sleeping on a couch and I had to wake him up twice to get out and in again 10 minutes later ,No Positive
61510,Best Western S vres Montparnasse,No Negative, Stuff is very friendly They speak several languages and very helpful Access to several underground stations line 12 not to mention just 7 10 min walk to Gare Montparnasse Careforre is just next door Elevator worked perfectly well that helped a lot with my huge suitcase Room is clean is just what you need for 3 4 nights stay
61511,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Nothing, This hotel is just a hidden gem so close to the metro 4 stops from the convention centre the hotel is very clean and the staff where excellent with great knowledge of the area and advice 
61512,Best Western S vres Montparnasse,No Negative, Hotel compact with comfortable clean room within easy reach of the metro making getting around the city easy Good choice for breakfast and plenty of eateries within walking distance for the evening Reception staff always very polite and helpful 
61513,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, We needed 2 bottles of water and got them from the receptionist for 3 Euro per piece Expensive little bottle Only 2 English television channels CNN and a sports channel , Location is good metro connections too Breakfast is good Beds are gooood Service Tea and coffee facility in the room Restaurants in the street Parking on the street across the hotel
61514,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, It s better wait for smart offer Full price is not objective , Perfect location quite quarter near 2 metro station line 6 and 12 big comfortable bed great staff lot of restaurants near hotel Hotel offers trsnsport to airport for the same price like bus company 
61515,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, noisy in a ground floor rooms you can hear a metro going every 2 minutes and little bit vibrations the room was very small for two people , good location the hotel located between three metro stations it is very convenient to choose one of them there are a lot of restaurants in this area a shopping mall and a supermarket there is a tea coffee facilities in a room 
61516,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Room is really small and double bed as well Internet connection was with the disconnection I would say the hotel is 3 stars with small then 4 , The location is really good 
61517,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The rooms were quite noisy could hear both street noise but also I could hear people in the rooms next to us and the cleaners in the morning , The staff were very friendly and helpful 
61518,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, I stayed 3 nights and I don t think my bedsheets were changed That put me off No room service fell a bit ill and had to come downstairs to get water And no view, Staff were quite friendly helpful and could speak English The hotel wasn t shabby at all 
61519,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The Hotel charged my card twice and I m still waiting on a refund and when I tried to explain this to the night porter when we were checking out he was very rude and kept raising his voice over me Very disappointing after an otherwise very welcoming and helpful staff , Most of the staff were very friendly and really made us feel welcome particularly excellent with my little boy 
61520,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Very small room and bathroom I could almost not get into the shower Breakfast is below the level of a 4 star hotel The service entrance atmosphere has nothing to do with a 4 star hotel ,No Positive
61521,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, View from room not great as we were right against another wall Hardly a deal breaker though everything else was good , 20 min walk to Eiffel Tower make sure you don t get lost though like we did Quiet area but not far from hustle and bustle Staff great very welcoming friendly and excellent English Lovely boulangerie just up the road Good curry house and Italian restaurant very nearby All very quiet Mon to Wed 
61522,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Besides the man who did my check in the others don t look very qualified I asked if was possible to do the check out after 12h and the answer was yes till 13h At 12h the same guy called to the room and just said Check out please Smells to sewer near the elevator and the bathroom has a annoying fan always spinning which was disturber during the night Definitely not a 4star hotel max 3, The location it s ok not for from Montparnasse and a area with lots of restaurantes and stores 
61523,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, It always annoyes me to arrive at a hotel and find that I have been mis lead This hotels boasts 4 and a half stars It is a 2 star hotel even by Paris standards The room was barely 9sq metres The chair could not be pulled out without hitting the bed The bed and pillows had the comfort of an autopsy table Everything about this hotel is dark cramped and depressing For nearly AU300 a night I had the right to expect much more We got out as soon as possible thanks to booking com and found a beautiful 3 star hotel in the theatre district The contrast was startling If you want to ruin your stay in Paris this place is for you otherwise keep looking , The staff we courteous and understanding The only redeeming feature
61524,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, We arrived in the evening having booked a double bed and bath but were offered a very small room with no bath The night staff were not helpful , The day manager was most helpful Moving us into an appropriate room reflecting our booking He greeted us warmly on entry and departure every day and guided us as needed The hotel is situated near the metro and reasonably located to all major tourist places 
61525,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Rooms much to small Elevator extra slow and small Receptionist remained talking with a friend for about 7 8mn before daring talking to me while I was Just checking in Not acceptable Does not deserve 4 , Location ok not too far from Montparnasse station 
61526,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Rooms 101 104 are part of an annexe at the back of hotel not ideal location and some are smaller than standard rooms Rumbles from underground beneath , Excellent friendly staff Good location Good breakfast
61527,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The room is very bad and too small the house keeper didn t refill the shampoo and etc Overall not nice hotel for leisure It s only for one person business traveler because in the middle of Paris, Only nice staff
61528,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, This should be a 3 star hotel not a 4 star the rooms were fairly basic and ours wasn t that clean e g it had cobwebs on the air conditioning vent I wouldn t mind the accommodation being more basic if this was reflected in the price but I d paid 4 star prices for a sub standard experience, The staff were friendly and helpful especially the guy manning the desk on the evening night shift 
61529,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, The bin was not cleared from previous travellers when we arrived , Good location right next to Montparnasse tower good noise isolation from the street traffic quite spacious room for Paris friendly staff 
61530,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Small room however with a fridge table wardrobe etc , Not far from the metro Also within reachable distance within 30 40 minutes from Eiffel tower Louvre etc suites for a good walk 
61531,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, Wifi was a struggle, Chose this hotel to be close th railway station Easy 5 minute walk plus close to 2 metro lines Reception staff were brilliant with good English and had an exceptional meal at French cafe on other side of the road Room was good and spacious
61532,Best Western S vres Montparnasse,No Negative, The very helpful staff especially the man on the front desk during the day He just was so knowledgeable and went out of his way to please The bed was very comfortable and rooms adequate Close to everything We really enjoyed our stay

61534,Best Western S vres Montparnasse,No Negative, Really well looked after all questions answered whether it was to ask where to go for food what tube station to go to ordered a really good professional taxi for us to go to the airport and even organised for us to have Euro Disney tickets ordered
61535,Best Western S vres Montparnasse, We ordered a double bed we got two separate beds which were sliding apart from each other For a couple that wants to spend its second honeymoon that is a real killer One of us occasionally dropped inbetween the two beds onto the floor View was not that cool were stirring at a wall from another house where we were facing kitchen and bathroom Windows including all the sounds The worst thing about this place was the breakfast First morning we went down and the first thing I spotted was dirty forks and knives I thought ok I m gonna take a tissue and clean it myself because all of the forks and knives located in a basket were dirty Plates were dirty too all of them But finally and that was the reason that made us leave were the cups prepared on the table dirty crusts from hot chocolate crusts from old coffee really awful Short excuse from the guy at the counter that s it WiFi slow bad coverage sometimes outages, Placed near the center of Paris nice place helpful staff
