394184,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Staff was not so communicative Answers to our questions were not so clear It looked like the staff was not in their mood But it can t be said about the security staff they were really nice and much more communicative than the staff at the reception , In general hotel is good Nice and rich breakfast Security was very nice and friendly smiley Good location some 15 minutes from the beach 
394185,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Saturday the had a big party Super lourd with thecno music till 11pm Not good for me , Great breakfast Great spa Room was great Close to metro Taxis not expensif for downtown 
394186,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites,No Negative, The hotel was really clean and the bed was really comfortable Staff was amazing and helpful so we will definitely come back Make sure to check out Yelp for great options for breakfast and dinner 
394187,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The speed of wi fi is ridiculously slow I had to use my mobile phone as a hot spot to give wi fi to The lap top Also the location of the bath is awkward The speed of wi fi is unacceptable , I like the night time time as it is quiet around the hotel when sleeping in the night I like the bed as it is very spacious I like spa It is really amazing 
394188,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, We stayed on the 5th floor and the wifi signal was weak and often lost connection, Extremely spacious and comfortable room excellent bathrooms and lovely views of the city from the 5th floor Conveniently located near public transport stops restaurants bars and night clubs 30 minute walk to the beach the Gothic quarter Raval and many other attractions The breakfast is excellent and there is a 3 course dinner the menu changes every night in the hotel for 18 which is of superb quality
394189,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The short brunette female staff member who dealt with my check in was straight off the bat abrupt and rude from the get go To describe her there is another lady that looks almost identical to her at reception She constantly looks pissed off too Every country I have been to you reserve and pay at check out and I found it quite bizarre that this is the first booking com hotel where I had to pay at check in That s fine but I did not find it pleasant how the staff member repeated sir you have to pay now multiple times and then say on booking com it says you have to pay at check in No It does not I looked in your hotel s Terms and Conditions and it mentions that there is a 25 deposit and that I will have to show my passport with a credit card on arrival for ID No pay at check in on booking com To top all of that off she gave me NO information about the hotel whatsoever She gave me the card for my room as well as my receipt and that was it I didn t know what time the breakfast started or ended I had to come back and ask I didn t know anything at all about the SPA which btw you have to pay 15 per day to use She charged my card without asking me This is where the argument arose from She did not make me feel welcome whatsoever And from reading comments left by various others the female members of staff are really rude in this s place and they don t make you feel welcome It s a shame because it s relatively well situated with taxis just outside and a metro 5 minutes away And it s very stylish The wi fi however is shockingly bad in all areas of the hotel You can just about connect yourself to Facebook Right across the street there is a nightclub which will play loud bassy music until 6am in the morning so for a family maybe this isn t the best option But the soundproofing is very good It s just the bass , The room was very spacious modern with good Aircon and a lovely walk in bathroom Metro is 5 minutes away and taxis are just outside Breakfast is nice with fresh food constantly rotated Room service were very polite and efficient
394190,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, suppose to have double bed since it was ordered during booking however there was two single bed combination but this combination was not secured with a kind of shield a o etc so the bed was terrible for our room I asked to reception and they fix it with bed shield for one night next day was same as before there was two single bed when we arrived to room poor service and mis arrangement on reservation page there was a information about baby bed crimb which can be asked to reception we did it there was a baby bed however hotel charge an extra cost for this baby bed which was not mentioned on reservation page ,No Positive
394191,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Little really they could do about the view It would have been helpful to say which tube exit was the better one for when arriving as I ended up going round in circles Breakfast seemed expensive and I skipped it for that reason I didn t do much research into so possible it was competitive with similar hotels Tea coffee making facilities in rooms would have been a bonus , had requested a double bed but it was twin beds pushed together however it was extremely comfortable so was happy to stay put Staff were friendly and approachable on check in and if I needed anything further Everything was very clean and tidy nice products provided for the bathroom 
394192,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The check out could have been later We had a flight in the evening so would be great to check out around 3 pm instead of noon , The breakfast was very good and you had many options Love that the hotel also had a swimming pool so you could relax after a day in the city or at the beach before going out for dinner Det rooms was grat as well overall a very good stay in Barcelona Only 5 10 min with metro to Catalunya The hotel had also a good AC and a fridg to cool down the drinks we bough Would visit again 
394193,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The disco nearby party On the roof outside is terrible Too much noise for people haring a room at the pool side Party starts at midnight till 5 o clock in the mornin , The spa
394194,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, If I could be very critical and say the lunch food but it was still good There wasn t any faults really , I liked everything about this hotel Staff were really friendly and helpful Bed was very comfy room was very clean Bathroom was very clean Hotel was modern throughout Free safe and also use of facilities like an iron or locker room Food and drink was good too No fault at all with this hotel definitely recommended 
394195,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, There were not enough ashtrays or trash cans by the pool so there were melted gum on the floor by the pool , Both beach and city in walking distance Clean and comfortable hotel with big rooms 
394196,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Breakfast was boring everyday the same nothing new or changed for 12 days Wi fi is poor in hotel room , Localization is good not far from metro bus shopping centre Quite near to beach Hotel is clean outdoor pool also Great rooms with bathroom at the entrance separated with glass from the bedroom 
394197,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Cabs worked out very dear for our trip there is a metro close I believe but we did not use it and spent about 150E on cab journeys to from the parties round the city for Off Sonar Airport cab was 25E but they made us pay 39E minimum charge The hotel arranged a cab back for us for 35E Room You immediately walk in to the bathroom The wardrobe bath sink toilet and shower are all as you walk in We traveled as 2 friends and this was rather strange as doors were glass so you could see them bathing etc Maid did not top up the toilet roll in 5 days Some clean towels were stained with what looked like nail polish 1 of our dirty towels was not changed for a while Terrible long thin pillows Only 1 plug socket on 1 side of the bed and not mine Area Very limited facilities near by Beach 15 minute walk Could be difficult to get a taxi from this poston most days Hardly anywhere to walk for food just cafe style baguette places really Poor quality mini marts I would suggest walking 15 10 minutes over to El Poblenou as there was a vast variety of food and shops in this area Walk to La Ramblas area took us a fair while but was doable , Rooms Mini bar fridge in room Safe in the room Hair dryer in the room Rooms appeared to be almost sound proof Good wifi pool area also Ask for a pool or cathedral view We looked on to a petrol station Comfy bed AC didn t seem to adjust it was either stifling in the room or very cold at night We stayed here for Off Sonar The hotel at this time has parties daily from 2 11 DO NOT BOOK IF YOU DON T WANT TO PARTY AT THIS TIME We loved it but was there to party 
394198,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Tea bags and bottles of water in room on arrival but not replenished on a daily basis On our last afternoon evening the pool area was closed for a music event that went on until 11 00p m No notice of this was given and the sound reverberated throughout the hotel and we were informed this event was on for three days so we were glad to be leaving when we did The surrounding area needs improving but ideal if you want to stay somewhere quieter , Spacious room and comfortable bed An enjoyable breakfast with a wide selection available A short distance to the beach and close to metro station 
394199,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, This hotel is a spa hotel a place to have a peaceful getaway they had a full blown rave for all three nights I stayed which means I was not allowed to use all falsities I feel I should have been told before booking this was not expected or exceptable, 15 minute walk from the beach
394200,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, So far so good Maybe need more varieties with breakfast, The location is good very convenient to bus stop metro station There is taxi stop just in front of the hotel also The hotel is not far from the city center also near the beachThe staff are very helpful
394201,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Unprofessional staff They are never available when you need them they don t speak English and some of them are rude Also no coffee machine in the rooms , Nice swimming pool indoors and outdoors 
394202,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Staff for the spa can be very moody and do give off a bad vibe Spa should be included in the hotel price as it s not very big most saunas and steam rooms were off Unsure what we paid for , Excellent for staff excellent guests nice room cool looking toilets excellent taxi access bar outside Can t go wrong
394203,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The check in at 3 pm it s too late but you have to leave at 12 o clock so you lose 3 hours we lost our day because we could not have a room to rest woke up at 4 am All the hotels i ve been the check in is at 12 o clock you come at 12 o clock you leave at 12 o clock it s logical check in check out must be the same time At the departure we must leave the hotel at 7 am because we had a flight to take I ask to have breakfast 15 minutes earlier to make sure we can eat without rush and stress they did nothing to facilitate things other thing you have to pay the water in room all of the hotels you should not water must be offered , The room was clean breakfast perfect 
394204,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Hotel guess still have to pay 15 euros a day each to just use spa pool etc and if you come out even for lunch you have to repay again to go back inside works out very expensive, Really nice staff and hotel is close to the lovely Beach about a 15 min walk and also the train station is very near for going into Las Ramblas city center 10 single train tickets only 10 euros 
394205,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites,No Negative, The bed was very comfy slept like a log Staff really helpful and friendly The room had everything you needed apart from coffee tea making facilities

394207,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The fitness center didn t open up until 10 AM Got access through the dressing room area though Limited equipment in the fitness room Both bicycles needed maintenance , Nice room good wifi pleasant pool lounge area
394208,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, We booked this hotel as the most reasonable with a pool It was a very good standard and the pool was great but overall compared to similar hotels I think it was a bit pricey Location was not ideal but a short walk to metro stations and about 20 minute walk to the beach , The staff were very friendly and courteous they made our stay most enjoyable The service and facilities room and pool area were great Requested a quiet room and slept like a baby no street or guest noice at all 
394209,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The bathroom shower room floors were extremely slippy and when I asked if they had a bath mat or something similar they were not able to help There were also no handles or supports and as I have mobility problems this did make it difficult and not safe to use I had let them know before my visit There was a menu that was part of the package as well as a hotel menu Both were given to us on both nights I was disappointed with the selection on the first night and asked to change to the main menu but was told quite abruptly that I couldn t The waiter seemed a bit over powering , The room was spacious and well equiped and the bathroom shower large There was an inviting pool but we didn t have time to try that nor the Spa The receptionists were friendly The restaurant was small but adequate 
394210,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Break fast I m vegetarian nd they have only cakes cheez and bread only nd we already told them about this and main thing is 7 days with same buffet Horrible, Orange juice

394212,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, No Tea coffee facilities in room, Excellent hotel that caters for everyone Rooms clean beds very comfortable As it says nothing to complain about 
394213,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, I asked for a room with Internet working well since it was my business trip I sent inquiries 3 times for this Noone never replied So once I checked in i realised that they gave me room at the very end of the corridor without WiFi connection at all After my claim they changed the room but it doesn t work much more better but finally i had WiFi in the room bathroom Building to be refurbished in very near future The rooms especially Rooms very small To some rooms you are not entering to the hall but to the bathroom directly, Perfect location Near to 2 metro stations Badell and Marina 15 min walking to the beach around 30 min walking to city center Bari Gotic Nice and quite area Someone left feedback about the very soft mattresses on the bed Indeed they are very soft and it is quite unconfortable to lay down and watch TV or doing some other activities but I slept well on it Rooms on higher floors have view on Sacrada Familia
394214,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Location out of town and area felt a bit unsafe had to get the metro to get to the attractions Indoor pool costs extra and outdoor pool very small Drinks very expensive Hotel somewhat impersonal , Breakfast good Staff Silvia and Joseph nice and helpful Lovely bathroom and shower Bed comfy 
394215,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The food at the restaurant was not very good dinner lunch , Breakfast was VERY good and the beds were also heavenly Location was also very good quiet neighbourhood and very easy to get to the centrum or the beach metro closeby 
394216,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The coffee was never hot enough and not very good from machines the hot food at breakfast repetitive and boring dry DEAD tasteless cereal no baked beans or fried eggs not worth the 14 euros extra every day Lovely spa facilities which included an indoor swimming pool with amazing massage water jets but very annoying that it cost 14 euros extra to use each day Lovely hotel but overpriced , The wholemeal bread rolls were lovely and fresh every day our rooms were clean and roomy the beds were spacious had lovely soft mattress toppers excellent walk in showers with plenty of towels a lockable safe and minibar in room the evening set meal we had one day was excellent freshly cooked and good value for money 18 euros Free wifi we were each upgraded to an extra living room space attached with another tv 3 phones in the apartment including a handy one in the bathroom Near bogatelle and marina metro stations so very easy to get anywhere Indoor and outdoor pools 
394217,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, i did book room for 3 nights i with i did not use tow night went back to get my room for the 3rd night they did not have my room saved for me with they did charge me for i did contact booking com and told them that I m not using my room those tow nights i paid but i will be there for 3rd night but they still didn t have room for me , everything except staff 
394218,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The staff was OK could be a bit more pleasant but nothing serious , Very nice rooms convenient location and great breakfast great variety and great tastes Though we did not try the Spa it looked very nice 
394219,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Management have ruined what would have been a great stay The booking was in my friends name for 55 Euros and already paid I arrived first and they asked for a credit card I said what for They replied holding and mini bar So I gave them my card next thing I know a few days later I have been charged the full room rate of 82 Euros I am now in the process of fixing this Because of this I cannot reccomend this hotel and I highly recommend AVOID EUROSTARS chain , Good location good breakfast AMAZING Italian restaurant across the road 
394220,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites,No Negative, The rooms are clean and tidy Staff always helping out Breakfast was excellent and worth every penny Staff like Yolanda always willing to assist and help Front desk staff Bertha and Jordi know almost anything you may need to know Excellent
394221,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Indoor pool is paid extra Beds were too soft , Excellent choice for breakfast dinners no so much It s 15 min walk to the beach to Segrada Familia an to the old town but the neighborhood is a little shady 
394222,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, I called for toothpaste and waited for 30 mins then I called again was given towels instead of toothpaste wait another 15 mins then got the things I wanted Housekeeping didn t renew the amenities and no cattle and coffee tea was given Also they left a cleaning towel at the bath tub , Bed is very comfy and walking distance to the metro 
394223,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites,No Negative, Bathroom with both bath tub and a separate shower rainfall bed was very comfortable Located in a quiet area but walking distance to busier areas Staff were extremely helpful 
394224,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The spa was expensive compared to the quality seen better days a bit old and not very well cared for would have been OK if it were free for hotel guests but on payment was quite disappointing , The beds were nice and comfy the room functional albeit a bit small Very hot during the night For a quiet room ask for the pool side instead of the street very quiet Breakfast was nice staff friendly and available to answer all kinds of questions Outside pool are was also nice 
394225,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The hotel is overpriced and we definitely did not get our money s worth As a former spa therapist who previously worked in a four star spa it was by no means up to four star standards We were charged for an item from the mini bar that we did not consume we did not realise this until we left for the airport to go home I thought this act was greedy as we already had spent a substantial amount from staying at the hotel The food is very mediocre and portion sizes are minimal The vast majority of staff were the biggest let down as in my opinion friendly staff play a vital role in an enjoyable stay Even down to asking staff for directions they were unhelpful and we were lucky to get a greeting from them at times We did not enjoy our stay purely because of the fact we did not feel comfortable staying there as we felt very unwelcome All in all I would not revisit this hotel and I would definitely not recommend it , The bed was comfortable and the room was spotless 
394226,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, There was no step on the shower cabinet door so water always came to the bathroom floor had to put down towels and wipe the floor after showering Toilet flushed lazily Breakfast was on the expensive side Television had some zoom mode on which was unable to change or the device itself was of poor quality , Breakfast was comprehensive but coffee was available only from coffee automat no coffee ready in pot Staff was friendly and available Two different line metro stations within walking distance Conveniences available across the intersection at the gas station Room was kept clean Location was peaceful Taxis were always available in front although did not use them Lobby was nice and there was service to the lobby tables 
394227,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The Spa was all booked for few days ahead so it was not possible to sign up for any treatment at all Staff at the spa reception almost did not speak any English and was quite rude and not helpful Terrible food at the room service microwave cooked frozen pizza for about 12eur was the only option available when I checked in around 23 pm , Room was clean and comfy Wifi worked well in the room and by the pool area
394228,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Where do I begin When I booked the hotel on booking Com I didn t see that the hotel adds room tax to your room in ADDITION to what you have already paid and this is charged to your room on checkout The language barrier is an issue if you don t speak English as the staff behind reception and the spa staff were rude The restaurant food was terrible and apart from the spinach starter everything else was disgusting Our group paid in cash for the dinner and the waiter still added the price of the food to the bill Barcelona is overpriced in general and when our group went to pacha they charged things on the bill that we didn t have so make sure to check the bill The area is also a little noisy and the decor outside of the hotel is poor The hotel is also in a poor location I would recommend staying in catalunya as it is a better area and is near the shops and cathedral , The spinach and boats cheese starter was delicious It s more of a main meal than a starter 
394229,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Difficulty printing on their computer After fussing with it for several minutes and several staff watching one man finally came over to assist Location not great Seedy area , The queen size bed was very comfortable
394230,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The fact the hotel has taken money because their systems were down that was not our problem it is their error not ours Also location was a bad area with a noisy night club behind , Avoid this hotel they charged our card for things we did not have and also over charged us when a deposit was paid I will now never book through booking com and also advise my friends and family to do the same I am very disappointed at this 
394231,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Not great window views but you don t go to Barcelona to sit stare out of your room window , OMG the breakfast Wonderful selection Room was well equipped the layout was different Walking distance to city centre lovely parks 
394232,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Because of the hotel policy rooms didn t have air conditioning so the temperature was unberable Bathtube was yellow from dirt , Hotel was close to metro station 
394233,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The outside area a bit dingy but convenient for taxi , I found the room fine bathroom good and bed was comfy Do not eat breakfast so cannot comment but found coffee good 
394234,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The biggest disappointment was the housekeeping sadly it was very poor It is the little things like topping up the tea making facilities in the room and ensuring there were clean cups would have been nice as well as a fresh bottle of water You aren t provided with any coffee or milk either Sadly the drinking glasses were not changed for the week we were there until I asked or washed them myself There is no other restaurants or areas of interest in the local area of the hotel , The room had a small sitting area plus a separate bedroom which worked well The bed was very comfortable There was good choices for breakfast in the restaurant The hotel is located within a short walking distance to the Metro which is the cheapest and quickest way to get around The reception staff were very helpful and welcoming 
394235,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Spa staff cordial but generally unfriendly somewhat apathetic and assertively authoritative especially about rushing everyone out by 9pm closing Also the spa pool always seemed murky and looked like it needed a cleaning and the hot tubs were generally lukewarm Cleaning staff very nice but sometimes over looked things All considered THE PROS DEFINITELY OUTWEIGH THE CONS HERE I look forward to returning Try to include a visit to Sitges a lovely beach town on the Mediterranean during your visit to Barcelona , Spa was wonderful Used it every day Desk staff were all geat Spa suites were like little apartments I felt like I was coming home at the end of every day Bed and pillows amazingly comfortable 
394236,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Booking com listing hotel as the A C is available however it wasn t available because Barcelona at the moment is on winter time Despite the fact that it was in middle of March and it was up to 28 degrees outside Moreover to use the pool not the SPA facilities you need to pay EUR 15 00 per day per person this is just ridiculous Also the room basically wasn t the cleanest one which I ve seen Loads of dust and dirt in the corners My friends had to swap the room because originally they ve been given room which wasn t serviced after previous customer later in other room they also have found somebodies hair in the bed , Extremely helpful and friendly staff on reception They re doing a great job 
394237,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, No kettle in room to make your own tea Belina who worked in Spa was not helpful in fact she was awkward made us wait ages to open our lockers then told us to hurry up as it was closing in 10 mins , Room very comfy and shower was very good The Spa was great 
394238,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Only one English tv channel Needs coffee making facilities in room No maid service to our room we had to ask for fresh towels to be brought up for our last morning, Very comfortable bed
394239,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, There was no air conditioning in the room The only pool available to use was the small outside one it cost 15 p p to use the inside pool , The room was very modern and comfortable Only a few stops on the metro to the centre of Barcelona 
394240,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The indoor pool was quite dirty The room was also very warm in March not sure if it was just our room but we had to keep the window open most of the time, Really nice hotel the room was very nice modern and clean Staff were excellent Also close to the beach and metro stations
394241,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Staff were ordinary Bellboys were lasy Toiletteries were replacing very poor Spa staff were not helping and not good temper , Breakfast was very good Room drsign was good Hotel was quiet Spa facilities was good
394242,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Absence of an iron at the room , Good location not far from the centre cleanness comfort excellent soundproofing and friendly staff I will come back next year 
394243,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, No tea or coffe making facilities in our room There was a 5 euro charge for using room service Hotel is a good distance from the city and beach Our view from room was was into an old office building , The bed was comfortable
394244,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Possibly only gripes were there wasn t tea facilities in the rooms and guests didn t enjoy use of the pool etc included in the price , Everything basically from arrival to departure everything was perfect 
394245,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Breakfast was a bit pricey and drinks Bed was a little on the hard side , Lovely room with bath and shower complimentary toiletries replenished daily mini bar quite reasonably priced
394246,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Service at bar poor Poor gym No restaurants around the hotel , Nice bed clean room Location is good if you are comfortable using public transformation 
394247,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The Wifi was very bad during day time and till 11pm I could not do any work using it so I had to use my own mobile as a hotspot Thogh a scale is provided to weigh the luggage I have to drop coins into it , The room had everything needed for a business traveller Room was cleaned on daily basis and the reception spoke good English It was located walking distant to my client I was to visit It was close to Glories and Sagrada 
394248,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Location wasn t that great It was close enough to the major park but would recommend staying somewhere closer to the marina where there is better restaurants and activities , Hotel had nice spa 
394249,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Restaurant s food was not very good and fresh Also staff from the restaurant was not organised , Room was excellent Hotel was brilliant receptionist was really helpful 
394250,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The rest of the hotel did not match the room at all The food was really horrible and the spa although a good sauna was not that great As well as this the gym was pretty pathetic The location I reckon would be perfect in summer as it s so easy to get to the beach and not at all far to get into the centre The only downfall was that there isn t anything in the area to do we had to always travel to have drinks and food , The room the suite was perfect Really comfortable and a perfect size The bathroom was big and had a double sink which was beneficial when needing to get ready at the same time The bathroom had a standing shower rainfall hand held and also a bath tube with a shower so again good for getting ready together Very clean and the room was Defo a 4 star standard The staff were lovely especially the receptionist Sylvia she was so helpful 
394251,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Warning Not a family friendly hotel There are several clubs that are very loud at night We even changed sides of the hotel and rooms since we were up from 1 30am 6am with the club base vibrating up the walls On the street side it s also very loud and we ended up checking out early The hotel is not near any of the scenic city stops , The property has a spa
394252,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Food in the main restaurant wasn t a great standard I ordered a steak and the waitress didn t ask how I would best like it cooked Staff didn t speak a great deal of fluent English which made our experience of the tourist attractions rather poor The location and surroundings were rather run down which was a real shame as the hotel was really nice and modern , Great hotel facilities were fab Room was very comfortable and clean 
394253,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Nothing The only down side was that we didn t stay longer, Very comfortable beds lovely suite and fantastic restaurant Staff were very friendly and helpful
394254,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites,No Negative, Excellently location right next to Sala Razzamatazz which was the focus of my trip Served also by two adjacent metro stations Marina Bogatell which enable access to Barcelona s extensive underground public travel network The rooms are spacious and modern in style open plan bathing facilities separate bath shower and lavatory Possibly not for the shyer guests sharing a room but if you re totally comfortable with your partner it won t be a problem Breakfast is buffet style with an excellent choice of fare You can also enjoy Bucks Fizz to start your day if that s your thing This is my 2nd stay in this hotel it won t be my last 
394255,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, not central in quite a quiet area Should include a kettle in the room, top class hotel clean and quiet Room has mini bar 10 minutes walk to the beach 15 minutes walk to the clubs taxi would cost around 6euros for the clubs in Villa Olimpica and the the centre like Placa Catalunia around 10euros
394256,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The location there was nothing really close by But there was a taxi rank opposite the hotel and the metro was near , Very friendly staff amazing room facilities swimming pool spa was out of this world very clean hotel would stay there again

394264,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, bed was sooooo soft no real bathroom and toilet everything was in one room devided just by glass wall no privacy weekend nights was really noisy although we had to keep the window open because it was really hot, breakfast was prefect although we paid for it extra it was worth it really close to metro station Marina and Bagatell stuff was really nice
394265,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The females at the front desk seemed very passive almost rude Was not very welcoming and not very helpful when i had questions I have not had this experience anywhere else in Barcelona They seemed to only speak Catalan not very much Spanish and next to nothing English The rooms were very hot The first room I was in had a clogged sink and would have a random puddle of water from an unknown source The second room was nice but still very hot I had to keep the windows open at night to cool down the room yes i have adjusted the thermostat in the room I did not have a good experience staying here and would not recommend it to anyone , The spa is very nice and very good 
394266,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The only real bad point was the open bathroom concept Very odd and kind of uncomfortable especially for friends travelling together But we made do , Great location AMAZING breakfast Friendly staff Large room and extra comfortable beds 
394267,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, 4 Star hotel but no desk no table no space to put even down a toothbrush in the none existing bathroom the sink was just next to the entrance door no real bathroom the toilet and shower was in the same room divided by a small slider so you could always look into the toilet shower from the room no privacy, Cosy bed
394268,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, What was a good location for me as I was here to attend a gig at Razzmatazz may not be so good for others this is an industrial part of town with a lot of noise in the streets late at nights as clubs open close Also I was out of the room from 9am until 2pm with a please clean my room sign displayed but this didn t happen even though housekeeping were in the room next door as I left , Comfortable and clean room with power shower and loads of toiletries Ask for a room on a higher floor if you need quiet Wifi worked well I didn t use the spa facilities but the breakfast buffet is one of the best I have ever attended and was great value 
394269,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, We didnt like the loud music emanating from the night club nearby Apparantly according to other reviewers we could have asked for a room overlooking the street which is very quiet We didnt find this out until our return We overlooked the pool , We stayed here for a week and we were very happy with our room which was very comfortable and lovely to come back to relax in after a day exploring Barcelona The location was good in as much as the metro was nearby so we had no problem getting out and about A very nice stay 
394270,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The location was fine in terms of 10 mins walk to the beach or very close to metro stations The only downside is the actual area it s more of a small business area for car repairs warehousing etc There are better touristy areas but overall within walking distance to more lively places and the beach , Lovely hotel comfy room spa leisure area are really nice 
394271,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The heater was turned off even though the temperature dropped in the night time They did not have any quilt and only available thin blankets Bath was mentioned in the descriptions however it was only shower when we arrived in the room ,No Positive
394272,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Area was more industrial that tourist but we knew this before travelling and it was a short walk to metro and Poble nou Also a 10 minute walk to sea front where there were lots of tapas bars and pubs , Spa was excellent at hotel facilities were really good we had a suit and complimentary spa it was excellent value Area was good for access for metro

394274,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The speed of internet was low If you are travelling from North America take an electric conventor for the electric plugs b c hotel do not have enough of them , The bed was very comfortable the breakfast was great 
394275,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Rooms are small and tight The bed was a little too soft The location is not near the tourist area so prepare to use the metro or walk many places , The staff was very helpful with any question The breakfast was amazing 
394276,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Having paid EUR140 a night you would imagine a nice hotel but it is not room relatively new but already with tired furniture not fresh curtains small TV staff not friendly at all they claim location to be in the center but you need to walk good 30 40 mins to the main sites ,No Positive
394277,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Not within walking distance from the city Located in a very quiet residential area Foul smell from outside the hotel seems to be penetrating into the lobby hallways the use of air freshener is recommended Uninvited guest LARGE COCKROACH was found in the room, Located within proximity of Metro station taxis readily available Breakfast service is excellent 
394278,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The food was really bad and always cold The waiters weren t professional at all and rude At the reception nobody cared to make us confortable Housekeeping it wasn t housekeeping at all Cause the room was dirty all the time ,No Positive
394279,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Customer service is pretty poor We arrived at the hotel in a taxi with our little daughter asleep and I was unloading the luggage from the taxi The concierge looking at us as i was bringing in the luggage to the reception desk but did not offer to help with the luggage until the last bag was left We asked for a change of sheets as we arrived and we had to spread the sheets ourselves without the service from the hotel staff We booked a double room but were given a twin room Next morning when we complained the room was changed but nobody came to help us with the shift Thankfully the two room were on the same floor Many other instances including being charged 5 euros room service charge for just ordering a glass of milk for our little daughter Also the guy at the bar did not look pleased to give us more milk , Breakfast was wholesome Location is good in terms of proximity to a beach 25min walk 
394280,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, We chose to eat dinner in the hotel 2 nights The second night the waiter was rude grumpy and very unobliging The food was not of great standard We ate elsewhere for the rest of our trip , Location was great Rooms were comfortable and clean And change of towels every day
394281,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, They took deposit with out asking I made booking through booking com and should be pay when we get there but they taken money out on my account never know until I get there , Breakfast was excellent
394282,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Very handy to find as close to bogatell metro Also near Marina metro but I think if I was to go back to Barcelona I d stay closer to the centre Didn t find the area that intimidating but maybe a bit run down and a lot of homeless people about, Breakfast was amazing Huge selection of pretty much everything available Room was very comfortable and shower was decent Staff very friendly helpful Location close to beach and the centre isn t too far away Can t comment on the sauna pool gym as didn t use them but they looked the part
394283,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Dinner serving staff had a rather abrupt manner , Inside the hotel is bright and modern The outside however is in an area which looks run down and industrial Surprising though that we felt safe walking around after dark and saw many women alone so the Area is safe enough The hotel is a few minutes walk to the beach front which did not bother us The hotel breakfast was the best we have had in a hotel of this type 
394284,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The only thing that would make me not re book would be to get a hotel slightly more central But we used taxis every day and it was only 5 euros to el born , Great breakfast and very comfy bed the staff were friendly easygoing but efficient 
394285,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The hotel and all the facilities are great but the location leaves a lot to be desired The area seems to be a fairly run down part of Barcelona with lots of poor quality graffiti and poorly maintained buildings Some of the graffiti around Barcelona is very artistic and appears to be encouraged There were a couple of bar restaurants very close to the hotel but sitting outside them in the evening was challenging due to the fairly frequent waft from the drainage The view from hotel windows is either in to the hotel garden pool area which is fine or at ugly buildings if you face the other way Our view was of the petrol station and taxi rank which didn t really bother us because we spent most of our time out and about with our friends , The hotel is modern clean and well maintained The staff are friendly and welcoming and we were upgraded from a double room to a suite FOC on arrival The breakfast spread is excellent frequently replenished and fresh Fairly short walk to the Bogatell Metro Station from which you can easily access the whole metro network with a few changes between lines 
394286,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, We were a group of 6 couples spending 40 a round of drinks We had an issue with a bar tender that decided it was ok to serve our group 7 half pints of froth and charge us full price When asked to fill them up he told us that was how they were poured in Barcelona I complained to the manager but nothing was done So after spending over 250 in the bar we moved to the tavern across the road and spent 300 or so to a more deserving bar I complained again on Saturday morning and was told that no one or nothing could be done until Monday when the GM was back in We spent the rest of our weekend eating and drinking out in the surrounding Taverna s spending around 500 each time so your loss , The visit started of great we were upgraded to a suite and the reception staff were fantastic
394287,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, We new it wasn t i the center so no problem as we wanted a location near the beach but not much around for the evening , Lovely hotel clean quiet great facilities 
394288,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Hotel was advertised as a spa aswell but this comes at an extra cost like I could just pay for any spa in the city with that way of thinking , Room had a separate living area and was very clean and modern
394289,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Only internet connection is not great I am not had any internet at all , Everything is just perfect to stay and enjoy your yourself Near by the beach lovely Restaurants and Tapas Bar Friendly welcome and a staff is great The rooms is very comfortable

394291,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The hairdryers were not great I have long thick hair and there seemed only to be one person in the restaurant and one in the bar and sometimes service was slow but they were working hard and it wasn t their fault , The facilities were excellent and comfort was brilliant
394292,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Use of the Spa is subject to additional charge 15 euro day This was not made clear at the time of booking The shuttle service Pick N Go recommended by the hotel never showed up as arranged to pick me from the airport I waited over an hour I had paid them prior to my arrival The hotel staff were not prepared to help me recover my money even though they recommended the firm Pick N Go ignored my emails asking for an explanation and refund I had to go through PayPal to make them issue a refund Room service is poor used towels were left in the bathtub and sink not cleaned I asked the cleaners not to bother coming in after that , Good breakfast range but was identical everyday The rooms and bathroom are well kitted and clean on arrival 
394293,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Location was the only thing we could find wrong with this hotel we were quite away from the centre of things A little street noise during the night when clubs bars etc closed , The outdoor area was a great place to relax The room was lovely very unusual bathroom but superbly finished All staff were very friendly and helpful 
394294,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites,No Negative, The staff were brilliant very welcoming and very helpful the food was great great location The spa was excellent also I would stay at this hotel again 
394295,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The room was very small for 2 people It took 3 days before we were given a 2nd chair The aircondition did not work properly Even at the lowest setting we had to get up during the night to turn it off completely , The Breakfast was excellent The facilities in the hotel were very good The location to beach and city was very good
394296,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The lounge was located by the reception and was rather like sitting in a goldfish bowl as the front of the hotel was entirely of glass The set of white leather chairs were a bit off putting Not good for sitting and relaxing This modern hotel is located in a rather run down semi industrial looking area and it is quite a walk to the beach , breakfast was plentiful and wholesome Nice restaurant Pleasant pool area Helpful staff
394297,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Gymnasium was not very well kitted out with apparatus a rowing machine would be a useful addition , Excellent all round hotel ideal location good facilities very helpful staff nice breakfast selection and comfortable bed 
394298,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Smoking in parallel rooms came through the air con system into our room, The beds were extremely comfy shower and bathroom facilities enjoyable Safe that you set the passcode to to ensure valuables are safe 
394299,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Trouble every morning when I tried to pay for breakfast Made me feel like a burden instead of a guest Wifi was not reliable but worked better after they tried to fix it , Standard quality nice rooms Not located in the center but in a neighborhood with caf s and cosy places to discover About 15 min walk from the beach 
394300,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The reception guy needed my identity card at the checkin and he did not gave it back to me Then my identity card laid there for two days at the reception and nobody tried to contact me about that not even at the checkout I had a lot of trouble while boarding a flight to Madrid After arriving there I had to go to the german embassy for getting a temporary identity card which I needed for travelling back to Germany two days later The hotline of the hotel was a mess After 30 minutes and countless talks to different peoples all were unfriendly and everybody knows nothing it was confirmed that my identity card is still there After some additional mails they told me that they will send it to my home address for about 30 In the meantime it arrives at home For me it s simply bad service and unbelievable Of course I could have remember myself within the two days of my stay at the hotel But hey it laid at their reception and everybody should see it and nevertheless nobody contacted me If I didn t remember that my identity card is there at the reception it would be there until world s end They did nothing to give it back to me the phone guys are unfriendly and incompetent and there were not one word of a apology It s a nice hotel but avoid contact with the service people and don t except help with problems ,No Positive
394301,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Croissants were poor and hot eggs were never hot lukewarm at best and the Spanish omelettes were closer to cold , Bed etc very comfy Hotel was spotlessly clean and the staff were very pleasant at all times 2 mins from metro helped a lot Breakfast was good but see comments re heat of food
394302,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The location was very poor the beach was very dirty the hotel restaurant menu was very basic and over priced for what it was, The staff were great The hotel itself was very clean the rooms were fab
394303,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The girls I was with didnt like the area at night it is a bit like lots of warehouses industrial I thought it was fine There was aways taxis out the front , Awedome facilities
394304,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, We reserved for two persons yet we only got one toothbrush The shower didn t stop dripping for minutes after we finished showering Front desk staff could have been friendlier we didn t even get a Goodbye an I hope you enjoyed or stay or such , We stayed for 4 nights and we liked the price for value the design of the hotel as well as the pool facilities The breakfast was abundant and they had typical Spanish food as well The connection to public transport is convenient and the room was clean every day The area is a bit industrial compared to the other touristic districts but you can get used to it and you ll probably not spend much time there anyway The district is very chilled and silent you mostly see locals which can be nice after getting out of the busy streets of the center There are taxis parking in front of the hotel all the time which is quite convenient 
394305,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, WiFi connection could have been better but that s all , The atmosphere was great The hotel is beautiful and has everything that you need Very cosy and modern Friendly staff and the roomservice was good also 
394306,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, We paid for the double room but were given a single room instead The pictures description size nothing matched what we booked After spending a night on a tiny bed we went to the reception listened to the lamest excuses I d ever heard and were finally offered the room we initally paid for which was actually quite good ,No Positive
394307,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, On the day we arrived the hotel had for some reason arranged a pool party with loud music to be heard throughout the day and all evening in the entire hotel and in the rooms Extremely annoying for guests seeking relaxation and quiet ,No Positive
394308,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Big letdown is that night club nearby somewhere Sound of bass can slightly be heard some days of the week Nothing insane but stil I dont blame the hotel for that of course Dry outdoors toilet cabins adjacent to swimming pool are below what I would expect fromm such lovely 4 star hotel Come on guys seriously P, Very stylish hotel all round Very clean hotel and staff are truly nice Matrasses are really good 
394309,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, This Hotel rent out bed for 25 euro per night u can imagine the people u can meet in lobby personal from pakistan very not friendly the area really not safety pakistan morocco getto ,No Positive
394310,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, the bar service by the pool was very slow i had to retrurn several time to get served when the staff were clearly available , the rooms were very nice and clean as was the pool area 
394311,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Room was very warm at night we were certain air con was not working as it should our friends room was ice cold in comparison We explained to reception and reply was simply that its been tested and is working other advice was to simply swap with my friends room completely ignoring the inconvenience this would cause our friends No offer of swapping rooms In generally all staff at reception not great attitude wise on our entire trip only 1 member of staff said have a nice day Outdoor swimming pool VERY small especially as in pics it looks big Not worth 450 overall , Hotel quite nice and clean bathroom nice excellent spa Staff in bar very nice and helpful

394314,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites,No Negative, Breakfast hotel room drinks at the swimming pool atmosphere itself and very close to subway station Bogatell Just some marketing advice If you sell drinks at the pool bar always combine them with something that makes you more thirsty Like peanuts or chips Customers will drink more 
394315,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites,No Negative, The hotel is absolutely beautiful Just got back after staying for 4 nights The staff were friendly and very professional Planning to go back with children
394316,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Poor service for such price We checked out early and left our bags in luggage room Before going to airport asked for a shower and while shower is free you have to pay even for towels , Nice clean rooms and quite good breakfast 
394317,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, That the restaurant couldn t offer a three year old just ham cured meats which was available each breakfast which made it unappealing to go again as a family , The pool was great
394318,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, We just had one small problem when we were having difficulty getting our transport to the airport organised online by ourselves We thought it would be straightforward for staff to contact our company and organise in Spanish but we couldn t get this done One of the reasons given for this was that it would be against the interests of the taxi drivers across the road We thought that was strange , Breakfast was excellent Great variety of food My partner loved the Prosecco too The en suite was modern and roomy Walk in shower was appreciated It was easy for two to get ready at the same time There was a modern feeling about the room and the air con was very efficient We found we could walk to the beach the Ramblas and the Sagrada in 15 minutes but the metro station was also conveniently close by The pool area was clean and relaxing and we also enjoyed using our complimentary passes for the spa We were particularly warmly welcomed at reception when we arrived and this gave us a good feeling about the hotel We really liked the hotel and would go there in future 
394319,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Small swimming pool area most of time crowded Neighborhood of the hotel not really nice Staff not always nice with guests, Close to Olympic port 10 minutes by foot and city center of barcelona through metropolitan 
394320,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Everything is bad about tbis hotel very bad exprince don t waste your money on this hotel You get your tawals filled with hair very disgusting hotel located in a very bad industrial area , Nothing about this hotel is good staff are very rude there only one female Moroccon waiter that is very nice and very professional the rest is very rude 
394321,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, I can t really say anything I didn t like Maybe if you keep the card next to your phone it stops Working but honestly can t fault the place Also you have to pay extra for the indoor pool It s extra and part of the spa So always use outside one even though that s not a big issue as was so hot and we wanted to be outside, The hotel was great it was 10 15 mins walk from main beach and main clubs but was perfect the staff was amazing There was a guy on reception small bold guy I don t remember his name very helpful
394322,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Internet connection part of the time overloaded and really slow Staff tried to get me to sign a bill where I was charged in my home currency instead of EUR at a really bad exchange rate Aircon in room erratic the temperature setting had no relation to reality Drain in shower didn t work properly had to take out the thingie that stops larger items from going down the drain for there not to be a flood , Nice pool area Good breakfast Reasonably close to communication Rooms were clean Rooms still fresh and new Well suited for teenagers and adults would not stay with small children 
394323,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, No tea and coffee facility in room Surrounding area a bit depressed and covered in graffiti which makes it feel a bit more intimidating than it really is as when you walk around it s a very friendly area with lots of small friendly bars cafes , Modern hotel with good facilities private pool area and nice outdoor dining seating areas Staff very helpful and pleasant Breakfast very good value in comparison with others hot and cold buffet and continental Room clean and well laid out with separate shower and bath Approximately 12 mins from Olympic village and beaches 
394324,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Cleanliness could have been a little better as could the timing of the turndown service Room service food was not the best either Room for improvement , Great pool with outdoor bar We had an upgrade to a suite which was great Location was good 
394325,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, More help on local tours and attractions would have been helpful , Only hotel I ve been to with smoked salmon and champagne for breakfast Big well equipped comfortable rooms with lots of toiletries Great value for money Not far to walk to beach or city Taxi rank right outside 
394326,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, No complaints, It was an excellent hotel no complaints at all It is a plus to have a pool in the hotel after such a big day going up and down in Barcelona and return to the hotel and get in the pool and the spa Oh how relaxing it is worth to pay 10 00 for the breakfast at the hotel they a really big variety of food 
394327,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Not being able to use the facilities due to a Music event for many days for which I will be making a complaint which lasted from 1400 till 2300 This also meant it was not viable to use the restaurant due to the racket The same applied to being able to use the spa Our days were organised where possible to avoid being in the hotel during these hours I felt sorry for the staff who were on duty as this music was a constant base beat which was very wearing and annoying whilst being repatative I feel some type of recompense should be made , Breakfast Near Metro Cleanliness
394328,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, I think the price is high for this kind of hotel It seem it has a lot facilities Yes it is but they are all like decoration Very small pool very small gym etc And they have very annoying elevator , Breakfast was very good 
394329,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The outdoor pool and gym are almost nothing Both is too small When I checked in they gave me a room near the road first floor and near the road I was feeling the buses inside my room and I found some tobacco ashes on the bed and some tobacco on the table However the staff was very helpful and they changed my room which was totally better than the first one , The spa is ok The breakfast is very high quality 
394330,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, It s not really a four star hotel to me The swimming pool was closed for pool parties that went on til late and were really noisy we couldn t order room service from our room and instead had to go down to the bar to order Food wasn t great tasting and cold We were on a non smoking floor but people were still smoking on our floor The first day we arrived we had no electricity until midnight so couldn t use our room two of the three lifts were out of service so overall a lot of negatives It depends what you re looking for If you just want a room in a good location it s better value for money than the other hotels but if you want a pool room service and generally spend more time at the hotel I would pay the extra money to stay at the better hotels Neighbourhood felt run down and a bit daunting but didn t experience any trouble , For us the main attraction was the location It wasn t too expensive by taxi to visit the beach port or main attractions given how expensive the other hotels are that have a better location 
394331,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The outside pool is tiny Not exactly picturesque surroundings of the hotel, New and fresh looking nice design Comfortable rooms and beds Very good breakfasts nice selection of food 
394332,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites,No Negative, Everything was just perfect We had an early morning flight so we arrived earlier than the check in time but luckily they had a room ready so we could sleep a few hours before starting to explore Barcelona The room and the bathroom was spacious modern and very clean The bed was super comfortable as well The location is also great Bogatell metro station is just 3 minutes walk away Both Nova Icaria and Bogatell beach can be reached with a 10 15 minute walk 
394333,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, No disco behind us but this was not your fault I would request to stay on the other side of the building next time , Rooms were very nice staff very helpful Breakfast extremely nice 
394334,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The area doesn t have many options around to eat or visit so you need to get a taxi or metro to go out at night We tried to use the gym but the machines there were completely broken down don t even try , The location is good close to metro station and 15min walk to the beach The poolside bar is fantastic and relaxing perfect for an afternoon drink Rooms were comfortable but the A C was a bit tricky to get going Overall if you re looking for a relax stay with close access to the beaches this is a perfect choice at the price range 
394335,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The hotel is a little out of town but very close to Botega metro station and 30 minutes walk to the sagrada familia There are a few bars nearby and it seems like an up and coming neighbourhood , Breakfast is very varied with everything you could want plus cava The bed was the comfiest I ve ever stayed in and the spa facilities are amazing 
394336,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Poor English speaking And one particular girl at the breakfast lounge that was really rude , There was one staff member that was extremely nice and we liked him alot I don t remember his name but He had glasses and midage and served us many beers and coctails at the bar Outstanding service and fun to be around 
394337,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Bit noisy at weekends outside but could put up with that , Lovely hotel very clean food very good and staff polite happy and informative Made to feel welcome and made happy Lovely bar and restaurant Location good for beach and city Taxi rank outside 25 minutes from airport 
394338,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, If we could of had free access to the pool would have been much better I thought paying for using the pool was a little extreme expecially as we were staying three nights , The room was great Location is a little way out of the main centre of Barcelona but it you like walking you are only a short walk from the beach area Restaurant in the hotel very good Not to expenisve
394339,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Had a regular check out at 1 pm and an evening departure to the airport but could not access the showers without paying 4 EUR for a towel after checking out , Awesome beds good breakfast with fresh made orange juice ice cold Cava hot and cold food choices Nice Danish pastries It is 10 minutes walking to the beach and a couple of restaurants with high class in the neighbourhood Close to the subway to get to the city Not crowded at the pool and a VERY nice Spa 
394340,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Na, Staff members were extremly friendly knowledgeable Big thank you to Beatriz Alba Marcin Carlos you made our stay really memorable You are fantastic Great location 15mins to the seaside 25mins to Gothic Quarter on foot places we saw memories we have are better than pictures 
394341,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Breakfast selection is almost there with some nice parts fresh bread rolls smoked salmon and a bottle of cava but lacking a bit of variety and quality of the cooked ingredients should be better bacon eggs sausages etc Location although perfect distance wise by taxi to everything it s quite an industrial part of town so not much going on in the immediate area , Reception staff were brilliant very helpful and always friendly Location is good for getting to the beach 15min walk and ramblas 7 euro taxi etc Indoor pool and spa is really good We were upgraded to a suite which was a nice touch and the room bed bathroom were all very nice 
394342,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, I went there with my family We booked the hotel with a good offer 400 euro for 3 nights 3 months in advance and informed them that we have a kid and they agreed But when we went there they charged us for 200 euro extra for my son , Spa and bed
394343,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The gym was ridiculous You cannot do much there The location is ok but of course not in the city center or at the beach However you can walk to the beach in 10 minutes and the metro takes you to the city center , Everything was clean and very new Rich breakfast although i would have preferred to have fresh baked pancakes 
394344,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Breakfast wasn t as good as we expected Limited hot food Although pastries were very good Location didn t seem good at first but once we understood it wasn t as bad as we thought it was OK , Nice clean modern rooms Lovely outdoor area and reception Staff were mostly helpful when they could speak and understand English well 
394345,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, A little noisy as a club is next door But otherwise very quiet during the week , Impressed by the comfortable room large shower and bath Clean and modern hotel Short walk to metro beach and local bars cafe and shops 
394346,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The heating AC was always on cold no matter what I did to try adjust the settings TV had very few EnglishEnglish speaking channels , Staff were helpful and knowledgeable Breakfast was very tasty and nicely presented 
394347,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites,No Negative, Good breakfast but for the money everything else was poor Slow check in and check out Had to wait around the bar on a couple of occasions as slow service Seemed to be ages to walk to places of interest 
394348,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Only one issue but a big one for us The indoor pool is only accessible for children 10am 2pm that meant we didn t get to use it during our 4 day stay the indoor pool was the main reason we picked this hotel There is no mention of this restriction anywhere on the website or in the booking confirmation this should be clearly highlighted , Staff extremely friendly amd helpful Room facilities Easy parking Fast free wifi
394349,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The price could have been a bit lesser to attract a much wider audience , The staff was very helpful The best thing about this hotel was its location and connectivity It was within a minutes distance from the metro station just a kilometer away from the beach and supermarket The room was well furnished with adequate facilities 
394350,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The staff on the front desk especially someone called Daniel we very rude and unhelpful We asked for an iron and he just said they couldn t provide an iron with no explanation Could have been better Also i booked this room for myself and my wife The room was supposed to be a double instead we got 2 single beds pushed together which wasnt ideal , The hotel facilities were fantastic it had everything we needed for our stay only thing lacking is getting hold of an iron The bathroom was one of the best bathrooms we had stayed in Everything was quite local 5 10 mins in a taxi to all the main attractions 
394351,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, the location is a little far from the city center and the transportation is not so convenient Close to the road so a bit noisy at night , the breakfast is very good and the room is big 
394352,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Could be more central but public transportation works just fine The surrounding area is not good caf s and restaurants are missing Our deal did not include breakfast and we struggled with finding a place to eat nearby , Helpful staff Great outside space 
394353,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, staf nice the hotel is clean, the suit where we ve been has a door locked and this door goes to another room we could hear whatever the people over there was talking about not nice the regular room that my friend had was much better i found a bit of metal inside the scrambled egg when i had the breakfast in the spa area there was people in the jacuzii with the cloths on i know they have they religion but is discousting
394354,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The breakfast wasn t great about par with most city hotel breakfasts The location wasn t the best for sight seeing but suited me as I prefer to be just outside the main stay My air conditioning leaked water one night which woke me up and the decor was a little bit tired but fine , The staff were very helpful had a nice relaxing environment and was quite modern clean and well maintained There was a nice pool bar although it wasn t great weather not their fault I would imagine in the sun it would be very nice Also a spa that i didn t try but looked nice
394355,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The seating area inside could be improved and drinks expensive for area ACTUALLY DOUBLE THE PRICE, The staff are very friendly and helpful Rooms clean spa great
394356,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, All transport facilities are easily accessible ticket t10 but you might have to travel a litte distance to find a decent place to eat, Rooms clean had a twin room at first but was instantly changed to a double no fuss got a suite on final day very nice separate living space if you want to chill with company gym was alright nothing great food was decent staff helpful spa was decent enough water cannons and beds in the pool were excellent 
394357,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Spa centre became a joke in this hotel It was a really great place with very nice facilities I m not even talking about a bathrobe and slippers which they used to have before This time I did not get even a towel And when I asked for a locker key I was told that they don t have any keys left and that I can change myself and bring my clothes over to the Spa Reception so they keep it there for me The Spa itself was overcrowded with families and children despite the fact that they have a notice on the wall stating that kids are allowed into Spa area only between 10am 2pm It was 7 30 pm but never mind The hotel is in great location I ve been here for many times now I like the proximity of the subway and the beach But the Spa is the real let down in my last trip I don t think I will ever use it again as it was hard to enjoy the facilities without having a towel , Great location
394358,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The staffs attitude when we checked in and when we had a few queries was awful On both occasions the staff were not friendly not helpful and when I asked a simple question the man laughed at me , Bed was comfortable Room was clean Good shower
394359,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The staff on spa reception didn t speak English and made understanding a little complex , Beds were very comfortable Room was kept very clean Service was always good and staff helpful and pleasant The spa area is superb the various jets really do make you feel like you have undergone a transformation 
394360,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Breackfast not included rather normal on booking , Clean and confortable room Staff kindness Metro station 5 min walking Quite area Olympic Port and beaches walking distance Perfect for runners
394361,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, During our last stay there was a problem with hot water in the whole hotel This time A C did not work Room with orientation to the east gets very hot inside in the early morning sleeping impossible after sun rise, Location
394362,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Air conditionning not working Any extra is far too expensive 48 euros parking for 2 nights 5euros extra charge for a simple coffe in the room etc , Modern hotel clean and well located
394363,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The room temperature was really high and the air conditioning did not work properly Fortunately outside temp cooled down quickly after the sunset and I opened the window to get fresh air in so it did not bother me too much , Renovated room Nice furniture and comfortable bed I did not try the breakfast Good value for money
394364,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Very poor was meant to stay for 4 nights but could only stay for one because the air con wasn t working they didn t have any double beds just 2 single beds Had to sleep with the window open next to a busy road so couldn t get any sleep at all,No Positive
394365,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The spa was very poor No dressing gowns not allowed to use the lockers and the staff made me feel unwelcome, Lovely room with friendly staff Well positioned for sightseeing 
394366,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, I found a toenail on my beautifully made bed and I know it wasn t mine because I file my nails rather than cutting them Apart from that I couldn t fault the hotel , The staff were incredibly friendly with a warm welcome and great prompt assistance throughout my stay Delicious breakfast Fantastic location close to public transport links Luxurious room with a huge bathroom very comfy bed and peaceful as it backed on to the pool 
394367,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The standard room needs extra hanging space for clothes having upgraded to a suite this was much better , The staff were excellent especially the reception Spa was superb all round very good hotel 
394368,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, They do not start air conditioner even though it was hot They have a weired policy not to start air con if its a winter season Though it was hot and so suffocating in the room Yes you can open window but you can not sleep with so many trucks coming early morning Even though I was on 5th floor , Nothing Not worth as a 4 star
394369,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Needs Air conditioning sorting out I know its a spa hotel but I wasn t expecting to have a Sauna every time we entered our room bed was comfy but the lack of aircon made sleeping awful make sure you drink plenty of Spanish Rioja before bed I asked the maintenance guy to fix our aircon and to be fair I don t speak much Spanish and he certainly didn t speak any English but through me pointing at the nice shiny Siemens A C controller on the wall and him shaking his head from left to right whilst pointing to the window we managed to come to an understanding whereby basically he was advising me that for cold air I need to open the window and that the Hotel didn t have any air conditioning installed The Spa is nice but it could be better with regular maintenance as only 50 of the wet area facilities were working during our short stay Spa also needs to include the use of either robes in the rooms or include the use of the changing facilities When you consider that we booked a Hotel Spa package and had to come down to the spa to collect our towels then go back up to the room to change and subsequently return to the room in dripping wet swimwear once finished in the spa this small detail might also help them maintain a dry floor in the lobby and lifts Oddly we noticed that they do have changing facilities in the spa but these we only for use by the locals using the spa not for Hotel guests Finally you will need a Taxi to get around from here if this is your base but with a Taxi always seemingly to be waiting across the road it wasn t too much bother just additional expense ,No Positive
394370,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The food we ate in the restaurant on Sunday night was very mediocre for that standard of hotel and not worth the money we paid My fish was very good but the sauce was horrible and cold my friends steak was chewy and was not in the mushroom sauce as stated on the menu , The room was a very good size and the beds extremely comfortable 
394371,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Air conditioning didn t work and blew out warm air had to open window as room got quite hot Location quite remote but could walk to beach and subway to main attractions, Lovely hotel food nice rooms lovely
394372,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, A C didn t work as it should on both cool and heat settings any fan speed and no matter what the thermostat setting the A C would always blow hot air which made it impossible to use the fan at night to cancel out the street noise I understand that the cooling feature may be off in April to conserve energy but it should be possible to just use the fan without the heating the keycard worked erratically especially in the elevators about 50 of the time resetting at reception did not help noise from the street I asked for the back yard room but this request was ignored I got two single beds despite selecting a double bed not a major issue for me but still the hotel charged 100EUR to the card used at reservation so I lost on conversion charges I would have preferred to pay the complete amount on check out the staff did not inform me that the outside pool was open the description indicated that it was closed in April so I lost the opportunity of using it the immediate neighbourhood is rather depressing and shabby mostly car repair garages, well appointed spacious room large window useful window curtains good choice of lighting free safe lots of good quality hangers in wardrobe modern furnishings looks really nice both bath and shower available some space to use in the mini fridge good choice of hotel cosmetics and such and good quality
394373,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The location could have been better it was too far out and you had to get a taxi to get you to the tour bus stops and the city as it was to far to walk for OAPs , The breakfast was good but the evening meal menu was limited 
394374,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Could have been more selection for the evening meal The only transport from the hotel was by taxi no buses Horrible view from window , Good selection for breakfast
394375,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Location is a little far from city center The bathroom in the suite is just too small and does not have a bath tub The spa closes too early , The spa was great but they close too early
394376,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, AC didn t work winter break Very hot room Bed not comfortable Pillows too soft no option to add more change, Large room large bathroom Design ok Gym is ok Food is ok
394377,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The location is very noisy and the rooms are not well insulated so noise from other rooms travels easily , The bed was very comfortable and the staff all very helpful and friendly 
394378,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Staff could be more friendly and there was a strange smell all around the outside hotel , everything was so good Location spa room breakfast always taxis waiting outside hotel perfect for couples For sure will be back to this hotel 
394379,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, I booked this hotel for it s SPA en gym but once I got there I read that they were both closed for maintenance They didn t want to refund or hear any complaints at the beginning but next day I talked to somebody else Elvira and she cordially and professionally found a solution and we came to a deal , The hotel itself nice and modern located in a quite zone The breakfast was perfect Elvira from the staff thanks a lot for your help hope you are there next time 
394380,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Rooms were very small for 3 people They call it a room for triple occupancy however it should be a double occupancy room Spa was not operational and they did not bother to inform us prior to our arrival , We did not like the room because it was too small so the hotel changed our room next day Service recovery was a good gesture 
394381,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, It was a really nice touch to have complimentary spa circuits for each day we were there the only drawback was a few parts were not working, The hotel was fantastic quality food was excellent staff really helpful and very close to transport links to explore the city 
394382,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Lack of some facilities Room minibar is not sufficient Away from city center , Staff are highly professionals and so helpful Area is quite with easy access to all means of transportations Breakfast is so good comfortable room with unique design 
394383,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, guests usage of spa then moving to rooms without full body dry spa always better separate days for women men It did not encourage me to use the spa, The modern style of the rooms and smart facilities
394384,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, At 22 o clock hotel by mistake issued a key for our room We were sleeping and someone unlocked the door without notification We were frightened Hotel send us review of issued key and it was mistake of hotel no one apologized Staff is on very low level or their director I wander if hotel had issued the key during the day than we could be robbed Secondly plumber facilities was not working so good in the room , A bad is cool
394385,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, I had to ask for more shampoo etc as it was not refilled after cleaning the room , Friendly staff very customer friendly especially the staff at the reception desk Wide range of choices at the breakfast buffet Good quality Close to public transport 
394386,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Couldn t check in until 3pm and I had to be at the razzmatazz venue from before that time which meant I then couldn t check in until 11pm at night No food was served during day except room service but of course no room Lack of restaurants in the area , Great hotel located right by the Razzmatazz venue and great rooms decor
394387,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The room was really small The shower cabin was right in the room next to the entrance door facing a window which was quite unusual The shower cabin leaked every time so water was all over the room The cleaning ladies were accurate and fast but after cleaning they never put my stuff back like they would leave my bathroom bottles on a deep shelf where I would never think of looking or place my suitcase in the middle of a room The neighborhood is quite troublesome it was quite frightful to walk in the streets at night There s no decent supermarket nearby Average wifi , The staff was friendly but not always helpful not all of them speak good English The location is nice 10 mins walk to the beach Bogatell metro station is almost round the corner Quiet room with a c

394389,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites,No Negative, Extremely friendly and helpful staff solved my problems quickly Very comfortable bed nice bath warm and clean room only 5min to the metro station 
394390,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, You have to travel a bit to find affordable restaurants in the evening Not much happening around the vicinity in November , This location was a bit far from my conference meeting point but walking to the metro was easy and provided me an opportunity to see more of the city Also the hotel is very close to the beach I jogged to the beach in under 10 minutes gorgeous views and wonderful stretch of beach 
394391,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites,No Negative, Facilities and the room itself were clean and immaculate Spa has alot to offer Helpful and knowledgeable staff Location great for us two metro stations within 10 min walk 
394392,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The staff at the spa were very rude and not helpful, Although not in the centre of the city the hotel was only a 2 minute walk to the nearest metro station The room was lovely and clean and the reception staff were very friendly and helpful 
394393,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Air conditioning did not work in our room There were no changing facilities offered to us when we used the spa but day visitors using the spa were shown to the changing area We had to remove clothing by the pool , Our room was very comfortable spacious and clean
394394,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Very expensive breakfast Smoke smell in non smoking room Low capacity staff probably for saving , The location is close to the place I wanted to be Good staff
394395,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, There is a phone in the room but there is no clear information provided of how to reach the reception There was a constant smell of sigarette smoke in the room, I particularly liked the great service provided by the gentleman at the reception
394396,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Location is quite challenging to get to if you are not driving and or don t know the area , Great value for the money Very professionally run Defintely a step above anything else in the price range
394397,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, unwelcoming staff at the reception I was early for check in so I wanted to use the spa in the meanwhile included in the booking I queued for the main reception and I was told to go directly there the woman didn t even look carefully at my confirmation At the spa reception after queueing again I was told I needed tickets so Had to go back to the main reception after queueing again where I explained this ridiculous situation and no apologies were made I genuinely think the receptionist wasn t able understand what I was saying in English after check in we went to our room and there where hair all over the bed We asked to change room and for the manager to come to check the new one together with us There were hair on the bed of the second room too We asked for any sort of benefit to recover such an uncomfortable situation for a 4 stars hotel but they were totally refused Cleaners came to re do the bed It was clear that the hotel staff didn t really consider this matter a concern which was really disappointing after checkout we left our luggage in the storage room when we came back after few hours one was missing The hotel staff struggled to help us as if this was not a big deal They just mentioned they might have an insurance but they didn t know the details it was clear they didn t know their policy to deal with this type of event It has been really frustrating and such a bad way to end our holiday not considering the loss of money , decent breakfast enjoyable spa circuit although not quite clean
394398,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, No directory to call staff or room service Otherwise nothing I did not like, Very friendly staff convenient location near subway stations very clean and comfortable bedrooms nothing fancy but good bed good bathroom very clean

394402,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, We booked the suite with SPA acces which we were unable to use as there was no hot water the entire day We could not even shower Nobody informed us at the check in so we found that out as we went for a shower The staff was very unfriendly and did not give us the opportunity to enjoy the SPA another day We wanted to make a formal complainnand they were also dening to have the complains book made us waste 30 mims more , Not much to point out in ths section
394403,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, It would be much better if you put a desk in the room and a boiler , The service is very good in particular the people in the restaurant are very nice I was impressed By contrast those in front desk are so so 
394404,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, the quality of the hotel is not the best Its a bit noisy and the room are small They have divided a normal room in two parts which makes very little sense You can hear the music from the swimming pool area which is annoying , its a nice location and easy to get around
394405,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Not enough hooks and hangers Bathroom set up very awkward with a glass sliding door that didn t work Restaurant staff were not very helpful , Very helpful desk staff Spa is lovely and guest pass was lovely to use 
394406,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The changing area for the spa was very small so it really was impossible to dress and undress The floor was wet and covered with hair it was so small and jam packed with people no wonder , Great staff a big suite big bath the room was great The spa pool and facilities were very good 
394407,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, the room shower was bad because I almost break my leg as I came out of the shower for a towel there was water all the floor from the shower , like the staff and the idea of having a security in the hotel
394408,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Sofa in room needs replacing very shabby Shower leaks into toilet area Breakfast staff overbearing Our son was ill in bed during our stay we had to sneak breakfast food to him This food was included in the price , Check in stafff very pleasant and helpful Cleaning staff also very pleasant and helpful
394409,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Location was a bit of a shock It would have been ideal for families and people who want to be a little bit further away from the hustle and bustle For young adults wanting to be in the heart of it all not the best , The comfort of the room and the hotel facilities 
394410,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Did not like the location the area seemed run down and unsafe with a lot of graffiti , The changing room in the spa was unkept and they did not provide robes or sandals Unlike any spa area I have been 
394411,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Could of had better dinner options on menu Everything else amazing , Everything Amazing spa hotel Breakfast was just incredible Brilliant spa extremely friendly staff ten miniute walk to the beach and the metro station is 3 min walk away and 2 stops to port velle amazing beach or 2stops to the catalonya Barcelona centre Taxi rank just outside so you can get pritty much anywhere from here for around 10 euro Room was something special best hotel we have stayed in in Spain 100 reccomend 
394412,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, location was ok near the metro however the streets and area around the hotel was not the best one lots of autoshops and big abondoned industrial buildings with graffiti sprayed on , modern and elegant hotel very exclusive interior design friendy staff breakfast buffet was not too big but very exclusive among others there were different kinds of cheese smoked salmon or champagne metro station was right next to the hotel Bogatell or Marina 
394413,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, disturbing voices coming from air conditioning system a fitness room with broken machines and not realy useful outdoor bar with no animation even no music, clean nice room design

394416,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Everything worked fine but it lacked the feel of a 4 hotel When we walked in there was an irate guest in a blazing row with reception staff and when I asked for a towel at reception I was told they didn t have any period Also the night guard interrogated us to get in late Boring view from room , We had the spa included which is basically just sauna s steam rooms and pool They are of good standard 
394417,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, staff there were 2 really nice receptionists who even upgraded us as we were on our honeymoon and 2 pretty horrible receptionists spoke very rudely to a client wasn t so helpful and was sending bad vibes in general the pool is to cold to swim in i feel like a paid a lot for a hotel that s not up to the standers it thinks it is there was no doorman to take our stuff to the room i had to ask as our bags were really heavy the suit was nice but iv e seen bigger and better another thing we came early so we gad to store our bags until check in they kept giving the gusts the keys to the bag storage room instead of keeping the keys to themselves and keeping check of all of the bags i was really mad at that and just felt like my belongings aren t safe , or were nice location close enough to beach you get a free pass to the spa if you fill out the hotel s review which was a nice treat very nice breakfast 
394418,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, I liked everything about the hotel , I had 3 wonderful nights at Villa Olimpica The staff were very friendly and the facilities were very clean and comfortable 
394419,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Entering the room you go through the toilet then to bedroom The sink of the bathroom was broken took 2 days to be repaired for 700 Euro for 4 nights with that happening seemed a lot, The hotel has a swimming pool and the location is very near to the clubs Shoko Opium etc as well as near the beach
394420,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Incredibly noisy night long service provision vehicles on the street outside Thursday night Friday morning Not the hotel s fault but extremely irritating Extra soundproofing triple glazing might help though , Spacious room Friendly staff Simple check in out Located close to Marina Metro L1 Located close to Salle Razzmatazz 
394421,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Hotel was not coporating with our need of getting a a specific type of room even though we requested it earlier Bed cover was not clean I got bites all over my leg Room didn t get clean one properly bed sheets were dirty we complained Hotel send us a box of chocolate and a spa for free for a day We stayed for a whole week breakfast was the same every single day not much options Very weak breakfast we were not happy at all for the amount of money we paid its not worth the it, We liked the location it s close to metro
394422,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, The location of the hotel wasn t great Being a young person I felt a little scared around the area especially at night as it felt unsafe The hotel would be much more appealing if it was in the centre , The room was very modern and very open spaced which was nice The hotel itself was very clean and modern and the facilities were great 
394423,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Minor negative we arrived on a Saturday night and there is a nightclub within 3 minutes walk of the hotel Our room was on the 1st floor overlooking the main street this proved rather noisy from about midnight well into the early hours of the morning Not by the actual nightclub but by people in the street being rather noisy , Not a central location however this didn t matter A 7 minute walk to Bus Stop 10 on the Barcelona City Bus Tour and a 15 minute walk to the beach Very friendly and helpful staff An excellent buffet breakfast that served everything even a glass of Cava if you wished Lovely pool area with an outside bar lunch facility and sunbeds We were upgraded to a Suite which had a separate lift ideal as the main lift was very busy Lovely bathroom with 2 sinks bath shower and a separate walk in shower and toilet Very comfortable large king size bed and other than a Saturday night was relatively quiet 
394424,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Room was quite small glass door of the toilet were quite unconfortable It s a pity to have such small swimming pool on such big garden , Helpful staff nice garden with a swimming pool 
394425,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Due to cheaper rates many youngsters stayed there meaning more noise Saturday afternoons and evenings a noisy disco takes place and it gets full of drunk kids The suites are too compact instead of just having a bigger bedroom and comfortable bed they have a lounge with a sofa and tv It does not get used , It was one of the cheaper hotels 
394426,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Management hosted a party with music blaring from 1 PM to 11 PM our bed s headboard was SHAKING from the constant bass pounding They were totally inconsiderate of hotel guests peace no siesta to make some money on a pool party Staff cared less , Location is near to train and walk to beaches but a very pedestrian area of town that is trying to add living amenities to the area 
394427,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites, Service is awful When I came for check in which was booked in advance I ve been told that the hotel is full Even though they charged me 100 euros in advance Ok They gave me a suit next day but the time was wasted Nobody served us at the pool The spanish lady staff at the spa reception has been away for more then 20min and after she back she even didn t say sorry They didn t clean the room But reception staff was helpful Thank you guys and Elena ,No Positive
394428,Hotel Spa Villa Olimpica Suites,No Negative, This hotel was perfectly located just a 10 minute walk to the beach where there are lots of seafood restaurants and bars The hotel is a 3 4 minute walk from the metro Bogatell giving you fast access to other areas in Barcelona There are also bars and restaurants close to the hotel for example D9 across the road which did great tapas You can take a beautiful walk into the city centre in less then half an hour by walking through the stunning Ciutadella Park me and my friend would walk into the centre gothic quarter etc rather than get the metro as we found this to be a perfect way to take in Barcelona The hotel had excellent facilities it was a fresh clean modern hotel The beds were extremely comfortable the staff were very friendly and willing to help the spa was amazing value for money the pool was perfect breakfast was also excellent From our bedroom window we had a view of the Sagrada Familia which was only a 25 minute walk from the hotel you could get the metro For those who like to go out and party Razzmatazz is literally round the corner from the hotel and was an awesome night out it is a huge cool venue with the party going on till 6 am I definitely recommend In all I would definitely go back to this hotel in the future There is nothing bad to say about it It made a delightful base from which to explore and enjoy Barcelona I would 100 recommend this hotel for singles couples groups families everyone
