470902,Mandarin Oriental Milan, The hotels traditional restaurant recommendation Solferino may look traditional but food was average 100 tourists everything is charged as an extra and prices at least triple of that in a really good restaurant in Milan Felt completely ripped off and sent to a tourist trap I am happy to pay but was not worth the money at all Spent half the price the night before at a top milan restaurant with wine Will not go to Restaurant Solferino again , Bed seriously comfy Stunning flowers everywhere 
470903,Mandarin Oriental Milan, Evening restaurant staff has room for improvement inattentive and didn t bring things that were ordered, Breakfast was amazing ricotta with honey and toast a real winner concierge services are world class
470904,Mandarin Oriental Milan, The girl in the cafe gave us a small table not comfortable for us and 2 dogs and didn t give us a big one in a lobby before the manager said that it is Ok and we can sit there because he knew that we stayed in Mandarin Oriental a lot of time all over the world , Super new rooms and megacomfortable beds Room service was perfect and staff is very kind Breakfast was not as in four seasons Milan but not bad Maybe we was at the end of it Also girl on reception made check out for us later for 1 hour And all comfortable was made for dogs even meal in the lobby So we liked staying there
