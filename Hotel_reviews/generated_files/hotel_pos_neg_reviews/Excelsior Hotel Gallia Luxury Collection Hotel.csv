406064,Excelsior Hotel Gallia Luxury Collection Hotel, A little out of the main town hotel runs a very nice Maserati shuttle though Taxis to and from ranged from 12 euros to 18 euros and attitude back to Linate airport was on 24 euros so watch taxis , Luxury hotel staff cannot do enough for you The rooftop terrace is excellent 
406065,Excelsior Hotel Gallia Luxury Collection Hotel, The location of the hotel Too far from the city center , The friendly staff and the facilities The hotel provided two cars for picking up and droping people to city center 
406066,Excelsior Hotel Gallia Luxury Collection Hotel, The breakfast service had many staff but lacked direction or systems or both The happy hour was ridiculous as the price of a bottle of wine went from 36E to 60E minimum price and the beer selection in the terrace is wrong Why not have the same beers as down in the bar I could not drink my second beer as it was undrinkable And I am in the wine and food business in Australia But I still paid for all the drinks , The staff were professional in their attitude to their work and friendly at the same time The quiet nature of the place was so relaxing The spa facilities needed some explanation at the desk as most newcomers would not be aware in the short time they are a guest as to the significant size of that facility

406071,Excelsior Hotel Gallia Luxury Collection Hotel, Room not refreshed properly coffee pods tea milk shower gels not replaced I had to phone room services every day to ask this to be done Terrace bar closed 2 out of 3 nights we were there no prior warning this had been one of the main reasons booked this hotel I expected better from a hotel of this standard , Bar staff in Gallia bar were excellent couldn t do enough to look after us Breakfast was good 
406072,Excelsior Hotel Gallia Luxury Collection Hotel, The food was average all over italy , The staff were friendly and helpful The nespresso machine The mazzerati car service to the city centre The size of the room and bathroom The ironing service 2 parts per person per day The proximity to the train station

406082,Excelsior Hotel Gallia Luxury Collection Hotel, Location is not the best since you need transportation to go to fashion district and Duomo area But the Maserati service was a good way to compensate it , Hotel is great staff very friendly and facilities new and modern Breakfast is among the top 5 I have ever had

406127,Excelsior Hotel Gallia Luxury Collection Hotel, Lighting in the wardrobe makeup area is really dim which is kinda weird and rather inconvenient Would have appreciated more walking space in there too but I guess everything else made up for this tiny flaw which we could live with, The extra bed for third person in the junior suite was a proper bed not foldout couch like many hotels even 5 ones Amenities like gym and chauffeur service were worldclass Special mention to the hotel staff all of whom I encountered were seasoned seemed like a very polished team helpful and spoke perfect English Breakfast buffet spread fabulous and totally worth it
