284912,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The staff was not knowledgeable or very accommodating for the level of hotel this was supposed to be No concierge The lines were long and only two people to take care of everyone When we checked in we were asked if we wanted to pay in US dollars or euros last time we were in Europe this was not a question that was ever asked I picked usd after the staff explained the exchange rate would be dictated by my bank not exactly true The room overall was ok but SMALL no privacy as the bathroom is basically in the bedroom For almost 450 it does not meet expectations , Location was perfect Close to everything but far away enough that noise was not an issue 
284913,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, We thought the staff at the restaurant for breakfast were very nice other than that not so much, They told us we were upgraded to a better room turned out the room was right next to a staff room Very unlucky The noise was incredibly loud especially from early morning very disappointed

284917,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Aircon didn t work properly keys stopped working in the door at least once a day and they don t have enough safe keys for all the rooms so we had to wait three days before we could get one , staff by the pool and at breakfast were very good

284920,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, n a, the staff was nice and we were upgraded to a suite at no additional cost since our room was not ready when we arrived the suite was very nice and luxurious great place They even allowed us to have a late check out the next day which was very convenient 
284921,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, While room was clean did not like location of bathroom common areas hallways etc were not Not enough seating at pool with umbrellas , Location was great within walking distance of most attractions 
284922,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Just the beds were uncomfortable too hard apart from that everything was fine, I liked the convenience to all amenities and the pool was a nice added bonus
284923,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Long narrow pillows , The best location for a break right in the city centre Los Ramblas is seconds away from the hotel I didnt eat in the hotel as breakfast was 20 Euro Rooms were what you would expect to be in the middle of the city but big enough Beds were comfortable staff were always helpful and friendly The pool area is tiny but really nice to cool down in after a day in the sunshine I would definately stay there again

284927,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Room service has a lot to improve Phoned to ask for a bottle of water and was told that I could come and fetch it for myself otherwise there was a long waiting time After 20 mins I got 1 tiny bottle although asked for a big one After 30 mins I called them again and finally got what I wanted Took only an hour Next time I just went downstairs to get a bottle of water and had to WAIT FOR 10 mins as the staff was too busy to hand it to me at the spot In the description of the rooms the terrace room should be mentioned as the one with no view as the wall is 1 5 m and blocks all the view Saying that the terrace was huge and we loved it , Location is amazing close to everything Room very comfy Nice large terrace in a terrace room All city attractions at the step of the hotel Cleaning staff very polite and discreet 
284928,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Bar was rarely staffed there never seemed to be a bartender around when we wanted to have a drink , Very helpful staff great location and comfortable bedroom with great little terrace A little pricey but it s well worth it because of the location to everything

284935,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Air con in room didn t work properly When we called staff they came to look and said they would return but did not Exhaust fan in bathroom did not work Didn t like that the bathroom door was just frosted glass and didn t close properly , Great Location stairwell and entrance are beautiful Inside rooms are neat and tidy 
284936,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Bit strange being asked to settle bill on arrival Door entry needed new battery which required several requests to change so several times we could not get into our room Staff on reception were not the most competent Asked for restaurant reservations and they forgot then eventually a lovely girl whose name I can t remember did help us and recommended place was great Gaudim Also the bottle of complimentary cava in dsughter s room disappeared after 2 days asked for it to be brought back but never got it Overall though enjoyed our stay , Quiet room comfy bed welcome gift of cava and fresh fruit nice little balcony Pool area was good place to relax though pool quite small Breakfast was varied and good quality

284940,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, It was a pity that there were not more guests in the restaurant during the evenings The food there was well worth eating , The location played a big role when i chose a hotel The small swimmingpool also and it was lovely to use that facility The breakfast was great 
284941,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The breakfast room in the basement and the cost of the continental breakfast , The location is superb both in terms of transport to and from airport and within walking distance of virtually all the main sightseeing locations that Barcelona has to offer Great to have an outdoor swimming pool especially in a city centre location 
284942,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Nothing could have been better , Everything was perfect The room was modern spacious an clean and of excellent standard and quality Staff were helpful and friendly Location was central The swimming pool area was lovely to relax after a day exploring Barcelona Close to transport links 
284943,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, The hotel was in a perfect location for exploring all parts of the city with a taxi rank immediately outside tour buses directly across the road and La Rambla 200yards away The staff were fab particularly the cocktail waiter by the pool serving the best mojito in a long time Breakfast was amazing and the restaurant was really good too A shame more people don t eat there A must for anyone exploring Barcelona 
284944,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, AC was very weak We were sweating in the room The pool area was obviously very busy but only one person was in charge We were always waiting for towels and our orders and drinks were taking far too long We once waited 2 hours for our food to arrive , Location and the size of room The pool area is good with good beds and umbrellas 
284945,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, We booked this room as an emergency we were returning from a cruise and I made a mistake about the day we were to arrive from the minute we stepped in the hotel the staff was 100 smiles and welcoming we were upgraded to balcony suite and given complimentary water and chocolates we took a long bath in there very spacious tub now were American so we take a bit more room than the average European the entire place smelled amazing the a c was crispy cold a welcomed accommodation especially in the summer time check out was a breeze and the staff at this time was also super amazing I felt safe I felt at home and I wanted to stay for the remainder of my trip I would have done so if it was possible to cancel my other reservations I hope the staff knows how amazing they are they truly were a highlight on this trip thank you
284946,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Overall it was very quiet in the room day and night What could be heard though was the slam of the door if the neighbors didn t think of holding on to the door and closing it gently Also the water in the tub when taking a shower didn t drain as fast as it should But this didn t bother us much we are very pleased with our stay , Very pleased with our stay at this hotel Arrived rather late in the night quick check in and were surprised by a complimentary bottle of cava and a plate of fruits in the room Situated in a more quiet street but very central just round the corner from Plaza Catalunya where the easy and reasonably priced aerobus arrives leaves We went by foot around the city but there is easy access to the underground and buses near the hotel The hotel is partly redecorated with a nice clean and cozy terrace with pool and bar The entrance and the main stairs are from the olden days and magnificent Our room 210 was with a spacious nicely decorated room hallway with large wardrobes that also fitted the suitcase large bathroom bathtub with shower and a very nice balcony with a set of chairs and table The balcony faced the street wich was a nice view and the balconydoors and windows were very efficiently soundproofed A kettle and tea coffe that was refilled every day The beds were comfortable and I am a bit fuzzy and the cleaning very good We didn t try the breakfast it seemed a bit expensive and we preferred to choose time and place to have breakfast outside the hotel We didn t try the restaurant either but the menu looked good There is also a nice reception area with cozy seatings and a bar We went to the spa one evening Quite small but with a steamsauna and a pool with different massage waterbeams also very nice and clean Everyone in the staff spoke excellent english and were very service minded 
284947,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Parking in the area can be difficult There is an underground garage just in front of the hotel but that is pricey at over 50 euro per day and on Sunday s the shopping mall with one of the entrances is closed which made it quite difficult to locate my car again Not something the hotel can change unfortunately , The best feature is it s location at the beginning of the Ramblas My room had a nice balcony with lounge chairs to relax in the sun a bit after site seeing Relaxing at the pool is great also and the breakfast is incredible Plenty of choices of fresh juices fruit yoghurt breads egg sausages etc 
284948,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, We loved our stay The room was large and newly renovated had a lovely outside area and a small pool Very conveniently situated The breakfast was also very good 
284949,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Room service was cut off prior to posted time and our in room safe was not working upon check in and it took 6 hours to get someone to fix it , The room was large and bathroom well appointed Robes slippers and all toiletries etc available Bed large and comfortable black out curtains worked great and room was quiet of all outside noises 3 minutes walk from where the airport bus stops and 2 minutes from nearest metro 
284950,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The outdoor pool was very small and crowded with 3 people in it Definitely only made for a dip in and out to cool down , The location of the hotel was excellent Easy to travel by Aerobus from the airport into the square and just a two minute walk to the hotel across the plaza 
284951,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, Amazing location is only the first impressive thing about this hotel Next is the welcoming and genuinely carting staff who withsmile on their faces will assist you from the moment you book your stay until your last minute in Barcelona The rooms are spacious decorated with taste and elegance with all of the high end amenities The view from the balcony and terrace is amazing and if you choose the studio with your private pool you have your own lounging area outside with a chance for a cool off To top it all off there is a great restaurant downstairs with competitive prices and a menu with all the local options The food is tasty and delivered with flair and by pleasant and accommodating wait staff Definitely worth recommending 
284952,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, WIFI connection was very slow and it was hard to get work done , Rooms are newly refurbished and quite small but very well designed and organised with a space for work Staff was very attentive and friendly Shower is great 
284953,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The room was very small Not so fond of the shower in the bathtub would be better to just have a bigger shower , Location was great on the Rambla very close to pretty much everything The room was a bit small but it was nice and clean Balcony was nice 
284954,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Long bolster pillows more conventional pillows would be better but only personal preference , Hotel staff were without exception friendly and helpful We enjoyed the pool and bar perfect way to unwind after a day exploring the city The location was spot on and you wouldn t know from the pool or bedroom that you were so close to the heart of the action Just a good hotel nothing glitzy but everything spot on We ve stayed at lots of city hotels This is right up there for a combination of location quality and value for money When we come back to the city we will book here again without question

284958,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, The pool bar areas were really well maintained and comfortable the bar staff at the pool bar was so friendly and helpful and really helped make us feel relaxed and at home 
284959,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The price of breakfast The reported fault regarding outside lighting was never completed , Welcoming friendly and helpful staff Our room and pool Staff were as accommodating as possible to our requests I d definitely recommend and booked the hotel as recommended by my son and his wife who visited last year I have mobility problems but managed easily due to the location of the hotel to the Placa Catalunya and the Hop on Hop off bus service 
284960,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Staff was inconsistently helpful and it was always chaotic when trying to talk to the front desk Tool few staff for number of guests I asked for directions and restaurant recommendations a few times and was disappointed with the level of help I got , Modern room that was large by European standards Lovely pool and gym on site Fantastic location 
284961,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, That breakfast wasn t included as the price was quite high , We really didn t have the opportunity to enjoy our stay as it was so brief Due to the problem with BA cancelling flights we had to find alternative flights and overnight accommodation We were impressed with the hotel even though we were in it for less than 12 hours The staff were very friendly and welcoming and helped re printing off our boarding passes We would stay there again 
284962,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, We had 3 rooms which didn t get sunlight we had a waste water pipe running through our bedroom which kept us awake most of the night 3 awful rooms worst ever , Great location
284963,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The lobby area always chaotic and with tons of people checking in and out , The swimming pool area was very nice with a bar that had good food mussels tapas clams etc Lovely to come back to and quite quiet considering it is in the city center Great location can t get any better than that Rooms were spacious and comfortable Very good breakfast and a spa 
284964,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Elevator takes long long wifi is not working good I couldn t watch movies on my computer spa is 3 metres per 3m and water has to much cloro they not take care much they just make it to show as a publicity for the hotel in the pictures but not to be use I paid 280 euros per nitgh so I spected something nice i NO recommend it they need to rebuild the hotel the spa they need more workers because many times it take me ages to contact with spa or bar And I really sorry for the workers they try the best And one more thing I can t believe they had 8 6 fabulous on reviwe, The hotel is near everything
284965,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The spa could be better organised No one there when we turned our for our appointment We had to get changed in a toilet and no robes were supplied , Great location nice pool area friendly helpful staff 
284966,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, On our first night the AC in most of the hotel was not working which was a nightmare Had to sleep on the terrace for a couple of hours We addressed this with the hotel and they very fairly compensated us with a partial refund and free breakfast They also sent us fresh fruit Cava and Lindt chocolates All was forgiven and AC was working the next day , The location of this hotel was fantastic Within 1 minute you were on Catalunya Square The bus to and from the airport is located on the square Las Ramblas is 2 3 minute walk as is Passeig de Garcia We reached Segrada Familia by foot within 30 mins and from there another 40 mins walk and you were at Park Guell Metro station is a 2 minute walk The area is full of bars and restaurants and the facilities in the hotel are fantastic The terrace rooom was lovely Staff very helpful giving directions and travel suggestions On arrival in our room was a bottle of red wine and a fruit platter Fabulous

284970,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Air conditioning was so bad we have to open the windows and door for the room to cool down below 26 degree Celsius Would not stay there again over rated costs and service was very poor Made promises and did not commit on the air conditioning I stayed three and did not sleep with the windows opens and street noise No water on the second or third night Not a four star service Paying for the location not for the comfort or staffs ability to check us in One hour to Checkin 4 rooms That were booked in advance Bar open a little time, Location that s it

284972,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, I would like to advise Reception Desk team do not advice something when not sure Sometimes silence do a better job , I would like to express personal respect to General Manager who control all the business processes Also I would like to note the excellent breakfast 
284973,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, Very good quality breakfast Breakfast staff were on top of everything keeping all items filled and attractive I included it in my room rate but I think it would have been quite expensive to purchase separately All hotel staff were wonderful friendly and extremely helpful Very near to public transportation buses and taxi stand Easy to walk in any direction for attractions Very central 
284974,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, See above , The daily breakfast was the best and most beautiful that we have ever seen The staff was very friendly and very helpful with directions and recommendations We would definielyvuse catalonia hotels again if we go back to spain The only negative that we found is there are no washcloths in the bathroom and no kleenex either This may be a european thing

284976,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The bed wasn t the greatest The sheets could ve been a bit softer and needed more blankets , The bathroom was so nice and big the flooring was beautiful the location was great the balcony was huge and nice 
284977,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The hotel s temperature control cannot be adjusted to guests preferences We stayed at the hotel the week where Barcelona s weather was relatively hot for the time of the year We tried to lower the temperature control in the room to cool it down only to find it cannot be done We called reception and they made a show to regulate the temperature control only to tell us later that the hotel s temperature was set at default and cannot be varied or adjusted We were informed that should be want to cool the room down we have to open the windows This is a first in my extensive travel experience , Very close to Catalunya Square of Barcelona and away for the crowded La Rambla although within walking distance 
284978,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, Since the moment we checked in had great attention The receptionists are great It was my bf bday and request a surprise and had a champagne bottle in the room Loved everything about it Great Hotel with a perfect location 
284979,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The access to the room is awkward with a heavy suitcase But that is common to all hotels I have seen in Barcelona, The Bed was hard as I like All amenities are good The location is great on the Plaza and the nights are super quiet with the windows on the patio which is super rare in Barcelona 
284980,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Very noisy room due to waste water pipe running through the cavity in the bedroom wall none of our rooms come see daylight as 2 rooms didn t have windows , Excellent location couldn t be better
284981,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, some of the items at breakfast were not fresh but it was addressed immediately by staff when pointed out , The hotel is in excellent location just off Placa Catalunya on a quiet street lots of shops and bars around Staff very welcoming and accommodating quick check in welcome drink complimentary late check out Good facilities with sun terrace pool and bar restaurant onsite good size rooms with bathroom supplies topped up each day mini bar some of them have balconies facing the main street good selection at breakfast hot and cold 
284982,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, extra rate for breakfast could be included for higher rates or categories to pass at the reception area for going from room to SPA , Nice bottle of Cava and fresh fruits in the room as welcome gift booked Superior room with balcony in single use Nice balcony of course there are other walls around in a million people city The situation is perfect for shopping eating sightseeing and transfer to airport Aerobus just 2 min away Plaza Catalunya I will come back Breakfast could be included for the higher rates superior upwards but I suggest to go outside as there are sooo many good restaurants very close by Nice therapeutic massage relaxation place inhouse Spa thk you Eva 
284983,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Nothing, A place for 2 suitcases lots of vanity bench space in bathroom big fluffy towels great cushions taxis ramp out front position near plaza Catalunya for transport hub room very clean and nicely decorated The staff were very helpful 
284984,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The only thing I didn t appreciate was the price of breakfast which was 50 per day for 2 adults and 1 child My 5 year old son had 1 egg and a glass of orange juice every day which basically cost 10 per day Maybe if you have 2 full price paying adults for breakfast kids under a certain age could eat for free , Friendly and helpful staff that spoke English Excellent location on a quiet side street near to Placa Catalunya Spacious room with good toiletries The staff came around every evening to check if we needed anything and gave us a chocolate which was lovely Airport shuttle metro and hop on hop off bus tours just a stone throw away from hotel Lots of restaurants close by as well as shops and the top of La Ramblas You could basically walk to lots of places from the hotel Not difficult to get to Barcelona stadium in a taxi Good variety of options at breakfast and loved the show cooking Good pool located on the first floor and pool bar which was open until 8 30pm servicing bar snacks and drinks Ton the bar and was friendly and helpful 
284985,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, We were cold at night in the room They gave us a heater but it didnt work but the extra blankets helped , Really good location near Ramblas and transport options including bus to airport Room with balcony was useful as we were able to sit out in the sun in the afternoons to rest our legs Shops and restaurants also nearby We also enjoyed the welcome tray of fruits and bottle of wine
284986,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The hotel is advertised as 5 star In Europe the stars are not awarded for their luxuriousness but rather for their amenities It has 5 star amenities but is not a luxury hotel We booked a normal room and we found that the room furniture is more like what you get in a nice motel Nothing wrong with it but as I said not 5 star on the luxury scale The doors on the rooms are very thin and the halls echo so at night you can hear the other guests slamming their doors and talking in the halls and it is like they are in your room with you Other than that the hotel is as advertised , Amazing location right in the heart of town so you can walk everywhere Great helpful staff clean room Bathroom was adequately large by European standards and all marble which made it nicer than the bedroom itself The bed was on the harder side but quite comfortable Cable TV is provided The hotel has a nice outdoor pool deck which we didn t have time to use It would be great in the summer I would consider staying there again as overall the experience was good 
284987,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The hotel was quite dated and the family room we were given was very basic The heating in the room did not work so for 3 nights we were literally frozen No attempt made to rectify the matter or be given an alternative room We did complain but no response as of it received from the management The hotel was very pricy for the facilities it had The lift was slow and often took the stairs as it was quicker The restaurant was very average and basic with not a great selection on offer The reception staff were friendly but not great decision makers , The location was fine 
284988,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The pool on our balcony was dirty The massages we got at the hotel were not good one girl was on her phone while giving me a massage , The staff were so helpful and friendly The service was great and location even better I did enjoy staying here 
284989,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Just a small thing but if room overlooks the front of hotel it can get a bit noisy around 3am when bins are emptied , Loved the little extras eg welcome drink water and chocs in room bed made down Staff could not do enough for us
284990,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The air conditioning barely worked at all we ended up just leaving our window balcony door open at night which kept it cool but also let in a lot of light , Breakfast was sufficient lots of choices good way to start the day Location is central to all touristy things but recommend venturing a few streets away 
284991,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Our room had a window which was facing a wall with sea painted on it to give the impression of sea view but I didn t really find it appealing Room was on the dark side with natural light being restricted , Centrally located with easy access to public transport and airport bus 
284992,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Unfortunately we were at the front of the hotel which was noisy As the air conditioning wasn t on as it was Spring we had to open the windows and it was very noisy at night , Brilliant location superb choice at breakfast Very helpful staff Very comfy pillows 
284993,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The process of check in is awful Room service is bad one day they just clean the room only after 3 pm The personal is very bad explain free and paid services in hotel so you think that is free and then you have to pay The parking problems I got it s another story Nobody in hotel is resposible for papking service but they are ready to collect money for that in the end I was solving the problem with parking company , Location is very nice 
284994,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Just my personal preference but I would have preferred a proper shower rather than a shower over the bath with a shower curtain , This hotel is in a great location for visiting the city and for transport links to and from the airport Very friendly and helpful staff comfortable rooms and extremely clean We were lucky enough to have a room with a terrace which was much appreciated in the warm spring sunshine Excellent breakfast buffet with a wide variety of choices and for the evening there is a lovely restaurant on site We would use this hotel again on a return trip 
284995,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, There was nothing I did not like, Staff were very helpful and the room was very clean and cleaned very well every day We did not book breakfast but there were plenty of places nearby and coffee was available in the room Excellent location
284996,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, 20 for breakfast is too much anywhere The bar is very non descript and pretty much just the hotel lobby but then you re not staying in this brilliant location to drink in the hotel bar , I was lucky to be upgrade to a room with balcony AND private plunge pool Wonderful large room and massive bed too Good massage Don t bother with paying the extra for Spa Access room as the main pool outside is much better This is just a cool jet pool and steam room You can pay 5 on arrival anyway 
284997,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, I thought the cost of breakfast was quite high although there was a good selection of breakfast items i chose to have toast and coffee and thought 20 euros was quite pricey for this , The staff were very welcoming and helpful 
284998,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, We arrived early and before the room was ready The hotel looked after our luggage Unfortunately when we returned later three of our luggage items could not be found The hotel staff hunted for the missing items which were later found after a stressful wait , Pleasant and friendly staff very clean 
284999,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, The HUGE bed was really comfy The hotel was very quiet Location perfect 2 minutes from the aerobus stop and Ramblas The welcome drink is a nice touch

285002,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, a little bit noisy in the night if your windows are on the street size Although it was Friday night , location comfort bed big and good equipped shower room
285003,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Room was a bit noisy due to ventilation system of a nearby building though it will only affect rooms with windows on one side , Perfect location right in the city centre Very nice staff good rooms Pretty good bed in the room everything is clean and nice 
285004,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The staff were generally very inefficient long check in and check out times They also lost my left luggage a, Beautiful building in an excellent location
285005,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, location very close to catalunya plaza Bus stop for the airport bus is very close there are many shops cafes bars and restaurants near the hotel It was convenient to explore the city 
285006,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Bath room was tiny door couldn t widely opened However shower area was vey big Refrigerator was extra small without a freezer , Location is superb very centric yet on a quite street Bad was comfort and room was highly clean 
285007,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, If I was being very picky I would say the room was hot so we had to open the window door at night and outside was a bit noise but no problem at all , A great location near to rather main Lane Rambler I used this to run the Barcelona Marathon who was ideal We didn t use the restaurant thus couldn t mark it Staff really nice and helpful Our room was spotless Will stay here again 
285008,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, Loved this hotel the location and the hotel are great The staff were very helpful and pleasant the rooms and beds were really comfortable and the breakfast was fantastic
285009,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The breakfast price could have been a few euros less if I have to put my finger on something , The beds were great and so was the rest of the room Great coffee at the breakfast service 
285010,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Nothing , Excellent location with walking distance to several attractions and shopping We booked a room with a terrace Friendly and service minded staff Modern and clean rooms 
285011,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Breakfast not good value for money poor selection of hot options which were all actually cold and no way worth 20 per person Found much better in nearby cafes , Clean comfortable and fantastic location
285012,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, Fantastic breakfast selection I would recommend including breakfast as a package deal otherwise it is quite expensive although worth it We stayed in a standard room The bed was the biggest bed I have ever seen and the matteress and pillows were both very comfortable a bit on the hard side Bathroom was quite luxurious The TV selection wasn t as good as we have seen in other hotels for English speaking but then again you re in Barcelona and probably won t want to be in your room much anyway Staff were friendly enough and willing to help Great location Would definitely stay in this hotel again 
285013,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Unfortunately they would not receive a very expensive package that we had to have sent to the hotel and sent it back which was very inconvenient for us ,No Positive
285014,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Even though the rooms had inner doors people in the corridors were very audible We were woken up by the voices and work of the cleaning staff both mornings long before we wanted to be up We had two rooms next to each other On the second morning in the very early hours one of the rooms had a leak in the bathroom The floor was covered with water and the problem was growing A call to reception resulted in many disruptions until finally one of my friends asked if they could be moved to another room so that they could get some sleep Once they were moved those of us in the other room were woken up by what seemed like the demolition of the room next door All of this before 7am Given the lack of sleep my friends requested a late checkout which was granted The hotel offered free breakfast which is usually 15 euro per person and which we hadn t signed up for to begin with not to mention we were planning to now sleep through breakfast Upon checkout I asked the manager if he thought it was appropriate to charge the full amount of the room for the night where there were so many disturbances He quoted us a 20 discount and reminded us that we were offered free breakfast I told him I didn t think that we didn t think the room should be free for that night but surely a free egg and cup of coffee did not compensate for a lack of sleep and missing out on half a day in Barcelona during our weekend away He was quite rude and his attitude towards our discussion is what left us with a negative impression of a hotel which we would otherwise recommend even with the plumbing issue it happens and a less than adequate discount for our inconvenience If we can t rely on polite good service we may as well stay at an airbnb and provide our own services , The location can t be beat The entry is beautiful and the rooms kept very clean General staff was very friendly and helpful 
285015,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, The Hotel was central to everything you can do in Barcelona a short walk away from everything and the atmosphere of an up beat city just outside the door An amazing hotel and amazing city 
285016,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Indoor pool was cold When booking online it was written outdoor pool open all year round however it wasn t It was a construction sight Was told tea facility in the room but there wasn t When I asked for a kettle to make tea they didn t give mugs or tea bags Renovation was being done but we weren t told about it and got no apology The shower was one second freezing cold then burning hot I had to call 4 times to reception until someone came to check CUSTOMER service not good At the time nothing was done then at check out was told we wanted to offer you breakfast for the inconvenience A bit too late You have to walk through reception area to go to the spa in your gown Everyone looks at you If you re slightly insecure you ll hate it , Pool in room balcony Excellent location
285017,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The pool in the spa could do with being a little bigger also some extra weights and machines in the gym wpuld be great , The room was lovely and the free cava was a great treat the balcony pool was absolutely fantastic and the room was very clean and spacious 
285018,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Noise from elevator Pool closed Very disappointing Room cleaned at 6 pm I wouldn t recommend this place at all Apart from its location ,No Positive
285019,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, i would like to eat something in the hotel restaurant whenever i want it is impossible because the restaurant doesnt open at 4 pm , hotel location is amazing so closed the city center and underground 
285020,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, There was a weird disturbing smell No idea what it was but it was horrible and after some days we thought that the smell was actually all over Barcelona So it might not be the hotel but it was disturbing and even we were in a floor it was getting to us so we thought that it must have been the sewer system or something Another minor thing is that the balcony doors were not actually closing But they were double double doors so this did not affect us at all , Everything was excellent apart from one thing One thing that possibly the hotel was not responsible for See the things I did not like for this Now staff was super friendly with twice coming to the room morning and afternoon to clean and check everything was alright and give us that special little chocolate sweet Very attentive clean comfortable the location is just AMAZING everything you need is just 5 seconds away we even managed to see the three mages parade Very very nice 
285021,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, There was no iron in the room but there was a same day ironing service just handy to know in advance Staff were very helpful though , Quality of the room and location of the hotel was fantastic couldn t have asked for better for a city break 
285022,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, I could not find one fault , Good breakfast Staff were friendly and very helpful comfortable beds and lovely pillows splash pool on our terrace Central location 
285023,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Air conditioning not working Apparently it is switched off in winter but the rooms were very hot even with the heating off We ended up sleeping with the balcony door wide open which is fine if you can sleep through traffic noise, The only hotel we stayed in during our stay which had tea and coffee making facilities in the room Very important if your first priority when you wake up in the morning is a cup of tea or coffee
285024,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, They upgraded us without asking to a room that had a pool as it was the middle of winter we could not use is so basically got a standard room the reason why the room was booked was for the spa bath in the room when we asked for our normal room they then said that it had been given away Didn t feel I got value for my money, Comfort of the bed and the cleanliness of the room also we received a free bottle of champagne
285025,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Bar wasn t great but bar staff very friendly helpful, Excellent area close to everything Staff very friendly rooms lovely Staff couldn t have been more friendly
285026,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Everything was great so no complaints , Well situated for shops restaurants transport Hotel staff were very helpful and polite The hotel room was spacious clean and quiet and I will definitely recommend it to friends 
285027,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, the breakfast should have been included in the price, We liked the location a lot Also the private pool the sauna and the free mini bar were appreciated a lot 
285028,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, We didn t have breakfast because the cost seemed high Maybe it was value for money but can t comment on that , The rooms were spacious and well equipped Staff were extremely courteous and helpful great location 
285029,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Outdoor pool we paid extra for was cold however they said heated Heating and aircon did not work and it got very warm and night Staff did not help to sort this out just kept sending maintenance and doing nothing about it No discount was offered considering we paid 440 euros for 2 nights , Lovely spa and room Location was perfect 
285030,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Nothing , The staff couldn t have been more helpful From the maid coming round in the evenings with extra towels and chocolates to a surprise bottle of cava and fresh fruit left in the room for my birthday we hadn t even told them 
285031,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Jobworks happened all day in the hotel there was a lot of noise you have to pay 5 euros to enter the spa where there are only 4 chairs a hammam and a tiny pool which I think is too expensive with the room price, Personnel at reception Spa personnel
285032,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, Perfect location and great value for money Staff were very friendly and looked after luggage outside of check in times bags were in room when we arrived back Didn t use the Hotel restaurant but looked very nice Beds were very comfortable and room was very large and spacious 6th floor with terrace Couldn t fault this hotel at all 
285033,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, it is a bit of a construction site at the moment The pool is closed with rebuilding going on from 0800 1900 Drilling and construction noise all day from the 1st floor Had to move rooms , The location was great just off the square The beds were really comfy the best pillows ever The staff very helpful when we complained about the noise 
285034,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Due to a technical issue I had not Wi Fi connection which created some inconvenience From a 4 stars hotel I would expect an alternative solution , Excellent location and building Room clean and very nice staff 
285035,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Very basic dated hotel Walls are paper thin and you could hear every single noise outside the door walls ceiling Our noise displeasure was topped off with building working commencing directly outside our window at 0800 Very inconsiderate Hotel foyer bar was very disappointing for a 4 star hotel Rooms were very clean although bed sheets were so rough it was like sleeping on a sack No quilt just dusty blanket and sheets Air conditioning didn t work either Overall very disappointing would not recommend or stay again , Location is fantastic 
285036,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, It was very noisy Construction was going on and there were some facilities out of action which was a shame They also need more staff on at the front desk , Great location comfortable
285037,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, an extra chair in the room would be useful but we just brought one in from the terrace so no problem , We enjoyed the decor of the room and loved the terrace 
285038,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Nothing , The service was good facilities was okay the place is somuch comfortable to stay very close to shopping area and city center so generous hotel was surprising us with champagne whitewine during the night to start our christmas dinner Everyday they re cleaning the room so clean and nice hotel and very good staff Before you enter the door the smells of a fresh flowers welcoming you was relaxing smells So much satisfied i d love to go back there next holidays So satisfied with the service and nice place to stay 
285039,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, I chose the hotel also for the reason to use its spa small in house swimming pool and sauna but during our stay the spa was closed for some reason Very disappointing We were suggested to use the facilities in the neibouring location but that took a walk also the swimming pool was very crowded , Location of the hotel is perfect It is very central and quiet at the same time
285040,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The swimming pool was closed and it was not mentioned during booking the hotel in the web site The staff offered to use another one in a place 5 min away from the hotel We got only one set for the bathroom shampoo tooth brush and ect the first day we arrived It was partly fixed when I asked We heard very loud doors closing noise in the corridor early morning or late night , It a very good location in the city center 
285041,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, A lift was quite small and nothing , Even though my room was not up to date but quite cozy A bed was as large as a playground because it was made with 2 beds The location was great for shopping breakfast was so nice 
285042,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Room tip we got room 122 and it was really claustrophobic as had no windows Definitely ask at reception about your room The manager was great and moved us to a better room Spa also very tiny and have to pay to use No changing facilities , Location is perfect Rooms lovely Bathroom and shower great Clean
285043,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, I cannot think of a single thing , I couldn t be happier with the hotel We stayed there for my girlfriends birthday so I asked if there was anything they could do for her They upgraded us to a superior room free of charge and then in the evening before we went out they brought a bottle of prosecco up along with some fruit Such a lovely gesture The hotel staff were brilliant and so helpful The room was a good size The bathroom was spacious and the shower was decent The bed was huge and extremely comfortable The location was great right at the top of La Rambla and really central for all the other places we wanted to go and see There is the Catalunya metro station right next to the hotel which has good links to most places you could want to go This was my first stay in Barcelona all my future stays will undoubtedly be at this hotel we loved it that much and I can t praise it highly enough 
285044,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, Asked for double bed when we booked On arrival we were upgraded to a larger room with double bed free of charge Breakfast choice was exceptional particularly the omelette cooked to order 
285045,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, there was heavy construction in the hotel and the heavy noice start early morning around 8 am and very very close to my room I was there for weekend holiday and couldn t sleep and feel comfort even no one of the stuff mention this issue for me if i know in advance i won t book in this hotel at all,No Positive
285046,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Very expensive breakfast 19 euro per person There is no need to book Near the hotel there are many cafes and you can have breakfast for 3 5 euro per person , It is a good place to stay in Barcelona In the city center Plaza Catalunya Near Lambra street Very convenient access to the airport During the 20 minute drive from the airport to Plaza Catalunya and back to the airport with the Aerobus transport Ticket price 5 9 euros The hotel rooms are large clean and comfortable Very comfortable and large bed No noise 
285047,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, Loved the location such a lovely woman working in housekeeping on the 5th floor the hole weekend 8 11 des 2016 the spa was great and i will deffinetly use this hotel again After all location location location 
285048,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, The hotel is in a brilliant location within walking distance of all public transport Rooms are very comfortable and spotless Really good hotel staff are very helpful would definitely stay there again 
285049,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Staff ignored our requests First room was a 2 floor room with a small stair and this was not said in any way at Booking or any other site I have to emphasize anything we asked of front desk staff needed to be asked 3 or 4 times We were very disappointed with the hotel and will search for another one next time we go to Barcelona, Breakfast was very good Location of the property is very good
285050,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Very fair hotel Nothing more The breakfast area is too smelly You really need a shower after having it there Maybe because it s in the basement , Location
285051,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, A bit old renovation needed and a bit expensive , Perfect location clean internet polite and friendly personal descent room and bathroom great but an expensive breakfast 
285052,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, There wasn t anything we didn t like The only thing to make it better would be an indoor pool not likely in central Barcelona , You can t beat the location It is centrally located to major transport networks and many tourist spots Besides the location the hotel staff were friendly and offered us several recommendations for meals The rooms were clean and stocked with all necessary amenities The breakfast buffet included freshly made to order eggs as well as a wide assortment of breads and pastries meats yogurt etc 
285053,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, At times the room became uncomfortably warm and AC wasn t great, Good choice at breakfast free wifi heated outdoor pool nice shower comfy room Complimentary bottle of cava on 1st night Location is city centre and close to everything
285054,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, WiFi down for several hours Staff did not communicate the breakfast was already paid They believe me only at the 3rd confirmation Building will need some renovation , Staff in general Breakfast Location Room
285055,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, Welcoming and supportive staff each floor has its own housekeeper which is available for any need couple of steps away Location is perfect rooms are well equipped and clean simply loved it 
285056,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Lightening in bathroom quite poor very busy with local events and coach parties it also seemed that some of the guests were staying there curtsey of the local government didn t have breakfast there at 19 euros but ate one night there which was very good and reasonable priced my friend had difficulty sleeping with so much noise of scrapping chairs in the room above , My friend and l each had a bedroom with balcony which was worth the extra money bed good and bathroom of course excellent location with good places for breakfast in same street would stay there again
285057,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Bathrooms were newly renovated but had no railings to hang any of the hand towels , Perfectly located within a minutes walk to La Rambla and other main attractions Comfortable and modern rooms friendly staff and lovely hotel overall 
285058,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Breakfast is good but not included Extra cost is a little high , Superb location and excellent staff Good restaurant on site and the spa treatments are top quality 
285059,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Breakfast too expensive if you don t each much in the mornings , Excellent new facilities in bedroom which included a built in charger and two TVs There was a complimentary bottle of water and truffles Excellent location Hope to be back and will recommend hotel to friends 
285060,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, No air cTo sleep in a stuffy room with the window closedonditioning or ventilation Or with the window open listening to the conversation with the street It may be the summer differently, excellent location with respect to the subway old town tourist routes Clean comfortable room
285061,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, My wife and I booked treatments at the Spa on location I had a massage and it was great but my wife had a facial and she said the therapist was not very experienced and got product in her eyes twice But the hotel was great , The room was great and the staff were very helpful and friendly My wife and I have a small baby and my wife said the staff were very accommodating Breakfast was a nice variety 
285062,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Expensive add on for breakfast Cross the road to find a really great local cafe restaurant or coffee chains I didn t request a non smoking room wrongly assumed the hotel was non smoking like in some other countries the room had a smell of smoke , Great location Easy access Room with a balcony was lovely for some fresh air Business facilities and meeting rooms available 
285063,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Can t think of any negatives , Very helpful and friendly staff Excellent room in new section with early check in Close to transport and attractions of central Barcelona beside Las Ramblas 
285064,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Small lobby, Although the hotel itself was very clean and comfortable the surroundings outside was quite seedy looking The proximity to all major points of interest especially the Las Ramblas and the transportation stops more than made up for this shortcoming
285065,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Rooms could be a little more quiet there is great insolation from outside but you could hear through the walls I had to hail my own taxi 4 30 in the morning not good , Location Staff was excellent 
285066,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Receptionist was quite rude and also the spa receptionist they both need to learn some manners and remember that smiling doesn t cost a thing , great location clean sheets
285067,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, We paid a lot of money for a 5 night stay and unfortunately our evening flight to Batcelona was delayed so we didn t arrive at the hotel until midnight We were allocated a nice room which was modern and nicely decorated Sadly at 7 30 in the morning the shop refurbishment next door started and we were woken by a hammer drill drilling into the wall The hotel staff moved us to a suite on the 7th floor which had great views but had tired decor and electrics that tripped out when we used the iron Value for money was poor and I wouldn t return again , The location was very close to everything which was very handy We used room service a couple of times which was prompt courteous and the food was good 
285068,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Wifi signal could have been stronger and more stable Bathroom was excellent in general but some of the fittings could use a little maintenance and sprucing up Breakfast rather expensive , Great location Friendly staff 
285069,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, No supplementary water No iron No scale There was a streem of ants in front of my room Only one slow left is availabe Bathroom door is glass and cannot be locked, The location is near the rambla metro station The lighting is brighter than other hotels 
285070,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Our first room an upgrade leaked from the bathroom above Obviously not a new problem from the staining we could see but the hotel was still using the room We were moved It seems the upgrade consisted of a kettle as the next room didn t have one cups teas coffee but no kettle The unhelpful man on reception said not all rooms had a kettle Over 200 a night and no kettle A kettle duly arrived Poor No sound insulation between rooms we could hear normal conversation from the room next door The disco A room on the ground floor was hired for a party We were on the third floor and it was as if we were in the disco No sleep before 1 a m Attempts to contact reception went unanswered perhaps they couldn t hear the phone above the music One member of reception acted as if he was always doing us a favour Too many poor points be considered a good stay Other guests paying just over 100 a night what happened to Booking com s guarantee , Great front door I m not joking the carving on the door is wonderful Perfect location ideal for the metro straight onto La Rambla but just off the main square and so little street noise Huge bathroom although the decor would not be our choice and a good range of complementary items Useful when flying with only hand luggage Comfy huge bed No noise from outside see what we didn t like Excellent range at breakfast but like nearly all hotels it is buffet style The hotel restaurant was great Innovative menu well prepared and excellent value We never eat in hotel restaurants we ate in this one twice When the hotel got it wrong which they did we were offered complementary cava and chocolates Most of the staff were friendly and helpful 
285071,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Nothing I will definitely go back there, Everything but we loved the spacious terrace off of our room We spend late nights there sipping wine and making plans 
285072,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, Lovely staff and very enjoyable stay Made our anniversary extra special by giving us a bottle of bubbles on the house Thank you we had a great time 
285073,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Older hotel and not much in terms of soundproofing I could hear noisy neighbors , When I asked for a different room due to noise they were VERY accomodating Extra perks like a bottle of champagne on arrival You cannot beat the location though 
285074,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The bar in the evening was not permanently staffed so you had to wait on occasions for someone to come from elsewhere, the pool area was lovely the hotel location was excellent
285075,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The view from our room was onto the back of building works For a superior room our room was small The service at the bar was very very poor waited a lengthy time on 3 occasions, Maids came to room in evening to leave fresh robes chocolates this was lovely Location excellent
285076,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Had a problem with printing my boarding pass but not a big deal , The location was absolutely fantastic convenient to everything a first time visitor to Barcelona would want to see 
285077,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The hotel is old not well kept not a four star hotel You cannot get into your room till after 2 00pm maybe some guests do I checked out at 6 15 this room should have been cleaned and available by 9 00am, Location very central 5 minute walk to bus to from airport Staff helpful
285078,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Room had a few things that needed repair or maintenance , It is I a great location close to the main Plaza but on a side street Lots to do an see around it The staff were very friendly and helpful Great balcony 
285079,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Restaurant was okay but in my opinion lacked the wow factor , Beautiful hotel fantastic maid service always greeted with a smile friendly reception service The beds were very comfortable with big step in shower clean towels every day and beds changed frequent with chocolates left on bed every night The room we had was nice and quite with a good size safe which included a 3 pin plug socket to charge phone or tablet good idea This hotel is in a excellent position and very clean 
285080,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, No breakfast included in our deal and an extra 19 per person if you wanted it which I thought was rather expensive so we went down the road an had a good breakfast for half the price, Clean and comfortable perfect location for exploring the city would use again
285081,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The room was hold really need to be up grade the bed wasn t comfortable The wall of the terrace was crack need to be repair and paint The drapery was not in good condition and the wall in the room need to be repair So the price is not a good value at all , The location of the hotel was great
285082,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, No negatives, Fantastic location Close to absolutely everything Always found our room cleaned Complimentary bottle of water coffee tea facilities was great Just loved how the maid would leave small chocolates for us all after a day out about Great Holiday will definitely visit again 
285083,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The staff seemed short handed We checked in early to our junior suite and was told our luggage would be brought up to us in 5 10 minutes 40 minutes later and still no luggage so we called the front desk and was told her colleague was busy so we came down and got our luggage instead The next day we asked for two more towels and they never came Seemed a little ridiculous given how much we paid for the suite, Junior suite was very spacious and modern A lot of different amenities
285084,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Nothing we didnt like, Starting from the 100 unbeaten amazing LOCATION to the entrance of the hotel the atmosphere and nice smell at the lobby makes you happier right away Staff are so nice and helpful rooms are very nice and clean cleaning service is very good and several times a day generous with the bathroom amenities Automatic upgrade of the room was a very nice gesture welcome drinks at the bar Although it is a little bit expensive but we didn t regret it at all Worth every penny Can t speak enough about the location it is the best for any type of activity we intended to do even better location than the other 5 stars very luxurious hotels 
285085,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The toilet door was opaque and didn t close completely there was a good inch gap to the door frame The toilet was situated right next to the entry door Hence you didn t want to be in the toilet or bathroom when the entry door was opened Plus you could hear everything happening in the hallway , Loved the little enclosed balcony alcove off the room even though it did get very hot in there Plenty of places to eat and grab a coffee close by The hotel breakfast is quite expensive for the price of one breakfast at the hotel we bought toasted sandwiches and coffees at Starbucks situated across the road for 3 adults 
285086,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, Fantastic location We had a street view could be a bit noisy at times but we didn t mind Our room was great and spotlessly clean Not sure what the rooms are like on the pool side though 
285087,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, We used the pool area a couple of times and the pool water was really cold some heating would be appreciated , Perfect location just off the busy streets and very quiet for Barcelona We booked a superior room and it was worth the extra money Staff were all very professional and helpful and the breakfast was really good with lots of choice Saving up to visit again 
285088,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, In the heart of all tourists attractions We walked everywhere We stayed in the room with a private pool Not a spa on the balcony which made a great cooling down spot after a long day with our friends in a hot humid Barcelona
285089,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, We did have an ongoing issue with our door lock but after we changed rooms it was great The room was smaller but still comfortable , The room was spacious and comfortable and the staff were very professional and helpful 
285090,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Doors slamming loudly at night as people returned back in the early hours Why no dampener on doors Pool water was not very clean, Central location
285091,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, Excellent location close to La Rambla and Placa Catalunya but yet on a rather calm street The breakfast was really good and the staff in the reception were helpfull 
285092,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, There is no Air Conditioning in the lobby sometimes its too hot to stay there Also the room A c takes alot of time to be cool , The location was very good breakfast was pretty good aswell 
285093,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, We had 2 separate stays here and both times booking in was not pleasant Both times we were asked to pay for the accomodation before we were allocated a room Our credit card was charged for the first stay of 2 days before we had even left Sydney it was credited back before we arrived We paid cash When we arrived back 4 weeks later for 5 nights the credit was not charged but we were again asked to pay for the room before we were allocated one Now having received the credit card bill today I find a charge from this hotel for A 275 94 dated 23 August when we were in Cordoba not a pleasant experience, Good position
285094,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Unfortunately building work was going on in s building only two doors down So the noise of the drills was quite incessant , Central location decent size room and terrace along with a pool area The staff were always friendly and helpful 
285095,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The pool was really small and quit unsafe the stairs moved and floor around pool was uneven and moved when walked on, The staff were amazing and the hotel was lovely and clean
285096,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Couldn t really find anything wrong Price was expensive but was in the centre so that is to be expected , Bed very comfy fluffy white towels large bathroom with toiletries Excellent location 
285097,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The whole trip was really very good so I m not going to nic pic because the positives well out weighed the negative by a long shot , Location for a city break is very good right in the centre the tour buses are about 100 metre s away just get of and on went you want so much to see hotel clean and neat the staff are very nice and helpful so overhaul we loved the whole trip P s just booked today coming next year for a week so much to see and do Mr Mrs mills 
285098,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Only tiny gripe was the sliding door wardrobes the doors were very stiff and sometimes came off the runners , Location was brilliant easy to walk anywhere within central Barcelona Pool was a bonus and prices for drinks around the pool reasonable Family room overlooking the pool was quiet certainly no noise from street or other residents in the hotel when we stayed Staff very helpful and gave great tips on places to eat Would definitely recommend 
285099,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, There was only one garbage box in the room and it was in the bathroom , First of all hotel s location is very good Just a 30 40 metre walk and you are in placa catalunya Room and the bathroom was clean and decorated well and they had space Housekeeping was tidying up the room 2 3 times a day Personnel is always smiling and trying to help you You don t need to enter wi fi password everytime you want to get connected 
285100,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, My wallet got stolen from the room itself Unreliable cleaning staff and suggest visitors take extreme precaution You won t get any help from management if you loose anything High time they have camera on all floors , Location is good
285101,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Our room smelled like a dumpster The hotel manager came to the room and agreed there was a major problem with the AC He promised compensation and we never received anything , Nothing
285102,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The breakfast was uninspiring Hot croissants and a few slices of cheese would have made all the difference , The lighting was superb sadly I was too sleepy to enjoy reading in bed for too long Everything else classy and a pleasure 
285103,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Really enjoyed our stay although we spent very little time at the hotel with so much to do and see We did have a lovely meal at the hotel one evening which was really good value and tasty cheaper than some of the meals we had outside Great to have the pool and a G T at the outdoor bar Staff were good although service not always with a smile they were efficient and very accommodating ,No Positive
285104,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, We enjoyed this hotel very much The location is wonderful very central 1 minute walk from the central square Plaza de Catalunya from where you can make city tours by bus The service in the hotel was very good the staff is very helpful and friendly Rooms are comfortable and clean We had one at the back of the hotel I can not judge how it is on the street side it might be noisy at times We only ate one time breakfast not included in the price in the hotel during our 3 nights stay No complaints at all It was very good But there are many places around the square and on Las Ramblas where you can eat a good and cheaper breakfast Overall we left the hotel with very positive feelings and definitely will come back to this hotel when we return to Barcelona one of the most beautiful cities I have ever visited 
285105,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, When booking my credit card was charged without my knowledge and then I paid again upon arrival It was only after the double payment appeared on my bill and after calling did I find out the first charge was a deposit for the card and I would have to wait 7 business days for the refund still waiting Had I known this policy I would not have booked and probably won t book again as I have to wait for my money to be returned At almost 400 Canadian a night this is ridiculous This policy should have been told to me upon my arrival , I enjoyed the location and the hotel overall Price was ok for what was available 
285106,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, There was building works going on next door to the hotel so it was very noisy in one of the rooms that we booked but we were moved to another quieter and better room with a small balcony as soon as i mentioned the problem and the staff were most helpful I felt the additional cost for breakfast was high i had my three teenage children with me and because they are all over 12 we were all charged full price i felt some leeway would have been nice especially as they don t eat a great deal , The room that we booked with a private pool was much better than expected the pool was much bigger than it looked in the photos and was well worth the additional cost
285107,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Room rates were pricey , The breakfast buffet is great but a little pricey Staff gave excellent service and attention Room was comfortable and all amenities were top class 
285108,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Long wait to check in We were told that our room may not be ready We were fuming as we arrived at 15 h For the price the place can t be qualified as clean Dusty bins always full Empty bottle on our floor stayed there during our stay Ceilling in bathroom opened with dusty pipes To top it all we were welcome by a huge cockroach at the reception See pictures below Is this really a four star hotel What a joke , Location
285109,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Beds were a little firm for our tastes The air conditioning was not cooling the room efficiently There was not enough space for our luggage , The hotel located right off Placa Catalunya so everything is within the walking distance Staff is friendly and trying their best to accommodate guests requests Room was just the right size and had everything necessary for a comfortable stay Breakfast had a variety of foods to start your day on the positive note 
285110,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The is the first time that I stay in a hotel in which housekeeping did not change the sheets every day even when there had been a very noticeable makeup spill on them The wifi in our room kept going in and out We couldn t always unlock our door and it was frustrating that we complained to three other employees at the front desk with no resolution It was a bit annoying to find that because the pool was not on the top floor there were very limited hours to get sun it was mid July but the sun only reached the pool area from approximately 12 30 or 1 00 to about 5 30 It also would have been nice to have had a free bottle of water in the room or at least a jug to a glass of water in the lobby , Very nice hotel in a FANTASTIC location Easy access to the direct airport bus and just meters away from Plaza Catalunya Las Ramblas Casa Mila and Casa Batllo We had various problems opening the door to our room but once I spoke to the manager about the door he took care of it immediately He really went out of his way to make the rest of the stay a wonderful experience Overall the whole staff was friendly The prices of beverages at the pool and the pizza were very reasonable and the breakfast buffet was great but very expensive 
285111,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The hotel is well situated and the room is great we had the junior suite That being said the problem is that we were robbed the FIRST day we got there we discovered the robbery the next morning I know that Barcelona is famous for it s pickpockets but to be robbed inside the hotel inside the room from INSIDE THE SAFE That ought to be a first Our money 1250 which is not an enormous amount but still a sizable one was stolen from INSIDE THE SAFE in our room by probably a staff member more than probably honestly what other option is there We spoke with the hotel vice manager who told us that the only people who went in our room were from room service who don t have access to the safe spare key the safe does not close with a code but with a key and that there is nothing that the hotel can do We actually had the distinct feeling that he did not even believe us He told us that we have to file a police complaint so that the police can come take finger and ear prints yes as if we re inside a CSI episode and so that he can send the report to the insurance After spending all morning at the police station for a useless complaint we gave the report to the hotel so they can send it to the insurance company and that was it We barely had the right to a we re sorry that happened but it s very crazy and weird No compensation no reimbursement no room upgrade not even a complementary breakfast not that we cared about any upgrades or complementary offerings but it s a question of principle and this disinterest carelessness and doubting is actually worse than the robbery itself One day prior to the check out i e , Great location
285112,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, 1 Cleaning rooms time schedule we experienced cleaning room around14 00pm 14 30 pm Maybe not disturbing for other guests but we returned to our room around this hours and many times we just asked the cleaning lady to replace toiletries only 2 Noise from surrounding site constructions 3rd floor room on pool side for sure it s a temporary situation but sound of drilling hammers wasn t pleasant Anyway was the quietest side of the hotel , 1 Best location very close to many touristic sites El Corte Ingles supermarket La Rambla Plaza Catalunya Passeig de Gracia Battlo La Pedrera Gaudi Houses Barcelona cathedral Palau Guell walking distance Very easy access to means of transport local bus metro aerobus to other attractions Sagrada Park Guell National Art Museum Catalunya 2 Short time waiting for checking in max 15 min Very friendly and helpful staff at reception 3 Courtesy treat at arrival 2 glasses of red wine while waiting for checking in and later on the same day a plate with sliced fruits an 80g chocolate and a bottle of wine This was a good surprise as we were coming from a 9 nights stay at the same hotel chain Catalonia in Madrid Catalonia Gran Via were we received a 1 5l bottle of water 4 Room design even small superior double room type smart divided with an extra couch but without balcony 5 Spa facility open until 21 00pm Turkish bath jacuzzi 2 water falls very relaxing not very big but not crowed 4 beds available 6 Swimming pool 1 2 m in depth 9m X 4m in size approx sizes sorry if mistaken Even if number of sunbeds was not enough frequent situation for hotels with such facility was not so disturbing 7 Wi fi very good no problem with signal or log in
285113,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, The staff were very helpful and pleasant The room was spacious and kept very clean and comfortable Location was perfect can walk to major areas beach market
285114,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Hotel decor needs to be updated No assistance to get chairs etc at pool despite some guests having loungers and tables chairs , Central location Pleasant staff 
285115,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The rooms were much smaller and older than we had expected for the price and 5 star rating We opted for a terrace room but it overlooked dirty looking roofs of the nearby buildings and yes the small hotel pool if you stuck your head over the railing to look straight down So that was disappointing and we wouldn t recommend paying extra for it , Good central location for what we wanted It is closer to city things but still walkable from the beach and associated restaurants and nightlife 30 min walk from beach Very close to the Barcelona Cathedral The staff was very helpful and had extra amenities like a plug adapter that we were able to borrow 
285116,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, The staff were excellent The location and the little extras like a drink on arrival chocolates in your room were perfect The bar served delicious food in the day and everybody from the front of house staff to the waiting on staff couldn t do enough to ensure your stay was perfect Special mention to Maria who served us at the Pool 
285117,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Food very expensive and poor quality No tea making facilities in room , Location and maids were great cleaning the room Staff at reception were friendly and helpful 
285118,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Swimming pool is very shalllow and small only good for little children not for adult If adult will swim it s only up to waist line , Very clean and they even checked our room twice a day to tidy it up They always top up the toiletries and towel as well Very friendly staff and chambermaid 
285119,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, We requested an early check in Not only was that not available but when we returned at 2 pm normal check in time our room was still not available Also the safe in our room was broken, Excellent location
285120,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, front desk employees should be more helpful and be more knowledgeable about museums restaurants and such Several times I was given wrong or no info Rooms need a facelift,No Positive
285121,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Pool was quite tiny and did not open until 10 on the morning , Perfect location Room very nice recently renovated and even better than in the pictures Helpful and friendly staff 
285122,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, There was no wifi the 5 days we were there The rooms on the pool were very noisy but the staff did accommodate us and move us to the other side , The receptionist Claudia was very helpful the location is brilliant 
285123,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Told at Reception to leave one room card in the power slot inside the room so the Air Con would stay on Came back Cleaner had removed it Room was then stifling hot and took a long time to cool down Also lots of problems with key cards not working Breakfast too expensive, Location
285124,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, I would have liked a thicker blanket on the bed it was a little cold and the blanket was very thin , The staff were friendly and quite nice The location was excellent 
285125,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, there wasn t anything I could fault with my stay here , I booked very last minute and the hotel and staff were fantastic they even gave me a free upgrade which was nice The room was fantastic and I would sefonately go back here
285126,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The Spa was a bit disappointing, I thought it was a lovely hotel It maintained the historic aesthetics in the lobby interior but upgraded the floors and rooms to a contemporary style Also loved that it was within walking distance to main attractions and the airport bus 
285127,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, that we had to go home , What a gem Literally on our second trip back to BCN in under a month we stumbled on a great deal on this hotel The location is amazing and literally a stroll onto the beautiful heart that is Catalonia Square Room was a like an awesome 1 bedroom apartment with a massive bathroom While we didnt get to use the facilities since the city was so alive they seemed to be great 
285128,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Drilling in the hotel all day until late evening My partner had a migraine that day and this made it worse We informed reception on check out and were fobbed off There was no mention of building works at time of booking, Location
285129,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, There was nothing that we didn t like , Our stay at Hotel Catalonia was simply amazing From exceptional staff and cleanliness of our room to chocolate delivery in the afternoon after Siesta time We highly recommend this hotel to anyone who likes to be in the middle of the wonderful Barcelona since its position is within walking distance to everything you are there to experience From heart of Las Ramblas to Gaudi architecture to Basilica of Santa Maria Del Mar and all its charming cafes and shops 
285130,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, I would like tea coffee facilities available in the room More TV channels in English, The staff were welcoming and efficient The beds were comfortable and the room and bathroom were very clean The location is superb The food offered at breakfast is varied well presented and plentiful 
285131,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Nothing I would book this hotel again hands down , The hotel was clean comfortable and beautiful Modern but with so much character and charm Every toiletry you can imagine was provided as well as slippers and robes We went as a family myself 26 and my parents They loved the location It was their first time in Barcelona You are at head of Las Ramblas where all the action is steps away from the topless tour busses best restaurants and much more At the heart of it all but yet the room was quiet and comfortable curtains allowed the room to be dark included great air conditioning that you can custom to your liking very cold like we like it The pool was amazing relaxing but fun with great music being played The breakfast is absolutely amazing Beautiful abundant and great selection My father is allergic to gluten we couldn t have been happier that the hotel had so many gluten free options including bread muffins etc ABOVE ALL I loved the fact that no matter how many times a day we left whether to eat to explore or attend an event upon our arrival our room was always clean an tidy Thank you for the delicious chocolates next to the beds 
285132,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, You have to pay extra to use the SPA The door of the turkish bath didn t work and we ve been looked inside for like 10 minutes before that someone came to help us terrible experience I had another disappointing experience I forgot the key of my room inside and when I asked the staff to send someone to open it they forced me to go down to the reception even if I told them that I was not wearing appropriate clothes I was in swimwear I was very imbarassed because there were many people at the reception and the member of the staff who gave me the copy of the key of my room was laughing at me I found this very unprofessional , The hotel is located in a beautiful area of the city in the very city center 
285133,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Unfortunately there was a lot of noise from the airco system and from work on the building next to the hotel The self service breakfast is very good but hygiene is poor because some of the guests touch the food with their fingers instead of using the cutlery and than put it back on the tray again As for the staff some of them are nice others are not The swimming pool was very small and it was not possible to take a swimm after breakfast because the area was still being cleaned at that time much too late I would say This hotel is very unique in a peculiar way It is the only hotel I ever encountered where the bill had to be paid at arrival instead of departure , the hotel Catalonia Plaza Catalunya is located near the city center in a quiet street The location couldn t be better 
285134,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Everything was perfect although we didn t have the breakfast as it was priced too high Nineteen euros for breakfast is too high Would be nice if they offered an ala carte breakfast at a discounted price , Everything was lovely All of the extra toiletries and slippers were a treat Great coffee and tea choices in room Wonderful terrace Wish we could have stayed longer 
285135,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Can t think of anything to improve maybe free English newspapers , Absolutely fabulous hotel great rooms hug bathroom every toiletry item thought of Breakfast was superb fresh baked pastries freshly squeezed juices excellent cooked food Even managed a complementary Bloody Mary You cannot beat the location for exploring Barcelona
285136,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Our room wasn t ready on arrival so we had to wait nearly 2 hours before we could get settled into our room We had no wifi during our stay either The air con also didn t work which was a struggle on such a hot night , The location private pool and comfy bed was superb And when we had problems with our stay the reception manager was incredibly helpful 
285137,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, When I checked out the staff assisted another guest when I had clearly been waiting some time Also noted that the other guest was requested to take a survey and I was not Seems to be disorganised at reception, Room was clean and comfortable Nice private balcony Hotel is close to Plaza Catalunya and Las Rambles but not too close and was quiet 
285138,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Room not cleaned one day WiFi didnt work for 2 days pool very small and not enough lounge chairs getting a drink from the bar took very long You have to pay full amount upon arrival No compensation was offered for any of the inconveniences , The location is great nice private terrace 
285139,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, It wasn t a cheap place but good value for the money , The location was great and so close to all the activities Staff were very good and the breakfast very good 
285140,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Triple room small for 3 adults and they assumed we were 2 adults and one child so things like shampoo robes etc always only 2 but when we asked they were happy to provide, Fantastic breakfast and location 
285141,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, One of the bed doesn t have a main leg how is that sounds My wife discovered that only after a fall Should be a lesson learnt for the hotel team , Location

285143,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Nothing , The rooms are comfortable and clean The Location is great Just a short distance you can get an AEROBUS to the Airport Very Convenient We had to wait about 15 mins for our rooms at 2pm and were given free welcome drinks 
285144,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Room was a bit tight shower very small water temperature kept changing but overall a great hotel, Great location friendly staff comfortable beds air con worked well tv stations were pretty good
285145,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Bad breakfast nothing to eat Small and old fashioned lobby and elevators not so clean lobby Small spa it s not for free and the jacuzzi was cold sauna and pool too To sum up not worth the money , Nice staff Amazing beds and big rooms Pretty good location
285146,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Poor signage as to where pool was Signs on elevator do not say what floor pool is on Had to call for toilet paper really in a 4 star hotel No staff available to work set up omelet station in breakfast room we were there at 7 00 am when dining room opened Towels by pool hard to find also , The food choices were good the hospitality i e Brought cava to our room with a platter of fruit on our first night nice touch They made us breakfast to go when we needed to leave for airport at 5 30 am Courteous staff 
285147,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Receptionists need better training and should have good command of speaking English , Very comfortable excellent location and spa is great Staffs are helpful 
285148,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Check in was chaos Needs massive renovation Breakfast was awful and at 20 euros extremely overpriced Asked for nonsmoking room it smelled of smoke as did the mattress and as for non smoking it s more of a suggestion Also if you want a safe ask for hardware at check in or you ll have to go back down to the front desk good luck with that , The location was good 
285149,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Problematic shawer Water flood the floor Very slow reception desk The parking is Expenssive and problematic Minimal bathroom facillities aircondition does not function well when the weather is hot , Location Bed Pool 
285150,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, I have been to Barcelona on 4 previous occasions and highly recommend this hotel nothing to highlight , Firstly the hotel was only yards away from the center where we were able to access tour bus and airport bus which was only Euro 5 95 we had always taken a taxi which was Euro 40 Secondly everything about this hotel was great I stayed here with both my sisters and they could not find one fault with our choice of hotel The room breakfast staff all excellent no matter where in the hotel we went Furthermore our room was made up to with such a high standard on our second day we sought out our room maid and give her a tip much to her surprise Lastly the shopping was fantastic basically at the top of Les Rambles and within walking distance to hotel Definitely book your stay here 
285151,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, This room was booked the night before as a last minute anniversary plan The room was beautifully decorated complete with balcony The value for money was excellent and was exactly what we were looking for The location could not have been better being right on Playa de Catalunya and is perfect for walking to the city s attractions aswell as a metro station and tourist bus stop The staff were very helpful in helping us organise a restaurant and other sightseeing arrangements Truly a first class experience 
285152,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Room service was very limited , We got a great speaking I also which made this excellent value for money Fantastic location great room and verandah Great pool and other facilities

285155,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Reception staff in general kind of indifferent Not rude but not friendly either just performing job but overall who cares as long as you dont need them more than a check in and check out, Location location location Rooms very nice On the small side but nicely furnished and kept Cleaned on daily basis and bed turned down at night Breakfast was good not a wow facture but really nice You will receive a welcome drink at the bar which is a good touch Internet is free and speed is really good Works very well in all areas I had a room with balcony which was nice 
285156,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, It wasn t really worth the extra price for the balcony I would have liked to use it but neighbors on both sides were smokers and would go out onto their balcony to smoke That was really disappointing , The room size and bed were very comfortable And making use of the on site spa was great 
285157,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, There was a reason for me getting this fabulous room and that was that there was some noise from the construction the day I stayed there Also the breakfast was a little too expensive for my taste , The room was really nice It was big had a comfy bed and I even got a large balcony that I could open to let in fresh air It was to the backside of the hotel so the view was not much but the air and sky was fabulous to me 
285158,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Although asked specific for one big bed Our first room was a big bed with separate mattresses and it was very hard to get a kingsize Waited for a day and End up with regular instead premium room no refound with one unit bed , Very quite double glazed windows to the street 
285159,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Too expensive breakfast 19 per person per day small room old furnitures reception team and their front desk managers who could not organize a room with a balcony inspite of my various reminders during our 4 night stay my emails sent 1 month in advance of our stay submitting this request , Perfect location helpful breakfast team
285160,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, Location is perfect for transport links including airport bus sightseeing bus Ramblas shopping local sight seeing short walk Rooms clean comfy Just off main plaza so not noisy Breakfast is expensive when compared to local cafes etc Pool area small but clean comfy Bar area small but the barman extremely courteous helpful

285164,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The tables at the pool area were not cleaned and there was a hole in the canopy overhead Not a deal breaker , The room was large with comfy twin beds and a small balcony where we could sit and enjoy people watching while sipping an aperitif Bathroom was large and well appointed Also had a well stocked mini bar The double paned windows blocked out all noise and curtains blocked out all light 
285165,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, I always think it is a little expensive, First of all location the rooms are very comfortable with details I always get a room with a street view and that is great I just love it I feel very safe Good breakfast too

285170,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, expensive breakfast it is better to eat outside the hotel, Excellent location We could not ask for better A spacious room and very clean Amazing spa to rest after a long trip or start the day in a relaxed atmosphere Luxurious accommodation
285171,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Room was a bit small Salad served at breakfast could have been fresher and while the spread was generally good I think they could have included museli and nuts to make the breakfast range more complete , Location was amazing close to aerobus stop Rambla La Boqueira for earlier evening seafood meals Gothic Quarter and Ieglesia de Santa Anna for evening guitar recitals They were all a stone s throw Nearby convenience stores for bottled water Great service from staff in the restaurant and housekeeping 
285172,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, Slightly noisy one night from people next door to us a room of lads otherwise very good , The location was fantastic It was within walking distance to the airport bus and the open top tour buses in the heart of the city close to Las Ramblas The balcony looked out onto the street There was a comprehensive fresh breakfast and friendly staff 
285173,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, We had to pay addicional fee for breakfast because they didn t have information about me and my son which is impossible because when I booked hotel I marked 3 persons also the swimming pool was closed in my opinion they should have information on the web site about this , The locations is perfect in heart of Catalonia place close for shopping restaurants and most things 
285174,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, The swiming pool was out of order without notice Breakfast surprice extra cost 19 Restaurant dinner menu Monday change without notice it did not have the fish plater announced , Confortable room and bathroom location helpfull front desk staff Nice building

285183,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, That there was renovation work on an they didnt mention that when we checked in The air conditioning didnt seem to be working properly , There was fresh fruit an water when we arrived in the room That they solved a problem with the room for me 
285184,Catalonia Plaza Catalunya, We have been waited more than 10 minutes to be served for check in knowing that it is Easter holiday but being in service industry the hotel should ensure to have enough workers to handle the flooding in customer We have filled all our details when booking the room via Booking com unfortunately the hotel staff needed to key in our details from scratch into the system this process taken another 5 minutes Two incidents that we have observed during check in was a guest shouting out loud at the lobby asking for Bartender once again the hotel must ensure enough workers during the festive season or closed for holiday Furthermore The guest served before us was running down to reception twice to complaint due to unclean toilet and malfunction of the door access card All these created further delayed to our check in process as it was only one person on duty Guest room is ordinary good it was clean and spacious unfortunately we were given room at 1st floor but the room s sound proof was so poor until we could hear noises from the street clearly we were awakened in the middle of night due to someone drunk and shout on the street and the noise of open close door from adjacent room Only given one bottle of water on the first night of stay toiletries was not refilled daily , Walking distance to the shopping and food area
