305675,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, If i had to dislike anything we had a poor view from the room but this is a hotel in an awsome city centre so all rooms cannt have a perfect view , Beautiful centrally located property great for accessing Amsterdam Breakfast was first class and the room was really comfortable and well equipped Staff were friendly and helpful Hotel close to station tram bus and taxis Red light sightseeing and shopping all within walking distance
305676,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, I stayed in a different building than the main one in which i had to cross the street and use my room card to enter the main hotel building to use the hotel facilities, The location
305677,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Only thing that i didnt like was the check in and out times Check in was 3pm which meant we had to wait as our flight was early and check out was 12pm and our flight was late We were aware of this beforehand however and were prepared to deal with this The hotel also stored our cases before check in and after check out so we didnt have to walk around with our case which was very helpful Amazing hotel would recommend to everyone , Everything was amazing All the staff were so kind and after mentioning that me and my partner were celebrating our 1 year anniversary the hotel was nice enough to give us an upgrade on our room and decorated it with balloons and offered macaroons The bed was huge and was so comfortable The bathroom was amazing with a great shower The room was simple and modern The location was probably the best part because it was right in the centre There was a 20 min walk max to anywhere in amsterdam pretty much and the restaurants around the hotel were great although i would say the cafes by the canals are also worth a try Overall an amazing experience thank you so much NH 
305678,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Nothing I didn t like about this hotel, Great location Great modern very clean hotel Touch of luxury and affordable prices Wouldn t stay anywhere else when in Amsterdam

305680,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, It has the name of Krasnapolsly but that is it Highly over rated Not 5 star Service is ok ish rooms small dirty and bathrooms extremely small, Location is great
305681,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Check in and out had lengthy queues bar only opens in the evenings and the cafe opens late morning A few issues with key cards opening the room and high price for extra bed put in the room , Staff were all very pleasant especially Beatrice on reception and James in the bar 
305682,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The lobby and service although the staff is most friendly However we were not lucky to get correct information from some of them when inquiring about certain stores trams etc Also we had asked for a blanket the room was cold even without air conditioning and when we came back at night it had not been delivered to our riom , Size and view of room 2027 Staff is very friendly although some do not give correct information

305685,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Some of the staff were disrespectful with me I understand there s a pressure on them but they must learn how to treat guests under pressure in a proper manner this is a 5 stars hotel Particularly the concierge staff 2 so far were rude and the call center staff I didn t like the beds they re horrible The space of the room in relation to the value of money to be honest it s not worthy I don t like the elevators tiny and warm each dedicated to a number of floors or rooms I didn t like the cleaning staff that I came across they don t understand English Also I didn t like the fact that they don t have a gym and I have to go to the other NH branch to workout not convenient at all Moreover the Tv wasn t responding at first then when we got signal I didn t find much options neither English nor Arabic channels were available, I like the breakfast area It s sunny huge and open I wish they add more variety of food though It s safe there there s security everywhere Cameras everywhere Mr Emile took immediate action when the cleaners opened the door on my mother He brought a machine to scan who went in and out He is also charismatic I like the way he handled the situation Majority of the staff were nice some were either moody or aggressive The butler who welcomed us he s a wise man been working for 25yrs was very welcoming and nice unfortunately I didn t get his name but I got the chance to say good back to him before I take off to the airport The location is amaaaaaazing I like the fact that Riply s Madame Tessud the dungeon 2 thumbs up and the body world are close from the hotel You can go on foot Also the zoo and micropia only 10min away Trams are available to take you for more museums in minutes They are easy to use The next door mall has lots of brands also great They have a spacious lounge to redeem tax free Smart

305690,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, We did not like the location of our room on the first floor There was not a lot of natural light which was the description of the room we booked The hotel was fully booked so we didn t bother asking for a change of room Will make a comment about that during booking if we book a next time , We enjoyed the excellent breakfast buffet and the service during check in breakfast at the Tailor bar and for check out 
305691,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, It s a hotel for big group tourists Check in was quite nightmare because it s almost always busy Not enough porters to help with luggage They are not really helpful although they re not rude at all but really lack of genuine good service , Location location location 
305692,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, I booked the hotel as a present for my 18YO daughter and here friends They arrived early and were told there rooms wouldn t be ready until 3 30 4pm and tried to move them into a groty apartment 5 doesn t just mean what you offer it s also about how people are treated and feel Left my daughter upset and felt uncomfortable the rest of the stay,No Positive

305694,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The staff at reception was rude and wasn t informative or helpful Breakfast was awful there was no variety and you have to get your own table so you will be walking around looking for a table making sure no one has taken it who are getting their food We hardly ate anything , I love the location of the hotel
305695,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Breakfast and the late check out I requested wasn t agreed, Stay was OK to say the least breakfast wasn t up to much although it was 70 euros for 2 people room service was impeccable tho as was the room keeping
305696,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, the check in process was rushed and felt more like a Motel check in rather than in a 5 stars hotel receptionist acted in a routine way and the welcome was practically not existing further more questions were answered even before I could finish completing the sentence upon reminding receptionist that we had chosen a bed type the only answer was we are fully booked we are fully booked we are fully booked I walked away while he was still bubbling something to us as he must have realised of the un proper response had given the receptionist told us that the double room of my sisters had been upgraded to a better one something that was not correct as we walked into the superior room it was exactly as on the pictures on booking com this did not apply to our second room while we booked and pre paid for a superior room of 25 sqm we were assigned a much smaller room and received no apologies nor an offer for compensation if not only after we had checked out unfortunately our experience at this 5 stars hotel was mediocre mostly for the way things have been handled and the very slow responsiveness and will not come back a note of thank you goes to the front office manager Mr Kiers that days later picked up my email messages and offered assistance , Delicious rich breakfast centrally located in the main square of Amsterdam
305697,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Staff not that friendly its a mass hotel and there is no individual care The attitude of some employees in particular Concierge was not friendly but they could smile with White people and keep neutral facial expression with us as Black people, Location The room I was eventually given after rejecting the first one When I walked in in 2016 to check the hotel room I was shown beautiful room but on arrival in 2017 I was given a ugly room and I objected 
305698,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The Staff at the Reception all of them said they are managers The Manager did not respond to our repeated request to meet him , The staff was dis courteous was charging wrong amount its a shame that the reception staff behaved rather rudely 
305699,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The bathroom glass walls were a bit too clear Need to ask the roommate go out to have a shower , Nice hosts and stuff The hotel is on the dam square Great place Close to everything Great food 
305700,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Bed was turned down towels changed only one night in six Friday night due to a PR function the only bar was closed They did back down for us when we complained to Manager Wine list in other restaurant needs some editing eg Pinot Noir Fleurie No attempt to take cases to room at check in Need to ask for mat in bath under shower Bedside light broken needed two requests to get fixed , Kind attention to my wife when she was unwell one day Food and service in White Room was excellent Food in other restaurant good
305701,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky,No Negative, The hotel was very nice Usually hotels in the heart of the city don t care about their service as visitors come anyway But not this one The room was modern and clean Stuff is friendly and always at your service The breakfast is nice I would come back

305704,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky,No Negative, The hotel was ideally placed for everything around Amsterdam The staff were so relaxed and friendly We stayed in the tailors bar one evening and the two barmen James and Erwan kept us supplied with a variety of cocktails and entertainment we really would recommend letting them choose the cocktails as their knowledge is wider than the already extensive cocktail list 
305705,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Junior staff was too much blaze about my issues that they caused The senior staff solved it all , I has some initial issues with the staff they lost my baggage for 1 5 hours and they lost a package delivered by DHL Since they realized that in both cases were their responsibility they dedicated a manager two considerer the shifts and all attention that I needed to solve it In the end they indemnify us the amount of the package wi fi service device and gave to us a complementary dinner in the hotel Great Hotel and Great Place Senior staff completely client oriented

305708,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, We booked the hotel for the picture of the bath tub and requested it also in website We were told that they didn t have a room with a tub but to ask again tomorrow since we were staying until Monday Called the next day to request if they had a room with a tub on Saturday and the man on the phone was very rude on the call and basically said they have done everything they could for me and if I didn t like it I could just check out So we checked out on Saturday and moved to a better hotel with a friendlier staff ,No Positive

305716,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, One day our room was not serviced at all despite us leaving early in the morning and returning late at night, Good selection of food for breakfast and locatity of the hotel very central and ideally located
305717,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, I waited 3 hours from 12 to 3pm to check in I was not allowed a late check out I was asked to leave at 12 noon This hotel is not 5 star compared to other 5 star hotels in the world , The location 
305718,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The fridge in the room was loud , Breakfast was excellent but expensive too The bathroom was very nice although a shower alone is better than a shower in a bath Rooms were very quiet 
305719,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Staff at reception They did not help us with the luggage, The staff at arrival was bad They did not have any time for us They only cleaned our room at 5 in the afternoon I was not impressed with this hotel at all
305720,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky,No Negative, I booked this NH Hotel Collection because I like NH Hotels and know its perfect as I had stayed here last year and this year I was traveling with a friends from the USA and I wanted him to experience Amsterdam at its best It s perfect for those wanting to experience living and climbing those steep narrow stairs This hotel is my favorite for Amsterdam

305722,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The room and bathroom were not as brightly lit as I like Nor were the mirrors facing the vanity of much use as they served as doors between the bathroom bedroom Even the parquet flooring was not spotlessly clean , Francesco the manager at the coffee shop was the star of the hotel As my wife does not have eggs he especially had the chef make a dessert for her My wife loved it and thanked him profusely He graciously told her to come again during our stay for the same dessert and did not charge us for it Such personalized attention is rarely received nowadays The hotel was superbly located on Dam Square and in the heart of the Centrum area The Superior Rooms were of good size 
305723,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, I did not like that I booked to stay in the old hotel and payed top money and when we got There they but us in a side building with not a Good view and the breakfast was not included In the cost I would never stay here again ,No Positive
305724,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Hotel is advertised as a 5 star hotel in hotel booking websites which was little misleading as it is not really 5 star standards Feels more like a 4 star hotel taking into consideration hotel furniture services , Location was great staff friendly heloful 
305725,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Besides the foyer and restaurant areas the balance of this hotel looks like a construction site It was cheaply renovated in the area that I stayed with incredibly dark hallways giving one the impression that it wasn t clean The stairs are a nightmare as I got lost in them a rabbit warren and lifts quite slow The rooms were fine but the air conditioning system is noisy and there is no way of turning it off or adjusting it I switched rooms because my bar fridge wasn t working , Decent location and a nice foyer and bar restaurant area Staff were friendly 
305726,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Paying for the location our superior room really wasn t worth what we paid A bit tired Mixed answers from concierge and reception as to whether motorcycles are exempt from the 50 euros charge for parking in the garage 3 o clock check in , It s central location Stylish smart lively and very nice staff especially the receptionists Fantastic breakfast Really good 
305727,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The air conditioning was not working in the room from the moment we checked in I immediately notified the reception staff and after countless phone calls back to reception a maintenance man arrived to confirm that the air con system was in fact not working Well no surprise there We were on a long weekend break with 2 other couples who were in adjacent apartments so when offered another room which was in a different building my wife and I declined as we all wanted to be close to each other having booked our 3 rooms together We were not offered a discount or any other form of compensation for the lack of air conditioning Bearing in mind that there was a weekend heatwave with temperatures over 30 degrees C we were disappointed with the lack of true customer care , The apartment was nicely laid out with a lounge kitchen and separate en suite bedroom The location was perfect right in the centre of Amsterdam an all places of interest were easily accessible 
305728,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky,No Negative, The offset building to the hotel was quite noisy at during the night due to the people partying in the narrow alley Technical personell working on the room nextdoor were not doing anything to be quite draging chairs over the floors talking loud on the phone just outside my door very early in the morning etc The room was excellent but they offered us a new room the night after inside the hotel and yes it was both quite and nice It was the breakfastpersonell that raised the question if they could do anything to improve our stay obviously the tech personell had reported to management that I had told them off with the phone episode that itself is very professional if you do something wrong and report yourself Thats respect to them good job no hard feelings The best part was the amazing breakfast you need to experience it Don t think anymore just book this hotel if it is within your budget 
305729,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Not value for money Always try to encourage you to upgrade but can t tell the differences of rooms offered Lack of facilities Staff is friendly but sometimes not sure if they understand you fully , In general it is clean and tidy over all Above average breakfast but very pricy beding is excellent might well be one of the best one we have experienced in recent years in Europe Location is unbeatable everything is at short walking distance 
305730,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Staff was rude and facilities are definitely not 5 star Checked in at 5 pm and room was still not ready and wouldn t be ready for another hour or more That s ridiculous for a 5 star hotel Also daily cleaning also extends past 6 as we came back before dinner and room was still a mess Also showers would turn hot and cold without us even flushing our own toilets seems other rooms usage affected our water temperatures Definitely not a five star hotel and definitely not worth the money at all Staff is also not friendly the key cards didn t work and I went to the front desk for a new one and have the receptionist blame me for demagnetized the card No other hotel I have been to is rude they just gladly give a new card but not here she made it seems so inconvenient that I would even ask for a card to get into my room Terrible experience overall , Location is good close to train station and public transportation 
305731,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Too modern I expect some history and unique trait of the hotel but I did not see any Hmmm for me it is a little bit less than 5 star hotel , Very professional and friendly staff Very big room 
305732,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Nothing it was all 10 10, Everything Location is amazing Staff were brilliant Room was gorgeous Concierge really helpful with organising some massages for us

305735,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Small issue with the rate at check out Must check bills when paying Was different from booking com Much more But it was sorted out and they reversed it as I had the email confirming the lower rate But if I had not saved the email I am sure they would have not agreed to it So be careful and check bills ,No Positive

305737,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, We were taken to a separate building the agent said it was an upgrade led us through a long hall in the main hotel out the locked door through an alley with people loitering into the annex up the elevator and into a room on the first floor that overlooked a noisy smelly street Looking out the window from the room onto this street you were welcomed with an awning covered in bird doo and fast food restaurants lining the street Not acceptable This should be the last room provided and only when explained to the buyer I went to the front desk asked for a room in the main hotel and was quickly re accommodated to the 5th floor lovely quiet room They were very quick to help and friendly in the change very satisfactory The floors in the final room weren t as clean as they should have been with lots of sandy type dirt caught on our shoes The rest of the room was fine , The staff were very efficient and accommodating friendly We had a quiet room on the 5th floor interior nice facilities comfortable bed and excellent breakfast We also ate mid afternoon at the lovely restaurant on the first floor excellent food and service Through booking com we had arranged for airport transfers which were great nice ride driver And transfer to the cruise ship at the end of our stay again a nice ride driver 
305738,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Thought it was quite expensive considering there is no fitness or spa facility breakfast also very pricey so opted to go elsewhere , Lovely comfy bed received a free upgrade on arrival Rooms are lovely however slightly noisy at times Very central location within close walking distance to everything you want to see in Amsterdam Staff on front desk are very polite and helpful

305745,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Your revamp has taken some of the character away from the winter garden especially the new chandeliers There were stains on a few of the chairs in the winter garden we would have expected these to have been removed and cleaned not left in use , Breakfast selection is wonderful the winter garden is a wonderful room The reception area is crisp and functional The rooms are simple and clean as it should be for the price

305751,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The rooms were not constructed to keep the noise of the outside and floor to a minimum , The staff was incredible but the ambiance and ascetic was very disappointing in the lobby and the rooms My friend described it as the equivalent of Motel 6 in the USA I would not go that far but it really was sterile 
305752,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, They have 3 buildings and they gave me a room in the oldest one and it was really old and consumed with really bad smell and when went to the front desk they changed my room with newer one but the sinks were both plugged with dirty material, Nothing

305756,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, This hotel was massively overpriced This last year I ve stayed in several 5 star hotels and paid around 200 per night The last was very opulent with a free mini bar several snacks etc The NH hotel cost 330 per night not including taxes The room was very basic and had a view of the roof When I complained I was moved to one of their more expensive rooms free of charge which was still considerably basic by comparison The first room was similar in style and quality to one of those ibis hotels with a shower booth The second was slightly nicer than a premier inn room For the cost I was expecting grandeur The cost in itself is not a concern for me but value for money is I will not use again ,No Positive

305765,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Before 100 days i asked for double bed but they can not guarantee for me a double bed Price is expensive in compare with the property there was a conference maybe thats why Noise came from the street all the night Since I came the coffee machine was broken and i called the reception 4 times before they send me a guy to change it so I didn t use it for 2 days , Location Polite staff They give me free decoration when they know I became a new father I live in room 5141 in the other building so i have another exit to the street and the room was big and good design

305771,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, when we arrived the keys did not open to our room they were faulty when we enterd the room there was a kind of disinfectant smell by which a worker said it may be outside and not from th room but it remaind through out the 2 days And the cushions were to flimsy not supportive enough , the selection for breakfast was exellent 
305772,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, I didn t like the glass doors in the bathroom you cannot see through them but you don t really get much privacy otherwise if you know what I mean And for whatever reason the restroom didn t smell that clean when I arrived I think the price is mostly due to location so keep that in mind It s a great hotel but not a good choice if you aren t trying to splurge , The service I got was absolutely wonderful They accommodated me in every way possible when my room wasn t ready earlier than check in Super sweet and kind The location is obviously the best in the whole city if you want to be a tourist in that particular area The hotel was very clean the room was great super comfortable and a good size The mirrors that opened or closed off the bathroom was my favorite part I also ordered food from room service and it was GREAT

305775,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, We booked a premium room However the room we got did not match with the room description no French connection for example Although the room was spacious it had a bit an outdated look Because of a conference the expensive breakfast was not in the usual room which is really nice and relaxed to sit but in a much darker and smaller room Also the bar was sometimes very loud because of a reception of the conference , The location ideal in the middle of the city center The hotel has a nice bar brasserie and restaurant and the staff is very helpful

305785,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The only issue that put me off The sheets could have been a bit cleaner On my first night there were some errant hairs from someone , Location was fantastic Staff was extremely friendly I was treated very well and I felt cared for in this wonderful and friendly city 
305786,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Compared to other hotels this was too expencive compared to what we got I thought you got a extra nice room for this kind of money but the room was just standard Will try a different hotel next time , Location
305787,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The bathroom lacked a Shataf which is a toilet washer instead of toilet paper used all over the middle east and islamic countries, The front desk staff were very freindly and efficient especially a lady called Amira

305789,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The room is too dull empty of anything that could give it life Very boring design or even stuff you fill the room with it looked too empty kinda unfinished The breakfast buffet was the worst i have had in years All you can get is omlete cold scarmbeled eggs and limited choices They also shifted us to the small resturant for 2 days where we couldnt even toast bread because they didnt have a toaster there , The location

305792,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Cleaning staff around foyer surly Disappointed to be woken up at 6 30am on week days by construction work on building next door When spoke to staff about it was met with a nonchalant reply Hotel quite expensive too , Reception staff ok Room had great view over Dam square Central location Room good size with comfy bed Hotel clean and tidy 
305793,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Hallway lighting was a little dark in the section where we were staying and there needs to be a small light always on in the room entry or at least pointing at the key slot on the light switch inside the room It was too dark to find the light switch key slot since the lights don t work without the key card inserted so you are left scrambling in the dark to get the key card in the slot so you can finally turn the lights on The desk clerk said we could leave the 2nd key in at all times but the maid kept removing it and would take it whenever we d leave it in So maybe fix that situation , Bathroom design was great so much we want to do the same in our house Room layout was also good overall we were very pleased with the room hotel location cleanliness and staff

305804,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The hotel used to be a beautiful old hotel with large spacious rooms which over the last 10 yrs I used to stay every time I went to Amsterdam I didn t realise since my last visit a few years ago it had been renovated I have no issues with modernization or updating a hotel but who ever did the work was only thinking about one thing squeezing the most amount of box size rooms into the new space as possible The layout is awful it has no character anymore it is essentially a warehouse full of hundreds of tiny rooms My room was a double room and there was barely any room to swing a cat in there I was supposed to share this room with a friend of mine who was not able to make it at short notice thankful so it turned out the twin room would have been far too small for two men sharing I will not be returning again unless it is free I will stay at the Raddisson next time as the prices were about the same Alex Russell, The location but that has not changed
305805,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Shower wasn t the most powerful, Location very friendly helpful courteous staff Our room was not ready on arrival as something had to be fixed by maintenance so we were given free champagne in the hotel bar our bags were waiting for us in the room once ready and cakes and pastries were delivered as an apology

305885,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The cleanliness of the room they kept uncleaned glasses for two nights remains of cappuccino in paper cup also for two nights they put amenities in the room for only one person and we were two There were tractor working very early in the morning which causes us lack of sleep , The location is perfect the staff were cooperative I wasn t first satisfied with our rooms but after they upgraded us to another rooms with extra room costs it was ok

305890,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, One of the lady bar staff was quite rude and not at all helpful in fact we was told on New Year s Eve that when we ordered a drink it would take ages and if we would like to go elsewhere feel free Which is quite amusing considering there was about 100 000 people that night in Dam square and you could not even get out of the hotel let alone get into a bar Also the safe in the room did not work despite telling staff about this Apart from the above overall a nice time was had ,No Positive
305891,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Left the room between 11 00am to 16 00 on the 1st of January and the room wasn t cleaned on time I assume it was due to skeleton staff on the day , Location was perfect

305900,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Nothing All was great , Everything Great hotel To avoid noise from the street ask for it in advance upper floor or window for quite street We didn t ask it but received the 4th floor which was perfect for us 
305901,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The toilet in the room smells really bad when we first came in They blamed the drainage It didn t occur again So I don t think it is the drainage Not very thorough when doing the daily housekeeping , All of the staff are super friendly Breakfast is excellent 
305902,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The heating did not work so we were left freezing at times The shower was either scorching hot or freezing cold The bed was uncomfortable The bar fridge did not work so we had no cold drinks Expensive accomodation for a small uncomfortable room , Loved the location it was absolutely perfect 
305903,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The Amsterdam wing of the hotel doesn t feel like it s part of the main hotel Horrible side entrance accessed through a public alleyway with garbage and takeaway boxes scattered everywhere doesn t make it feel like a 5 star hotel Rooms in the Amsterdam wing face a busy and dirty side street I m sure I could hear rats scuttering around somewhere at 2am they weren t in the room but must have been close by since that side street is full of takeaways The quality of room service food needs improving Horrible club sandwich and breakfast omelette but the smoked salmon was excellent , Bed was almost too comfortable difficult to get off it 
305904,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Staff impersonal member of staff that checked us in was very efficient but didn t smile and made us feel like an inconvience The bathroom looked great but did not smell fresh The sound on the TV only lasted 10 minutes bbc1 before the voices became distorted , Bed was big coffee maker was great and the design of bathroom was lovely

305907,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The building design means that there are several clusters of rooms accessible by dedicated small lifts elevators and that can mean a long wait at busy times Not sure if this can be changed though Based on the furniture provided in the room it the room could do with being about 10cm longer hard to get into and out of the chairs at the work desk I didn t take breakfast as this was too expensive Plenty of places nearby offering excellent value breakfast , the room and bathroom absolutely up to date good air conditioning The location is perfect in the city centre 5 10 minutes walk from the Central Station Free tea and coffee and mineral water provided in the room
305908,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Crazy in a new room truly nowhere to place and open your luggage no luggage rack whatsoever so had to open my cases on the floor Cold wooden floor no throw away slippers provided Enough tea and coffee in the room but not enough milk ,No Positive
305909,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Signages inside the hotel are not clear The friendly staff lives to help however I am kind of a person who would prefer following the directions to find a WC for example rather than stopping every nearby staff member to ask for directions , Great location at a walking distance from Amsterdam Central Train Station friendly staff allows early check ins and cleanliness 
305910,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, No one informed us of the 170 deposit that we had to pay with a credit card as we don t have one we would never had booked there if we had known we needed one We then had to pay this deposit out of our spends which left us short of money for the 3 days that we was there , Nice rooms hotel staff were nice 
305911,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Everything heating was not working hotel staff was rude and not helpful arrogant no service had to go to another building to find my room beakfast was bad generally a very bad hotel and wandering why 5 Star should be max 3 star, Only location
305912,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, A warning and I am not the only person this happened to The revolving door should be marked more because it is not the usual in out type and you can be caught out especially if someone suddenly steps the door The consequence of this was that I seriously hurt my nose and it was the quick action of one of the staff who got ice that I did not have a swollen face , Very good position Reception staff helpful 
305913,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, I didn t like the bath shower it had outbursts of boiling hot water then freezing cold whilst running a bath shower I also didn t like the fact the hotel apparently take a 200 deposit upon arrival luckily I didn t pay this as I showed the receptionist it didn t say this anywhere on my booking , I liked the friendliness of the staff everyone seemed very willing to help etc I also really liked the air conditioning in the room I stayed in very responsive 
305914,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, First room was freezing cold but we did change it eventually One of the receptionists was rude , Beds are very comfortable Great facilities in the rooms such as the 3D TV coffee machine and iron 
305915,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, They charged me extra money i dont know why We stayed with a winter park view room which was awfull Our room has to be city viewed Room service was terribly slow and house keeping was horrible They didn t even came after many phone calls The only good thing was location But its not good enough for a 5 star hotel ,No Positive
305916,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Hotel advertises car parking this is in fact a public multi story car park right next to the hotel which charges 50 Euros day I came to my car at 10 30am to find the back window smashed through park here at your peril Noise from outside the hotel was a problem during the night as our room overlooked a passageway between the hotel and offices next door , Good hotel with nice facilities
305917,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, 1 Unlike other hotels nothing additional service provided for the kids not even a bed 2 Staff is comparitively not helpful I had 4 bags and two kids no help offered even to show the way to the right elevetor 3 Full noise in the room from the street all the night couldn t sleep well , Only location
305918,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, For a five star hotel and the amount I paid I was disappointed for the following reasons The toilet was dirty when I arrived it smelt of urine as if it hadn t been cleaned with detergents for days I called room service and waited 20 minutes for an answer When I did finally get through the lady who took my order was abrasive then when I asked her to confirm my order she got aggressive using vulgar language and one of her colleagues took over Her colleague then tells me she is busy and is stressed AS IF that is a reason to ever justify being rude to a guest , The location is excellent Could not have made a better choice
305919,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, How it wasnt made clear that you pay on arrival so we thought it had been paid for as it was a birthday present Had to comtact home to get money transferred, Lovely clean hotel and friendly staff 
305920,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, a The room was small and hardly allowed us to walk around b The room was dirty and EXTREMELY NOISY The sound proofing is a nightmare in this hotel c Staff was rude and not at all welcoming Everything seemed very fake , Other than the location and the lobby nothing 
305921,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The reception staff we arrived at 14h30 and at the reception one lady said your room is not yet ready for check in and u have to wait this is not acceptable at all we were so tired from the trip even the way how she talk was bad Then they give as very small room an there s no hot water in the room I couldn t take shower even and also no view in the room, I like the location
305922,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Memebers of staff messed up our early check in and had to spend hours to finally check in Wasn t the nicest of welcomes but overall was a lovely hotel to stay in, After several problems the staff were superb with service
305923,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The only thing I have to really say I did not like was the price of a breakfast 30 euros per person So for a family of 4 very expensive, Fantastic family room located in the heart of the city everything was great and the staff were very friendly and helpful
305924,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Breakfast costs 29 euro Very steep therefore we did not have breakfast in the hotel The bedrooms were very cold the temperature is set at 24c and you cannot adjust The hotel staff gave us an electric heater as an alternative , The bed was lovely nice and big The room was clean 
305925,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Even though the breakfast was REALLY lovely at 29 95 euros per person it was on the expensive side , Huge comfy bed in the room and we were upgraded at check in so that was a lovely touch
305926,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Breakfast is very expensive and actually could be a lot better especially given the cost and I am thinking here more of the cooked buffet as the quality and selection of the cooked food is at best average and actually given the price it should really be classed as poor all the rest of the breakfast buffet is good The next time we stay here on pleasure we will skip the hotel breakfast and find somewhere local to eat better cooked food at less than half the price , The location is about as perfect as it gets as you are truly in the centre of Amsterdam have stayed here on business and came back with my wife for a long weekend primarily because of the location and also because it is a really nice place 
305927,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky,No Negative, This hotel is ideal located right in dam square YOU are only 10 mins from the train station and all the big shops are right on your doorstep canal trips are also very close bye I will definitely been staying here again when I go back 
305928,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Front desk seems to be understaffed as the queues are long and it takes quite a bit of time per registration so he queue moves slowly , Excellent location Modern style rooms
305929,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, They charged me 28 euros for crisps and coke lolol, This was without a doubt the best hotel we have stayed in we came for our anniversary and the staff really made it special the room was decorated nicely and was really for our arrival About 6 hours early everyone was really lovely and helpful we were even suprised with a little desert I would like to say a really big thank you to the whole team we will definenly be coming back
305930,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, More teabags and a tea pot more coffee pods We had breakfast in our room most days and would have liked more hot drinks both then and at night The light switch combinations were a puzzle at first but lots of fun to play with , The room was lovely I really liked the strong hot shower The bed was very comfortable 
305931,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Booked a room for 3 had to ask for addional bath robes towels toiletries for third person , Location was excellent all main attractions within easy walking distance Friendly bar staff and lovely cocktails 
305932,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky,No Negative, Staff extremely helpful Room very spacious and comfortable We had lunch in the hotel s Grand Cafe as soon as we arrived and we re made to feel welcome and at home immediately 
305933,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, We were upgraded to a superior room however although recently refurbished the room poorly equipped 2 beds with nightstands one desk and one armchair were the only furniture in the room and the only element of decoration was the TV The room was right above the hotel patio and was therefore very noisy Poor soundproofing between rooms Overall the minimum was there but hardly anything more Overall the hotel is more worthy of 3 stars or 4 stars than 5 , The location of the hotel is ideal The bed was good
305934,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Staff not very helpful I was asked to pay a some money to block the room when i checked in To serve as a deposit if i used any items in the mini fridge I was told this would be refunded when 48hours after checkout I checked out on the 13th didn t use anything from the bar the money wad still not refunded I spoke to reception staff Monday this week a lady confirmed the money hadn t been paid back and that she will do it immediately and it should be in my account within 48hrs Still not refunded today is Thursday Spoke to staff today who claimed it had been paid out on the 15th ,No Positive
305935,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Refer above, The location was the only reason we chose the hotel and for the price we paid the room is without a view and very small for two persons The air conditioning is set and we couldn t get the room warmer and it s freezing outside We stayed 4 nights and the sheets were never changed Complimentary bottled water was only available on the day we checked in No replacement the following 3 days I can conclude there is nothing I like about it 
305936,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, We became aware of the aircon at night after a couple of days although we could have turned it off without inconvenience , Wonderful breakfast Helpful and friendly staff 
305937,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Check in and out very poor slow and disorganised Asked for connecting rooms with double beds got rooms some distance apart changed to next door eventually and single beds Disappointing rooms generally in terms of size facilities and condition similar to Premier Inn but ten times the price Ok for our one night stay but would expect more, Perfect location right on Dam Square Public areas good breakfast cafe and bar nice with good staff Concierge very helpful too
305938,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Indiferent eesign Far from being a 5 star Delays everywhere Check out baggage storage Problems technical took forever to solve, Location Right in the centre
305939,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, They need to work on the sound proof as its sometimes annoying on the red light district , Everything about it Amazing location and helpful staff Good facility and new furniture 
305940,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Only one let down We have stayed before and was really looking forward to a cocktail called Envy But they have stopped making them , Comfortable and clean rooms 
305941,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, the rooms were very small and quite minimalistic, it is very central and a nice feeling to check into this hotel I would have expected a bit more value for my money though
305942,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, I am most upset about my room location With it being next to the cleaning cupboard I was disturbed by the cleaner every morning This is not the fault of the cleaner but due to the lack of soundproofing of the wall Also in Room 3001 there is a door adjoining another room Feeling poorly I had to return to the Hotel during the day I was woken that afternoon by someone rapidly trying the door handle This was very unsettling to say the least After that the people in whatever Room that is that joins 3001 were then conversing which was clearly audible to me and disturbing I was unable to rest The hotel is lovely but my Room was not worth my that much of my hard earned money Unfortunately, Staff are lovely 
305943,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, There was a little hiccup with our check in and after making sure I did all I could by contacting the hotel directly before leaving the U K And having emails after emails there was still problems with check in I will say this was sorted in the end but it was just a little embarrassing and time consuming especially when I had sorted it all before leaving the uk , The room and location was amazing The staff were great As it was a surprise for my husbands 30th birthday they upgraded our room to a premium room free of charge and when we entered there was balloons and 2 pastry surprises from the chef and a little note wishing him a happy birthday Our room was cleaned everyday And in the evening we would come back to our lights being on low mood and chocolates on the pillows Little touches like this makes the trip more meaningful especially being in a different country 
305944,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The staff were horrendous There s a little blondie called Nadia She was by far the rudest person I ve met The breakfast was a 2 out of 10 The door keys broke 3 times in 4 days that s out of order in my opinion when you spend thousands on a hotel I requested early check in because my flight was early but I still couldn t check in until 3 pm that s also out of order when you spend a decent amount of money on a hotel and once you arrive at the hotel the staff try to par you off to their apartments it s more like a hovel A hostel Not a luxury hotel So please don t be fooled by their upgrade , The location was excellent The hotel on a while was lovely and has everything you needed The bar staff were excellent very helpful and great fun 
305945,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Staff were very rude Entering room with no permission This was done by manager of hotel and concierge on more than one occasion Did not get a refund or even a voucher as I had to check out early for personal reasons , Housekeeping staff were nice and polite
305946,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Snobbish receptionist with no interest in their clients , On checkin the reception wanted to upgrade us The truth was that the room they wanted to give us was bigger but in a shabby rundown section located outside the hotel down the street 50 metres 
305947,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Our room was upgraded to an apartment which was awesome but the elevator was broken So climbing the three floors to our room was rough at times But truly a great location , Love the location of this hotel Everything you come to see in Amsterdam is literally right outside your door Very clean and great restaurants 
305948,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Rooms were very standard for a 5 star hotel The staff would knock on your door several times in the morning to try and get in to clean , Good location hotel lobby very nice 
305949,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, View out of the window was a brick wall disappointing and the mattress although huge was on the hard side Also very expensive to eat in house especially breakfast which isn t included as standard so we found other places in the locality , Pleasant modern room in a great central location which was a free upgrade on checking in after we were asked if we d like to pay to upgrade I declined with good ensuite and huge bed Decent tv and tea and coffee facilities although no hot chocolate provided Quiet as in an annex off the main hotel 
305950,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Extremely poor customer service Everything began when I called the hotel to make sure we would have had an earlier check in at the arrival The lady at the phone mentioned that they did not have any reservation under my name and when we arrived we did not have any earlier check in When we finally got the key and went to the room we opened the door with the wifi key two people were already in the bedroom When we were assigned to another room I tried to have a shower and when opened the bath towels I found fake eyelashes The clean towels were delivered after more that 30 minutes Definitely it was not worth what we paied , location room 
305951,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, No negatives , The staff in this hotel are excellent They just can t do enough for you One of our party took ill while we were there they were so kind helpful The rooms are great with lovely comfy beds The barmen in the Tailor bar are also worth a mention Lovely guys Ok so it s not the cheapest hotel around but it s nice to treat oneself now again

305953,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, We were deceived by pictures posted on Booking com Staff are arrogant and rude Didn t expect much anyway coz they re a bunch 20 year old Their definition of king size bed is two single bed with wheelies put together They only change the sheets every 3 4 days When you order room service they ll come knock 40 minutes after delivering the food to pick up the food cover They don t care about privacy We put the do not disturb sign on but they still open the door after 3 knocks That hotel is disgusting and the staff needs to be trained here in dubai , Nothing to be honest
305954,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The bed is not very steady due to the wheels I understand it is easy to move the bed but it is not very comfortable for me , The staffs are very helpful and kind The room is very clean and the breakfast is the best and the best

305967,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The offer to upgrade our booking a superior double room to an appartment was shambolic We were led to a narrow dark flat completely off site previous staff accommodation which we thought would not have been worth more than 1 3 of the fee we paid for our superior double room Needless to say we refused to take up this offer and insisted on our original booking To date it still puzzles me what made the receptionist think that we would be delighted with such an upgrade which really would have been a massive downgrade therefore beware , The superior double room was spacious the bed brilliant The Hotel staff were extremely helpful 
305968,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Communication between reception and housekeeping staff was imperfect and both I and the friends with whom we were travelling were repeatedly interrupted when the Do not Disturb sign was lit Because the hotel was spread across 5 different interconnected buildings rooms at the same price level offered markedly different facilities Breakfast was good but very expensive , Reception staff were very helpful when we checked in early because I was unwell and the concierge service was excellent Room was perfectly comfortable and there were excellent facilities in the lobby area Location excellent The Grand Cafe Krasnapolsky was a very pleasant cafe and dining location

305986,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The first 2 days the cleaning was disappointing with a weird smell like the water hadn t been changed and the bedding top wasn t changed even though we called and asked because it had a stain We found the cup of the complimentary water of the previous people that stayed there behind our towels in the bathroom and when i showed it to the receptionist she said she would talk to maid service about it and that she didn t know what to do , Amazing Breakfast The room and the options are truly amazing Great location Big room with great beds and quality all around

305991,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Rooms have been upgraded in hotel which has left them cold and dark we asked for a room upgrade from a superior room to a premier room and even then the room disappointed us the heating wouldn t work in room either and in late September it got pretty cold we complained they gave us a extra blanket and a small heater Overall I feel ripped off and won t be staying there again , Breakfast was excellent Hotel location excellent right in Dam Square and 10 minutes walk from central station

306041,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Only the cleanlynesd, For a 5 star the room is too small too much noise early morning from the cleaning and at night the noise from the road Finally we had to go to NH Carlton
306042,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, we dropped our bags at the hotel after about an hour long argument with staff who were very happy to argue back and add more fuel to the fire and talk to us like we should have been grateful to be there We left and went a walk around Amsterdam for a while when we returned they had no record of our payment that we had made only 2 hours before I will never be returning again and will make sure everyone knows about our experience as a 5 hotel our problems should have dealt with immediately and professionally and wasn t at one stage we just had to let it go as we got the feeling they didn t want us in the hotel most uncomfortable stay of my life I stayed in 3 not far from the Krasnapolsky in January and the service we received in there deserves 5 the hotel director of the Krasnapolsky should really have a good look at his staff while they are working as attitudes are appalling, Nothing 
306043,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life 1 member of staff emailed me TWICE to say the price of the room and when we got there they said it was a mistake and we had to pay over 50 dearer no apology for mistake but made to pay even though there was proof of original price not the 5 service I expect from a 5 hotel the staff have let this hotel down and as someone who works in the frontline of customer service myself it appalled me the attitudes that we got from the staff disgusting way for a guest to be treated , Nothing the service made this 5 hotel go to a zero 
306044,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Young manager at check in was extremely unaccommodating needed training he had absolutely no idea how to treat a customer glass enclosure to bathroom while beautiful to look at allowed all noises from bathroom to be heard in sleeping portion of room extremely long distances to walk to get to an elevator and set up once on floor room was a bit confusing you could go in 3 different directions including down a couple of steps to get to some of the room scrambled eggs at breakfast were loose although the rest of the breakfast set up was wonderful , Great location Most of the staff was friendly professional Comfortable beds and nice room set up 
306045,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, very very noisy the total nasty stinky crowded and noisy center of the old city when you open the window the whole room stinks like chips and hamburger from the fast food places below and anyway you cant really open the windows until the end what I personally don t like at all the hotel is very expensive, Very clean nice stuff great breakfast
306046,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Extras are offered often almost always at additional exorbitant prices There is no swimming pool Only the few very expensive rooms and suites have view to the outside There are two or three clerks at the front desk but usually one has to wait long in line to get to them There is one elevator for the front more expensive wing and there are two elevators for the rear wing of which one is always out of order, This hotel has the best possible location in Amsterdam opposite the Royal Palace All facilities are luxurious and comfortable and the personnel is helpful and courteous but 
306047,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, 1 service a bit slow in the coffee shop 2 we were there for 2 nights on our first night there was a problem in our room when a revolting smell all night We complained and we were informed that the room adjacent had also complained and that it seemed that there was a problem with the drains and we were given the option of changing room we were given a choice of only one room available We obviously took it but the bath room was half the size of the previous one On check out we figured that we were due some compensation and we indicated that we expected the extras on our bill to be waived these amounted to about Euro120 for the ruined night and the inconvenience of having to change rooms but the duty manager had no authority for this I therefore emailed the General Manager upon my return home and was informed that on my next visit I would be given VIP treatment I thanked him very much for his offer and told him that since I had no plans to return to Amsterdam furthermore I expected that every guest at the hotel was always treated as a VIP and not only when they complained No offer of any compensation was made We were therefore very disappointed with the level of customer care and customer expectation that we expected from a 5 star hotel , Very good Breakfast and coffee shop

306065,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Our main disappointment was with the reception staff We felt that they were trying to be so professional that they actually forgot to engage with us as people we had to wait 25 minutes to check out on Sunday 24th July and there was no apology for the wait and once we had checked out we were told to wait in yet another queue to enable us to leave our bags at the hotel until our departure thankfully one gentleman had the good sense to realise that people were starting to become unhappy and asked if anyone in the queue just wanted to leave bags to be honest this is not something you would expect at a 5 star hotel , The hotel facilities and location were excellent the hotel bar was incredibly good and the staff within it very good The room was excellent 
306066,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Air con did not work properly Breakfast was poor for the money no one to find a table for you all self service including tea and coffee which again is poor , Good location Building in reality is not as nice as in the photos

306070,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Not enough information in the room about to tv channels to save having to scroll through multiple channels to find an English speaking one We were in a room where we could smell the dust being generated by the workmen every time we we up to or down from our room to be fair we didn t make this issue known to the hotel staff , The location the staff and the comfort were excellent 
306071,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Value for money is poor The hotel is over priced for a hotel with no facilities just rooms restaurant meeting rooms 5 star hotels should have some sort of spa recreation facilities Rooms little small small water is 8 euros room service which is ridiculous laundry is also overpriced check in out took around 15 20 min , Location was great in the center of Centrium area Close to malls shops 5 minute walk to main train station 
306072,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, They couldn t able to meet my request to provide me with 2 connected rooms dispite te fact I send the request twice early and two days prior my arrival We have no option unless to stay at one room since kinds cannot stay in an separated room Nevertheless I fully recommend this hotel , Staff are very friendly and helpful Breakfast is very good with fair varaity of foods Location is excellent in the Dam square Concierge services

306077,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, There was nothing that we didn t like the hotel and staff were fantastic , The receptionist on arrival noticed from my passport that it was my birthday and upon arriving back from a walk found that she had arranged a cake and some balloons in my room her name was Rebecca and she was fantastic the room overlooked Dam Square with a direct view of the Royal Palace I have nothing bad to say about this hotel the entire trip was fantastic 
306078,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, 1 booking was cancelled when arrived they offered another room with higher rate 2 although we paid the fees upfront at check in they decided to re charge city tax at check out we had to fight to avoid it 3 so many other customers had problems with their booking as well so many mistakes have been done at the reception , good location comfortable bed
306079,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, When we arrived we were told the hotel was full We had requested inter connecting rooms via booking com as we have a disabled daughter but we ve didn t get them The hotel manager said we shouldn t assume that our request would be fulfilled and because of the time we arrived they couldn t accommodate our request After much discussion they gave us two adjoining rooms on the front of Dam square down the street facing the delivery depot for the big department store de Bijenkorf Very noisy all day and most of the night as there was extensive work ongoing in the department store The noise was unbearable with skips being delivered and filled constantly from 5am to after midnight There were also store deliveries On numerous occasions the street was blocked with so many lorries that the police had to get involved Our air conditioning didn t work and we couldn t open our windows due to the noise and dust We reported it to reception but nothing was done The managers and staff were very unhelpful and unreasonable The hotel was so busy they did not have enough staff to cope The rooms were adequate nothing more To say it ruined our city break is an understatement I would not recommend this hotel , Nothing to like about this hotel certainly not five star Not worth the money 
306080,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Having to wait until 3pm to check in There was some rubbish left under the wash basin in the bathroom from the previous occupants , Location of the hotel was excellent Tea and coffee facilities in room a bonus Bed extremely comfortable

306087,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Staff were very unhelpful and showed a lack of attention to detail and we were give the noisiest room in the hotel above the service entrance , The location
306088,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, No breakfast included in the price of the room especially if for example my wife only likes a cup off coffee and a piece of toast for breakfast and you wanted to charge 26 Euros Don t think so , Size and cleanliness of the bedroom and toilets
306089,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Check in was very slow and even though I asked a staff member for directions to the elevator no 7 it s a huge hotel nobody asked to bring the luggage to our room My husband was not there so I carried three bags and handled two kids When we finally got to our room the keys did not work I had to go to the reception and the person there did not even apologize for the inconvenience The view from the room was directly to the alley and two buildings where the construction workers started each morning early The hotel is being renovated and it would have been great knowing this beforehand Breakfast was nice but noisy and crowded The orange juice did not seem freshly squeezed which I usually expect from 5 star hotels , Perfect location nice and big family room
306090,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, We asked for a roon with king size bed and had to wait for it for 2 hours After the waiting we recieved 2 beds put together on the top of that there was constructions noise in our room and it was terrible They eventually mooved us to other room but it left us with bad taste not going to go bach there again , Breakfast was good great Location
306091,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, 2 kinds of bacon served at breakfast both rock hard and inedible and at 18 euro p p that s quite unacceptable Very sullen housekeeping staff and quite rude , location
306092,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, NOTHING , I booked this NH Hotel Collection because I like NH Hotels and know its perfect as I had stayed here last year for 10 days and this year I was traveling with two friends from Colombia and I wanted them to experience Amsterdam at its best The Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky offers apartments that the entrance is in the canal zone behind the hotel It s perfect for those wanting to experience living and climbing those steep narrow stairs To wake up in the morning and see the canals and at night be able to sit on the stoop and see the beautiful people walk by is an absolute adventure This hotel is my favorite for Amsterdam 
306093,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The only thing that could make this hotel better is if it had a pool but otherwise it really is perfect , Amazing hotel with attentive staff The hotel s location is perfect so central right on Dam Square We went for our anniversary and they very kindly upgraded us to a premium room Beds are very comfortable and are huge Our room was above a busy street which was quite noisy but Jennifer was lovely and switched us to another beautiful room which was nice and quiet The breakfast is out of this world so much variety and the chef makes the best omelettes Thank you hotel Grand Krasnapolsky for making our stay in Amsterdam so memorable we will be back 
306094,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The bathroom was not as good as expected May be it has been renovated for a while already The temperature of the water supply was not very constant The bathtub was worn out The hotel was busy We needed to queue up for long time before we could check in , We stayed in superior double room The bed was large and quite comfortable 
306095,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Problem with Wi Fi No working coffee machine Wrong Room at check in do not stay at the reconstruction side of the hotel we changed our room Complicated elevator system No asistance for leading to rooms although you spend more money comparing to other hotels, Great Location downtown of the city Very Comfortable Bed Nice and Clean Room
306096,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The receptionists on departure were quite brusque and a simple did you enjoy your stay and see you again would have been nice and cause me to go back which of course I now won t , Position was fantastic and the room service staff were very good as was the food
306097,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky,No Negative, Great staff and service absolutely the top of European hotels the time I ve been staying there since July 1999 plus nothing beats the central location Excellent 
306098,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Way too expensive for what you get The rooms are really just basic accommodations with some extra spent to look nice Very understaffed at checkout as well , Stylish rooms and building and a solid location if you like being in the thick of Amsterdam About as central as it gets 
306099,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Breakfast was split over three rooms and was so expensive that we eat elsewhere Rooms were ready very late but to be fair the reception staff let us keep one of our rooms for a few hours extra the day we checked out , Central location Clean Tailors Bar 
306100,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky,No Negative, The location of the Krasnapolsky cannot be bettered The view of the bustling Dam square and the palace from the front rooms is an additional bonus It is a very busy hotel with business travellers the young and trendy making up the majority of the guests Nevertheless both Reception and the Concierge were both courteous and very helpful without undue delay We stayed in a Premium Double Room XL with View It is a very large high ceilinged sunny room with a whole wall of windows looking onto Dam Square Furnished in ubiquitous but pleasing modern chic it has a very comfortable XL king bed and space to swing many cats at once And lots of sockets for charging devices etc The bathroom has his n hers washbasins a separate rain shower and a toilet A series of mirror panels open it up to the bedroom Toiletries were replenished twice a day Cannot fault cleanliness and the willing housekeeping staff Breakfast at the conservatory like restaurant was a mixture of the excellent and the mediocre Fresh juices and smoothies fresh pastries stunning bread and a good selection of fruit and cooked food Cheese is sliced and dried up a let down for a cheese country like the Netherlands Hudson s Terrace Restaurant provides well prepared and well priced contemporary dishes and deserts in a contemporary setting whilst enjoying views of the ever bustling square The wifi is free efficient and works throughout the hotel 
306101,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Everything was great My only dislike was that we were informed by the staff that we had to use the normal elevator instead of the staff elevator which was literally next to our room and not labeled as staff elevator at all I think that could use a little clarification , The view from our room was amazing rm 2027
306102,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Its not the fault of the hotel but there was too much noise at night time but as we were tired we slept through like a baby Maybe its very normal in that part of Amsterdam drunk English lads causing too much unrest but Amsterdam is very safe and welcoming city The hotel is just a few meter walk to the famous red light district china town and number of monuments coffee shops centraal station etc etc , We had a fantastic stay Hotel is very nicely located rooms are large size and very clean simple but nicely decorated Their staff is very professional very kind very hospitable but the price is sky high too expensive We think as this location is ideal otherwise it is just an average 5 star hotel but very hospitable and welcoming staff They have taken a very good care of us 
306103,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Nothing, All the staff were brilliant The breakfast was the best that we have had on our 4 week trip in Europe The upgrade to the apartment was fantastic for our family Location can t be beaten for exploring Thank you once again we will highly recommend staying with you to our friends 
306104,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Booking com didn t book 2 rooms that we had payed for only one we had to pay for another room which restricted us of doing things as we didn t have much money after payn twice totally disgusted with booking com will not use them again I also sent you a email and was expecting a reply but didn t even get one I want a explanation,No Positive
306105,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, It s at the higher end of the pricing scale but that attracts a certain clientele and means you will not be subjected to raucous noisy weekend parties and brides to be with their entourage of loudmouthed drunks, Excellent hotel in the heart of Amsterdam a haven of peace and tranquility in the bustling centre Excellent room with separate toilet and shower superking bed with really nice linens Friendly and helpful staff in all departments Amazing breakfast In spite of the hotel being full it was amazingly quiet and peaceful in the public areas I would definitely go back to this hotel 
306106,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, No lock on bathroom door Disposable toothbrushes not provided in case of emergency Not clear on charges for mini bar Coffee and water provided on first day but not sure if part of cost after that albeit no water provided on second day , Bed was fantastic Extremely comfortable too as was the whole room experience Excellent location 
306107,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Obviously a minor issue but I guess they might refrain from knocking on doors just after 9 00am to check the mini bar status , Excellence all the way through breakfast rooms location efficient and helpful staff
306108,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, paying 50 to park the car from 6pm to 10am Wouldn t mind if I was there for 24hours but 25 would have been a more sensible price for 1 2 day , Good bed Nice breakfast Would stay here again for the right money Best factor is location right in central Amsterdam 
306109,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Our room was located on the first floor above a cafe and quite close to the street which was pretty noisy from 6am in the morning , The location is fantastic On Dam Square and very close to pretty much everything The staff were very helpful and friendly I d definetly stay here again 
306110,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The main historical hotel building is only one of many internal buildings of the hotel Our superior rooms were in one of the internal buildings elevator 5 and were very very small even for Amsterdam standards e g compared to Swissotel across Dam square They might be OK for a single person but way too cramped for a couple Bathroom is actually a glass stall inside the room It is absolutely impossible for one person to use the toilet or the bathroom without totally waking up the other as there s a single light switch for both and the glass walls do not block any light or noise The tiny closet has space for about 3 hangers because of a weird huge clothes pressing contraption that takes most of the space BTW the closed is so cramped that some of the little things usually found inside e g cups are store on shelves near or at the floor The minimalist shower stall has absolutely no place to hold anything you d need to shower soap shampoo everything must go in the floor No place to hang towels except for a single hook away from the shower stall We ve also experienced some water temperature variations sudden cold then super hot shots during every shower an unpleasant surprise for a supposedly upper scale and recently renovated property Unfortunately we ended up with the feeling of overpaying for a less than stellar comfort level at the Krasnapolsky even compared to other and simpler NH Collection places we ve stayed earlier during the same trip in Italy Would hardly consider coming back to it at the current price level probably choosing the Swissotel despite its less charming outside appearance , Perfect location beautiful historical property overlooking Dam square Excellent breakfast inside a truly beautiful room with very high ceiling and natural light Good heating AC Quiet room facing away from the square ou busy streets Slightly stiff mattresses which may be a problem for some Very clean Friendly staff 
306111,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, There was no bathtub just a shower Breakfast was too expensive so we didn t try it , The room was nice there was a good entertainment system in the tv staff was great and all requests were granted promptly location is amazing right in the center and close to everything Excellent coffee machine in the room 
306112,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Price to high compared to what you get Breakfast is 30 a day for one person which is ridiculous , Location in fantastic Great staff and nice rooms Cleaning was average 
306113,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The apartments are definitely NOT 5 star There were cigarette burns in the curtain chipped furniture cracks in the ceiling etc The beds were stiff and many queen beds were made of cheap single beds put together that formed a crack in the middle All rooms are called Superior which is misleading Look at what s after Superior in the room type Single Double Premium Only Premium is close to a 5 star experience which is what this hotel advertises itself as Superior Single rooms are much closer to Motel 6 , The location is in the heart of Amsterdam
306114,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Staff service staff arrogance hotel value way over priced The superior rooms are min 150 per night more than comparable better quality hotels within short walk We had torn sheets on our beds that we asked to get changed and were not We were not helped with our bags even when we had changed rooms Crappy pillows porter baggage assistants non existent Dirty room crappy room over loading dock which was a superior room If this were a discount hotel then some of this wouldn t matter but the fact that they call themselves a 5 star hotel is a joke , The more expensive rooms are fine Staff service is poor especially for a 5 star hotel 
306115,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The rooms view is not that good but this is expected in such a crowded area , Location it is in the center of Amsterdam Rooms style is awesome the hotel overall interior design is amazing specially the restaurant area 
306116,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, I forget my jacket in the room i noticed it then i sent an email to the hotel Nobody answered The day after i called them they said they will investigate and will inform me back Again there was no answer On third day i called again and they said me they didn t find,No Positive
306117,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Very noisy some noise from outside the hotel but mostly other guest walking around at night keeping us awake Rooms need to be better insulated to corridor noise Brought this point up st reception st checkout but not given any apology , Lovely reception area with a gorgeous bar and patisserie All the staff were friendly and helpful 
306118,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, No English language TV nor the option to purchase movies Breakfast was expensive and poor quality Huge queues at check in and check out Staff unhelpful with regards to advice on getting around , Outstanding location
306119,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Everything else was not up to an expected standard the build quality for a 5 star Hotel is shocking and poor the staff need sacking I have never had a duty manager tell me to F k Off The Head Office will now be contacted and my complaint taken to the Board of Directors, The Location
306120,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The room did not have a view and on two occasions I was woken up in the morning by planks being sawn and on another by a cement mixer I arrived at the hotel around 7 30pm after reaching Amsterdam on an overnight flight but was told I could not get a room until 3pm Tiring , Clean room comfortable bed and good shower toilet facilities
306121,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Some of the design was strange in small details For example the soap dish in the shower had no drainage so the soap floated in a pool of water There was a tiny step up into the bathroom about 1 cm so it was possible to catch your toe every time The corridors to the room were extremely hot and stuffy , The staff were wonderful The room was smart and the bed amazingly comfortable 
306122,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, More outlets for Americans to use the transformer Airconditioning is controlled by hotel so it could not be lowered to our satisfaction More counter space in the bathroom, Bed was very comfy and the room had been recently remodeled very nicely The location could not have been more convenient and the staff more helpful
306123,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Either Booking com or the hotel misplaced our reservation as NH had no record of it Thankfully the staff solved the problem but at a significant increase in cost since I had to upgrade my original reservation The good part was the room was great as one would expect with the upgrade , When we arrived the hotel did not have our Booking com reservation no record of it Don t know who was at fault but it generated some anxious moments for my wife and I However and to their credit the staff particularly Beatrice at the front desk was extremely helpful in getting us a room even though it was early in the morning way before check in Our room looked right out on Dam Square and was very nice It was a large sunny and well appointed room It provided a great start to our European vacation 
306124,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Room very scrateched Too much noise coming for upstairs Too much noise from corridor Room and elevator far far from entrance in some paria zone I thought, Nice team Nice service Nice location
306125,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, I asked for the hotel to empty the mini bar they did but the fridge wasn t working I asked them to fix it since I was on a business trip for 5 nights but they kept ignoring me For 400 dollars a night I thought they would at least get that done , Location of the hotel was great right in the heart of the center Very touristy though for those of you that aren t really interested in the tourist life 
306126,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Very impersonal and standard service No smilining employees You feel nobody care of you Shopping Mall style service Wi fi didn t work in the room No upsell of diferent services in the hotel No inviting restaurant and bar , Location Size of room Room product bed comfort lighting bathroom 
306127,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Front desk staff were very arrogant They badly need more training on 5 star hotels customer service Rooms are cleaned and checked only once a day No one pass in the evening to check if towels or mini bar needs to be refreshed , Location Location Location and room comfort
306128,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Staff although polite stand offish It seems the trend is to show yourself to your room which is not 5 star practice Beds not turned down at night , Bed was comfy Rooms immaculately clean Coffee maker and kettle in room 
306129,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The hallway smelt like wet carpet it didn t effect the rooms so wasn t a huge issue The bed was a bit hard for my liking but was huge and still comfortable , Great location nice furnishings and very friendly staff Large king size bed 
306130,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Breakfast was very poor for the price the food was cold and fried eggs dried up coffee from a machine in the restaurant was terrible There were 5 of us at nearly 30 each I would expect to be served the tea and coffee Staff on reception didn t seem to know what they were doing They tried to charge again when I had prepaid the rooms and they didn t seem to be able to find anyone s bookings Had to ask for the room to be cleaned This is the 4th time I have stayed here and feel that it didn t live up to the previous times , location coffee machine in room 
306131,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Having to leave, From when we arrived the staff were so helpful and polite Upon arrival they informed my wife and I that we had a free upgrade to an apartment So from a standard double room we were given a flat in the middle of Dam Square it had it s own kitchen fully fitted kitchen lounge area utilities provided such as kettles plates cuttlery iron board even a hoover we weren t going to clean but it was a nice gesture none the less Overall the hotel made a wonderful trip even more wonderful We ll definitely return 
306132,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Room cleanliness or should I say dirtiness Very bad renovation turning a grand traditional hotel into a modern overnight in and out business type bad facilities, The location and some of the staff were charming
306133,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, We were on the first floor on Thursday Friday night A lot of revellers in the alley Lots of noise Wouldn t have had that in a higher floor , Locality was great for walking Nice staff 
306134,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Upkeep was poor elevator and its associated signage speaker floor walls overall cleanliness was terrible Seemed like it was also used for a service elevator Hallway smelled most of the time , Location lobby were best qualities 
306135,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Paying 43 euro for two double rum and Cokes in the hotel bar however it s not the worst I ve ever payed and the bar itself is excellent , If you have never been to Amsterdam before the location of the hotel is perfect a stone throw away from numerous tourist attractions retailers and places to eat When we arrived me and one friend with our room pre booked we were given a free upgrade to a superior room in the Amsterdam wing 
306136,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Prepaid but had no record at registration and had to pay again Checked bank records going Back 12 mths and confirmed had already paid Ran out of Nespresso coffee pads they made a big deal about saying we had a coffee machine in premium room and they wanted 12 euros for 6 new pads Ridiculous as no other coffee in room , Location
306137,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Only down side was for the size of hotel no swimming pool or spa which is a shame really However wouldn t stop us returning, From the moment we arrived to the day we left 4days later we had the WOW factor with this hotel The ladies and gent at reception are well mannered We also found the cleaners to be very polite and honest I had left a lot of euros on the table and to a euro it was all there on my return Nothing was too much trouble a truely memorable experience The location is second to none We shall most definitely be returning 
306138,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Having to go outside and across a lane to get to our bedroom wing Room lighting complex multi switches and ultimately inadequate My wife cannot understand why this hotel like many others does not place a mirror above the dressing table Although plenty elsewhere The cooked breakfast guy cannot fry eggs without vulcanising them , Excellent hotel recently modernised to high standards friendly helpful staff central location right on Dam Square Superb breakfast buffet fried eggs apart 
306139,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, everything was perfect, size and comfort of the bed the location of the hotel Would happily move to Amsterdam and live in your hotel couldn t be happier 
306140,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, I stayed in the superior room 5008 I did like everything apart from the price the room was small it was definetly NOT worth 732 for the size of room that was my only complain,No Positive
306141,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Very clean nice staff except for some delay when we asked for blankets when we arrived Everything was great thanks, We booked apartment outside the main building on the other side of the canal behind the Hotel fully equipped Very central located in the heart of Dam Square 5 min walk to central station not so far from museums area staff very helpful kind luxurious classy don t miss the main restaurant we had breakfast it is GRAND indeed Concierge ppl are so professional helped a lot to arrange book a trip Mr Ayman Gomaa was so kind informative
306142,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Wasted 30min of my time arguing that room will require extra cleaning after a chocolate was stepped on the floor Charged 200 for the extra cleaning Not something I expect from 5 star hotel and 700 per night suite , Location is good 
306143,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The air conditioning wasn t working very well It was too hot and we were only staying for a night By the morning it was too late to call the technician cause we were checking out The only solution was to open the window which was locked Thankfully they were very helpful in helping us open it , Staff were very helpful in trying to solve our issue with the air conditioning Location is great 
306144,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Having stayed in many nice hotels this misses the mark for being a supposed 5 hotel My room was small the bed was cheap and springy the sheets didn t even reach the end of the bed I had a view of a brick wall and roof This felt more like an Ibis and I was left disappointed It s a good location but if it s luxury you are after this is not it , Excellent location in the heart of the city 
306145,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Had to wait a long time to check in but staff very helpful and attentive Had to cross a passage to the wing of the hotel where my room was and felt a bit unsafe even during the day , Nice size room great bathroom and breakfast was superb 
306146,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, There was no locking system to the bathroom and breakfast was overpriced , I like the location of this hotel close to all bars and restaurant and great for nightlife 
306147,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Service The room was made up with 2 separate beds which we immediately requested be made into one bed Five separate calls over two days and a trip to reception which was in another building somebody eventually came to the room and replaced the sheets with a large one but they didn t replace the 2small duvets fobbing us off with I ll come back later lies no one came that night or the following day or night The food was expensive and generally inadequate The housekeeping replaced two used towels with only one and complimentary water for tea and coffee was only given on the first day of the stay which when queried we were told it was chargeable or we could drink the bathroom water I got the impression that as our bill had effectively been paid before we arrived service was not their highest priority , The location 
306148,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, We did not eat at the restaurants Prices were very high and we could get food nearby for much less Would have liked to have eaten at the restaurants for convenience There was a beautiful sitting area off to left of the service desk We wanted to go in there with some friends who were staying at a different hotel The area was roped off but not being used , The rooms were very clean and beds were very comfortable Great showers Everyone at the service desks were very kind and helpful There were fresh flowers inside the hotel lobby that were fabulous The outside front entrance was also beautifully appointed with flowers Very inviting 
306149,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, We got 2 beds instead of a king one We stayed at an XL premium room with view to the plaza and floor was very deteriorated Price was very high Air conditioning wasn t working room was too hot most of the time so we had to open the windows which turned it very very noisy , Location is very good right at the Dam Plaza
306150,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, We were given a room on the road facing side on the first night which was very noisy until about 3 am It was a Saturday On our request our room was changed on the following day to a very comfortable and bigger room without noise which we appreciated and thanked the reception staff, Location Service all round was excellent Very friendly courteous and helpful staff It will be my first choice of hotel next time in Amsterdam
306151,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Having to leave We look forward to booking a return visit soon It is a very popular location so near the flower market transportation the museum district and yes the red light district , This elegant modernized Grand Dame hotel is located across from the Dutch Royal Palace on Damm Square It is a five minute walk from Amsterdams Central Station The Staff is professional personable and friendly The breakfast in the elegant ball room is wonderful Cocktails at the Tailor theHotel Bar is great Many great restaurants near by all available with help from the concierge 
306152,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Check in took about twenty five minutes with staff trying to locate a twin room which I had booked and already paid for Was then sent to lift which was tucked away next to an entrance to a kitchen or service area located a long way from reception and the room only to find a lift 3 doors from our room Their version of a twin room is two single beds pushed up against each other Placement of fixed bedside tables means this is the only way it can be done The floors felt sticky Room only had one set of toiletries and one bathrobe and one pair of slippers Flaking paint in shower Shower made deafening noise which we only realised late just before going to bed All in all it felt like a poor budget hotel other than for communal areas Room was located at side of hotel heading towards red light district and noisey at night Shame really as there is so much potential , Impressive foyer and central location though this is not much of a bonus as Amsterdam is so small and easy to get around where ever you are 
306153,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The room is small The service was very slow and it at times none was provided at all Complimentary water at day one only The hotel is too expensive for what it offers Wasn t pleasant experience Don t think I will be going back again , Probably the location is the only advantage 
306154,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Staff seemed very unwilling to voluntarily assist us at the reception Things were also not adequately explained by staff I was particularly annoyed by the 200 deposit which I was forced to give at check in which was not mentioned at any point prior , Location is ideal and the room was very spacious and modern You won t find anywhere closer to the centre of Amsterdam 
306155,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, The lift to our floor was at the back of the building next to the car park fire door exit Felt very uneasy waiting for the lift Hotel took a exceptionaly high security deposit upon arrival which they failed to unhold with my bank upon departure so now I am out of pocket for 10 working days which equates to 2 weeks until the funds will be released into my account , Location was superb Hotel was very classy with regards to the design and furnishings Room was spotless modern trendy room with bright neutral colours Most guests were very casually dressed so you don t feel out of place given the hotels high star rating 
306156,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, even thou the stuff was the best i ever met in hotel yet and i cant think of a better location in entire city i still thing it a bit pricey even for the 5 star hotel One of the elevators was broken that was really annoying, Location is perfect on dam square You are just 200m away from red light district and most attractions accessible by foot Train station just 5 minutes away and most of the trams and buses goes to dam square The stuff was superb They upgraded our room for free just because they had them empty But the thing that impressed me the most that there are Tesla cars taxis in Amsterdam Iam a big fan of the brand and i tryed to catch one but failed This cars are very expensive and i never thought i ride one I came to the reception and asked if they can order Tesla electric car for me and they did That was the best airport ride of my life Thank you very much

306158,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, We waited until 3 30 for our room and it still wasn t ready so we were given an upgrade to a premium from a superior room Would have been interested to have had a look at the room we actually booked We would definately visit again the hotel is on dam square Staff all helpful and pleasant It was just the length of time we had to wait having arrived at about 12 30 We took a canal cruise to pass the time and the weather was fab , Everything

306165,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, When we arrived it happened that all reservations from booking com were trashed We were offered awful apartments across the street It took a bit convincing to pursue them to give us our Room Left a feeling that if we would arrive later we would be out of luck Service at bar is painfully slow Long lines to wait for consierge and checkin checkout , Location is great 
306166,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, We asked many times via e mail to deliver us material we left in the room but the answer alwais took long time and was general so we lost the material , Central position
306167,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Our room appeared to be catered for one person as opposed to a 2 person room Hairdryer needed replacement so it was swapped with a room heater Toiletries needed to be asked for on more then one occasion Advertises In house movies on television however in our section there was no access to them While food was lovely at breakfasts they were very understaffed for the number of clientele present Seemed to be more focused on business clients then holiday makers , The breakfasts were very well catered for in regards to food choice Bar and cafe areas were well staffed Foyer lovely Reception staff were very helpful

306173,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Initial room much too small for the price requested and was provided with a slightly larger room D cor is too modern for my taste and lacks the feel of being in old Amsterdam Staff is helpful for requests but lacks personal service , great location near the train station and great department store
306174,NH Collection Amsterdam Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky, Didn t know my details when arrived Hidden charges upon check in Extra 50 a day seems excessive and makes the room appear better value than in reality when searching online , My room was absolutely outstanding big modern wet room style shower comfy large bed nice mini bar selection and quality furnishings
