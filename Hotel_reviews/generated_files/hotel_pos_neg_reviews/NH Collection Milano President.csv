366733,NH Collection Milano President, Very hard to find the parking and you can hear the sound of cars passing by from your room We asked for higher floor but was given a room near the street with a bad view from construction A little bit far from restaurants and the shopping center You have to walk at least 10 minutes and you ll sweat from the heat of the sun The entrance of the hotel is a road so you have to be careful if you have small children The sofa bed was not that comfortable and there should be more pillow , The staff were so accommodating especially the restaurant The room was so clean spacious and modern Our suite can accommodate us all good for four person 
366734,NH Collection Milano President, Nothing, Staff was helpful especially CARMEN I guess she is the breakfast manager or supervisor plus the 5 or 6 deferent verify of croissant in the breakfast 
366735,NH Collection Milano President, We were supposed to have a nice Plaza view but there was only a big construction work just in front of the hotel because they were building a new metro station there So it was impossible to enjoy the balcony or open the balcony door during construction hours the noice was terrible , Otherwise hotel location was nice breakfast was good and sufficient free waterbotlles on every floor was also a nice little bonus Very polite and helpful doormen 
366736,NH Collection Milano President, We had requested an early check in but still had to wait till mid afternoon to get into our room , The breakfast was amazing The junior suite room we had was very stylish and modern Nice to have complimentary water and a coffee machine Lovely bed and bathroom The location was great only a 5 minute walk from the Duomo The communal areas of the hotel were very stylish too The garage is immediately behind the hotel and the garage operator sorted out the 3 congestion charge which was most convenient Direct access from the garage into the hotel 
366737,NH Collection Milano President,No Negative, We Stayed for two nights with my wife and two kids in Junior Suite with Extra Bed The staff was very helpful and friendly it s just about 4 min walking from the Dumo and all shopping streets It was fantastic Suite with a King size bed and full Bathroom mentens with two LCD The seating area with LCD and sofa bed There is a balcony without setting just to see the city from up Hotel is very secured so you can t reach your room from the elevator without your room key 
366738,NH Collection Milano President, Although within walking distance to the Duomo the hotels location felt out of the way and there was a lack of restaurants at night in the immediate area There was a major construction site just outside the entrance to the hotel not the hotels fault at the time of our stay We requested a change of rooms due to a very squeaky bed Surely other people must have complained about it Would consider other hotels if we were to return to Milan , Location was within walking distance to the Duomo Piazza and metro station The staff were accommodating in our request for a change of rooms and we re always welcoming 
366739,NH Collection Milano President, a bit noisy if accomodated on Via Largo Augusto after corner or Via Francesco Sfortza It is better to request a room on the reception side , Excellent central location well trained staff nice rooms Nice gym Nice selection of spirits and wines in the lobby bar 
366740,NH Collection Milano President,No Negative, Excellent service from front of house staff Very comfortable room great view of the Duomo Fabulous location Great breakfast too it had everything Italy is also v good for those that have to avoid gluten

366742,NH Collection Milano President, the shower in the bathroom was not 5 stars standard Staff wasnt that helpful with the luggage and parking is handled by separate service , The hotel is very well located and room is good Staff was nice to provide a bottle of champagne for our honeymoon 
366743,NH Collection Milano President, Our pick up car couldn t stop right in front of the hotel because there was a construction going on right in front of the hotel , We booked a junior suite and the room was really spacious for the four of us The breakfast food was very good The concierge was also very helpful We went away for a couple of days to Venice and they stored our 4 luggages without questions They also have really yummy fruit jellies on the reception desks 
366744,NH Collection Milano President, This time house keeping was poor They left only one set of towel Also room was located same floor with breakfast restaurant Access to the room was through the door like back of house , Excellent breakfast 
366745,NH Collection Milano President, parking underground too expensive and no left we have to take stairs and it was difficult with kids the hotel entrance from the street is not good we can t stop near the entrance because it is a main street with no side parking or even waiting area , the staff welcome us and show us the suite facility they also keen in providing information breakfast was amazing the location good
366746,NH Collection Milano President,No Negative, The friendly and helpful staff at the reception and Breakfast area The Breakfast spread was very excellent and they even had Gluten free food for my wife who is Gluten Intolerant Very handy to all the major tourist sites 
366747,NH Collection Milano President, The room service was a bit difficult to order since they don t really speak English but it s a 5 stars hotel and when I got there I spent few hours to solve the reservation problems I booked the room for two night but the staff insisted that I booked it wrong then I showed her the reference but she couldn t find the booking on the computer and finally she found it as it took a while to wait Overall the price is nice and they are friendly the location is good so I will recommend it , The room was big and comfortable and clean staffs were friendly nice location near the shopping area 
366748,NH Collection Milano President, It s just a standard hotel with no bells and whistles and the value for money is not great , The hotel is clean and nice and it s a central location walking distance from Duomo 
366749,NH Collection Milano President, A lot of noisy work in front of the hotel starting at morning difficult to sleep late I asked for a double bed and I get as always 2 single beds Breakfast very expensive 33 per person , Nice location very central Charming and clean but small for a Superior Double room with a view Good wifi connexion
366750,NH Collection Milano President, Air Conditioning could have been colder it was hot in Milan but the temperature setting on the AC was governed by the hotel and we could not set it lower , Staff was extremely helpful excellent English 
366751,NH Collection Milano President, Wish the AC was colder in the room Closest metro station was a bit of a hike , Nice room nice bar nice staff Vey close to Duomo without the crowds 
366752,NH Collection Milano President, Size of rooms was a little annoying shower is going to be too small for any one above average size , Hotel staff went out of there way to please us breakfast was excellent 
366753,NH Collection Milano President,No Negative, Not inexpensive not much in Milan is but a great value Elegant and well appointed guest rooms and public areas helpful and welcoming staff all the ones I encountered spoke English great location within blocks of the Duomo and the Galleria Wonderful breakfast spread with gorgeous array of freshly baked pastries and lots more Big plus soundproof windows that keep out the din of the street no small thing in a crowded noisy area and flawlessly functioning air conditioning despite ferocious heat outside Slept like a baby in the ultra comfy bed Can t say enough good things about this stylish and friendly hotel 
366754,NH Collection Milano President, Construction in front made access difficult In the evenings upon return to the hotel numerous homeless individuals on the sidewalks we had to walk over or around to get to the hotel Air conditioning did not keep the room cool , Modern look rooms nice with coffee Amazing bathroom 
366755,NH Collection Milano President,No Negative, The staff especially on the reception desk were extremly helpful The room was very quiet clean and the bed comfortable Location was important to us as we were in Milan for a short visit and we wanted to expierence all that the city had to offer 
366756,NH Collection Milano President, Because of the construction near hotel there was noice a bit, Close to center Duomo Close to shopping areas and close to eating places king size bed is real and comfortable

366759,NH Collection Milano President, Again as I have said I think there should be a little bit more for vegetarians police for breakfast besides that nothing really to complain about, Most importantly the staff are amazing and and as I ve said on my trip advisor review I will most definitely be staying here again and recommending it to all my colleagues
366760,NH Collection Milano President, Directions on using the coffee maker would have been useful It gave me trouble the whole time Also no clock in the room Why Modern and appears rather new overall except the mattress Kind of dipped worn , Location close to the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II Very nice facilities Gracious staff Safe for solo travelers No using the elevator without your key 
366761,NH Collection Milano President, construction around the Hotel car parking very expensive i couldn t sleep neither my wife because of Bed Bugs or Mosquitoes that caused itches and bites all over our Body very bad experience for this high amount spent within the hotel Parking and room , Great Location
366762,NH Collection Milano President, The staff Was rude Interested in attending groups only and not so much individual guests I Was told to call The place I needed to call myself though noone in that place spoke english etc Many emplomes behind The desk none willing to serve Bar left unattended most of The time bartender rude Defenitely The worse 4 star hotel receptionist service I have ever stayed in Of noticie The staff acted angry and unenthsiastic ,No Positive
366763,NH Collection Milano President, Breakfast for 33 EUR is very expensive No water bottle for free available at the room , The hotel is perfectly located at the city center just a couple of mins to walk from the Cathedrale The rooms are big and clean The stuff was really friendly 
366764,NH Collection Milano President, Internet was very limited could not use the software that I needed to use for my work I could not even see YouTube And there was no 4G connection in the room either Basically I was cut off from the internet while being in a luxury hotel in the center of Milan The bar was basically inside the lobby and offered so little privacy and comfort that it was not possible to have a business lunch I ve found the building architecture embarassingly ugly , The staff was courteous and the position was good 
366765,NH Collection Milano President, since its my 4th time i have booked for 12 days and had to leave in 10 days due to some other commitment however they refused to refund the amount i know its none refundable booking but since am loyal with them and with booking com which you can see i was in Qatar for the same dates i booked in Milan but none refunded the money, its my 4th time i stay there and i like the location employees lobby breakfast and smell of the hotel
366766,NH Collection Milano President, the piazza in front is a building site for a new metro line but it had little impact , Location was very convenient near the Duomo the passagio and La Scala close to the metro for anything else Plenty of free bottled water in fridge next to lift 
366767,NH Collection Milano President, The first room we were given had a double bed so we needed to swap despite the booking being for a room with single beds Anyway our room was changed without any issue , The location was excellent it was about 10 minutes to the Duomo on foot The staff were very welcoming and helpful The room was good fine for two to share although the single beds were pushed together and a little cosy Breakfast was lovely fab coffee The room was very quiet with a very quiet air conditioning unit we slept well 
366768,NH Collection Milano President, being moves around the lack or organisation the style of the room The building works going on outside of the hotel, when I arrived I had to move rooms three times as they booked the wrong room We previously stayed at the NH collection in Rome back in January which was beautiful This hotel was not up to the same standard There was building works going on outside of the hotel which I was nevre made aware of 
366769,NH Collection Milano President, Customer care We were surprised when we arrived to the bus tour Tanzi We have been cancelled of a como tour nobody knows why Is it the rate of this hotel No answer At the check out we were also surprised that we were charged at a breakfast that we didn t take ,No Positive
366770,NH Collection Milano President, construction site just in front of the hotel quite noisy trams going around hotel, Great location close to Duomo and shopping areas very helpful staff at front desk clean rooms good breakfast
366771,NH Collection Milano President, There were no drawers or any where to put things away You could only hang stuff your trousers Blouses Shirts etc But no where to put anything else No hooks on the bathroom They charged you for any room service 8 euros for anything you asked to your room Water coke ice etc 15 for breakfast besides the cost , The location But sadly the plaza in front of the hotel was under construction so it was kind of scary to walk at night 
366772,NH Collection Milano President,No Negative, This is a 5 hotel The hotel bar food was excellent and such a high standard The whole hotel was excellent and I could not fault it would definitetly recommend staying here 
366773,NH Collection Milano President,No Negative, Super happy with everything My boyfriend has a birthday when we come to the hotel The staff made a special gift for him When we sat in the lobby for a little while and went out to see the city they came with a cake and champagne glasses for both This was SUPER SURPRISE for both me and my boyfriend He thought I organized all this but myself was so surprised i try to find quickly my phone to make a photo If I were to be prepared then I would take this special moment on camera or video because it s memory for life The room was ok little bit maybe expensive i was thinking but because of service in hotel how much attencion they have how special day was for us it was worth it And this day my boyfriend could use bar and all drinking from the bar and snacks for free Milan is expensive for example a beer in caf outside cathedral duomo cost 9 and fanta drink 6 A little bit Walk from center and its halv price for drinking and restaurang anyway i notice more nice and cheaper to have a drink and snacks at hotel big beer cost 8 50 inklusive snacks My conclusion about trip to Milan its very beautiul and worth to to visit be careful on the street If you stay in nice hotel like we did you will enjoy it Service at hotel was the best i ever had if i ever visit again Milan i will stay here at NH Collection Milano president Thank you so much for everything I will allways remember you and your hotel THANK YOU xxx
366774,NH Collection Milano President,No Negative, Its not my first time its the 4th time i stay in this hotel the location is amazing the employees in the hotel and the breakfast as well the lobby area 
366775,NH Collection Milano President,No Negative, I liked everything about this hotel The staff was friendly and helpful with information about Milan The room was large and clean The breakfast had a good selection of food The location of the hotel was perfect close to the city center The fitness room has everything you need 
366776,NH Collection Milano President, We had a small bug in our room we hope that it was not the kind that eats clothes and stuff not a bed bug but a one that we found climbing on our room wall ,No Positive
366777,NH Collection Milano President, The street is very noisy impossible to sleep The conditioner did not work and someone was smoking so all the smoke went into my room The worse experience i ever had Would not reccomend this hotel to anyone ,No Positive
366778,NH Collection Milano President, Room keys keep on malfunctioning construction site in front of the hotel and they have yet to send me my invoice by email after requesting so during check out by phone and by a follow up email , Location is decent rooms are decent service is decent
366779,NH Collection Milano President,No Negative, The staff were very nice happy and extremely quick to respond to any request They came across genuinely caring and pleasant as well as very professional I will definitely stay there on my next trip I would highly recommend it Location is perfect too very central 
366780,NH Collection Milano President, Everything was perfet, There was a mix up with my booking but Baldo at reception was so helpful He managed to give me a lovely room and even called to check it was ok I stay at this hotel for business and wouldn t look to stay anywhere else whilst in Milan 
366781,NH Collection Milano President, The air con was not working in the room We were unable to sleep most of the night as our baby could not settle due to heat When we opened the window the noise of the traffic was so loud it woke the baby up The reason for the aircon not working was that in milan during the cooler months they turn this facility off in the hotel The weather was unusually hot during our stay but this was not a good enough excuse The second night was as bad as the first even though maintenance said they had fixed it There are no baby changing facilities in the hotel except for the hotel room , The staff were amazing From the moment we walked in to the moment we checked out they were very helpful The negatives could be dealt with and arent something that would put me off staying there again They gave us gifts for the baby and the location was perfect A short 10 Mins with a pram walk from the hotel to the duomo and a further 10 min walk from duomo to the last supper and fashion district The breakfast was lovely and room service was prompt and food was delicious 
366782,NH Collection Milano President, Parking options are very bad we paid 70Euro for two days we changed room In the first room the toilet was not flushing and the water in the sink also did not flush at the second room we had the same problem with the sink It was smelling in the corridors and we found a hair in the bed The rooms are extremely small We would not recommend this hotel no idea why this hotel had rather high ratings The NH in Turin is way better then this one , The Location is very good
366783,NH Collection Milano President, I was not made aware that there was heavy building work just in front of the hotel and although I had asked for a quiet room the one I was given was was at the front Noise and dust were not very pleasant , Ideal Location
366784,NH Collection Milano President, I am a member of by group and I usually use nh I book for 2 days and before arrival I want to change my booking to one day but they don t accept it Not nice,No Positive
366785,NH Collection Milano President,No Negative, The facility is great and the people are even better Everyone was extremely nice helpful and friendly And that s not everything the hotel is located literally 4 min walking distance from Duomo so we could just walk to all the popular places in Milan and didn t have to use the public transport at all Bonus On the second day of our stay it was my birthday and the hotel crew brought us champagne after we finished breakfast and made my day feel special straight from the start What a nice surprise 
366786,NH Collection Milano President, Breakfast choices were not that big On the other side champagne was served for breakfast which is always a great idea instruction side on front makes the location not that attractive, Beautiful rooms great location Amazing view from the suits
366787,NH Collection Milano President, 1 No twin beds I was with my mom and made it clear we needed separate when reservation was made 2 Unhelpful employees they get agressive if you conplain 3 Not possible to use my EUR 450 deposit at Booking com to pay part of the bill we have nothing to do with booking com they said 4 try to upsell the breakfast that was visibly over crowded when we were there I do NOT recomend the place although I had pleasants experiences with NH network before Dont stay here , Good New structure Bad Constant smell of urine from the fa ade also a noise from construction just in front Quite Small room even though I got a superior room 
366788,NH Collection Milano President, There is clearly an ongoing problem with homeless people sleeping just outside the hotel and when you re window is right over it all you can hear is them yelling I had to call down to reception to tell them to call the police because they were having a fist fight I would recommend that the hotel work with the police and the city council to try and resolve this problem , Lovely big bed and nice room Very clean Staff gave me an upgrade because I had to wait about 15 20 min to check in I would defiiitely stay here again if I go back to Milan Just not during fashion week as prices were obscenely high 
366789,NH Collection Milano President, The rooms are not really soundproof or isolated You can hear everything from down the streets and inside the hotel But it s not a real big minuspoint for me same at home , The balcony is awesome i hate it when a hotel just have one window and probably I can t even open it 
366790,NH Collection Milano President, The front desk receptionists are neither efficient nor friendly It took me quite a while to do my checkout although there was no queue There was no mention of the construction of the new metro station in front of the hotel ,No Positive
366791,NH Collection Milano President, Staff are not good the managment is worst managment I ever saw old fernture basic breakfast location was far from the doumo my stay was the worst even theives and poor people seating infront of the hotel me and my family we afrerad to go at night there are other hotels near better than it, Nothing
366792,NH Collection Milano President, the Arabica channel need to be add it to the TV chancels and more water bottle , the hotel amazing staff very kind and helpful near to the doum every mooring the over cokes water and snakes for free in the lobby
366793,NH Collection Milano President, Staff didn t give accurate information and weren t knowledgeable on many aspects No one offered to help when we first arrived I had to wait and then ask for someone to help with the luggage , Room was spacious and clean Reception area is big
366794,NH Collection Milano President,No Negative, Very good location and breakfast Staff was really helpful and the bed very comfortable Late check out times especially on Sunday The are happy also to keep your luggage secure after your check out to enjoy your last hours in the town 
366795,NH Collection Milano President, The room was full of dust My husband is allergic to dust but on a minimum so there must have been a lot a lot of dust because he spent the whole night coughing and suffocating We also had to check out earlier due to that however the room was booked for two nights of course no refund There should be a special policy for situations like that when a guest is sick etc, Location is great Staff are friendly On the reservation we choose an option to pay at the hotel and the hotel didn t try to take any irrelevant deposit beforehand which is very unusual with booking these days Great to finally stay at a property that trusts their guests 
366796,NH Collection Milano President,No Negative, Wonderful hotel Comfortable clean and spacy rooms superb location perfect to see Milan on foot Breakfast was very good too Perfect deal for the price and value We will definetely stay there on future trips to Milan 
366797,NH Collection Milano President, Fitness centre on renovation , Excellent location for shoppings n mins walk to Duomo And many taxis available at taxi lane just opp the hotel Staffs are friendly n warm We shortened our Rome stay n back to this modern clean hotel for extention Total 5 nites stays 
366798,NH Collection Milano President,No Negative, Absolutely perfect location Just three minutes from Duomo 20 meters from the bus to LIN airport Very good service friendly and helpful staff even with the craziest requests 
366799,NH Collection Milano President, We had a room with possible connection to next room locked door We had quite noisy smoking neighbours and all thile noise and smoke was coming through the door to our room We are no smokers and it was a surprise for me that it is possible to smoke in this hotel Than one day we notised water coming from above floor in our bathroom The stuff changed our room for the other one but in both rooms we saw old water prints on ceiling So it is a general problem of the hotel Sanitary equipment has multiple leakage so when you are taking shower half of water goes not on you but on the walls and floor No surprise that thete are leakage prints on the ceiling in every bathroom The surprise is that a hotel of this level can not fight this problem well , Comfortable location Good stuff Nice rooms 
366800,NH Collection Milano President, Not so kind staff but maybe they were too much under pressure Little tricky to reach the hotel by car because you need to enter Area C which has controlled traffic so beware that the hotel has no private garage you can park in one that they indicate anyway it will cost you 35 40 per day but we already knew it thanks to others guests reviews and you need to buy a card in a Newspaper Shop to allow your car s plate to ride in Area C otherwise you ll get a fine But I just discovered that because I asked the staff I ve travelled throughout Firenze that works on the same system as well the guy then told me that we needed to do all that If I hadn t have asked him he wouldn t have told me but he knew I was by car See what I m trying to say is that the staff need to care more for the tourists in this kind of thing , Great location and breakfast was amazing Room was super comfy with a large bed Shower was good but we thought it cold be a little better for a 4 star hotel 
366801,NH Collection Milano President, the pillows need more support its too flat the room cleaners are very hardworking , the waitress at the restaurant named ANNA is simply divine she is cheerful and ready to help 
366802,NH Collection Milano President,No Negative, The attention to detail is great they gave us an amazing room with a beautiful view I ordered an espresso and when it arrived I was at the buffet so by the time I got back to my table it was slightly cold and the waitress switched it with a new one without me having to say anything 
366803,NH Collection Milano President, No drawers to put my folded shirts Hotel s architect must have believed that business travelers have their shirts on hangers Lights in the room are a nightmare and if I had a companion it would be difficult not to disturb her The look of the room is very cheap not what I would expect to find in Milan the capital of design, Great location near Duomo Shopping streets garage under hotel nice breakfast Checkin was slow 
366804,NH Collection Milano President, Nothing , Excellent location close walking distance to Duomo City Centre and Shopping Fashion Quarters Perfect facilities and very friendly staff in particular the receptionist Alice and waiter Mohan Singh Sumptuous breakfast buffet The Restaurant is worth visiting for dinner 
366805,NH Collection Milano President, Nothing really Rooms fairly small but ok Cold atmosphere , One of those hotels you couldn t really fault or praise Very impersonal as is expected with a large city hotel Liked position 
366806,NH Collection Milano President, Breakfast was a little bit busy , The breakfast choice and quality was excellent Reception area and bar are really well designed and modern with excellent staff Our Bedroom and Bathroom were very clean And the bed very comfortable It was a short walk to the Duomo and we were lucky enough to get a view of the Duomo from the room
366807,NH Collection Milano President, wifi was temperamental but the hotel did their best to sort it out for us, The staff were excellent specially Alberto and Singh they made the stay amazing for a young famiyl with kids
366808,NH Collection Milano President, My colleagues arrived at breakfast before I did so it wasn t noticed when I joined them and it was hard to get the attention of the server for coffee The pancakes were cold even under the warming unit But breakfast was otherwise very good , The desk staff were great really friendly and put us at ease They really seemed to like their job 
366809,NH Collection Milano President,No Negative, I traveled with my pet dog this hotel was perfect for it there is a park nearby where i can walk my dog the location is near the Duomo I love the fact that this is a very pet friendly hotel The staff was very helpful when my dog made a mess I like this hotel very much 
366810,NH Collection Milano President, Nothing , Staff were amazing took my boyfriend here for his birthday and they upgraded us to the top floor suite lovely view and room overall perfect would 100 stay again 
366811,NH Collection Milano President, I would give this hotel a 10 So perhaps the following comments are not needed as it is not specific to the hotel Milan is a busy city with much traffic I came to Milan from Venice where there are NO cars So the neighborhood feels city like and bustling I like walking and getting over toward the Duomo helped but I did not enjoy walking the neighborhood like I did in Florence and Venice Also if this is helpful to anyone else the airport is quite a ways out of town I had a very early flight and had to be at the airport at 5 a m You need to take a train from downtown Milan to the airport So if you have a very early flight consider staying at the airport I stayed at the Sheraton Malpensa and was so very glad I did , The NH Collection President was a very nice hotel All of the staff were so professional and helpful The room was very nice spotless and comfortable They offered a delicious breakfast not only a buffet but you could order custom items like an omelet with your chosen ingredients And the breakfast hours were long in duration which is nice The location is very good and only about 10 minutes to walk to the Duomo piazza Everything about this hotel shows their ability to keep a very high standard for the guest 
366812,NH Collection Milano President, Cleanliness of the room Found plastic piece in scrambled egg the manager aplogized but no further investigation nor explanation was made They mixed our booking with other people and gave us worse room without view and claimed that we didnt have breakfast with our rate Almost believed the receptionist and i was about to paid extra for the breakfast Fortunately i checked booking dot com confirmation so i didnt pay extra Generally they have issues with capacity but with breakfast its maxed out Feels like a high school cafeteria Crowded and crowded and crowded I didnt enjoy the breakfast at all especially with the foreign particle in the food that they couldnt explain First time at NH and i will never come back , Location
366813,NH Collection Milano President, We arrived at the same time as a bus tour group and there were only two people on the front desk do it took some time to check in , Great spot close to everything Super comfy bed and the suite worked well for a family 
366814,NH Collection Milano President, Room on the small side for the price , Good location good staff English well spoken excellent breakfast Quality restaurant expensive tho and good late bar All very good really bar the price and size of room 
366815,NH Collection Milano President, Room was cold and digital temperature control only went up to 22 degrees Celsius Reception office reset the system but finally we were given a radiator to heat up the room Staff is nice yet many speak very poor English Street in front of hotel undergoing construction October 2016 so uncomfortable entrance with luggage and so on , Central location Great breakfast Comfortable room shower 
366816,NH Collection Milano President, Nothing, The location is perfect short walk to EVERYTING Basilica Palazza Metro restaurants and premier shopping And the staff was remendously helpful Recommended a fantastic authentic Milanese restaurant
366817,NH Collection Milano President, Asked for an iron with ironing board 3 times staff every time promised it would be delivered fast but did not ever materialize Safe in the room was defective Single room not much larger than a cupboard Wifi kept disconnecting this seems to be a problem also at other NH hotels , Good central location easy to reach by public transport Friendly staff Room on the 8th floor to the back was quiet and had a small coveerd balcony Complementary sparkling and still water in fridges in the hallway 
366818,NH Collection Milano President, Room not ready to check in to on arrival at gone 2pm , So close to Duomo and everything central Modern boutique feel yet not cold or austere Staff very helpful rooms very comfortable and incredibly well appointed 
366819,NH Collection Milano President, Could really do with a spa pool beauty salon and there didn t seem to be any partnerships locally to take advantage of , Staff were all friendly and helpful 
366820,NH Collection Milano President, Not one thing , This is a lovely modern hotel in a great location near the Duomo We just stayed one night at the end of our vacation but the room was good sized with comfortable bedding and modern bathroom facilities The bar and lounging areas were spacious and breakfast was delicious It was a busy lobby with lots of business travelers and returning shoppers stuffing their suitcases 
366821,NH Collection Milano President, NoneA hotel with nulti, Excellent choice for travellers to Milan The hotel is in close proximity to all your needs Quality and cleanleness are super Staff very friendly
366822,NH Collection Milano President, Could not control the temperature in the room and it was cold Apparently it s a central system that works according to the season , Love the hotel location comfort style decor clean friendly and helpful staff Will go back 
366823,NH Collection Milano President, The receptionist was a disaster all of them especially a lady who remind me hotels of 70 s, We are loyal and regular customers of rosa hotel next to your Hotel and said to give a try at your hotel but compared to Roza your Hotel was not at all nice
366824,NH Collection Milano President, The bathroom was a bit small The breakfast buffet service was slow , The location of the hotel was outstanding The hotel staff was courteous and very willing to help Overall our stay was very much worth it 
366825,NH Collection Milano President, The construction work in the street they closed the main street entrance so the taxi or the car cannot drop you off in the main entrance, The room is modern and nice
366826,NH Collection Milano President, There was a lot of construction going on in front of the hotel which a little inconvenient , Very well situated for walking to restaurants attractions etc Very accommodating staff excellent breakfast buffet included in our vroom rate great amenities 
366827,NH Collection Milano President, There was construction at front of hotel but it was not their fault , The size of the room and the comfort of the bed plus the special treat that was left in the room It was a nice welcoming gesture 
366828,NH Collection Milano President, The room was small for the price the fitments cupboard drawers etc were shabby For example the magnets to hold doors eyc closed were inoperative There was a dire shortage of convenient electric outlets , Breakfsat was excellent Staff had a friendly and helpful approach

366875,NH Collection Milano President, Parking is on site in the sense there is access to it from the hotel It is administered by a third party company and while you retain access to your car round the clock they also would keep your car keys and re arrange it in there as their logistics would require Not a big issue since the staff is nice and the arrangement is common in Italy I only wish they had a vacuum cleaner to lend me when I spilled baby formula all over luggage in my new car trunk , Location is an excellent 3 minuted walk to the Duomo and lots of mainstream dining and shopping opportunities We traveled with a 6 months old baby and everything worked according to plan The staff is very helpful and nice they fixed a baby crib in the room and were readily accommodating with our requests ice and a banana for the baby Everything with a smile and good attitude We will certainly be back

366938,NH Collection Milano President, I did not like the cards to read the doors and the elevator I think it should not be chips but more like sensors on the card Because my card was broken in my room from half more or less because I needed to insert it Then I could not use the elevator to go to the reception and I found the fire exit in the hotel to move to reception and change it I was in the 7th floor so for a customer I don t really think that it is useful I think it is quite expensive for this hotel the room was quite dark and small yet clean and good The car park is a problem and I don t understand why NH hotels is not making a deal with the car park behind the block to at least reduce the cost of the car parking I paid 70 euros out of nothing for car park for two nights For me for the hotel customers it should be max 10 euro per night , I enjoyed the location
366939,NH Collection Milano President,No Negative, Great breakfast beds and lobby zone Good view from the balcony if you have one Quite convenient location bike rentals right next to the entrance
366940,NH Collection Milano President, The reception staff are expected to also handle the call center which besides delays to guest seems to also cause frustration to the staff themselves , Breakfast was interesting Rooms seemed soundproofed enough Taxis queue right out side the hotel
366941,NH Collection Milano President,No Negative, Perfect location 3 min walk to Duomo and very safe Wi fi was excellent Breakfast was very good and rich Staff was very helpful Taxi just outside the door Excellent value for money Modern and minimal decoration Very good room size and clean

366943,NH Collection Milano President, The keys don t work all the time and you have to change them usually The space to put things in the bathroom is extremely small No drawers in the room not very convenience,No Positive
366944,NH Collection Milano President, My room 544 was next to an emergency exit being used constantly by staff it was like central station and each time the door was left to bang Safe locked open , Nice comfortable Rooms
366945,NH Collection Milano President, The hotel staffs at the cafe for breakfast are too busy We ordered an omelette and have to ask the 5th staff then we finally got our omelette , We checked into the premium double room but there was water leaking from the roof in the bathroom on the second night of stay We called the reception and they sent the maintenance guy within 10 minutes After confirm that it cannot be fixed we have one guy from reception who came and helped us to move to the luggage We were upgraded to a bigger room within the next 10 minutes This is really a great demonstration of showing the utmost concern to the customers 
366946,NH Collection Milano President, 1 Air conditioning was not functioning properly The room was mostly too hot In general in the hotel it was too hot 2 The room was very small for two people for the price charged We selected in booking com a room for 2 with seperate beds and the price is higher than a twin bed but the two beds were nearly fixed to each other 3 Some small objects that are standard for the room were missing like laundry bag cotton pads Mostly few people working at the reception 4 Price performance ratio is mediocre, Location is very central Reception is run by competent people
366947,NH Collection Milano President, Drains in the bathroom seems to be clogged , Everything Central location 5 minutes to Duomo and Torino 10 minutes by car to Central train station Plenty of good restaurants nearby Both beds in our junior suit were very comfortable Spacious Room 522 Nice view from balcony opening into the square Excellent breakfast spread with several kinds of fresh fruit juice Great stay overall Highly recommended for family stay 
366948,NH Collection Milano President, The bed is making noise when you move on it , Everything the staff were very friendly and helpful they offered us cake and juice for our arrivale because of our honeymoon
366949,NH Collection Milano President, Value engineered appointments like bed quality Small room Expensive for what you get but I guess due to central location Best probably on special deals, Excellent location good wifi free version at least for my needs helpful staff Close to subway and taxi stand outside hotel 
366950,NH Collection Milano President, Was given an extremely noisy room next to the cleaners service room Asked to move was Mey with unwillgness to help Was made to wait very long for a solution Overal extremely rude and unhelpful staff They were sarcastic and laughed at me This was across 5 different staff I will never stay here again And I feel totally ripped off , Free water 
366951,NH Collection Milano President, The door to our balcony did not close properly so the insonorisation was not as promised The air conditioning could not be programmed properly , Great location Great hotel Super breakfast Super staff in general but special compliments to the ladies in the breakfast room always smiling and efficient 
366952,NH Collection Milano President, Request for fresh cold milk from the bar did not materialise , Friendly and efficient staff excellent room exceptional cleanliness and perfect location
366953,NH Collection Milano President, Price we paid was too high even for the excellent suite No car park and the one employed by the hotel far too expensive , We liked our suite and the friendly helpful staff Great location for shopping site seeing and restaurants 
366954,NH Collection Milano President, Staff communication very poor Un professional staff They are doing service only but they don t care about you or about hotel reputation, Portable wifi for free goes with you any where
366955,NH Collection Milano President, Difficulty with lifts not accepting card Similar experience with card not opening our room door As we were on 3rd floor and right away from the lift room 337 this was a chore to go back down to reception to have card rectified , Excellent breakfast Comfortable quiet room Close to Duomo and other attractions 
366956,NH Collection Milano President, Understaffed at front desk There s always a line No concierge service First and only meal dinner was appaulling Luke warm soup and absolutely tasteless pasta Excuse from kitchen you are just not used to our food , Location of property Excellent The shower with double shower heads were great 
366957,NH Collection Milano President, Value of money it was really expensive comparing to room size and the stars, The staff are really friendly and helpful the room s facilities and details were very nice hotel s interior and decoration is very modern and new

366960,NH Collection Milano President, Hotel was hectic and front counter was chaotic People kept pushing in and staff did nothing to sort it out If it had not been for the lovely Giorga who was able to sort out my room I would have been disappointed Too few staff at reception for size of hotel , Good location nice room The lovely Giorgia at reception was very helpful
366961,NH Collection Milano President, It was very expensive i e low value for money some of the staff at the reception were not willing to serve genuinely Also we couldn t get hold of an Iron to press our clothes , The hotel was very clean modern and fairly close to the Dumo Breakfast had great varieties of food 
366962,NH Collection Milano President, One of the staff serving during breakfast was rude , It s a nice hotel 5 mins aways from the center of the city restaurants and supermarket are close by 
366963,NH Collection Milano President, I asked for near or adjacent room for my kids They don t care Although our booking was joneur suit not regular room My room was at the beging of the corridor and my children was at the end, Portable wifi out side the hotel
366964,NH Collection Milano President, Slow elevators the recepiontists are doing everything theyvare the operators the concierge everything They also dont speak english fluently nor they have all the information required by the guests I loved the staff from the ssme hotel chain but in rome, Location 8 minutes walking maximum from duomo and the city center also there are alot of shops nearby room cleanness room space that it has balconies good building i would recommend to stay here for sure but be prepared for the receptionists
366965,NH Collection Milano President, it was really far far too expensive for a city like Milan , They have portable wifi connectivity packs so we had internet everywhere we went It was fantastic The staff particularly Agnese was absolutely lovely It is modern clean and a really nice place to be

366974,NH Collection Milano President, Nothing really, Very cool thing about the hotel is the NHConnectivity Pack which basically gives you free Wifi anywhere in Milan I have never encountered something like this before and I think it shows the hotel is really thinking about their guests and what they require All staff is excellent especially Giorgia in reception and the breakfast team

366978,NH Collection Milano President, we had stayed at another NH hotel in Florence and when compared to the room we got there this one in Milan seemed smaller but not a really serious issue , location is excellent close to Duomo and the main shopping district metro station also was very close about 3 5 mins walk so it was convenient for us to go to Milan Expo easily great options at the buffet breakfast

366982,NH Collection Milano President, The fact they don t have family rooms I booked a room only to be forced to buy a second room although they did give me a discount after a long discussion The attitude of some of the receptionists there were 2 exceptionally rude Rooms are not soundproof people walking down the hallway were enough to wake u up, Location Very clean and comfortable room modern Breakfast quality and staff both amazing
