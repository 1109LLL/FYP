118928,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Breakfast expensive but did not try , Room Upgrade on Arrival which was very spacious and a very high standard room Nice quiet road with parking at Bloomsbury Square very reasonable if booked in advance and less than 5 mins away Excellent location for sight seeing theatre shopping All within 10 minutes by foot 
118929,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The hotel lacks the charm I thought it might have based on its location We were in a basement room with very odd miss matched furniture Perhaps the rooms upstairs are nicer If we stayed here again I would request an upper level room , The hotel is located very close to the British Museum and within easy walking distance to two Tube stops making it a great base for exploring London There are also some good restaurants nearby Our room was very clean and had good air conditioning which was a bonus as we were in London during a heat wave 
118930,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Nothing really , The location was excellent convenient for restaurants bars and shopping We were going to Covent Garden so the location was perfect an easy stroll 
118931,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Definitely not a four star standard There was no fridge in the room we needed to leave our baby food with the staff and then collect it when we needed it Bathroom was ridiculously small there was no space to place items near the sink We were asked to pay for the room at our arrival before even seeing it , Bed was comfortable 
118932,Grange Beauchamp Hotel,No Negative, I received a free upgrade to a superior room albeit in the basement which was much appreciated Friendly welcoming staff and a reasonably central location make this a good choice for London travel 
118933,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, I was disappointed that our room was in the basement beside the rubbish bins I was expecting a beautiful outlook not frosted cracked windows and low ceilings also the wifi was very slow we had to sit in reception to use it , the location was great the staff helpful and the beds comfy
118934,Grange Beauchamp Hotel,No Negative, Staff were extremely polite and helpful room was lovely bed extremely comfy Great location minutes away from a beautiful park and subway Very quiet 
118935,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, No Hot water to the shower and valve would not put water in the tub , The room was very good Spacious clean well appointed and a nice view of the garden 
118936,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, simple amenities like a dental kit was provided only after asking the number of nights I was staying and was told if I need for another day i will have to buy it from outside Not expected at all , The room and the hotel was very nice 
118937,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, There s obviously an expectation for people to shower rather than use a bath as running a bath was a slow process due to the slow rate of water flow If you like a shower fine if you want a bath start running the water early , Only used the hotel as a base so not able to comment on the overall facilities The room was clean and the bed was comfy It was described as a superior double deluxe It wasn t a particularly large room but perhaps that s what you get for a good location in London The staff we met were all pleasant and helpful Plenty of places to eat nearby so once again didn t use the hotel services Near the British Museum which is a fantastic place to visit 
118938,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, We thought that the bed was not too comfortable The room was quite small but we only needed a base and it was adequate , Location of hotel was fairly central and convenient for our needs 
118939,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The controls for the water in the shower bath did function properly In the morning you could not get any hot water in the shower After running it for ten minutes the water was lukewarm at best You could get no water in the tub period This was in room 201 Our friend in the bottom floor had no such problems , The room was spacious clean well appointed The staff was friendly and helpful The thermostat was confusing but since we were there on record hot days it may have been understably slow to reduce the temperature 
118940,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Tub not the cleanest , Linens were crisp Shower nice hot Room on underground floor was deliciously cool London was in a heat wave Server in bar was a darling Andrea went out for ice when ice machine in hotel was empty 
118941,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, We stayed at the Beauchamp for two nights The break was to celebrate my husbands 50th The hotel is lovely and very clean They put us in a family room in the basement The room was dark and depressing We won t return ,No Positive
118942,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Aspects of the bathroom were a little shabby Could provide more channels on the TV which was old tedious to use Nearly scalded myself with the leaky kettle , Comfortable bed Clean well equipped room Very friendly helpful staff Good location quiet street 
118943,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The hotel is quite tired and dated looking throughout no real atmosphere around the place, Great location in a lovely area very close to Oxford Street less than 10 mins walk Leicester Square 15 mins walk 
118944,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, price of breakfast a little steep 17 50 for continental we went out instead, good quiet location really large twin room very helpful and friendly reception staff
118945,Grange Beauchamp Hotel,No Negative, A very nice hotel just a 2 minute walk away from the British Museum Covent Garden Soho and the Theater Area Trafalgar Square are easily accessible on foot from the hotel The room was large and very clean the bed was really confortable The price with Booking was very good Excellent value for money Very kind staff 
118946,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, There was nothing at all , The staff were very helpful friendly and professional The hotel was very clean and modern with a comfortable homely feel The hotel was exactly where we needed to be a really good central location 
118947,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, What s not to like, Room very large able to adjust heat bathroom good beautiful huge window with view of garden Very quiet staff very helpful Walking distance of tube restaurants and bars but far enough away for no night time noise 
118948,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, See above comments , Not a lot room much smaller than photos Temp in room far to hot No water bottles in room for drink making Double room only one set of towels although did supply more when asked 
118949,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Real issue with hot water lack of and although advertised to have a bar area this consisted of a small bar counter and chairs in the reception area which was not conjusive to a relaxing environment , Convenient location friendly staff and clean good sized room 
118950,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Size of room tea coffee making facilities in an awkward location up on a shelf , Can not fault the hotel or location we didn t spend that much time at the hotel only to sleep really but we were a little disappointed with the size of the room especially with the price we paid for 2 nights but I guess that s London prices excellent location 
118951,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Unable to detach shower hook Kettle in the cupboard where clothes were had to boil it in there as is doesn t detach , The bed was very comfatable and the staff were friendly Breakfast was not included in the price if the booking which was suprising given the price paid Good location and close to tubes 
118952,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, My daughter and I were separated while touring London on our own I came back to the hotel and was informed by a female staff that my daughter called to check whether I was back I thanked her and let her know that I would be in my room However the next time when my daughter called again she was told that I wasn t back It would have saved us a lot of trouble if the staff who picked up my daughter s call had duly checked by calling my room or with his or her colleagues Other than this hiccup I am quite pleased with the staff s services , The staff were polite and helpful The bed is comfy and I liked the fact that they provide evening service and placed chocolates on the bed 
118953,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Perhaps the shower facilities could have been better but this could have been me not working it properly , Overwhelmingly happy with our recent stay at The Grange Beauchamp Hotel I brought my Mum to London as a gift for her 50th Birthday on arrival we received a very warm welcome and were happy to find our room was ready much earlier than we anticipated it to be also they were kind enough to upgrade us a larger suite which was a lovely surprise The location was ideal and perfect for a theatre stay with it being walking distance to Covent Garden After an evening out we returned to the hotel to find a fully staffed bar and we enjoyed drinks on our return The room was spotless and well facilitated Could not fault this hotel and would definitely love to return 
118954,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Coffee cups in room were stained and had lipstick on one of them Breakfast is overpriced 17 50 for continental , Staff very pleasant and offered room upgrade on arrival Room spacious and comfortable Ate evening meal in the restaurant where the meal was good value and tasty 
118955,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, For a hotel advertising itself as four star there should be complimentary bottled water as a minimum The single cabin style room is just that a very small and strange shaped space but nicely appointed , I liked the fact that Earl Grey tea is provided in rooms 
118956,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Air conditioning was stuck on cold and would not switch off Room incredibly small for a double Lots of empty bottles and food trays in hallways not removed for several hours Lift very slow , Staff are very welcoming and friendly Room was comfortable albeit very small 
118957,Grange Beauchamp Hotel,No Negative, The staff were so welcoming the hotel so clean the location excellent 15 mins stroll to Covent Garden yet very tranquil as situated on virtually unused road The room was fabulous huge and a very comfortable bed There was a nice small garden patio area outside the rear of the hotel I wouldn t hesitate to recommend this hotel and to return on my next visit to a London Theatre 
118958,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, No hair dryer in the room which otherwise had anything else you could possibly need Green streaky stains on the carpet outside bathroom entrance All the pros definitely outweigh the cons though , The bed was incredibly comfy and the view from the 8th floor room impressive Great location and the decor of the hotel carried through in an Art Deco style throughout Good breakfast choices 
118959,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Not much to dislike once I got out from the lower level The breakfast seemed way too expensive but I didn t partake so hard for me to judge Otherwise a nice place to stay , Very centrally located on a quiet street so even a room in the front is not a problem with noise I was at first given a room in the basement level which was slightly depressing and reeked of lemon disinfectant but was moved for my second night upstairs to the third floor without any problem Once there I got a chance to fully enjoy my stay Great towels Ample supply of pillows 
118960,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The thermostat does not allow you to adjust the temperature over a certain level The first night was very cold and uncomfortable I did contact reception and they were unhelpful The next day spoke to the duty manager and was told that I should have been offered a heater by reception I was just offered a heater for the following night and it was left at that I felt they could have been more sympathetic when I told them we were unable to sleep through the night and ruined our plans for the next morning I felt it was just ignored , The location was good and close to the tube 
118961,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Leaking iron rusty water on shirt and no hot water to wash with shower and basin Kettle in cupboard high up and awkward to get to with out getting burnt , Bed was comfortable staff we smiling and happy to help 
118962,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, They need to update the bathrooms to be in keeping with the room standard , The room was beautiful lovely big windows they kept our luggage for us after we checked out and it is in an excellent location 
118963,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, We had a basement room and some of the carpet smelled a bit like mildew The staff seemed to be tending to a leak in the hall so it may have been an isolated incident Some of the furnishings seemed a bit dated but they were clean and in good condition , Excellent location near the British museum and relatively close to the theater district Tube stations and bus stops close by Nice big room that worked well for our family Great selection of magazines in the room for leisure reading The staff was friendly and accommodating Everything was clean and tidy 
118964,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The wi fi speed wasn t great but this didn t bother us much as we literally used the hotel to get ready in and sleep in Also we did have to ring reception to help us operate the shower the shower dials controls were really stiff to turn my boyfriend had to do this for me so we thought we were doing something wrong This is just me being really picky those 2 things were the only slight downfalls but it didn t ruin our stay I would definitely recommend this hotel without a doubt , The staff were lovely although we didn t spend a great time in the hotel itself as we were busy out in London the time we did was really enjoyable After a long train journey to London and a hectic first experience on the tube I really wanted half an hour to freshen up and chill out before exploring London The hotel managed to give us our room 2 hours earlier than 3 00 check in which was a god send Also after leaving the hotel at 8 30am one day and not returing till 11 30pm Harry Potter and the Cursed Child parts 1 and 2 in the same day the turn down service from the hotel was lovely and the little touches made it 
118965,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Small room for the cost No wardrobe or storage space Glad I wasn t thee for a few days or I would have had trouble with organising my stuff No bath just shower , Good location for meeting I was attending 
118966,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, nothing, we got moved to another Grange when we arrived but we couldn t have been more happier It was only on the next road I always tend to stay in Grange Hotels when staying in London and have been using them for years
118967,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, My room wasn t available so I was upgraded with free breakfast only when I asked the staff in the morning I was told breakfast wasn t included Pretty strange , Nice spacious room clean Friendly staff Free room upgrade
118968,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Superior double room was small unremarkable and worst of all was on a significant slant not flat so you felt sea sick and disorientated First night slept poorly due to a constant bright red light and loud humming noise over bed Staff turned it off for the second night which was great but then we recieved a 6 o clock wake up call This was a mistake and was absolutely not requested Above irritating me it was completely unprofessional So therefore I experienced poor sleep on both nights Very very expensive even for central London and nothing to justify it Breakfast extortionate but thankfully endless places to eat within walking distance Staff were pleasant but will never book here again , Staff let us keep our luggage at the hotel post check out Staff were pleasant Location good 
118969,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The only down side was the coffee at dinner which was very weak Probably should have mentioned it but we were rather short of time as we were going to the theatre , Friendly helpful staff spacious superior room clean comfortable bed and great location for the Theatre Overall a fab stay 
118970,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Room 308 Noise of air conditioning with small glowing red light immediately above the bed The air conditioning was on all night and seriously affected our sleep The following night we arranged to have the air conditioning switched off Unfortunately this also switched off the only ventilation in the bathroom , Cleanliness of room and friendly staff 
118971,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The lack of wifi in our room also please be aware your bathroom floors are very slippery with socks on , Everything very comfortable warm and extremely quiet for London amazing I couldn t get any wifi though which was a bit unfortunate 
118972,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Tiny crammed seating area in lobby uncomfortable for waiting or for anything else Wall lamps in room are beaten and need to be changed detracts from room homely welcoming feeling , Great location Comfortable bed Elegant modern room decoration yet very cosy You have to ring a bell to be buzzed into the hotel takes seconds but gives feeling of safety Staff have professional demeanour not necessarily the friendliest 
118973,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Beds could have been comfier , Excellent location for getting about Staff very pleasant Check in efficient and luggage store available to hold cases when we arrived early 
118974,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Didn t have water in the room Shower pressure poor , More spacious bedroom that I was expecting Comfy bed nice TV Nice decor Amazing location and quiet street 
118975,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Nothing to report, Hotel is welcoming excellent service luxurious rooms and elegance to die for Breakfast is wonderful Even heart shaped marmite Will return to such a lovely place Staff are available and we were treated extremely well Thank you for a wonderful stay Oh and the super comfy beds with huge cushions and afternoon chocolates Perfect 
118976,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The shower was poor The water low was a trickle and not particularly warm The bathroom had seen better days although it was clean, The room was clean and comfortable The bed was extremely comfortable and the size of the room was large and airy 
118977,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Room 13 was close to the main elevator and seemed to be under a very busy area of the hotel There was a lot of noise that kept us awake at times and affected the quality of the stay The location of this particular room felt like it shouldn t be used for guests , Room was a good size Staff were friendly 
118978,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Would be nice if there was breakfast included or not so expensive , Location is short walk to sightseeing shopping tube Room was good size for London 
118979,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, My cabine room was not according to the standards of a 4 stars hotel only 2 miserable coat hangers no wardrobe dirty curtains miserable lighting The staff is not very professional all young people with good will but little experience , The breakfast buffet was just correct
118980,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Bed was a bit firm for me But that s personal preference Price was quite high for time of year but it s central London so to be expected, As we arrived my daughter was dressed up and announced it was her birthday A few minutes of being in our room there was a knock on the door and we received 3 slices of chocolate cake and drinks A very lovely touch
118981,Grange Beauchamp Hotel,No Negative, The staff were extremely friendly and helpful We stayed at the hotel in a group of 11 for my dads 60th birthday celebrations and were each given a room upgrade free of charge
118982,Grange Beauchamp Hotel,No Negative, On booking I mention to the hotel that we were there to celebrate my daughters birthday and if there was anything they could do to make our stay any more special I d be delighted Not really sure if the message was received and or read I was pleasantly surprised when a lady knocked on our door and brought a piece of chocolate birthday cake with a happy Birthday It was so lovely and special I will recommend the hotel on 
118983,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, There needs to be a sign that the water of the sink is not drinkable We had to ask the bar staff to be sure if we can drink it or not and only then they said they did not suggest it ,No Positive
118984,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Couldn t get the shower hot just warm and the mattress was a bit too hard , Location was amazing yet very peaceful with a room overlooking a lovely private garden 
118985,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, N a, Staff were super efficient and helpful Booking and email communication was great I was lucky enough to be upgraded to a premium double suite and it was lovely Shower pressure was excellent The room and bathroom were immaculately clean 
118986,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Breakfast more expensive than a starter and main meal Therefore we did not have a breakfast Knock on the door at 9 10am to clean the windows Sorry mate to a women , Location Free room upgrade All in all great value for your money and would stay again 
118987,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Hair dryer was fastened in desk drawer No ironing board in room pants press was not practical Dining staff were stoic and white wine was not served in a bucket and was placed on the table unopened and not poured into glass, Room was spacious and bathroom was clean Desk and seating area in room were perfect 
118988,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The bath wasn t brilliant we had to use the shower head to fill the bath as there were no taps and the bath switch simply cut the water flow off from the shower head The water also wasn t as hot as we would have preferred , The bed was really comfy the room was cosy and the decor was lovely They also brought up complimentary treats because it was my birthday which was a lovely touch 
118989,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, No complaints , Walking into the bathroom I was so happy to see a full shower door I don t know why European hotels only have half doors on their showers but we Americans are not used to that The staff was very attentive and friendly Great location for attending our son s LSE graduation 
118990,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The bathroom facilities were not as mornern as I would expect for a 4 hotel specifically the old shower head that didn t really give any water pressure Also the windows should have been double glazzed both for a winter stay and to stop us from hearing the cleaners and other staff walking past the outside of our room We could have also done with more towels and toiletries for 4 guests in 1 room , The staff were perfectly polite and the room was clean The room was also very spacious and even had an extra bed in which was a nice supprise
118991,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The room was very hot on arrival 26degrees and the management unable to fix the AC therefore we had to have the window open which was into the area at the front of the hotel and consequently woken at 6am as the recycling of bottles was collected , Good location 
118992,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Staff very noisy making up rooms in the morning even though the check out is 11am we were woken up pretty early because of that , Very contemporary room comfortable bed 
118993,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, I had a problem with a hairdryer not working and the tv suddenly went silent On both occasions the staff responded quickly and found a replacement hairdryer and rebooted the tv but it would have been nice not to have to call for help , The Cabin rooms are very small but have everything you need for one person and a one night stay and the three layers of blinds and curtains do an amazingly good job of keeping out the traffic noise The rooms are very clean and modern 
118994,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Not good value for money if that was a superior room I would hate to have seen the size of a standard double room For the price we paid breakfast should have been included Have stayed in much better hotels than this paid alot less Really wish that we hadn t bothered with the weekend break not memorable at all , It was clean staff were very pleasant
118995,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Nothing, Although room was on lower ground floor it was very spacious well presented I really liked the range of toiletries magazines and tea and coffee services
118996,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Room too cold the window was not double glass bed too short for an average size person Check out at 11am without the possibility to delay a bit , Clean and well maintained Great location Very friendly staff
118997,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Shower could of been more powerful Longer bed Room a little tired in a place or two but overall nice, Friendly staff and lovely room great location Turn down service nice touch Cake for our anniversary from the hotel was a lovely gesture
118998,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, One part of the bedroom was much colder than the rest teenager didnt mind I would , one night stay with 2 boys 15 11 Spacious clean room which even had an extra bed so boys didnt have to share Staff werent english but were polite and researched any answer to questions when they didnt know
118999,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, I know London hotels are expensive but I can t come to terms with 200 pounds per night and no breakfast for a fairly ordinary hotel Ridiculous , Inside the large comfortable room Outside a very attractive quiet street Perfect for the British museum 
119000,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The room was in need of a proper clean lots of dust on top of the television and spiderwebs in one of the wall lamps The shower was almost unusable as the water pressure was very low and the shower head was clogged with limescale , The staff were friendly and welcoming 
119001,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Although we were given a complementary upgrade when checking in 11pm nice gesture the room wasn t particularly special or beneficial extra bed Bigger space The problem with the room is that it seemed to be under or next to a noisy generator or kitchen ventilation This was constantly running all night so kept waking up and found it hard to get back to sleep footfall from above was also noisy first thing in the morning Cost was also a bit expensive expect it with location but have stayed in better hotels for less , Easy to travel to West End around the corner from tube station Staff polite 
119002,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Breakfast was ridiculous expensive and choice only fair, We had a basement room which at first we did not like but it did NOT have the typical basement issues like bad air quality The room was really quiet as well and was very spacious 
119003,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, We were in a room in the basement so it was a little dark but the room was large 2 double beds which was perfect for the three of us 2 adults and a child We couldn t stop the noise of the fan in the bathroom that seemed to run constantly so it was a bit disruptive throughout the night , The 2 double beds were very comfortable and for us the location was good We chose not to pay the extortionate rate for breakfast and instead walked the 10 mins or so to Covent Garden and had a delicious breakfast in Carluccio s for a third of the price 
119004,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, no minibar in the room , My stay here was great the room was really really nice the staff was really nice and they upgraded me to a better room for free 
119005,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, There were 2 Beds in the room however we got the distinct feeling we weren t meant to use both Just a minor point and didn t impact on the stay which was superb , Big room big beds very clean staff lovely Close to tube station restaurants and West End Wonderful 
119006,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, No bottled water provided in the room The shower was great but the bath taps in our room didn t work room 106 , Extremely friendly polite and helpful service clean comfortable rooms tasteful decor quiet road yet central location 
119007,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The flow tap for the shower bath meant a simple process of taking a bath v complicated as no water came out when tried to run bath but shower worked ok so filled bath using the shower , Fab location friendly courteous staff comfortable room
119008,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The room tilted concave in the centre of the room which meant the bed tilted towards the door If we laid from the side of the bed our heads would be higher than our feet Bedroom was okay old world charm In the room we were provided tea coffee but no bottle waters free or to purchase Bathroom was okay shower was tub shower it was difficult getting in and out because the height of the tub Basic bedside tables and a desk but limited room Hotel had stacked the desk with a load of magazines and a pamphlet to donate to children in Africa The front desk staff were cold and unwelcoming however the room staff was very kind , Attractive area it had a comfortable neighborhood feel Surrounding buildings are other hotels Across the street from a park and just beyond that was a stop for the underground 
119009,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Everything is way too small but acceptable The main thing is that it was way to noisy I couldn t sleep for the entire night The noise was not from the outside but from upstairs i felt like somebody upstairs kept on running walking running walking and running making it impossible to sleep , Nice location and reasonable price since we decided to stay in town all of a sudden Everything you want from a hotel are provided in good quality 
119010,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, N a, Great customer service the ladies at the front of house were lovely perfect location and amazing hotel room We had a triple room for my grandma mum and myself and we were all over the moon with the space and comfy beds 
119011,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, our room was on the ground floor facing the road we had to keep the curtains closed at all times , Price and location were very good very comfy place 
119012,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Initially booked to stay at Grange Beauchamp hotel however upon arrival we were told they were doing some sort of work on a few of the rooms and we have been transferred to a sister hotel We wouldn t have minded but wish they had told us beforehand Shower in the room was broken and the sliding doors were all broken so had to be careful Floors very creaky so could hear people walking around all day and night The bed was the most uncomfortable thing about the whole stay really rock hard and there was very little chance of getting a good nights sleep the pillows equally as awful didn t help would have expected much better considering the price , Hotel room was lovely and big lots of space and light with huge windows It was a very warm weekend when we stayed so the fan they provided was a life saver Breakfast included as we were upgraded really nice selection and the staff were lovely Really close to Russell Square tube station and surrounding areas
119013,Grange Beauchamp Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location Nicely furnished rooms Very friendly helpful staff I asked the chamber maid when she arrived with our towels if she knew the hotel wi fi pass word she didn t but was happy to go down to reception to check on our behalf Also a very comprehensive collection of mags on our bedroom coffee table everything from art periodicals to fashion magazines Nice extra touch 
119014,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Would have been nice to have a kettle in the room and the bath shower was small and a bit slippery, Nice sized rooms and fold down service Convenient location to the Russell Square tube station 
119015,Grange Beauchamp Hotel,No Negative, Two large double beds are provided in a twin room so groups traveling in odd numbers all have a bed rather than a sofa bed or having to find a single room Rooms are large and very comfortable The hotel is in an excellent location too 
119016,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Room was excellent and very clean I only felt that the hallway areas leading to our room could do with freshening up a bit it seemed a bit dark and gloomy , All the staff were extra friendly and took the time to wish you a good day evening as you walked past 
119017,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The difference in price between the continental and cooked breakfast 17 50 vs 23 was a bit surprising as nice as it was the continental should have been considerably lower priced in my opinion , We had a lovely room The location is perfect for the West End and the staff very attentive and friendly Highly recommended 
119018,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The carpets should be replaced The carpets in the corridors are dirty and dusty The rooms were clean but I didnt want to walk barefooted in the room because of the carpets It is an old building so there is hardly no isolation We heard every step and move the people upstairs made , The personnel were really nice and helpful
119019,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, As we arrive from a warm country we are used to be able to open the windows for air but the room had no such option so we had to use the A C on and off Ceiling was creaking every time someone moved above like in proper old houses, Did not have breakfast at the hotel because the vicinity has lots of other nice options walking distance from many popular sites Hotel very clean and well kept 
119020,Grange Beauchamp Hotel,No Negative, Location was fabulous and really peaceful We stayed in a triple room which had 2 huge beds plenty of space for 3 of us and it was beautiful room Overall had a great stay and the staff were very helpful and friendly I would definitely stay here again 
119021,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Unfortunately we only had one night so not enough time to take advantage of other amenities , Location was great and easy walking distance to train Rooms and Bathrooms were spacious clean comfortable Staff very friendly and helpful 
119022,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Shower over bath is outdated and dangerous needs handles or better still completed re modelling This is an old place and its time to renovate, Location is good close to Br Museum and Ttm ct Road Bed was comfortable and staff were pleasant Food was good 
119023,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, They took money off my card before I arrived which I wasn t told about I didn t want any money taken from that card as this was needed in my bank They did release it straight away but it didn t go back on for 4 days, Great hotel Great service Great location
119024,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Comparing to waldrof hotel in covent garden The price is not much different I myself will choose that hotel next time Based on the location price and the building and design too , The service like how they gave chocolate on to bed is just like 5star hotel The staff was really helpful with the direction
119025,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, We did not have a breakfast there as we thought at 23 it was way over priced This is our one and only gripe , Thoroughly enjoyed our stay The staff were very attentive We were there for our 35th wedding anniversary and we were made to feel special 
119026,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, We had settled the bill and as we were leaving they said they made a mistake and could we give them 3 cents I thought they should right it off rather then embarrassing themselves for 3 cents, Location is fantastic Close to everything Room was great Spacious for London 
119027,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The only problem I could think of is that there was no fridge in the room , We paid for a regular room but were given the executive suite which was a nice suprise The room was lovely clean and beds were comfortable The staff were very helpful and helped us find our way about town We didn t get a chance to use the spa and restaurant facilities but I m sure they would have been nice too 
119028,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, the room while fine and clean was a bit on the small side so would have expected a bit lower rate, bathroom new and very clean fully equipped location superb staff service impeccable
119029,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The food oh dear evening meal was over cooked and over garnished Breakfast buffet looked tired Danish pastry was not properly made all dough and all together too much low fat everything and foul undrinkable coffee , Room was very comfortable but facilities eg robes should have been provided for two people not just one Staff were exceptionally kind and helpful 
119030,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Couldn t fault anything, Very comfortable and the staff made us very welcome including delivering a surprise tray of drinks and birthday cake when they found out why we were staying 
119031,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, I had to extend the bed in order to sleep comfortably even though I had asked for a long bed on my initial booking Although it was a double room only one dressing gown was provided No large dressing gown was available , The staff were very friendly and professional A very comfortable room in a good location with easy access to West End shopping and theatres An excellent evening meal very well served 
119032,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Barring a slightly dusty sink nothing we didn t like and hubby travels a lot , Excellent location in beautiful Bloomsbury minutes from British Museum Soho West End and tube Room was gorgeous with extremely comfy bed and accommodating room service Staff v helpful and pleasant We got a good deal from booking com and a surprise unexpected upgrade as we were there for special occasion Would love to stay again 
119033,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Could of done with a curtain over the rear window and door my wife got a fright when the kitchen staff passed early morning, Bed was very comfy room was huge shower was excellent staff were very happy and pleasant Location for city centre and theatre land was perfect
119034,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Basin behind bathroom door was poor planning filling up the bath tub took some working out due to a trickle from the tap in the end we filled the bath using the shower head , The bed was lovely comfortable and huge Turn down service was thoughtful with a chocolate each o Soft white towels in bathroom and a dressing gown in the wardrobe were nice touches Free upgrade to Junior Suite was a big plus on checking in thank you Excellent English breakfast to choose from and hot food served by waiter to table much preferred to hot buffet serve yourself 
119035,Grange Beauchamp Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is in a great location for getting around central London We were lucky to be upgraded to a junior suite and the room was fantastic as we re all the staff I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others 
119036,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Double room was fine but single room was very cramped especially the bathroom there was no wardrobe price for room only was too high breakfast price exorbitant,No Positive
119037,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, only one robe water not hot enough bath tap very slow flow, we were upgraded to an executive room 301over loooking the garden from 004 first allocated that was at road level
119038,Grange Beauchamp Hotel,No Negative, Lovely room Very quiet and comfortable Loved the area Not touristy but still centrally located There were many great restaurants just a few minutes away on foot 
119039,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The shower we had lacked water pressure but it still worked ok , The bed was very comfy the hotel is modern and the location is outstanding a couple of minutes walk to the tube restaurants bars 
119040,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The chair in the room was a little bit broken The room was small but it was ok for 3 days but not for 1 week , The service was good We arrived earlier then expected so we could just put our bagages in the Hotel The room was clean The location was perfect near everything in London 
119041,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Staff to quietly spoken making them hard to hear and understand Room little small for size of bed plus different sized pillows not good Very expensive for breakfast so had to go out to eat , Staff very friendly and helpful Hotel clean and well presented 
119042,Grange Beauchamp Hotel,No Negative, The Hotel was very nice we got upgraded for the second night since we complained about the first room number 13 because of the noise But the staff was very very helpful and accommodating The hotel is very comfortable very clean and situated right behind the British museum 
119043,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, When I had been in the room for a little time I realised that there was a fan blowing cold air through perforated panels in the ceiling It was very cold and noisy and I would not have been able to sleep in those conditions The staff on duty tried unsuccessfully at first to switch it off Eventually they managed to switch the fan off from elsewhere in the building but the hour or so that this took was not at all relaxing I was staying for one night only and this problem spoilt what should have been a relaxing evening in this otherwise lovely hotel It was good that the duty manager offered me a small compensation of a free breakfast which I was not able to take up but this problem needs to be sorted out before I would want to stay there again A pity as in every other respect the hotel is perfect for my needs , I liked the quietness of the room free from traffic noise at the back of the hotel overlooking the garden I also enjoyed a delicious dinner in the hotel restaurant The hotel was nicely furnished and decorated and had a pleasant atmosphere The staff were friendly and helpful 
119044,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, We booked room only as breakfast was quiet expensive at around 24 each although there are plenty of places to eat near by , stayed here for three nights location is perfect seven minute walk to Oxford Street and everywhere is within walking distance booked an executive room which was nice and spacious by London standards hotel is close to both hoburn tube station and Russell Square station a two to three minute walk 
119045,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Size of room not much wider than the length of a single bed The price of breakfast was also a little off putting so I had breakfast elsewhere The bathroom was very small not recommended for the person of a larger frame I managed but just , The location was excellent proximity to the West End of London as well as public transport links I was pleased to find a nice clean and comfortable room in Central London at relatively short notice for less than 100 per night The staff were super friendly and happy to help 
119046,Grange Beauchamp Hotel,No Negative, The room was clean cozy and very comfortable and the staff friendly And the price reasonable The location in central London is excellent walking distance from Soho Piccadilly Circus and Oxford Street but removed enough to be in a quiet location 
119047,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, The duvet was as thin as paper and they had pillows the width of cushions so I hardly slept all night , The location and the room was very clean and quiet
119048,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Decoration a bit outdated We did not try breakfast based on other reviews and found many cheaper alternatives nearby , Large comfortable suite and bathroom
119049,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Room is very small I know London accommodation is always on the small side but it was pretty crammed I would have thought a bar fridge would have been nice but as I looked around I really could not see where they could have fitted one However bathroom was a good size unlike other places where you almost have no room to dress within the bathroom Mattress sagged transversely across the mid segment of the bed because the base of the bed was two segments brought together I don t mean two single beds brought together which would have been ok but 2 bases brought together one from the head and one from the foot to meet in the middle It was very odd and I think someone with a bad back would have been in trouble because of the sag in the mattress where the two segments met , Location Impossible to beat 5 minutes walk from Russell Square Station and 7 minutes from Holborn Station 10 minute brisk walk to Oxford St 15 min to Leicester Square if you like walking which we do literally right next to the wonderful British Museum 2 Sainsburys within 7 min walk for items you need Good reasonably priced meals on Southhampton Row 1 street down and adjacent streets Very clean I m very fussy about this and they passed with flying colours Attentive to requests Nice warm room no stinting on heating and when it got too warm you could switch off central heating which would bring the room down to an ambient temperature of about 21degrees C Also a pet peeve of mine inadequate wall sockets which they passed with flying colours ample wall sockets at desk and below both bedside tables for charging all of your mobile devices and laptop
119050,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, We were upgraded to a room on the lower ground floor and from 5am all we could hear above us was the continual stomping of people moving around the restaurant and reception area, Clean and tastefully decorated
119051,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Poor soundproofing in the bedroom Our room was under the dinning room and staff seemed to be stomping around above our heads from about 6am , Great location nice and helpful staff well appointed 
119052,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, 1 Windows in bedroom bathroom are single glazed the old fashioned types and the window in the bedroom wouldn t close at the top so there was quite a draft coming into the room 2 There aren t any drawers in the bedroom for storing clothes so all our clothes had to be bundled on to 2 small shelves in the wardrobe or draped over the chairs etc There was of course a wardrobe for hanging clothes The room is quite spacious enough for there to be a chest of drawers for keeping ones clothes , Staff very pleasant Bedroom and bathroom nice and spacious and very light and airy Very hot water at all times Having a safe in the room for valuables The room we had no 304 looked out onto the lawns at the back of the hotel which was very pleasant 
119053,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, On arrival reception smelt odd like old frying fat Arrived at 2 30 to check in and our room was not ready told it would be five minutes it took an additional half an hour Room was large bathroom floor was incredibly slippy and the bathroom was cold Odd shaped hole in the ceiling with fragile looking panels was a little off, Lovely old building close to the tube
119054,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Fair to say that breakfast is expensive but thats expected London prices etc , Have stayed before a year or two ago This time got a free comp upgrade to a junior suite Cant complain on the facilities and a good location ideal for museum 
119055,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, I booked a suite and we received an ordinary double room staff unhelpful we arrived late and they insisted my partner sign in as well as myself this has never happened before room dreadfully cold and a c heating unit very noisy a double whammy of discomfort I won t be staying here again , Location

119058,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Thought the breakfast was a little pricey compared to cost of other meals, Location and Willingness if staff We were offered an upgrade on arrival The room was lovely comfortable spotlessly clean and tastefully decorated
119059,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, Not cheap but that is to be expected of a London hotel and we had breakfast elsewhere as over 20pp for breakfast when you have already spent a lot of money on a room for the evening wasn t justifiable for me personally The room was just a tad cold for me but just a small gripe for generally a very pleasant stay , Lovely room fairly spacious when we arrived we had been upgraded to a room with a king sized bed which was a nice suprise Pretty good location just a 10minute walk to Tottenham Court Road and right by British museum Helpful staff when we asked for the use of an iron it was delivered to our room immediately 
119060,Grange Beauchamp Hotel, WIFI was terrible There s free WIFI and you could also pay 10 pounds per day for premium WIFI The free version requires registration and is automatically disconnected every hour or so This is really annoying Also there was no socket near the bed so it was impossible to use my phone charge it lay down at the same time While my room was only a short walk from the elevator I had to go through 3 different doors Not easy when carrying luggage The location for the luggage was at the narrowest part of the room when you open your suitcase you can t walk from one side to the other unless you go over the bed I thought there were much better spots for locating luggage , Great location near Russell Square The British museum and tube stations The room and bathroom were both spacious Nice selection of coffee tea in the room Nice to have things like a selection of magazines a daily paper left outside the door chocolate on the bed padded hangers for delicate clothes 
119061,Grange Beauchamp Hotel,No Negative, The location of the hotel was great just a 5 min walk to Holborn underground which took us to everywhere we wanted to go The staff were very helpful and welcoming and the room was spacious and very clean
