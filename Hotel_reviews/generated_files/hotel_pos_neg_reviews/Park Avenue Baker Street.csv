72258,Park Avenue Baker Street, Some of the ceiling lights in the bathroom didn t work Other than that we were happy and I thought it was good value , The hotel was in an almost ideal location for our purposes We arrived by train to Marylebone and this hotel is within easy walking distance from there The Nearest tube station and Regent s Park again are very close by and it is quick and easy to get anywhere in central London from there The room was in good condition and clean the bed was comfortable and staff were very friendly and helpful

72263,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room was extremely small Our travel bags took basically all floor space and the closet was not big enough to unpack everything Also there was a green and bright light above the door indicating the exit which was hard to ignore since the room was so small Although the clean and nice interior the bed the staff and the location outweighed these facts , Clean room and bathroom modern interior nice bed Great location near Baker Street and the City Centre no need to go by subway in order to get to tourist attractions 
72264,Park Avenue Baker Street, Housekeeping left clean bath mat in bottom of the shower each day which meant it was always wet before being used , Lovely and clean microwave and fridge in room as well as the usual tea and coffee making facilities Just a few minutes walk from Baker Street tube station Plenty of cafes etc within walking distance

72269,Park Avenue Baker Street, Teensy tiny single room with single bed which wasn t comfy at all which lead me to investigate the mattress which didn t even have a mattress protector only the sheet over it Mentioned to pleasant young man who was going to Google mattress protectors to see what they are Mattress problem rectified for second night but still without protector , Shower room was lovely bright with clean shiny fittings Staff very pleasant 
72270,Park Avenue Baker Street, No lift meant 6 flights of narrow stairs at least twice a day Breakfast very poor selection Bacon almost raw Milk ran out towards end of service Apparently there was none left in the hotel , Convenient location for a nearby evening function

72272,Park Avenue Baker Street, Crossing a busy main road from reception and to breakfast room and breakfast was poor cold and not kept topped up, Room was small but tastefully decorated and clean Tea coffee and water in room
72273,Park Avenue Baker Street, probably the bathroom was intended for disabled guests since the washbasin was uncomfortably low while the toilet was unusually high , Loved the position at 5mins walk from Baker Street Station and well served by the 139 line bus Friendly staff and modern rooms 
72274,Park Avenue Baker Street, Appalling hotel They may have low rates but it is for a reason I had to leave and find another hotel after my first night The club room one of their best rooms was tiny The location is not great with the noise of a VERY busy road all night The staff were nonsensical and failed to mention that there had been a power cut and that I would have no hot water It wasn t until I called down having stepped into a freezing cold shower that they said yes we are aware there is no hot water What sort of service is that I tried to get my money back with no luck as it was a non refundable booking through booking com Very frustrated with the whole experience I have learned never to be fooled by the photos and read reviews before you book ,No Positive
72275,Park Avenue Baker Street, Dirty socks left in wardrobe 2 bulbs out Double Quilt Cover Folded in half and put in a Single Quilt Cover wrong on every level Wardrobe door loose , Location and very clean

72277,Park Avenue Baker Street, Walk across Rd to breakfast was inconvenient luckily the weather was kind othe wise would have been a problem Also breakfast wasn t great disappointed and Low level room very dark No way a 4 star , Comfortable bed
72278,Park Avenue Baker Street, It was a little tight in there for two but we didn t stay in the room much , Nice room very compact but normal for London and the high ceilings made it feel larger Nice bathroom and bedding Staff helpful 
72279,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room was situated over the road from the reception and the room was rather small and crammed , The hotel is ideally located a 10 minute walk from the nearest tube station and a short walk to Baker Street and Oxford Street is not too far 
72280,Park Avenue Baker Street, I couldn t get the safe to lock so ended up taking my iPad out with me in the evening I m sure it would have been fine but didn t want to risk it and didn t have time to request someone to look at it as I was running late , I had a lovely space with a big bathroom quality furnishings and fittings Also was impressed that bottled water was provided along with hot drinks it s often missed 
72281,Park Avenue Baker Street, Room was very small asked staff for some ice and they said they couldn t bring us any , The room was very modern bed very comfortable and friendly staff
72282,Park Avenue Baker Street, It was mentioned during the time of booking that Breakfast is complimentary from Bookings com but I had to pay as the confirmation had mentioned extra , Nothing
72283,Park Avenue Baker Street, Be very careful as they won t let you in without showing the original card you booked with Mine was a business card and I don t carry it with me Never had this problem before I did suggest that if someone subsequently came to claim our pre booked room they could turn us out but no I had to repay and then hopefully get refunded Nightmare ,No Positive
72284,Park Avenue Baker Street, Key cards repeatedly failed and had to be re issued four times Basic simple facilities in the room not restocked properly Quality of bathroom products very poor Advice from reception limited Only provided bottled water once when you arrive not replenished ever Bathroom cleaning average, Location of hotel
72285,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Good location easy to find from Baker St underground station Staff were friendly helpful The room was clean and very comfortable It was a basement room so it was a little bit dark but we were only staying for one night so it wasn t a problem If we had been staying longer I would have preferred to have a room on a higher floor with windows that can open Facilities in the room were great Lovely clean bathroom with a good shower Breakfast was very nice there was a good range of traditional continental options 
72286,Park Avenue Baker Street, Breakfast sausages did not look cooked Also didn t realise I had to walk over the road to my room then back again for breakfast next morning, Lovely room with good facilities
72287,Park Avenue Baker Street, Accommodation was across the road from reception no staff no lift concern as single traveller Better directions re Gloucester street and interruption in sequence of street numbers should be noted , Close to tube station
72288,Park Avenue Baker Street, The cooked breakfast was disappointing Some items were not replenished and the scrambled eggs were dried up and rubbery , A conveniently placed hotel modern and clean Pleasant friendly staff 
72289,Park Avenue Baker Street, No lifts Had to go over road for breakfast waited for an iron for 3 hours then had to ask again Did not feel security was very good anyone could get in and windows were not locked at rear Was not expecting such a small room Deskspace wsmall and chair had no back, Most things supplied in room except an iron and board 
72290,Park Avenue Baker Street, Our room was across the street and then down into the basement Our view from our window was bricks and a big steel vent pipe We could hear the underground trains and the noise from above was ridiculous The room was so dark the lights had to be turned on as soon as we entered The fire exit green light was broken so at night the whole room lite up green The breakfast was cold and the young lady in the restaurant was useless we constantly had to ask for items to be refilled or replenished , It was close to harley street 
72291,Park Avenue Baker Street, Hot drink machine wouldnt produce hot chocolate but lots of other drinks to choose from , Polite staff Clean quiet room with great full english breakfast 10 min walk from Baker Street underground Had microwave fridge which was very useful Great shower room 
72292,Park Avenue Baker Street, After i paid the bill the receptionist told me that the room is in another building across the street in the basement I went there the room smelled humidity i couldent stay there was not enough air to breathe So I went back asked for another room he said there is no other room available II wanted a refund He said you cant get a refund he called the owner she told me to send her an email she will let me know tomorrow morning she must consult with someone about the refund Finally I told them I have a family in London I will call him to come and pick me up and I will call the police because the address of that room is different than the address of the hotel Finally they refund my credit card I am not sure yet that I got my money back ,No Positive
72293,Park Avenue Baker Street, Downstairs room across the road no fresh air but I did choose on price Bathroom design not suitable for older guests all the features but just haven t come together correctly , Perfectly adequate for an overnight visit to town Recently decorated with modern decor and air coned rooms Staff really engaging and helpful 
72294,Park Avenue Baker Street, They should let you know if its a basement room before booking and the rooms are a separate building to the main hotel Not very clean stained carpet wifi does not work very well never again,No Positive
72295,Park Avenue Baker Street, Only negative our room was next to the door and we could hear people going in out It was not a big problem , The staff were all lovely very helpful I rang for an iron and some milk and it was brought to the room within minutes Room was great very clean Microwave fridge and free safe in the room plus tea coffee hairdryer toiletries Great TV good wifi Excellent value for money 
72296,Park Avenue Baker Street, Breakfast dreadful Guests had to keep telling waitress that food had run out Then a wait before more arrived One lady waited 15 mins for scrambled egg when that arrived most other things had run out Very poor organisation , Room small but bed linen really good quality as was towels Clean
72297,Park Avenue Baker Street, The breakfast was appalling not glasses for juice knife to eat bacon sausages or tomatoes we had to ask for everything so our breakfast came out in stages i e I had a rasher of bacon then a sausage and then just gave up on the rest The lady looking after the dining room was to busy trying to tick residents off her list instead of organising our breakfast , The room was as it said in the advert a small double it was perfectly sized and had everything I needed in it
72298,Park Avenue Baker Street, Bed was small No proper ventilation window was opening into a wall of the next building Refrigerator was not in working condition mini bar was not there the room was in different building on the other side of the hotel so you don t have access to the restaurant for breakfast etc The bathroom was very small higher chances that you ll hurt yourself , Courtesy of the staff especially who helped me to move into the room with my luggage 
72299,Park Avenue Baker Street, i stayed in a single room bed was a little too soft for me and i kept rolling off I think i will choose a double room next time but i would definitely go back , Excellent location ideal for RCOG visits Small and compact but contains all you need 
72300,Park Avenue Baker Street, This particular room is next to the generator which keeps you awake all night I am not sure it s possible to sleep in this room I had a similar one here before I asked the receptionist how I could make a complaint about it she said she would raise to manager but I have yet to hear anything back , The rooms are all the same style and nicely done If you get the right room in the hotel it s a great place to stay and good value
72301,Park Avenue Baker Street, I ve stayed there many times so clearly i like the place and its conveniency The staff were helpful but they did put me in the basement the first night as i was staying there for 17 nights i asked them to please move me up to higher floor and a bigger room They did the next day and i was thankful staying in that basement room for 17 nights would ve been so depressing Vacuum cleaning the floors was not that good but hey I can be very clean sometimes They had a complementary bottle of water the first day but the rest of the days they didn t replace the old bottle with a new one , The location is great The large rooms on the second floor are perfect for a single traveler thats there for longer than a week 
72302,Park Avenue Baker Street, Bed was a it too short for me by a few inches as I am 6 1 English breakfast was a not really much of an English breakfast But it was adequate This hotel was more of a business oriented hotel it seemed and less for tourism It is fine if you are a tourist although I was among business people when I was there , Clean room kind service from staff Perfect location between two parks Marylbone station is right around the corner From here I walked all the way to the Thames long walk but fun My hotel room had a USB charging port and it comes with a power plug for all countries built into the wall 
72303,Park Avenue Baker Street, The breakfast wasn t good For the price it wasn t worth it I asked for two fried eggs and asked that they be runny and two hard eggs came out I didn t have time to ask for them again , The location was great My room was across the road from reception but that wasn t a problem It was quiet and comfortable and good for the evening 
72304,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Walking distance from Marylebone Station so easy access to everything we wanted to see and do during our visit Room was compact but clean and had all necessary facilities We will be staying here on our next visit 
72305,Park Avenue Baker Street, Bedroom was so small we had to climb over our luggage to get around it The pillows were terrible This was supposed to be 4 star but was far from it , This was in a convenient location We were helped with our baggage Bathroom facilities were good 
72306,Park Avenue Baker Street, If staying in a basement room phone reception is a problem , Staff are friendly it is well located I liked that despite no room service they provide a fairly big fridge and a microwave 
72307,Park Avenue Baker Street, the fact that I could not check in till 2 pm I arrived London at 5 30 am and arrived the hotel from Heathrow at 7am , The Hotel is well located with easy access to at least 2 underground stations
72308,Park Avenue Baker Street, Myself and 12 year old daughter had to stay in the building over the road with no reception area leaving me a little anxious Wasn t what I would call 4 stars or value for money , The location was great near to underground and other attractions close by The room was clean and the staff when seen where friendly 
72309,Park Avenue Baker Street, The staff confirmed a late check out at 12 am instead of 11 am But at 11 they knocked the door twice and they called from the reception Not a nice gesture from the staff , ok walking distance from where I was going room was ok for a single room Nice bed
72310,Park Avenue Baker Street, There was an uncovered bright green safety light in the ceiling which more or less prevented any proper sleep it looked as though the cover had fallen off We complained at the desk in the morning the receptionist said he could do nothing but that the manager would be in touch with us regarding some sort of refund We never heard from anyone , Location near Regents Park Well presented room though small
72311,Park Avenue Baker Street, Having to cross a busy road to get to our room noise level outside room paying 20 for breakfast which was abysmal inedible paying out extra money for breakfast elsewhere checking out was not very professional overall would not recommend this hotel at all , Location
72312,Park Avenue Baker Street, It wasn t a full double bed and the lights were broken I had to turn the air con off for full darkness, It had a wonderful shower and the room was very clean 
72313,Park Avenue Baker Street, Rude staff terrible management Problem with the electrics in the room meant we couldn t charge phones use kettle TV or hairdryer These issues were not dealt with appropriately by management we felt very badly treated We shan t stay here again ,No Positive
72314,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, This is a pretty standard joint no frills but solid And a short walk to Baker Street and all the yummy cafes there There is no elevator but the porter is very willing to help and I appreciated that In fact all the staff were really great It was pretty clean although there were some stains in the carpet and on the bedspread but anyway don t you generally remove the bedspread at hotels 
72315,Park Avenue Baker Street, We were put on the top floor of an annexe across the road with only one stairway and no other means of fire escape , Five minutes walk from underground station and excellent restaurants in Baker Street
72316,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room wasn t clean there was no refrigerator the television was very poor and it was a basement room with no view despite having a window The wallpaper was damaged and there was a huge mould or damp stain on the ceiling , The bathroom was acceptable the towel only having a small dark stain 
72317,Park Avenue Baker Street, Had to stay in building opposite and there was no hot water They did however move us back to the main building the next day and the room was bigger and better , Good price compared to other hotels in the area and a great location
72318,Park Avenue Baker Street, Bad customer service and management I leave note about my parents can t live underground room breath issue but they don t care I come here morning told them again the morning staff confirm one is underground and other one is upstairs I accepted I just got one underground key cards because this staff told me other one clear not finished I understand and paid money But when I come back the night staff told me just two underground rooms She said she don t know I don t have any evidences CCTV no voice no any manager in here no people have responsible for this kind of problem I don t understand how your hotel operate no anyone can give solution when your staff have problems , Good hotel and good safety when I forgot my wallet in the room I call the staff help me found it after 1 day Thanks 
72319,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, I stayed in the building across the road from reception Even though the room was small it was very clean and comfortable I would stay here again as the location is perfect 
72320,Park Avenue Baker Street, Size of the room is too small fot two people , The Area where the hotel is located is excellent for walking and all sorts of transportation is easy to get 
72321,Park Avenue Baker Street, Hotel rooms are on both sides of the road in different buildings Bars in the area close early, Room does the job quite comfortable although quite small and pricey
72322,Park Avenue Baker Street, Rooms tiny I have stayed there a few times but don t think I will go back Wifi disconnects every 2 minutes Lots of stairs no lift The rooms used to have a bar fridge but they don t now I complained the room lights were not all working still not working , Location is good Baker Street tube 1 minute away on bus routes and walking distance to oxford street
72323,Park Avenue Baker Street, Overall a good stay in a clean hotel with a great location Staff were friendly Only gripe is that the staff wouldn t upgrade me to a room with a double bed for the same price even though it was 10 30 at night and no one was going to be staying in the larger room anyway They weren t empowered to make any decisions had to keep checking rates prices what they could and couldn t offer on their screen Don t like a computer says no set up , Excellent location overall quite good value considering I booked last minute
72324,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Small room but very clean and comfortable Bathroom was nice Location was amazing right by Regent s Park and the Baker subway Would stay here again 
72325,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room we were alocated was situated in an annex across the road from the main building Our room was on the top floor with 4 flights of stairs to negotiate Had this been clear on the website we probably would have looked for another hotel The hotel facilities were very limited and overall it seemed a bit overpriced for what was on offer , The location was good for our purpose There were good amenities close by The room was clean and adequate 
72326,Park Avenue Baker Street, Nothing Would definitely stay again next time we re in London , Brilliant location in a very nice area under a 10 minute walk to the underground Staff were all very helpful and polite Room was nice tidy and spacious Overall hotel was very clean in general Staff there to help 24 hours 
72327,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room was too small facing a dirty roof The bed throw and the sheets smelled as if not washed for long time Old kettle and carpet smells bad , Location
72328,Park Avenue Baker Street, Everything is bad in this hotel , Nothing is good in the Hotel The Hotel is one star and no elevator in the old building with very narrow stairs and additional to that the receptionist doesn t no how to deal with tourists because we were waiting for check in for more than 2 and half hours and the receptionist refused to allow us to check in because we have a 4 kids although I explained to her that we booked 2 club rooms and we are 2 adults and 4 kids and their ages 12 10 8 and 4 years old but still she was insisting to take one more room for our kids and they re 4 8 years old also she would like to spread us into different floors and building because of not available rooms in one floors and as well in one building additionally she was forcing us to cancel our booking and allows hotel to detect one night charge to allow us to leave to another hotel otherwise they will not allow us to check in our room After long discussing with her she called duty manager and higher management and both are refused finally they allowed us to use our two rooms but in different floors 
72329,Park Avenue Baker Street, The hotel uses a building across the road to house some of the guests This is where I was put The porter helped me with my bags up 4 flights of stairs But those stairs were narrow steep and covered in dirty carpet In my opinion it did not feel like i was staying in a hotel It felt like I was staying in someone s house I was on the 2nd floor and my room was located in an alcove with 2 other rooms The room was fine basic very small and clean surfaces however the carpet was in bad need for replacing I was staying in room 212 But as a woman staying on her own I felt less secure here than I would have in a traditional hotel layout I didn t raise this concern to hotel reception as I was in a hurry to get to a conference and just had time to get changed before I had to leave By the time I returned it was late and I just wanted to get to bed fast I have to acknowledge that there is a buzzer system to get into the building for security purposes but there was no one manning the entrance like most hotels I was travelling for business so my costs were covered but if I had to pay the cost myself I would have been very disappointed and I think you can certainly get much more for your money in London , the location was really good 5 minute walk to marlybone or baker street tube station nice clean neighborhood 
72330,Park Avenue Baker Street, The check in desk and rooms were in different locations check in is across the street so it was a tad confusing when trying to check in Our room was also not very clean There were unknown substances on all of the curtains and floor The walls were also paper thin and we could hear everything that was happening in the other rooms The shower bath tub was nice but very skinny which made it difficult to stand in the shower , The area was great and very close to Regent s Park The staff was friendly The A C was at a perfect temperature for us and the bathroom floor was heated which was a nice touch 
72331,Park Avenue Baker Street, Poor mattress dirty carpet grim view with old take away bag outside window enclosed space Breakfast very poor cheap products Restaurant not designed well tables too close to each other toaster broken , Bottle of water in room Was able to leave bag with the hotel on day of check out 
72332,Park Avenue Baker Street, There was a few marks in the walls and a stain on the carpet which should of been cleaned better but did not effect our stay in anyway and I would definitely stay again , The location was great and the bed was so comfy for me as I have a bad back and the staff were really nice and helpful the breakfast was also very good 
72333,Park Avenue Baker Street, Staff were reasonably pleasant but didn t appear very organised Breakfast was particularly bad as food had run out and we had to keep asking for plates cups and cutlery because they weren t available and the girl seemed quite put out by it all rather chaotic and very glad we didn t pay the full tarrif , Good comfortable rooms Excellent location for what we needed 
72334,Park Avenue Baker Street, The breakfast we paid extra for was horrendous ended up leaving and demanding a refund of which a manager was due to call me back I STILL haven t had this call back more than 24hrs later appealing service The breakfast was bad as there was no food in the trays to select from no clean cutlery had to ask for glasses cups milk and which tables we could sit at as the tables were dirty This was so poor I can not explain ,No Positive
72335,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Very helpful staff when we arrived earlier than check in They allowed us to store luggage and fill out our registration form etc so we could go and explore London without having to take our case with us When we did arrive back to check into our room our luggage was brought up to our room for us Very helpful polite staff The room was small but more than adequate for what we needed free wifi tea and coffee facilities within the room and a microwave to use also No fridge although it stated the rooms were equipped with one but it wasn t a problem at all This is my second stay here 
72336,Park Avenue Baker Street, The breakfast was non existant when we went down to the restuarant with four other people waiting before us there didnt seem much point in waiting beyond the half hour we did wait When we complained to the hotel receptionist the fee paid was refunded to us , Location friendly staff
72337,Park Avenue Baker Street, The noise in this hotel was too much to bare constant doors slamming and banging throughout the night this continued every night for days we did not get much sleep so we checked out a day earlier due to lack of rest we were not offered any refund for that day which was disappointing , We booked a luxury room but only managed to get it on the 2nd day of our stay this was after making a fuss The member of staff did put things right for us which we were grateful to We were then happy with the size and position of our room which was very clean and comfortable The location is good 
72338,Park Avenue Baker Street, There is nothing for me not to like , I just love this place when I am working in London The location is perfect with so much around and good public transport services The staff are welcoming and the room has everything that I need for a very comfortable and relaxing stay after a hard day s work Home from home almost 
72339,Park Avenue Baker Street, Everything ok You only have to know there is no elevator I hade som problem with my knee but they changed the room so everything was fine , Breakfast ok Bread and croissant not really fresh 
72340,Park Avenue Baker Street, Mattress was worn sank in the middle Bathroom small which QA ok however design of sink unit meant sharp corner in front of the shower cubicle Given basement room for 179 without breakfast this was not valid for money The Hilton chain charge this rate with breakfast and a comfy bed, Location
72341,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Close to the Tube station only a 4 or 5 minute walk Staff were friendly and accommodating Room was of a good standard Lovely cool room Perfect for a single night s stay for a solo traveller 
72342,Park Avenue Baker Street, Can be a bit noisy outside windows are thick though so blocks a significant amount but not all Not very disabled friendly in my bit , Good location Close to tube train amenities and Reagent s Park for leisure 
72343,Park Avenue Baker Street, Bathroom was so small it was difficult to get inbetween the shower to have a wash Strange phone device in the room which wasn t explained and I still don t know what it was Not necessarily a didn t like but would of been great if it was explained I m sure, Staff were very friendly and very accommodating Great hospitality tray and free water 
72344,Park Avenue Baker Street, The premises nr 173 has no lift yet for heavy luggage the reception had a friendly assistant who carried out the luggage to the room therefore the lift is not really needed The room did not really have a view instead one looks into the still light and bright court yard With the room being not on the busy street side this was OK as the room was very quiet , Up to standard hotel in walking distance of Baker Street tube station Easy to get around Friendly staff to the point comfortable room in same building where the reception is not across the street Immediate support by staff when asked and online request prior to arrival was honoured ironing machine and board Very quiet room at the backside of the hotel No breakfast was used Closeby several options exist for breakfast for half the price 
72345,Park Avenue Baker Street, 3 flights of stairs but other than that it was great staff were very friendly and even left a gift in The room for our anniversary , Spotless and fantastic shower
72346,Park Avenue Baker Street, Breakfast was a particularly soulless event with a limited choice of food in particular the standard of coffee one secures from those damn machines I m sure when you are catering for low numbers the hotel budget and staff could stretch to making a decent cafetiere pot of coffee or tea The dining room restaurant was clean and tidy with helpful staff although the windows of the conservatory could do with a periodic clean , Very welcome and helpful staff during our short stay Room was very neat and tidy with all facilities required on hand Bathroom clean and modem with good quality towels a must for me Would use the hotel again as it is very convenient for Baker Street station and local eating places One particulate bonus in staying a smaller hotel is the quietness due to the lack of traffic noise which can be an issue when I have stayed in a more centrally located hotel 
72347,Park Avenue Baker Street, The stairs though still defeat me , I have stayed at the hotel on many occasions It is well located the staff are friendly the bed is comfortable and it continues to offer good value for money What you see is what you get with the hotel and that suits me fine unpretentious and reliably consistent 
72348,Park Avenue Baker Street, Most Horrible hotel they gave me a room on 3rd floor with no Lift I have to climb 3 floors and rooms were available on ground 1st floor and 2nd floor and I requested them so much they didn t agree to give the room on lover floor The rooms are so tiny you cant even move your self I will never recommend any one for this hotel not at all worth for money , Nothing most horrible hotel 
72349,Park Avenue Baker Street, Dirty No elevator Room Smelled Room tiny Carvers stained No amenities no iron or hairdryer Surly staff Worst hotel I ve ever stayed in malpractice for Bookings to list it, Location
72350,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room was in a basement in a different building to the hotel The telephone didnt work in the bedroom and the handle came off in the ensuite and i was stuck in there trying to get out awful place , Nothing Waste of money 
72351,Park Avenue Baker Street, There was a huge party happening the room Next door until 7am I told reception repeatedly but nobody told them to be quiet They were also smoking in their room It was disgusting I couldn t have had a worse night sleep,No Positive
72352,Park Avenue Baker Street, we couldn t use the safe because it was not fixed , It is quite near the subway where you can get anywhere The room was very well cleaned every day and the internet worked very good 
72353,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room was far too hot and although we called reception for advice we were told that 19 degrees was as cold as it could be In fact reception the next day said that this was not so The coffee at breakfast was unpleasant, The property was well located the staff were welcoming the shower was modern and everything was clean 
72354,Park Avenue Baker Street, No lift up to the room and staircase was quite narrow would be an issue for anyone with mobility problems , Good location comfy bed good value for money
72355,Park Avenue Baker Street, No lift and on top floor Room very small Cooked breakfast disgusting Cold buffet breakfast poor choice and pasties stale , Bed standard double but comfortable 
72356,Park Avenue Baker Street, A bit overpriced for what it is Didn t really look like a 4 star hotel Breakfast was poor for 10 pounds , The rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable The location was very good 
72357,Park Avenue Baker Street, No lift No minibar Breakfast is a bit weak Would be better if there is some salad Some bedrooms are located in semi basement which were not unpleasant as you can see right through yoir windows the place they keep cleaning stuff and rubbish etc , Cozy bed and good bathroom Nice staff Location is very good 10mins walk from tube station 3mins walk from bus stop 
72358,Park Avenue Baker Street, I have no comment to make on this no complaints at all , The hotel is very central to Piccadilly Square but not in a noisy area street traffic was quiet The hotel is lovely and the staff extremely friendly and willing to help in any way they can I didn t have breakfast due to a very early start everything for me was just perfect 
72359,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room wasn t clean or sound proofed which meant that people could be heard coming and going and noise when walking up the stairs or on the floor above, The staff on arrival were incredibly warm and welcoming thank you
72360,Park Avenue Baker Street, Payment terms I booked for my boss and had requested to process all payments by visa details that I had provided during the booking process in the meantime hotel contacted me to fill out form for Visa approval I do understand their point as I did not send the form as requested and they were not going to allow Mr Andres in the room whilst he arrived in the middle of the night and staff gave him a really hard time to this and in fact we will not consider using this hotel again would have expected a better service since he had already made use of this hotel previously so I thought this issue could have waited till the next morning where I could send the form filled in or else even drop me an email to remind me to fill it out so definitely service is not good at all ,No Positive
72361,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room was in a town house and on the ground floor very odd But the worst was yet to come when we got back late and tried to sleep Every vehicle that went past rumbled past loudly and we could feel the vibration of each one We didn t get any sleep what so ever and left feeling shattered which ruined the next day in London We weren t asked about our stay when we checked out either It was not a hotel but a collections of townhouses Not at all what I was hoping for, The rom was modern and clean
72362,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Did not opt for breakfast due to time constraints Excellent location friendly helpful staff It suited us down to a T for our quick visit and would stay there again in the future 
72363,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Friendly and attentive staff clean and quiet room comfortable bed and within walking distance from Oxford circus Baker street and public transport to the hub of London Definately value for money in the area 
72364,Park Avenue Baker Street, The green LED light in the room made it feel as though I d left a light on The mattress was uncomfortable and broken The staff weren t very helpful in resolving any of my issues The room was very hot and the air con ineffectual I actually moved to a cheaper hotel for my second nights stay in London as my nights sleep was so poor , The location was very good for the underground services
72365,Park Avenue Baker Street, No view from room window in basement Noisy people in room above shower base cracked When we booked into hotel was then escorted across road to our room in basement , Very comfortable bed TV good adaqate tea and coffee facilities microwave 
72366,Park Avenue Baker Street, Refrigerator was not available in the room and had been taken for repair Couldn t chill our drinks or food Reception staff offered use of their main fridge but they were located across the road and it was inconvenient No compensation which was disappointing as room rate was high , Walking distance to everything we had planned to see Lords Cricket Ground Abbey Road Regents Park and the lovely canal walk 
72367,Park Avenue Baker Street, Tiny room with even smaller en suite Breakfast room described as restaurant but was more like a squeezed in cafe Breakfast finished at 9 30 We arrived just before 9 and little hot food left but they would cook fresh for you , We had no traffic noise and we could open the window Very clean and modern facilities 
72368,Park Avenue Baker Street, Felt a little uneasy being in a basement room with people coming past the window and not being in the building with the reception in You had to cross a road to get to reception and for breakfast , Quite location Clean and modern Close to underground The staff were very friendly and helpful 
72369,Park Avenue Baker Street, The hotel claims to be a 4 and charges everything accordingly only because rooms have recently been refurbished The staff tries hard to cope with the situation but absence of an elevator of air conditioning and refrigerators in the rooms absence of some aeration system in the bathrooms are undeniable facts Not to mention dirty window panes and pathetic breakfast On arrival we were given a luxury twin room in the basement of the building accross the street atrociously claustrophobic and suffocant as the window opened only a few inches and literally opened on the garbage dump I found it absolutely unacceptable and told so to the manager The next day they moved us to the third floor but it was a traumatic experience altogether Definitely not recommendable , Location near Baker Street underground station is ideal for covenient airport transfer Marylebone area is safe and pleasant some important cultural attractions the Wallace Collection Wigmore Hall and famous shopping destinations Oxford street Marylebone Highstreet are within walking distance 
72370,Park Avenue Baker Street, In a single room with the length of the bed against an outside wall the curtains were too short by 2 3 inches This caused an uncomfortable draft across the top of the bed, Nice colour schemes Friendly welcome Practical location for my needs
72371,Park Avenue Baker Street, I stayed in the annex part and there was no lift By the time I d got to my room on the third floor I was ready for bed , Staff were really friendly and helpful 
72372,Park Avenue Baker Street, Watery scrambled eggs and insipid Mushrooms Room hadn t been checked and they had to do something with a fuse once I discovered there was no power , Friendly reception team 
72373,Park Avenue Baker Street, Wi Fi drops frequently on iPhone apparently it s better on alternate devices , Bed and bedding are tops Bathroom updated great Staff very knowledgeable and helpful Wonderful location close to Regents University tube shops etc 
72374,Park Avenue Baker Street, Its not a 4 star hotel Its a nice b b but that s it There are no facilities other than a bed and then the buffet breakfast No evening meal restaurant no room service To get to the room you come out of the hotel across the street and a few doors down into a separate building Though a nice room this is definitely only a b b , Friendly staff comfy bed nice breakfast
72375,Park Avenue Baker Street, I could not turn off the TV but at it was late rather that tell staff I put it on radio then mute , I found the staff helpfull The room was as I had expected it to be and fine for my trip to Lords as umpire 
72376,Park Avenue Baker Street, A lot of the accomodation is in separate building across the road with no reception The room I was shown to had not been cleaned and bed unmade So taken to basement room where generator right outside window and noisy all night , Location
72377,Park Avenue Baker Street, The size of the room for the price you pay may disappoint those who prefer a bit of space to stretch out but is entirely practical if you weigh up the advantage of having good local facilities I would also recommend special requesting a room on a lower floor if you have any legs or fitness related issues with no lift walking up relatively steep stairs to the third floor is a task even for the able bodied of us All in all these are intended as recommendations for the more particular customer and are far from outright complaints , The reception and bell staff were not only polite but extremely helpful They kept our baggage safe for us whilst we explored London and helped us to move our baggage up to our room once we d finished Polite professional and despite the room being on the smaller the amenities were more than sufficient for people who were looking for comfortable and clean accommodation in London with good links to both Regents Park and the Tube National Rail services 
72378,Park Avenue Baker Street, Reception lobby and our room were not in the same building Had to cross the street Room was quite tiny , For us a big plus was the location only 10 min to oxford street via baker street underground station Didnt try the breakfast Room was small but had most things you want 
72379,Park Avenue Baker Street, There are some green and red LED lights from fire alarm etc in the room which can not be switched off This means the room is never completely dark at night even if the heavy curtains do shut out the light from outside In fact this means that the room is so well lit at night that I was able to find my way around f e to go to the bathroom without ever having to turn the actual lights on Personally I did not mind this at all because sleep comes easy to me either way but I can see how it might irk a more light sensitive guest , Very friendly welcome upon arrival As I was very ill that day and therefore exhausted from my travels I really appreciated that I was able to get an early check in between 10 11 am so I could get some rest before meeting my friends in the city later that day Check in was done quickly payment upon arrival and the staff offered me a mobile phone for the duration of my stay which I did not need They also gave me the WiFi password and then a porter kindly carried my suitcase up the narrow staircase to my room on the first floor The single room was very small but I ve never known them to be any different in London It was lovely and clean which is what matters most Inside the wardrobe there was a small safe a microwave which I didn t use and a kettle together with an assortment of instant coffee tea sugar and some rather good cookies It also offered a large bottle of still water which was lovely The tee coffee and cookies were replaced every day There was also a flatscreen tv installed at the wall at the foot end of the bed which I never turned on The bathroom was nice with a good shower Adequate water pressure is a matter of luck in British hotels but this one was just fine The room was cleaned and towels replaced every day the bed was surprisingly comfortable and also much to my surprise I found the hotel room to be pleasantly quiet I didn t hear much of the other guests at all and since my room didn t face the street I certainly didn t hear any traffic either I know the sound of the streets was a point of complaint for some reviewers but since it s not an overly busy street and there was barely any traffic at night I genuinely can t imagine that having a room with a window facing the street would have been much worse Baker Street Station is about a 5 minute walk away from the hotel As a huge Sherlock fan I got a kick out of being able to walk past 221B Baker Street every day 
72380,Park Avenue Baker Street, There was a very loud AC machine right outside the window that affected our sleep , Staff were happy to provide us with cutlery and plates delivered to the room at a late hour 
72381,Park Avenue Baker Street, restaurant not open for dinner service , the hotel was amazing only two complaints were that there was no fridge in the room and the restaurant would have been amazing if opened for dinner service 
72382,Park Avenue Baker Street, The bed was a bit too soft if you like a soft mattress you will be fine , The room and bathroom were lovely in a convenient and quiet location We loved all the amenities in the bathroom 
72383,Park Avenue Baker Street, Not so much a problem but didn t realize beforehand that hotel is split in 2 Main hotel and extension extra rooms on either side of road My room was in the extension and although this wasn t a problem for me the lack of a lift and having to climb stairs could be for those with mobility problems and or lots of luggage , Perfect for solo travelers Within walking distance of Central London Transport links all close by 
72384,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room was in a different building across a very busy road it didn t feel safe as the was no reception in there breakfast also served across the road The room was not fit for purpose as the glazing was not sufficient to block the noise from the constant traffic of cars busses and coaches , Friendly staff
72385,Park Avenue Baker Street, On arrival to our room we found there were black hairs on our bed sheets which was not the best first impression We also found the shower to drain really slowly so if you have a shower for more than 5 minutes it started to leak onto the floor It was hard to get a good sleep as there are many pigeons outside your window from 5am making a lot of noise Lastly we went out for around 4 hours on our first day stopping here and once we came back our room was not clean We phoned reception to see why this was and they weren t particularly helpful but the room was eventually cleaned an hour later , Despite the negatives the hotel was very close to Marylebone train station and many restaurants and attractions The bed itself was comfy and the room and bathroom was presentable 
72386,Park Avenue Baker Street, Small room Noise from other rooms , Staff very friendly and professional Clean comfy room Decent breakfast Good location Complimentary soft drinks as well as tea coffee and biscuits Good complimentary toiletries 
72387,Park Avenue Baker Street, I had booked a deluxe double room but we were put in a basement room I was rather disappointed about that It would have been great to have a window to look out at the parks or street But we could just see a wall , Location was great minutes away from Baker Street station
72388,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Didn t use restaurant Met friends for breakfast lunch and dinner Having lived in London for over fifty years I found location perfect for all places I wanted to re visit and walking distance to Oxford Street 
72389,Park Avenue Baker Street, The hand basin has a large crack all round the bottom The shower requires bleaching and up grading The room 023 is rather dingy with only a small window Looking onto a wall , The bed was comfy but only a small double 
72390,Park Avenue Baker Street, 5 flights of stairs to get to room with cases to carry and no lift The staff did not tell us this or ask if we could manage I felt the Premier Inn I stayed in the previous night was better value for money at half the price with an exceptional choice for breakfast I would not stay at the Park Ave again ,No Positive
72391,Park Avenue Baker Street, Breakfast was basic in choice of milk and cereals restaurant was had a very impersonal feel more like a cafeteria than a restaurant, Comfortable bed quiet location no traffic noise whatsoever
72392,Park Avenue Baker Street, small rooms rooms not as new as advertised mini bar and the safe wasn t working our room wasn t cleaned the day before departure windows were extremely dirty they tried to charge GBP 25 per hour for late check out although we have informed them in advance , central location close to public transportation comfortable bed WiFi
72393,Park Avenue Baker Street, More towel space hooks maybe so nit picking as you asked , Good use of small space to provide most usual things Like to be able to make tea coffee generous with biscuits and water 
72394,Park Avenue Baker Street, The bathroom which was very clean with no stains during my last stay now had some stains on this my recent visit so I am not sure if it would get worse going forward Everywhere else was clean , I liked the new feeling to the place and it was clean Staff were very helpful I had stayed here the last time too and stayed in same room 
72395,Park Avenue Baker Street, no lift went down for breakfast at 9am and no hot food left had to ask for them to refill the trays no milk or orange juice also , location good very clean 
72396,Park Avenue Baker Street, Breakfast was dreadful came down at 9 15 on a sunday and there was a choice of overcooked eggs bacon or sausages and nothing else for a good 20 minutes until beans were put out No milk juice or bread for toast , Location bed was decent 
72397,Park Avenue Baker Street, The Wifi on the third floor weren t working it kept losing connection We tried it with three devices Also the breakfast was not worth the money it was expensive for what you got I am not saying it was bad but just not at the right price , The location was excellent and the staff was very polite 
72398,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Good location and the staff were pleasant welcoming and helpful I had a problem with the heating in the room far too warm for me a not unusual problem in hotels When I asked if it was possible to do something about it a member of staff was knocking on my door in five minutes and the issue sorted I will certainly stay here again when next in London 
72399,Park Avenue Baker Street, Room tiny bed hard wifi was useless wouldn t connect the reception side of the hotel looks much more glamourous to the other side of the road were our room was situated the fridge didn t work , Close to tube Room was clean 
72400,Park Avenue Baker Street, There was no lift to our room but the kind staff member brought our luggage to and from our room Check out is 11am and after 11 30 they warn you there could be an extra cost so double check this on your stay or just make sure you check out on time , The room was small but high spec cleverly designed for a small space Great lighting perfect temperature control bathroom had underfloor heating shower was hot and powerful good location for us Comfy bed and friendly staff what more can you ask for from a hotel at such a good price for London City We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be returning 
72401,Park Avenue Baker Street, Wifi facility didnt work when at the 3rd floor it did work in receotion area , Comfortable beds very clean tea coffee making facilities small fridge and microwave 
72402,Park Avenue Baker Street, Breakfast was a bit of a shambles We went down at 9 35 only to find no cups on the tables no glasses no bread and very little hot food We asked the staff who told us all the cups and glasses were being cleaned We then waited an inordinate amount of time for a glass and even longer for a cup When the cups were brought out they were immediately packed away in the cupboard rather than brought to us I would not recommend having breakfast here , Location and access were good
72403,Park Avenue Baker Street, 1 Went down for breakfast at 9am and there was no food left Orange juice and milk also had to be asked to be refilled A queue of people formed awaiting for more to be made at that point we requested a refund and ate elsewhere 2 Waitress was unhelpful and quite rude to one of my family who requested a additional cup 2 There is no lift so please be aware if you have a problem climbing stairs , The rooms were clean 
72404,Park Avenue Baker Street, Not much really but be prepared to climb 50 relatively steep stairs if your on the top floor as there is no lift Wifi intermittent on top floor , Bed comfortable Room was quiet Breakfast was excellent location was great Easy reach of Marylebone station Madam Tussauds and Baker Street underground by foot 
72405,Park Avenue Baker Street, Slight niggle that poss a little attention to daft stuff like the towel rail fell off as it had worked loose button fell off light controller nothing bad just tweaks, Great little hotel well placed and we ll organised Room clean Good TV Breakfast was fine 
72406,Park Avenue Baker Street, The decor was a bit shabby and very dis organised at breakfast the food ran out and guests were kept waiting only one member of staff working front of house which wasn t very good when trying to locate cutlery etc , The Staff were lovely helpful and friendly
72407,Park Avenue Baker Street, Staff not very friendly or went out of their way but dealt with us We were led across the street by making us run out onto a busy road Breakfast is in fact NOT complimentary as was stated and very basic Not worth 20 Room was really nicely decorated and lovely Bed was so comfy The room was amazing and so was the wifi Just those little details that need fine tuning to make it a great hotel worth 380 for 2 nights , Close to baker street and attractions
72408,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, The street was beautiful So convienient The staff were friendly and understanding Cute and small Just for sleeping but a very comfortable sleep at that They had a phone that you could rent out that would help you navigate London if you were not familiar with the area 
72409,Park Avenue Baker Street, Shower needed a good clean with bleach as there was pink mold on the grout between the tiles shower door was black at the bottom around the frame with mold forming Windows needed cleaning properly Pillows very lumpy , Very friendly helpful staff Very small bathroom small but newly furnished in a modern style good shower Very good facilities in the room big bottle of complimentary water Fridge microwave also in the room Very pleasantly decorated with a modern look Good breakfast though a better selection of fresh fruit would have been appreciated 
72410,Park Avenue Baker Street, Room was very hot room was very dark and no proper lighting Room was in a basement with staff walking past the windows a lot Very small bathroom compared to the strangely large bedroom size Bed was concaved Overall felt like I was staying in a hostel Breakfast was like eating in a hospital at 7am I paid 175 for one night of this , location helped us near London Marylebone
72411,Park Avenue Baker Street, The wifi just wouldn t connect for me the staff fixed it one but it disconnected after a couple of minutes and couldn t connect again There was a small stain on my bed sheets also , Location was very good staff were quite nice and the hotel was nice and quiet at night as it s away from busy streets 
72412,Park Avenue Baker Street, the bed was a bit uncomfortable for me but that s because i have some back problems so maybe it might just be me , Location is perfect if you want to stay in the centre but away from all the tourist packed area the room i had was always well cleaned and spatious Excellent value for money and i would definitely come back in the future 
72413,Park Avenue Baker Street, no complaints , The room was a nice size clean and it was super cute and comfortable It was very easy to find from the tube station and the neighborhood was nice 
72414,Park Avenue Baker Street, Shower was positioned a little low in shower so had to stoop but really room was great , Staff very friendly room comfortable and spacious Good value for money 
72415,Park Avenue Baker Street, Not much fruit choice in the morning and some of the English breakfast items were stewed rather than grilled or fried Instant coffee only no fresh coffee , Small but very comfortable room Very helpful and friendly staff 
72416,Park Avenue Baker Street, The single bed room was in the basement of the hotel near the staff quarters and the restaurant therefore there was a lot of noise and was difficult to sleep at times ,No Positive
72417,Park Avenue Baker Street, WIFI breaks a lot and the room was tiny, Really nice hotel and location close to underground and many restaurants Room was clean and modern designed Simple but tasty breakfast
72418,Park Avenue Baker Street, nothing honestly great , The room was a good size so clean and had tv microwave and fridge It was close to the underground and a bus stop that takes u to harry potter studio close to the zoo and lovely park and close to madame Tussaud 
72419,Park Avenue Baker Street, not 100 por cent clean they could improve, i love the position between 2 underground stop they give you for the duration of the stay a mobile phone with free data and call big toilet respect the room
72420,Park Avenue Baker Street, After asking not to get one of the rooms downstairs during my booking they still put me in one of them and it is horrible It is in a building on the other side of the street the room was very smelly and dark it is right under the stairs so also very loud rooms are small and the view of this one was basically right to the air conditioning machine running every 10mn literally in front of the window very annoying and loud The windows were not helping at all so you have to keep the curtains closed Showers were not very clean and also one of them was broken water leaking when people upstairs would take their shower They changed me on the second day to another room upstairs 2nd floor but it was still very loud because of the air conditioning Girls at the reception are helpful and nice but this hotel is not a 4stars hotel and I would most definitely not recommend it , Good location
72421,Park Avenue Baker Street, We had to turn the fridge on to use it Didn t seem like it had been used in a while and was quite noisey so just turned it back off again , Loved the handy So very handy The room was perfect size and temp very clean 
72422,Park Avenue Baker Street, No butter Just some spread stuff Breakfast cold having been sat in Bain Marie since 7 30 I went for it at 8 15 , The duvet was great and the bathroom very clean 
72423,Park Avenue Baker Street, Breakfast was so so staff wasn t quite helpful a girl in the restaurant couldn t speak English and seemed not to understand anything what guests were telling her Grilled tomatoes at breakfast were boiled not grilled tastes disgusting in my opinion My friends booked a single room and the room was so tiny that it couldn t even fit in 2 people in there Double rooms are bit better because there is more space , Room was clean bed comfortable air condition works for heating and cooling no problems with hot water shampoos soap hair dryer kettle tea coffee and a bottle of water were provided 
72424,Park Avenue Baker Street, A bit unfriendly receptionst Unhelpful when we asked them to fix our minifridge in the room that didn t work, Comfortable bed Great location Wi fi connection Housekeeping They offered a smart phone with free calls and unlimited mobile data that we could bring with us while going out without any charge
72425,Park Avenue Baker Street, The breakfast was awful Cold Poor service Had to make my own table up ask for the buffet food no glasses or cutlery or napkins Would stay at the hotel again but definitely not pay for breakfast, The room was lovely and comfortable and the shower was amazing 
72426,Park Avenue Baker Street, There was a bit of confusion with our groups luggage as we checked in early with bags being delivered to wrong rooms Service was a bit slow Overall we had a good experience and would be back , This hotel represents great value for money in a great central location easily accessible for all London attractions The rooms are small but all rooms in London are small however all very clean modern and well appointed with a safe fridge microwave hair dryer and tea coffee making facilities The bathroom had under floor heating too I stay in London often on business and will certainly stay again 
72427,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room was at the front of the property on a very busy road so it was difficult to sleep with all of the traffic noise , The staff were very helpful and friendly The location of the hotel was ideal for a solo traveler with easy access to Baker Street station and lots of places to eat nearby 
72428,Park Avenue Baker Street, It was near perfect except for a noisy extract fan from the kitchen which started at 6am , Very good value for money well appointed rooms with tea coffee water and even a microwave in my room Clean crisp and modern decor giant shower 
72429,Park Avenue Baker Street, The reception staff were very cold and not particularly welcoming They were better once we checked out as they were different employees but the welcome was not warm at all and they didn t even ask how we were They forgot milk with our tea and coffee arrangement so I had to call about them bringing some up and then they took 20 minutes to do so and therefore we only had two sips of tea before we checked out of the room the next day If I m paying 100 I expect a decent cup of tea in the morning The bed dipped in the middle slightly so my partner and I felt like we were falling into each other , The bathroom was stunning very well put together and the facilities like the TV and the design of the room were very nice 
72430,Park Avenue Baker Street, Rooms need to be sound proofed Extremely noisy you can hear every single thing happening around you Pillows not comfy Breakfast horrendous tomatoes taste like perfume very strange the sausages skin is very thick to cut through and the mushrooms was like water Not pleasent at all If I hadn t paid I would have gone somewhere else On the second day had to keep asking for things people was going in the cupboards trying to find utensils etc and this was at 9 10 ,No Positive
72431,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Room size is as expected in London city It is great value for money Very classy and chic Staff was friendly and ready to help Be aware No lifts but there are bellboys Hotel is in 2 different buildings and you may have to walk in between for breakfast 
72432,Park Avenue Baker Street, The shower suddenly open by itself in midnight and phone the front desk they said nothing can do at that moment can t change room can do nothing and really no smile and very not welcome , Location is good and convenient 
72433,Park Avenue Baker Street, There was blood on my pillow upon arrival Fridge and phone was broken and i had to ring down three times overall for them to send someone up We were left with no towels after they cleaned the room The tv had a universal remote and subtitles were stuck on the screen as we were unable to turn them off The staff were unprofessional and lacked basic customer service skills No room around the bed so we had to get changed in front of the door, Easy access to transport and local atttractions Good shower Comfy mattress
72434,Park Avenue Baker Street, Even though we had paid for the room we didn t have the card we paid with on us so they charged a different card essentially we paid twice They said they would refund the other card but that is yet to happen , The location was amazing 
72435,Park Avenue Baker Street, Tiny room dark when your a lady trying to do your makeup couldn t see properly in the mirror Had a massive wardrobe which probably isn t needed for people who stay 1 night limits floor space Fridge wasn t on so had to wait for it to cool took ages and was loud Hall way and stairs looked a bit grubby Some walls need a paint , Bed was comfy bathroom was lovely good shower and clean 
72436,Park Avenue Baker Street, Breakfast is highly unrecommended The room was too hot the bacon too dry and hardly any people there For 7 or 10 pounds it s way too expensive so better have breakfast elsewhere Also since the building is quite old I heard other customers walking talking or making noise , Had a double room Room was clean bathroom relatively modern rain shower and it was just enough space for a solo traveller Pro of the hotel was handy a smartphone with restrictions and 4G internet connection you could lend with no extra fee to pay The phone itself was a bit old so it was slow Oh huge con is that I couldn t use the handy phone for wifi hotspot With that it would ve been better But al least I could use it for navigation and web browsing during my trip Also the nearest underground station Baker Street has a great connection to travel to most places since many lines stop there Also I was lucky to have a ground floor room since there was no lift for my heavy luggage D
72437,Park Avenue Baker Street, The decor and furniture was nice as was the bathroom , Room was so noisy I could not sleep at all because of the traffic and did not stay most of the trip I travelled home which was one hour each way and got more sleep than if I stayed in that very noisy hotel I would not recommend this hotel to anyone 
72438,Park Avenue Baker Street, The staff were not English and when I needed assistance were very flaky with help I was even asked what is the changing of the guard When I asked what days it took place Room small ,No Positive
72439,Park Avenue Baker Street, Could have been better not having room number 012 next to the staircase as could clearly hear in the night people coming and going Also the room above this which was number 113 had a creaky floor Suppose it s an old building but with refurb rooms Felt as though our room should have been a Store Room Management said they would give us a better room if we stayed again , The shower was excellent 
72440,Park Avenue Baker Street, all breakfast tables were all left with dirty plates i had to move them to get empty table the food was not hot nobody appeared to replenish extremely poor also I stayed for a total of 3 nights one on business then a 2nd booking for the weekend no bottle of water for second booking I rang and was told it would have to be paid for people running up and down stairs until 3 30am Friday and Saturday nights so very little sleep All in All pretty terrible stay, good location for where i needed to be 
72441,Park Avenue Baker Street, Temperature too hot in room and hotel and couldn t alter thermostat Bed very soft no where to put case as room compact Asked for poached eggs took a long time in coming and had to remind them only 1 other diner in breakfast room Expensive for what it was No lift , reception staff friendly shower nice complimentary water
72442,Park Avenue Baker Street, Rooms were small and not the cleanest , The hotel very kindly gave me and my mum free breakfast as it was my birthday however the breakfast wasn t worth the 10 that the hotel charged Good location easy access to the underground and other transport 
72443,Park Avenue Baker Street, We had a small but ok for London room in the basement so could hear lots of rumblings from either the aircon or The Underground Not a big deal and it was almost soporific , Friendly and helpful staff Very clean and well maintained rooms Excellent location 
72444,Park Avenue Baker Street, THE EN SUITE WAS MORE FITTED OUT FOR A DISABLE PERSON SHOWER TO LOW FOR A MAN TO STAND UNDER A BIT NOISY AS WE WERE LOCATED BY THE HOTEL ENTRANCE AND BY THE ROAD BREAKFAST ROOM FAR TO HOT , THE STAFF WERE FRIENDLY AND A GOOD LOCATION FOR WHAT WE WANTED TO DO COMFORTABLY WITH TEA MAKING FACILITIES GOOD BREAKFAST 
72445,Park Avenue Baker Street, The hotel is split over 2 separate buildings on either side of the road which wasn t clear when booking so you could end up in either one , Nice friendly and pleasant staff Rooms were clean well looked after and well finished
72446,Park Avenue Baker Street, Breakfast was disappointing the room is very small and so the tables are all very compact very awkward atmosphere maybe some quiet music could improve this The cooked breakfast was very poor and actually made me and my partner ill that day safe to safe although we paid in advance we skipped breakfast the next day, Such a lovely location so quick and easy to jump on the tube and get to pretty much anywhere 
72447,Park Avenue Baker Street, Very small room The room is tiny I wish I had of listened to earlier reviews as the pictures are very deceiving It was dusty and only had four coat hangers for 2 people The room wasn t cleaned properly each day and rubbish was left in the room You couldn t get out of the bed with out bumping into the wardrobes or desk Lighting really dark especially when getting ready and doing make up Was on the other side of the road to reception and main hotel fine for us but wouldn t have been happy if I was on my own Definitely over priced , location
72448,Park Avenue Baker Street, We had a room in the basement which is abit annoying in the morning with the noise of steps and stairs , The room was really comfy Got surprised with the phone provided in the room with free calls and internet even though we did not really need it 
72449,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Rooms facilities were modern and worked The double room was one of the smallest I ve ever been in but hey ho it is London It was easy to get to on the bakerloo Staff were v good 
72450,Park Avenue Baker Street, Extremely disappointed to find the mattress was brown and the sink was blocked , Awesome idea to offer guests a complimentary smartphone for calls Internet and maps 
72451,Park Avenue Baker Street, Breakfast could be better and at least a bottle of water should be left in the room everyday to avoid the guest providing it from outside , The location is very suitable very close to Baker Street Station also attraction places are also walking distance to the hotel 
72452,Park Avenue Baker Street, The mirror in the room was broken a few of the tiles on the floor had no grout and came apart also there was mold in the shower also the room size was very small which was deceiving from the website photos, Room was fairly clean and modern was a good price
72453,Park Avenue Baker Street, Room location Cigarette burn on toilet seat Stains on bedding Put in separate building across the road to reception Noisy and no lift room at top very small, The shower was functional
72454,Park Avenue Baker Street, I was in a building over the road from the reception and although the phone lines connected you to the main building when I returned from an event that evening as a woman on my own it felt very unsafe just walking in to the doorway When you walk in to s hotel reception immediately you feel safe I felt very unsafe walking in to this unmarked door There was no warning about not staying in another building given The receptionist was too busy trying to flog the use of some phone I was also on the top floor and had to climb 5 sets of stairs as there was no lift I had bags and luggage with me and no one assisted The carpet all the waybill the stairs was grubby looking and the room was grubby too It just did not warrant the amount of money it charged Also it is very misleading that it calls itself Park Ave Baker Street it is not on Baker Street , The room although small was nicely decorated
72455,Park Avenue Baker Street, Breakfast unfortunately it was limited and served until 9 30am we arrived at 8 45am and had ran out of most things when you asked for more to be brought out they said no when it s gone it s gone and when you pay 10 each for breakfast but not get hardly anything is a disgrace considering we all paid the same money the staff didn t communicate with us well either Wasn t impressed and also a staff member knocked on our door at midnight whilst a sleep woke us up and turns out he had the wrong room Not professional , The room was okay
72456,Park Avenue Baker Street, Hotel wasn t very obvious when walking down the street I missed it when walking by and had to backtrack in confusion There are little silver plaques with the name and I expected to see something a bit more prominent , Location was close to Baker Street and lots of restaurants nearby The tube was also very close Shower was great had both a shower head and rain type from the ceiling 
72457,Park Avenue Baker Street, I was surprised that my duvet showed signs of recent blood spill O and those stairs , Not as efficient at reception as before Slow and ponderous and left me waiting for 10 minutes on checking in even though I was the only one checking in 
72458,Park Avenue Baker Street, Ground floor room was a little noisy as we were by the side of the road but we soon got used to it , Great location clean rooms and wonderfully comfortable beds 
72459,Park Avenue Baker Street, would have liked spare loo roll in bathroom Seemed to provide part rolls which ran out , Comfortable with fridge and microwave good location and quiet location
72460,Park Avenue Baker Street, I honestly have nothing negative to say I loved everything , The staff were very friendly My room was very clean and comfortable Breakfast was quite good and I have dietary restrictions but there were many options The location is perfect for walking to the shops or the parks I would definitely stay again 
72461,Park Avenue Baker Street, Not being ambushed and accused of stealing so we wouldn t make an official complaint The hotel is built for HOBBITS with no mind your head signs Also the hotel is split across a busy road which is not told in check in or the website, Better customer service cleaner hotel to be ready at check in time not 2 and half hours later 
72462,Park Avenue Baker Street, The air conditioning did not work I run hot so had to open a window to get some air The room was tiny , The bed was large and comfy The location was good and easy to find 
72463,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room was very small for one described as a Deluxe Double this is actually their standard room Although comfortably furnished several of the appliances and features did not work the fridge and hairdryer were broken as was one light fitting all repaired on the second day the pillows were lumpy and were also replaced broken but not fixed were the sink waste one could not fill the sink and the extractor fan , Excellent central location quiet and safe residential area excellent public transport links plenty of good nearby places to eat and drink two small supermarkets nearby staff were attentive and exceptionally polite the room was spotlessly clean Probably good value at the price we paid 354 for three nights 
72464,Park Avenue Baker Street, Gloucester Place with much traffic Bathroom was not clean Windows could not be opened only very slightly , Nice rooms in a small Hotel Very close to Baker Street Tube Station Very nice pubs only a minute to walk Friendly staff 
72465,Park Avenue Baker Street, The sheets came off the bed easily whilst I slept I think who ever made the bed couldn t reach behind the mattress as there is so little space in the room,No Positive
72466,Park Avenue Baker Street, Unfortunately they had problems with the fire alarm at 5 30am and the bed was too soft for me although some people may prefer this , Good Location lovely Shower and plenty of Toiletries
72467,Park Avenue Baker Street, 1 Fire alarm at 06 40am that failed to stop faulty 2 The fact that the room was in a dingy basement 3 No Window the window looked at a wall which was less than 8 inches away 4 No refund for the breakfast which was not taken because of the fire alarm 5 Room not located in hotel but in a separate building down the road , Decor was nice 
72468,Park Avenue Baker Street, That the staff did not handle the early fire alarm well enough Luckily I knew to get out straight away but we were left with no information Some other guests clearly stayed in their rooms when we were not given confirmation of a false alarm The staff didn t know how to turn it off and unfortunately that meant well over an hour of not being able to get to my room The whole point of me travelling late the night before was so I didn t have to get up too early to catch my train from Birmingham Really unfortunate as I didn t have a decent stay , Just easy and comfortable 
72469,Park Avenue Baker Street, Having to cross the road from the accommodation to reception and the dining room , Very close to Marylebone Railway Station that is why I chose it Everything was very clean and the en suite shower was excellent All of the fittings in the bedroom and en suite appeared to be brand new 
72470,Park Avenue Baker Street, Continental breakfast was adequate but not particularly appetising Coffee was horrific , Location Friendly and helpful staff Excellent room Free Wifi throughout Easy to find and close to transport links Perfect location for purpose of my trip
72471,Park Avenue Baker Street, Note that its an old building and so no lifts The breakfast was quite expensive for what we got Not friendly to muslims as no alternatives to pork sausages and bacon ,No Positive
72472,Park Avenue Baker Street, Our room was in the basement across the road from the actual hotel in another building and view out of window was the wall Having said that it was very quiet But room was very small and address was NOT Baker Street Didn t have breakfast ,No Positive
72473,Park Avenue Baker Street, Nothing all was swell, Location superb Staff very friendly gentleman at reception was very helpful and curtious Room comfortable and shower great 
72474,Park Avenue Baker Street, The 4 Flights of stairs no lift and no bar no room service no free water on second day as stated would be provided could not find a hairdryer , The room was very nice but rather small especially if it were for two 
72475,Park Avenue Baker Street, Only one minor little nit pick was that the window didn t lock It was in a sub terranian room in a busy London area but besides that the stay was perfect , Staff were very friendly as they have been the past few times I ve stayed and very helpful Look forward to staying again in the future
72476,Park Avenue Baker Street, Soft uncomfortable bed No travel accessories bathroom shelf provided Making it badly design bathroom renovation , Excellent location Close to local eateries and transport 
72477,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room smelt very strongly of cigarette smoke and when we mentioned this we were just provided with an air freshener , The bed was comfy although a little small Staff were extremely helpful and brought an iron up to our room for us The location was excellent and the room was clean apart from the smell 
72478,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room double was tiny and in a separate building across the road from where reception and the breakfast bar are i e you have to cross the road to go for breakfast check out etc The shower in our first room had a little bit of mould room was slightly below street level so we had to ask to be moved to another room , Location is good Baker street station is less than 5min away and the staff are very friendly and helpful Price is above what it should be but it is London after all 
72479,Park Avenue Baker Street, On the top floor Many many stairs Staff showed us up but didn t offer to carry bags Separate hair shampoo and conditioner would be excellent , Small compact room but everything you needed was in there including free bottled water coffee and biscuits etc bonus to have a microwave 
72480,Park Avenue Baker Street, We paid for breakfast in the morning which is usually 10 but booking on arrival we accepted offer of 7 Which is brilliant Breakfast was the only criticism I have It was served from Bain Marie s and had been there a while and not very hot , Excellent location We had been to see Billy Joel at Wembley stadium Bed was very comfortable Decor very smart Tea and coffe in the room Fantastic shower Reception staff very helpful and friendly
72481,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room was very small even though we had a club room think the photos led us to expect more space Breakfast wasn t very good value for money fairly expensive for the quality of cooked food choice , Really comfy bed and pillows Good room facilities we had everything we needed and it s in an excellent location Very helpful staff We would stay again 
72482,Park Avenue Baker Street, Too small room Mine was on a bulding in front without any previous notice Besides 2nd floor without lift , Quality of facilites at room and location Friendly and pro staff
72483,Park Avenue Baker Street, I asked for double bed room and got twin room that too on 4th floor and bit a effort is needed to go up all the way Breakfast is not that impressive even though we got full English breakfast, Location and friendly staff 
72484,Park Avenue Baker Street, Breakfast service on 2nd day Basement room with view of brick wall , Had basement room not in the main hotel building with the view of a brick wall Breakfast service on the 2nd day was poor Had to ask for plates cups knives and falks There was no bacon beans or egg left and when asked all came at different times so didn t get a full breakfast in the end The room was clean though and the staff in reception were very polite and helpful 
72485,Park Avenue Baker Street, There was a fair bit of external noise heard in the room but it didn t seem to affect our sleep , Complimentary soft drinks in the room were a nice touch We were visiting London for the Regents Park theatre this hotel is perfectly placed for both the theatre and a variety of restaurants 
72486,Park Avenue Baker Street, When we arrived the toilet had not been cleaned and we had to call reception to come and scrub the seat The hotel is also across 2 sites and we were in the extension across the road , The breakfast was very nice but entirely self service 
72487,Park Avenue Baker Street, The fact we were across the road down underground They were doing renovations and on the steep staircase they had plastic over the carpet One of our single mattresses you could feel the springs the small fridge didn t work the small container of milk we bought went off The wi dos overlooked the area where the staff had the linen Also late evening around 12midnight and later when we were trying to sleep we had staff bashing things around and talking right outside our opened window that we open to get fresh air not aircon , The only thing good was it was within walking distance to Sherlock Holmes museum and Beatles museum Also close to busses and trains Also it had a microwave so we could hear up dinner we had purchased 
72488,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Very impressing service SPOTLESS and IMMACULATE Cleanliness of the room Best location in the middle of the London Tube bus service just 3 4 minutes of walk Love this Hotel Stayed in room 111 Thank you 
72489,Park Avenue Baker Street, A mirror in our room was smashed which wasn t great and the room was quite cramped but still comfortable, The hotel was very modern well equipped and in a fantastic location for both getting to Euston and Wembley my main priorities
72490,Park Avenue Baker Street, Booked 3 rooms for group of friends to catch up and discovered on arrival we had rooms on opposite sides of the road Two in a basement and one in the uppermost room with no way out if there was a fire or any other incident Very disappointed ,No Positive
72491,Park Avenue Baker Street, Breakfast could have been better presented and member of staff on duty a bit more present, Room was very clean and warm welcome at reception breakfast was disappointing 
72492,Park Avenue Baker Street, Breakfast was a let down, Location excellent room big enough cleaning service exelent breakfast could have been a lot better but that would not put me off staying there again
72493,Park Avenue Baker Street, When we told the manager that the people across the hall were noisy and had extra people stay they pretty much ignored what we said , It was modern and comfortable It was quiet most of the time 
72494,Park Avenue Baker Street, Room was very small and old tired d cor Not a good match for the photos , Good location Most of the staff friendly Convenient location but not on the same street as Sherlock Holmes Museum 
72495,Park Avenue Baker Street, Very noisy from traffic secondary glazing did not reduce Very bright green light on ceiling to identify door as fire escape which lit up the whole room , Good location
72496,Park Avenue Baker Street, The AC DO NOT WORK With London temp soaring to 32 deg the AC did not work 2 nights in a row The Manager s response was callous and she kept on insisting that it is OK from OUR side As if I owned the Hotel Room The hotel refunded me just GBP 50 for 2 nights before I cut short my stay and moved OUT And also the lockers in the room are faulty and they have a tendency to open with 1234 code irrespective of the code you personalized PLEASE STAY AWAY from this hotel, ONLY the LOCATION as it was only 150 mtrs from London Business School where I was attending the course 
72497,Park Avenue Baker Street, 3rd floor no elevator as usual in these old London buildings The Internet was useless had to log in every few minutes only 3 coat hangers seriously , The bed was comfortable room and bathroom was clean plenty of water drinks and tea n coffee 
72498,Park Avenue Baker Street, Only slight problem was the noise from the stairs when people departed There was a steady stream from about 4am , Good Value for money I was in their second site across the road which was fine Bedroom was nicely decorated and bathroom clean and all functioning 
72499,Park Avenue Baker Street, Booked this early got a basement room across the road I ve had much better rooms in London with location and for same price or cheaper , Location was spot on
72500,Park Avenue Baker Street, Beware there is no elevator at this facility My elderly parents had a tough time going up down the stairs , The staff was excellent and very responsive to guest needs Location is close to the Baker Street tube station 
72501,Park Avenue Baker Street, There are 2 buildings so you need to cross the street cars passing to go to reception No elevator at least in my buidling , Location clean cheap for London standards nice new furniture faciliites and toilet modern good wifi comfortable
72502,Park Avenue Baker Street, Tight squeeze in a tiny room Didn t deserve the description deluxe No lift and a narrow stairway to negotiate with luggage aim to sleep ground floor , Location excellent for walking access to Oxford and Bond Streets and other central locations 
72503,Park Avenue Baker Street, A lift , We are used to larger bedrooms I had booked a deluxe room But my husband and I found it hard to dress at the same time one had to sit on the bed while the other got dressed The smallest room we have had in a long time 
72504,Park Avenue Baker Street, Booked Delux Double room It was small and located in basement of annex across road with view of a ladder and wall Breakfast offered limited choice , Good Location 
72505,Park Avenue Baker Street, No tv remote and one of the bedside lamps did not work We were in the annex across the road where work was being done carpets in hallways covered with plastic workmen disturbed us quite early in the morning , The bed was comfy Although we didn t use them there was a microwave and a fridge which would have been very useful had we have been staying longer than the 1 night 
72506,Park Avenue Baker Street, I don t think the staff were the most helpful people in the world I also requested an early check in didn t get it even though we gave more than a weeks notice I didn t feel comfortable leaving our bags in the lobby whilst we had to leave because we didn t get our early check in No lift not a hotel suitable for people who need wheelchair access , It s not in a bad area restaurants and coffee shop near by with good public transport links Rooms were modern 
72507,Park Avenue Baker Street, clean and nice guest rooms though not very roomy, very lovely place excellent location 5min walk to Baker ST underground station and the Sherlock Holmes Museum
72508,Park Avenue Baker Street, walls are too thin you can hear people walking the stairs or coughing in the next room , Room was very clean and well equipped microwave coffee and tea fridge wifi worked perfectly and we even had this free thing that looks like a mobile phone that you can use to surf the internet or explore the city and more The bed was really comofrtable and the location is just perfect close to oxford street and regent park and for those who fly from Luton it is super close to the bus stop 
72509,Park Avenue Baker Street, The shower dribbled a bit , Brilliant location for walking and tube access Nice cosy well thought out room Helpful and professional staff A great area to stay in for exploring and eating out Couple of nice pubs and places for breakfast 
72510,Park Avenue Baker Street, walked straight past it didn t realise it was there and the broken socket but as said this was resolved by moving room, staff were very good had broken socket and were moved to another room very promptly
72511,Park Avenue Baker Street, Phone call several hours before while we were still in France saying they would like to change our room to another place on the other side of London We said this was not possible A different room was found for us reputedly better but surely the original room couldn t have been smaller Consistent refusal to find storage space for bikes in spite of requesting this on the booking com form Eventually after much debate space was found in the luggage room Too expensive for what was offered , Not a lot 
72512,Park Avenue Baker Street, A lift would have been nice though I had read prior reviews so was aware in advance I was also in the building across the road from the main hotel which was a minor inconvenience when checking out on a rainy day , I booked a deluxe single room Though small it was perfectly adequate for 1 night It was comfortable and clean with modern decor I asked for a high floor due to poor reviews of the basement rooms the room was airy and bright but the lack of a lift made it quite a climb 3rd floor That said the concierge carried my bag upstairs for me which was appreciated 
72513,Park Avenue Baker Street, We felt the breakfast was ok but could ve been filled a bit better as not everything was available all at once, Room was well appointed with air con and a nice quality feel about it check in staff very friendly 
72514,Park Avenue Baker Street, Room was very small especially as we paid extra for a deluxe room We felt that this was not reflected in the rooms standard just the higher price , The room was very clean and comfortable It was also cleaned every day with replacement of towels 
72515,Park Avenue Baker Street, The bathroom was very small and cramped The bed wasn t very comfortable, The location was close to public transport and good eating options Very easy to find
72516,Park Avenue Baker Street, The housekeeping is slack Garbage was not removed the floor was not vacuumed the tea tray was not properly refilled glasses not replaced the table by the bed was sticky for the four nights we were there We paid an extra 30 pounds to have our room extended for this one night rather than move to a different room felt that the room should have been fully cleaned and prepared as if we were new guests , The location is central to buses the Bakerlook and Marylebone stations Staff are kind and helpful the bed is comfortable our room was quiet despite being on the street free wifi tiny but efficient bathroom 
72517,Park Avenue Baker Street, no lift, nice boutique hotel in a quiet street nearby marylebone tube abt 8 mins walk room is clean neat with all amenities plus point with microwave the only downside is hotel no lift so if stay at 2nd floor need to drag the luggage up n down which is a bit of hassle otherwise nice stay checkin and checkout smooth
72518,Park Avenue Baker Street, the only thing I could fault was the breakfast 10 isn t a huge amount but I would have expected the coffee to be of higher quality the bread available to toast a bit higher quality and hot food to be of greater quality better cooked For 10 I could have got a decent breakfast at Starbucks, Location staff room decor
72519,Park Avenue Baker Street, Just a couple of small things that make the stay less enjoyable and the communication irritating I found I had to say the same thing about five times regarding our wish to upgrade the reservation from one person to two difficulty in changing reservation from single to double through Booking com and could not phone direct to London from Canada to explain new costs and options were not clear at any point until signing the final bill communication was very difficult both in email and when we arrived I stayed alone at the hotel on June 8 and tried to explain in person that we would like to have one room for the final four days of our stay but still that request was not processed when we arrived June 22nd every day the room should be vacuumed but it was not as I found threads and items on the floor every day new clean glasses should be provided and I think that the refreshment tray refilled to include the cookies and the bottled water OR there should be a nice polite sign to explain that bottled water is only offered at the beginning of the stay we paid to move from single to double expected but we had to pay a penalty to remain in the same room double to twin of 30 pounds for a Club Rate which we did not understand as the rates and options were not clearly presented It would seem that having a twin would have been a preferable for us as cousins not as a partner relationsip We agreed to stay in our room to avoid having to pack up and move but wish after the fact that we had done so to save 30 pounds fee and to have the refreshment tray fully replenished for a new reservation The breakfast buffet is not my choice and not worth the additional 30 pounds I would not recommend it , The room was comfortable updated not too noisy although we were on the street location ideal for both Marylebone and Bakerloo lines Staff appeared willing to help and were friendly We felt safe It is nice to have a kettle with facilities to make tea or coffee in the room and to have a small fridge and microwave I went down to the desk three times to request extra water and clean glasses and the young men on duty were very kind While I did not like having to go down it was not their fault that there were small problems they were most professional 
72520,Park Avenue Baker Street, Having asked for room on first floor we were put on top floor no lift I immediately had a panic attack as we were told we could not move My husband spoke to receptionist who then moved us yo first floor Not the best start to our trip , Hotel quite close to Regents Park and Baker Street
72521,Park Avenue Baker Street, Room could do with a little maintainance plug socket was loose etc But nothing major , Was well placed in the city near to Baker Street underground station Near coffee shops to grab my necessary morning coffee 
72522,Park Avenue Baker Street, There is no bar and the restaurant is only open for breakfast The lobby is tiny but this hotel does not position itself as a place to hang out and socialise There are plenty of bars and resturants around , A nice small hotel in a good location 5 minutes walk to the nearest Baker Street tube Rooms are small but are very modern well equipped and have comfortable beds Staff was very helpful WiFi worked well This is great value for money for a single business or leisure traveller who is just looking for a modern room in a new hotel to sleep But for two people this is not likely to work due to very small space 
72523,Park Avenue Baker Street, The rooms we booked three were all very small and one of them in particular was downright claustrophobic All three rooms had a very strong smell of mould, It was close to train station
72524,Park Avenue Baker Street, booked a small double and it was very small although everything that you needed was there I was on the top floor which was three flights of stairs up and there was no lift also the cooked breakfast wasn t very hot the first morning I stayed I wont stay there again I prefer something bigger with a bar etc , staff very helpful hotel very clean the location was very good
72525,Park Avenue Baker Street, Cleaning outside room at 3am not acceptable including staff talking and disturbing the guest Guest actually could not sleep and leeting staff know did not work ,No Positive
72526,Park Avenue Baker Street, Our deluxe room was barely big enough to get into bed from both sides , The location was perfect for us close to Underground and our destination in London 
72527,Park Avenue Baker Street, Check in was slow and room wasn t ready on time which was an inconvience There were 3 other couples waiting on rooms also at the time which isn t ideal when your on a short trip and time is limited Rooms should be ready by the specified time Also a cleaner attempted to come into our room prior to check out time on our morning of departure which isn t good enough especially when we were late checking in in the first instance, Location is excellent 
72528,Park Avenue Baker Street, We prepaid for breakfast but it was cheaper to buy at the hotel There was a little green light in the ceiling which glowed brightly through out the night possible a smoke detector, Check in was easy the room was comfortable and we received complimentary soft drinks Breakfast was good and the location was ideal for what we wanted ease of getting to Wembley We were in the main part of the hotel 
72529,Park Avenue Baker Street, The external door to the building did not always fully close and lock so not a secure building The smell outside the room perhaps from the vacuum cleaner left there Please provide conditioner or better quality shampoo that doesn t matt and knot long hair No mobile signal in the basement rooms, Excellent Staff very friendly and helpful 10 10 The location Quiet room at the back of the building Good wifi Comfortable bed and pillows
72530,Park Avenue Baker Street, Room was smaller than expected for this tariff but although being compact it was well provided Wardrobe hair dryer etc Breakfast was an extra but at seven pounds each if you settled in advance represented good value and friendly service, Location is very good being relatively near Baker Street tube and Marylebone Road for restaurants and busses Also an easy walk to Regents Park and Lords Cricket ground
72531,Park Avenue Baker Street, We had booked a deluxe double and were given a basement room which was very damp and smelled the room was so small we could barely walk around the bed This was definitely not deluxe The window would not open and there was no phone signal which was a problem as my mother in law was in hospital and we needed to be contactable We were given another room after complaining , The staff were very helpful when we had a problem The location of the hotel is probably the main plus point 
72532,Park Avenue Baker Street, There is no elevators and the hotel is a typical three floor building so if you don t like stairs ask for s ground floor The air conditioning was week yes global warming is real and London is getting hot during summer The furniture was a bit old I have to struggle with the doors of the wardrobe to open them , This is a small hotel in the heart of London It has a perfect location My room single luxury room was tidy and clean yet a little bit small The hotel offered a smartphone with 4G access during my stay free of charge which was of real help Breakfast was a generous English breakfast with plenty of nice choices 
72533,Park Avenue Baker Street, Our view was no point having a window as all we could see was the wall but we wasn t there for a view out of the room so did not effect us , Got there slightly early let us check in to our room room was as expected all clean tidy 5 min walk from the station would stay here again
72534,Park Avenue Baker Street, We asked for extra pillows as I was being admitted to the London Clinic the following morning for major surgery and cannot sleep without lots of pillows We were informed that it wasn t possible and they didn t have spares After 2 phone calls and 30 mins they found one and then never returned Very disappointed for 135 , Clean room
72535,Park Avenue Baker Street, We were in a twin room and my bed was extremely soft which I did not find comfortable There was also a green light in the room which stayed on and kept me awake so I did not get much sleep at all , The breakfast was very good there was a good choice although the scrambled eggs were a little too salty The room was very nice and had everything we needed although some people may struggle with the stairs which were quite narrow The location was very good and quiet 
72536,Park Avenue Baker Street, You always have to Ask for extra hangers And if You are Staying for one night or whole month You Just get one complimentary bottle of water I think giving a complimentary bottle of water for every night stay would be more fair Even if the bottles were smaller in size This trip the room small fridge was not cold enough but the hotel changed it in a few days and promised they will change all the fridges in the near future , Location helpful staff
72537,Park Avenue Baker Street, NO lift We were on 3rd floor and 66 steps up narrow staircase , Clean room friendly and helpful staff good shower tea making facilities hairdryer 
72538,Park Avenue Baker Street, The air con was not very effective It didn t matter to us because of the time of year and weather but in the height of summer it could be an issue because the room gets the sun all afternoon , For such a central location I thought it was good value for money 
72539,Park Avenue Baker Street, Breakfast was a good price at 7 but a little uninspiring , Excellent position near to Baker Street tube but also within walking distance of places of interest Very comfortable bed and clean room Choice of two shower types with plenty of hot water 
72540,Park Avenue Baker Street, Check in was very slow Only one person in front of us and it took around 20 minutes to check in Room was on top floor with no lift We were not advised of this in the booking , Bed was very comfortable Room clean and spacious Good location Good tea and coffee making facilities in room and a microwave and fridge for those staying for longer stays than over night 
72541,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Enjoyed my stay at Park Avenue Baker Street very much Excellent location even though on a busy street with traffic the hotel has made very good arrangements for windows to keep all the noise out Staff was very polite and helpful Will definitely stay again Thank you for the comfortable stay 
72542,Park Avenue Baker Street, Being in the basement with underground trains passing every few minutes and being interrogated on arrival as the credit card I had paid with wasn t with me even though the stay was already fully paid ,No Positive
72543,Park Avenue Baker Street, We were located in a room below ground there was a green light which was on all night disturbed sleep very annoying , Very comfortable bed 
72544,Park Avenue Baker Street, Walls were very thin so a noisy couple of nights , Room though small was very well appointed lovely bathroom I was in the annex across the road Very courteous helpful staff 
72545,Park Avenue Baker Street, Nothing at all negative to report I was a little surprised that after checking in to the hotel we were shown to our room in a different building on the other side of the road but the accommodation was superb and it made no difference to our stay at all , Very comfortable well decorated room En suite bathroom was well fitted with an efficient shower Great location Lovely breakfast 
72546,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Great location good breakfast and reasonably priced Rooms clean tidy and compact with everything you need Staff very helpful and friendly Would recommend to anybody 
72547,Park Avenue Baker Street, Couldn t fault the facilities room or staff They were fantastic , The greeting at reception on our arrival was friendly and very helpful especially helping us with luggage to our room Checking out the was easy and quick too The rooms are lovely comfortable and modern in decor Comfy beds and fab to have fridge microwave tea coffee and bottled water which was complimentary I would definitely re book this hotel again 
72548,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room is really small and has nothing to do with the pictures in the website When I arrived I was told that I was not going to stay in the main building but in a diferent one across the street but was never awared of that before The bed sheets have not been changed The closet was so small and had only 2 hangers and no drawer I had to keep my clothes in my suitcase The bed was terribly small , Nada 
72549,Park Avenue Baker Street, Nothing, I liked everything staff so helpful delicious breakfast high standard of hygiene fresh and modern decor really comfortable bed with beautiful linen etc etc
72550,Park Avenue Baker Street, Nothing , Clean and nice sized room Near two tube stations bus stops Ideal for anyone going to Harry Potter Studios as one of the bus stops is about 3mins walk from the hotel door
72551,Park Avenue Baker Street, Bed was not very comfortable and of course being just off Baker Street it was noisy all night long with traffic But of course we knew this would be the case , Nice room and very good shower 
72552,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room was very small and dark We had a view of a dingy roof wall yard We also had a problem with water leaking from a light fixture over my head and had to be moved rooms at 1 30am We did not receive an apology the next morning when we checked out even though the receptionist had full knowledge of the incident when I mentioned it Very disappointing , The decor was nice
72553,Park Avenue Baker Street, Difficult to find initially but we were using a map not an app Our double room was tight on space The basement room was initially a little cool and musty improved when we adjusted the heating, Street with character Smart decor Very central Quiet rooms on 2nd floor and basement Lots of places to eat nearby Close to Regents Park Easy walk to underground station Very comfortable bed and fresh modern bathroom Complimentary bottled water and biscuits with tea and coffee a nice touch 
72554,Park Avenue Baker Street, The rooms are in separate buildings across the street from the reception there is no lift and we were on the 4th floor pretty tiring each time we had to climb the stairs , The room was compact but with high end fittings and fixtures it was clean and the free soft drinks was a nice touch 
72555,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room was too small to stay for a long time only just one bed and very small desk There is no other space , It was clean and the staff is very helpful There were an electric range and fridge 
72556,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Comfy bed quiet room at back room compact good breakfast choice Would not want to stay for week or more despite fridge and coffe machine in room as only half a ward robe left and no real space for a large suitcase we travelled light
72557,Park Avenue Baker Street, Did like having the top floor Bit of a total to the room But for one or two nights It was no problem , Great place to stay 5 min walk from Baker st underground And only one stop to the theatre we went to Loved it Will stay again when we go to theatre Staff very welcoming If you dont want to climb stairs it s not good But clean and v Comfy beds
72558,Park Avenue Baker Street, Very small single rooms Really didn t like the underground rooms Really poor view and staff walks by the window The double rooms are lovely though , Great staff Very helpful Lovely double rooms with very comfortable beds and a great shower Great location 
72559,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room was a bit small and not enough space to move around The furniture in the room was a bit old , Excellent location for getting to tourist attractions and other places in central London We walked to Oxford Street Piccadilly Circus Trafalgar Square and London Eye Very close to underground stations and also Marylebone Train Station 
72560,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Very comfortable and purpose built designed rooms clean bathroom and very friendly and attentive staff Location is superb with fantastic links from Baker street and Marylebone stations 
72561,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room was small with limited space to put things No free shelving in wardrobe due to microwave fridge etc which were located inside wardrobe due to lack of space , The staff were very polite and helpful The location was good close to local facilities and the London Underground Hotel clean and tidy 
72562,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Excellent service from staff when checking in and checking out Located conveniently close to Baker Street station London Zoo Madam Tussauds shops restaurants 
72563,Park Avenue Baker Street, The reception weren t too helpful I ve gone several times to ask about the mail but they kept on dismissing me without even inquiring about my name or my room number I wasn t aware that the accommodation had no elevator so going up and down two stories floors wasn t something I prepared myself for , location is great a walking distance from Marlybone Station and Baker Street Marlyebone High Street is a walking distance from the hotel
72564,Park Avenue Baker Street, The breakfast was not good at all the cooked part worst scrambled eggs and baco ever , The bathroom itself and specially the hot floor and the shower 
72565,Park Avenue Baker Street, The rooms were actually across the road from the reception there were no lifts to get to the rooms and the staff were ill informed and not really able to answer any questions except really basic ones The cooked breakfast was not worth the money For example the sausages were obviously sitting there for hours , The location was good 
72566,Park Avenue Baker Street, Heating Poor heating slow to kick in fans and under floor didn t work Eventually got a heater which was good Didn t like being in a separate building to reception No lifts , Location was good good access to transport staff helped with problem I had during the stay Room small but good 
72567,Park Avenue Baker Street, The breakfast is really poor I strongly suggest you to walk a bit down the street to find nice and cheaper alternative No variety at all no fruits plastic bread an old coffee machine not even a coffee like of beverage everything is overcooked and not tasty Avoid taking your breakfast in the hotel , We ve got a very quiet room facing the backyard no view at all but it doesn t matter which was fantastic to sleep a little bit longer 
72568,Park Avenue Baker Street, Bright green light in room so didn t sleep well Breakfast underwhelming and coffee not great , Location friendly staff comfortable beds nice contemporary style 
72569,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Very helpful staff who made sure we could use a room to get changed after the journey A 20 min walk sees you in Oxford street so good location I enjoyed the full English breakfast will use this hotel again
72570,Park Avenue Baker Street, No lift so if you struggle with stairs ask for a room on the first floor , Great location literally 5 mins walk to both Marylebone and Baker Street stations Very helpful staff who looked after our bags until our room was ready Nice self service breakfast with good choice of hot or continental options Room was modern very clean and beds were comfortable All in all a perfect place for a short stay in the Capital 
72571,Park Avenue Baker Street, Really small room No elevator Expensive , Good location 15min walking from Marylebone centre Good bathroom and confy bed Friendly reception Good and free wifi service 
72572,Park Avenue Baker Street, Room not cleaned on the last night towels weren t changed The noise from other rooms in the morning we could hear people walking up stairs and outside rooms Bring earplugs if you life to sleep in , The staff were amazing very helpful I real liked the location of the hotel very close to everything I really enjoyed staying here The room was cute and cozy 
72573,Park Avenue Baker Street, Water only on arrival every night would be nice as there for a week, Amazing staff I left my bath robe they called me immediately and said they would keep it until my next stay Brilliant
72574,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Staff were very helpful I did not like my first room as it was in the basement and bit damp I asked them to move me to a higher floor and I got a good room
72575,Park Avenue Baker Street, The rooms were in a different building from reception and there was no way to contact reception from the room The shower was leaking and the bathroom flooded every time I had a shower, Comfortable bed Quiet rooms great location
72576,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room is on the basement next to the staff room and restaurant with little window and it became very noisy in the early morning when the staff start to work and people come for breakfast , very convinent location walking distance to marylebone high street mayfair regent park loads of bars restaurants around 
72577,Park Avenue Baker Street, Breakfast was a little expensive and breakfast facilities were not convenient but there were plenty places close by to get cheaper and just as good , Bed was really comfy Room was lovely and modern very clean Shower was amazing Large TV speedy Wifi fridge microwave in room which you don t really get in most hotels Plenty of facilities in the area such as pubs restaurants shops etc Really close to tube station for travel to anywhere in London 
72578,Park Avenue Baker Street, Not exactly a room with a view as it was in the basement of the hotel s extension away from the main building and reception desk I felt somewhat unsafe being in a building without any hotel personnel available specifically as the rooms are quite noisy and our neighbours started their own little party at 3 37 a m The windows could not be opened with makes it somewhat claustrofobic given the fact that the view was only a wall on 2 meter distance Really annoying however was the green light in the ceiling which could not be turned off as we were told it is for safety reasons but which lit up the entire room in green at night I know at least one person who would immediately leave this hotel for that reason , The location of the hotel is marvellous within short walking distance of Baker Street tube station Personnel friendly Our room was ok and clean beds good and with nice tasteful decoration Bathroom ok nice toiletries available Wifi worked great though no password required safe There were coffee and tea facilities and cookies on the house new every day For a hotel in this part of London with this service level the pricing is ok 
72579,Park Avenue Baker Street, Where do I start Could not get a shower Wouldn t fit in to it too small Staff didn t stop talking and very loudly through the night Room wasn t clean enough , The location and that s it 
72580,Park Avenue Baker Street, No lift Were on top floor and smell of bacon cooking made us feel sick from 7 30 a m , Shower room lovely Microwave fridge safe etc very good
72581,Park Avenue Baker Street, The stuff didn t want to offer the bill of the payment They told me that maybe it is possible to send it next days by email when I ve asked them to send it at my home adress in Italy they print the bill in 1 min ,No Positive
72582,Park Avenue Baker Street, Part of the property is across the road so breakfast each morning involved going outside and crossing the road , Fantastic location privacy quietness cleanliness Attentive helpful staff 
72583,Park Avenue Baker Street, Room really warm even with the a c on fully Green safety light on always which is brighter than the main lights in the room Had a big turnbine just out side our room which went off most of the night , Location is great
72584,Park Avenue Baker Street, Couldn t turn off a green emergency light in the ceiling which kept us awake all night , Really clean rooms Great value and location Friendly staff
72585,Park Avenue Baker Street, Room too small Shower although nice was not hot Every member of staff was foreign which is no problem just surprised that s all 7 staff we met , lication ideal
72586,Park Avenue Baker Street, One of the staff members was smoking right outside the door when I arrived not a major issue at all but didn t think very professional , Simple but really nicely done clean and modern with everything I needed Microwave was a helpful added bonus 
72587,Park Avenue Baker Street, Light on the smoke alarm was v bright Leaving the room with a green glow for the entire night which was frustrating Also our room on the ground floor appeared to be next to a staff only door Staff came and went all night with the banging of the door waking us up more than once Shower basin was blocked so couldn t showier for more than a minute without it filling up, Cosy room selection of cold drinks in the room Good wifi Very comfortable bed Great location 
72588,Park Avenue Baker Street, The only thing I wasn t keen on was having to cross the road to go and have our breakfast , Friendly helpful staff Excellent location clean we would stay there again 
72589,Park Avenue Baker Street, Could not fathom out how to use the plug in bathroom sink Had to cross street for breakfast not a problem on a fine day but if raining who wants to have breakfast while wearing wet clothes , Close to transport links Comfortable room made to feel welcome Bonus in the room was a microwave perfect for a late night snack 
72590,Park Avenue Baker Street, The only thing is the iron and ironing board Have to ask for it every day as not one in the room It is really old and not very good but it does the job to an extent , Have been staying at this hotel now for the past 18 months on each visit to London Whether it is for business or pleasure The staff are very friendly and helpful We are always greeted with a smile and nice to see you again The location for work it s only a short walk from Baker Street tube and it s only 3 stops from central London We always get the room we request each time 
72591,Park Avenue Baker Street, BREAKFAST HOT FOOD WAS COLD MACHINE COFFEE TERRIBLE PASTRIES WOULD BE BETTER IF ON A WARMER NOT WORTH THE EXTRA BETTER TO GO A LOCAL CAFE OR SUPERMARKET, ROOM SMALL BUT VERY CLEAN WITH GOOD LINEN LOCATION GOOD FOR TUBE SERVICES
72592,Park Avenue Baker Street, The room was very small and a little tight for 2 people The entrance of the hotel was opened in the evening and didn t feel secure as anyone could have walked in It is advertised as 4 stars and I am not convinced that it is Despite the fact that it is a lovely place it feels more like a guest house than an hotel for the way the place is set up and the feeling in the place I think it is worth highlighting that there is no elevator and the stair case is pretty narrow and steep Being young and fit I absolutely didn t mind but I was thinking of other people that might find it an issue A green emergency light in the room makes it impossible to sleep in the dark Last detail the shower was blocked and didn t close properly As a consequence you had to be extremely fast to not have the water running over the shower and soaking the place , The staff was very helpful The hotel is 5 min walk from a tube station and 5 min away via the underground to central London The place seemed recently refurbished 
72593,Park Avenue Baker Street, We started the trip with paying for the hotel we already had payed for because they didn t accept the payment because we couldn t show the card we had payed with The receptionist had a lack of generall knowledge about London and the tube system,No Positive
72594,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Ideally located for our visit to London It is not a large hotel but has most of the features and comforts that you might associate with a larger establishment 
72595,Park Avenue Baker Street, Room was in recently renovated town house opposite Hotel Stairs and no lift could be a problem if elderly , Good equipment in room Bathroom modern and very clean
72596,Park Avenue Baker Street, Stairs are narrow and the sound of guests walking up and down could be heard from my room Room was rather small but I know that to be common in UK , Provision of microwave fridge and tea coffee making facilities was a big plus Room also had a safe Room was very clean and shower toilet facilities were very good 
72597,Park Avenue Baker Street, Few little bits needed looking at cracked mirror panel on light fittings few scuffs on walls and few little stains on decor Fire alarm drill went off on Saturday morning twice despite the welcome pack stating it would be tested on Fridays , Lots of hidden extras like heated floors and cooking facilities which hadn t been mentioned in the booking Very quiet room Staff were helpful and friendly Lovely bathroom and room 
72598,Park Avenue Baker Street, We were farmed out across the road the room was very small the breakfast location was again across the road which was a nuisance staff wouldn t give us extra milk, The location
72599,Park Avenue Baker Street, Striped carpet Made it confusing at first going up and down Sounds silly but it did , Location was Great for Madame Tussauds and underground Also easy for uber taxi in to London 
72600,Park Avenue Baker Street,No Negative, Location was ideal for me as I had a family member in The London Clinic Single room was compact but had everything I needed and en suite was very good 
72601,Park Avenue Baker Street, I was in a basement room and it smelt a bit It was clean but there was a persistent smell of humidity Also from 4 AM onwards people coming in and out of neighbouring rooms and the kitchen and talking loudly shouting in the corridors made it impossible to sleep , The ladies in reception very nice both at check in and check out Same applies to the lady sorting out breakfast Breakfast is quite good too 
72602,Park Avenue Baker Street, I booked with yourselves three rooms only to find the same rooms the next day collectively 100 less This is a ridiculous system of booking which I will not be fooled by again ,No Positive
72603,Park Avenue Baker Street, Not really a bad experience but the hotel has narrow stairs In the other hand staff brings your luggage upstairs , Great location Staff was helpful Comfy room 
72604,Park Avenue Baker Street, A lift for luggage as we were on top floor 3rd , We had a nice quiet room V soundproof at the back for sensitive sleepers
