481400,Hotel Manin, Breakfast was a disappointment for us , The rooms were spacious and the decor was great The location of the hotel was very good not too close to the crowded areas and not too far to walk to the main attractions of Milan 
481401,Hotel Manin, No coment everything perfect, Perfect location for all needs Walking distance to shopping and dining district touristical places and 24 hr supermarket Lots of choice in breakfast menu In the park just next to the hotel lovely open air coffe shop where in the evening you can enjoy the glass off beer acompany life music Diffenetly come back to this property again and recomend it to my friends 
481402,Hotel Manin, Actually it was all good , Super friendly staff clean neat and upscale rooms very comfortable bed quiet Breakfast was also awesome great eggs meats bakery fruits and coffee classic Italian 
481403,Hotel Manin, Half an hour prior to closing the breakfast table there were no options left no bred no scrambled eggs no ham no warm milk no coffee no tea no yogurts The overall options were indeed very nice and diversified however the fact that three were no refills at least half an hour prior to the closing time was quite disappointing The 2 waiters seemed overwhelmed with the number of guests on the 2 mornings we were there Maybe more staff or a better separation to refill and withdraw dirty dishes from empty tables would cover that lapse , Staff at reception were very friendly and professional The room was very nicely decorated very quiet The black out blinds and very quiet air conditioning allow you to sleep in if you wish to 
481404,Hotel Manin, The attendant who first handled my complaint about the room was overly defensive and told me she would have to verify the smell in it first before offering us a new room in order to judge the pertinence of my complaint We were lucky the Manager overheard our exchange and intervened immediately offering us a different room without further verification , First room offered had a horrible smell of cleaning products Complained and requested a change of room After a not so helpful dialogue with an attendant at the desk my issue was handled by the Manager who efficiently and courteously gave us a nicer larger room with no smell Hotel is a great deal for the price well located with nice installations and efficient service Included breakfast was nice and on a sunny day can be taken in the hotel garden Later I was also able to verify the hotel also counts with an equally efficient Manager for their restaurant 
481405,Hotel Manin, We suffered with some mosquitos in the room and also i would advise maybe changing hair dryers as the button is really awkward to hold in , Staff and location were really good Breakfast was also fine plus we had dinner one evening which was also good service slightly slow but not an issue Room had all ammenities I would expect 
481406,Hotel Manin, Nothing, Excellent quality staff so helpful and efficient rooms well equipped and thought about and the beds are soooo comfy The hotel facilities are excellent too lots of places to sit and relax Breakfast area in the garden is lovely and the choice of food is outstanding Highly recommended 4 quality and above
481407,Hotel Manin, We ate at the hotel restaurant unexpectedly one evening as there had been a downpour The food was of poor quality and very expensive However when we complained the following day to the hotel staff they were quick to give us half the money back and the restaurant manager came to apologise It was a shame as the rest of our stay was brilliant , The staff were extremely helpful and smiley
481408,Hotel Manin, No supermarkets near by and the room could have been slightly bigger , Perfect location very close to the city center yet located in a quiet area Breakfast was fine but it could use more variety Subway station very close by and easy access from Malpenza airport 
481409,Hotel Manin,No Negative, Great location for short walk into centre or the shopping districts and by a park Very peaceful Lovely garden at back for breakfast and evening drinks 
481410,Hotel Manin, Not too much staff during breakfast time So sometime have to wait to order, The room was wonderful and very comfortable The breakfast is varied and with lot of options 
481411,Hotel Manin,No Negative, Booked for a night stay as there was a strike on Italian Railways and we couldn t get back to our hotel Centrally located nice garden to have breakfast quiet at night 
481412,Hotel Manin,No Negative, The locaton of the hotel is good it is right on the edge of the city centre easy walk to the Duomo or a few hundred metres to the nearest Metro The hotel staff were really helpful and friendly throughout our stay 
481413,Hotel Manin, Parking facility is damn expensive 35chf approx 300m from the hotel and no ready access to the car The parking is typical from 3rd world countries one car parked milimetres from the next Air conditioning broken in the whole hotel for many hours and when working not very efficient No drawers or shelves anywhere in the oh so fashion room not even a small shelf in the bathtub for the shampoo No hanger for the handtowel in the bathroom Tiny elevators Restaurant not good at all better stay away from it not worth it , Location
481414,Hotel Manin, The staff were extremely rude unhelpful and only interested in business people with extreme amounts of power and money just felt invisible At one point we waited over 40 mins to get a drink in the delightful gardens when we were the only people there The room we booked was supposed to have a balcony but it didn t it was also supposed to have a bath but it didn t So overall although the hotel area was quiet and well situated we would not go back to this hotel as were very disappointed , About the only thing we liked was the comfortable beds and air conditioning 
481415,Hotel Manin,No Negative, The hotel is not in the centre of the turistic city centre t is a quiet area than the center and close to almost every point that you might go Both by walking and by metro t is very neat and clean and has a very nice garden Brekfast was also very nice and fresh So we advice Hotel Manin Milano 
481416,Hotel Manin, 50 00 charge per Extra person per room Our Wives No one explained to us when we checked in that the air conditioning would not work if the window was cracked open to cool off a very warm room when we checked in , We were charged 50 per an extra person because the hotel stated we only made a reservation for 1 person per room The room had a king sized bed My wife was the second person as was the wife of Will Collins in the second room This seems unfair I did not realize that we had to list both people our wives for this reservation 
481417,Hotel Manin, Nothing everything was perfect I will go back there soon and I will send people , The hotel itself is fantanstic modern elegant and super clean It has a delicious garden with a beautiful and excellent bar Rooms are spacious clean airy with big windows silent and bed super comfortable Staff is AMAZING particularly Francesco Salvatore Walking distance from centre Brera and Armani Bar Breakfast excellent and the service STAR 
481418,Hotel Manin, Breakfast needs improvement coffee in pots on warmers poor quality especially for Italy Service staff just okay no smiles friendliness except for headwaiter welcome person There was what it looked like a bearded Manager around unfriendly no smiles When it came to paying for parking seperate from hotel bill the valet person again not friendly tried to tell me my credit card did not work but I insisted and ALL OVER SUDDEN my credit card worked Looked to me as he was just trying to get CASH from me possible theft from garage operating company , Room excellent bed kind of small Location excellent Front Desk fine could be a little more friendly more 
481419,Hotel Manin, Room was too small Breakfast had limited options Parking issues, The top floor rooms seems to be renovated and give a modern touch Ideal location to move around 
481420,Hotel Manin, Hot breakfast option Maybe a bit more variety Saying that so many choices of everything else Couldn t fault it, Staff facilities location all thumps up Highly recommended
481421,Hotel Manin, You can clearly hear people walking outside your room and anytime someone is flushing their toilet or moving their luggage or room furniture the boos e is as if it s right over your head exposed piping in the ceiling bathroom Pillows are too high and not soft enough Poor sound insulation Every time someone goes out to trow a bag full of glass bottles they might as well throw it into your bedroom ,No Positive
481422,Hotel Manin, We booked a room for two and we Must have done something wrong because at the end it stated only for one I would have NEVER booked in this Hotel because the Price is a Slam in the face for a sole guest The Price offered is okay for two People This Hotel is Not a 4star nor should it sell tself as such , The breakfast
481423,Hotel Manin, The room and the bathroom would need a little lifting up Partly old fashioned as it is Still clean and confortable enough The traffic made some noise even at night Our room was giving to the park and the street The view was nice , Exellent location Friendly service at the hotel Lobby and the terracegarden were stylish Breakfast was good 
481424,Hotel Manin, Early closing time of buffet breakfast 10am usually other hotels open till 11 am Dinner restaurant food was extremley bad Food was tastless and limited choices in the menu Bath tubs should be replaced or have an alternative with a shower box, Hospitality of the breakfast staff The garden
481425,Hotel Manin, Superior double room was outdated and especially bathroom appliances However single room where our daughter stayed was totally renovated and updated , Room size location Stuff is friendly and very helpful
481426,Hotel Manin, I booked a room for 2 nights for my partner and myself I made sure to point it out on the reservation and put both names there I even called the hotel a few days before to confirm Upon arriving i was told i had to pay an extra 70 per night because this was a room for 1 That was very disappointing To have to pay that much extra money i could have spent somewhere else for a surprise week end with my wife to be Very disappointing to have been misled like this , Very nice hotel Very convenient location Great staff 
481427,Hotel Manin, Little things here and there could be improved Shower was a bit old and needed an update Coffee in the room but only decaf Elevator was extremely small And even though we put the towels on the floor they still hung them back up on the racks so they were wet the next day Also even though we requested an iron they never brought one , The staff were quite helpful and the breakfast was nice Location is excellent right next to a very nice park 
481428,Hotel Manin, No air conditioning and hot having the windows open meant I woke up at 1 30 from mosquito buzzing in my ear , Beautiful modern interiors and luxurious accommodations 
481429,Hotel Manin, Small room but it was a single so maybe I shouldn t have expected more , Quiet hotel at least in March with more than adequate facilities for business travel Nice location opposite a park and with a metro station only two stops from the Duomo in the road immediately behind Has a restaurant and garden 
481430,Hotel Manin, Nothing, The hotel has charming and peaceful atmosphere The staff always friendly and helpful Garden It s a piece of art At the end of the day sitting there with glass of something make wonder Location just bingo 
481431,Hotel Manin, Booked this hotel for the outside bar which wasn t open Room was smaller than expected and the bathroom was separated from the bedroom by a glass wall which was very awkward, Great location
481432,Hotel Manin, The bathroom has very thin ceiling whenever the room above uses water it s very loud , Comfortable room with balcony Breakfast was very good with various fruit savory choices 
481433,Hotel Manin,No Negative, Very clean and comfortable Helpful staff Great breakfast Fairly close walk to center of the city Get hotel to stay at if you have a pet as there is a park right across the street 
481434,Hotel Manin, Nothing interesting about the rooms rather functional , The location is near perfect for getting around the city and it s set in a quiet back street The breakfast was very nice and the room it s served in would be lovely in the summer with an outside courtyard area 
481435,Hotel Manin, The breakfast options are limited and it starts at 7am Starting at 6 30 would be better as sometimes I have to leave the hotel early to catch a flight , The staff are always lovely and very helpful As I always stay here when I am in Milan for work I was upgraded to the room with the park view 
481436,Hotel Manin,No Negative, I decided at the last minute to stay in a hotel in Milano rather than continuing my long delayed journey which began in New York The hotel was immaculate I was able to check in early La zuppa della nonna was great and the room spacious And an easy trip to the train station the next morning 
481437,Hotel Manin, Do not buy Scala tickets from the front office It would cost you a fortune and your places could be so bad that you will be obliged to leave the show not having even enough space to stand up to see the stage Waste of money waste of time , the room with the parc view the excellent breakfast proximity to the center and of course Ms Ylana smiling face and warm welcome 
481438,Hotel Manin, 2 single beds when double room booked Ruined an otherwise brilliant stay, Excellent location brilliant staff and nice breakfast Quality of room was lovely but booked double room and received 2 single beds very disappointing
481439,Hotel Manin, Nothing, Feel like in a 5 star hotel I liked the staff very kind and polite Very good breakfast great rooms good location walking distance to Duomo The park across the road is beautiful We loved everything 
481440,Hotel Manin, Complimentary water would have been nice Neighbouring room noisy but nothing the hotel could do about that No other complaints, Great location convenient for almost everything Good breakfast selection and comfortable beds Red tourist bus route is virtually directly outside the hotel Convenient also for Milano Centrale station approx 7 by taxi 
481441,Hotel Manin, Nothing I didn t like , The hotel was very good in a great location close to the city centre but peaceful The staff were excellent and very helpful would recommend this hotel to anyone 
481442,Hotel Manin, None, Perfect location within walking distance from most attractions and city center nice and generous breakfast buffet nice view from a renovated nice room Most of all reservation manager a nice lady was listening to a problem and fixed it beyond my expectations 
481443,Hotel Manin, Accesories in the room the bathhroom were not replaced every day also bag of black tea I could hear everything from upper room and bathroom toilet flushing shower , Lobby restaurant and outside bar design was very good japan like style Staff at breakfast was very polite and kind Room was small but clean and bathroom was fine Lokation near the park but near old center and popular neighborhoods is exellent I walked the distance between central train station and hotel 
481444,Hotel Manin, Pity they dont have a pool or a sauna jacuzzi, Fantastic silent air conditioning new well styled room Real panoramic TV although I didn t use it Wonderful internal garden Great quality of breakfast for an italian hotel where normally american breakfast is somehow poor 
481445,Hotel Manin, Breakfast Not good and poor bread selection Hot breakfast not good Poor cold selection no salami 3 days exactly the same breakfast, Kind staff Comfortable bed
481446,Hotel Manin, The breakfast while vast didn t cater to people who do not eat pork or beef The mattress itself was not the most comfortable , The hotel itself is in a great part of the city where it is just outside the really expensive centre but very close to an excellent reknown shopping area The proximity to metro stopTurati and the City Sightseeing Hop on Hop off Bus were pluses The food was great and the staff was very knowledgeable helpful and friendly 
481447,Hotel Manin, Our room 101 was above a large entry garage and at 7 in the morning they start rolling things in and outside Which was loud and not so amusant being on a holiday Lucky for us we only wanted to sleep a bit langer on one day of our 3 night stay , The room was nice big and very clean What I liked most was the breakfast buffet There was plenty of choice for everyone The staff was always friendly and helpful The hotel was good located next to a nice park 
481448,Hotel Manin, Restaurant could be better however breakfast was great but there are lots of great options nearby , Comfortable rooms and friendly staff we booked a meeting room as well the hotel staff were extremely helpful with everything The hotel is near a nice park great for running Good location 
481449,Hotel Manin, Restaurant closed Saturday evening and this was not mentioned on info pack, Lovely staff great breakfast great location opposite park and about 10 15mins walk along nice road into centre Sightseeing bus stop right outside 
481450,Hotel Manin, That I could not stay longer and continue to enjoy your hospitality , I have been coming to the Manin for over 50 years and love the hotel owners and management I am so impressed with the renovations and the excellent use of the garden Easy walking to the city center 
481451,Hotel Manin, Staff where ordinary service seemed a bit of a chore Maybe more a business hotel , Room was very good clean spacious kettle with tea coffee in room good shower breakfast excellent 
481452,Hotel Manin, Small rooms tred furniture and unconfirtabke pillows 12 15 minutes walk to the Dumo , Staff were very helpful and the breakfast was decent Facing a park but could get noisy sometimes 
481453,Hotel Manin, The breakfast is not bad but it could be better , We stayed in a park view room with a cute balcony to which they upgraded at our second night stay upon our request The front office manager was really helpful When last night we came back to our room there was a bottle of prosecco and snacks on table which they ve organized for my mum s birthday It was a really nice gesture The location is excellent It takes apr 10 minutes walk to Via Montenapoleone and to other nice streets 
481454,Hotel Manin,No Negative, Four stars hotel but feels like 5 Great stuff thanks to Mariya and the others ofcourse Good breakfast good rooms good location We loved everything 
481455,Hotel Manin, Zero insolation You can hear when next door guest is using a bathroom or talking on the phone The ceilings in the hall and bathroom have a designer fence element through which you can see all communications and sometimes it leaked a drop here and there Most likely condensation Chairs and coffee table on the balcony were impossible to use dirty Very simple breakfast , Good location Rather clean bathroom Friendly staff pleasant rooms nice comfortable beds 
481456,Hotel Manin, Nothing, Wonderfully located furnished and organised hotel The park across the road is beautiful and the hotel is easy walking distance to the metro and very interesting parts of Milan Very friendly helpful staff Restaurant is very good quality and breakfasts also very good Would definitely come again 
481457,Hotel Manin, Rooms are quite small and compact for single but minor issue They didn t replace my tea but they are forgiven this time , Very nice helpful and friendly staff overall Clean and lux hotel with a pretty private garden area Peaceful area hotel next to park which is great for walking Comfortable room with kettle for tea which was perfect for rainy days in Milan when I was there Walking distance to Duomo or metro if needed 
481458,Hotel Manin, Breakfast orange juice , Refurbished room excellent bathroom comfortable bed Excellent front office manager and staff Good breakfast choices Top location 
481459,Hotel Manin, Staff check in behaviour very good Staff check out behaviour not so good There was no dish washer TV Channels were only Spanish ones limited no international, Good Location simple useful decoration very comfortable
481460,Hotel Manin, Breakfast, A bit too expensive altogether but nearby center 20 minutes walk to several other touristic locations and railway station peaceful across the nice park 
481461,Hotel Manin, The AC wasn t allowed to be on Italian Law , Staff was really nice and helpful Location is great to walk everywhere Rooms are clean and comfortable
481462,Hotel Manin, I could hear everything that was happening in the room next to me all the man s conversations him using the bathroom his phone ringing , The location was great 
481463,Hotel Manin, I was charged for breakfast and I never attended it I am waiting for the hotel to respond to the extra charges made , The hotel and staff were very accommodating
481464,Hotel Manin, Not much in fact If I try to find one I would go with more helpful staff But even that was reasonable , Breakfast was reasonable Room and bathroom was clean enough Location was also very close to city center I would choose this hotel for my next visit as well 
481465,Hotel Manin,No Negative, Staff on reception went out of their way to collect the car we had parked down the road and very helpful Hotel was located just down the road from the centre and on a main line for tram stop 
481466,Hotel Manin, I didn t like the rubber sheet on the bed it should have had a cotton mattress cover on top it made the bed sheet slide My room was very hot and there was no air conditioning working to cool it down , All good
481467,Hotel Manin, Bad joke accomodation for over 200 per night Old furniture smelly blanket After asking for change there was no change Parking 30 per day Definitely no 4 hotel Maybe 2 3 in Europe scale , good location breakfast ok very helful stuff
481468,Hotel Manin, The bench at the foot of the bed had very sharp corners I was terrified of banging a knee on a sharp corner in the middle of the night , We liked the location near Piazza Cavour which is just outside the Centro Storico The hotel is across from a public park which lends an air of tranquility which we appreciate at the end of a busy day of sightseeing and shopping La Scala Il Duomo La Pinacoteca di Brera and of course the Quadrilateral di Moda are all within easy walking distance The breakfast buffet is on the back side of the hotel facing a tranquil garden 
481469,Hotel Manin, Manager charged for one night extra for using the room for 3 hours extra The room on the hotel s website is 50Euro cheaper than booking com, Nothing at all The staff is rude wanting to make extra money by charging clients more than required
481470,Hotel Manin, As I return client I did not find the staff so friendly at reception Disappointing, Light bright room with lovely park view Complimentary water is great Generous breakfast 
481471,Hotel Manin, Disappointing to see better rates than ours on booking com for several days before our arrival Despite the fact that we could have cancelled our bookings and rebooked for a good saving we did not Next time we would do this Booking ahead I do not expect to pay higher rates especially when I have free cancellation , Friendly and welcoming front desk and concierge assistance Great rooms despite being a little small Good location for a variety of destinations Extremely clean tidy with good decor
481472,Hotel Manin, There was no halal food in the breakfast bar There were not many choices on the bar , I liked the room design I liked the staff they were so kind and polite
481473,Hotel Manin, I had booked a superior room facing the park Huge mistake Constant street traffic noise all through the night Early morning garbage trucks making a lot of noise as well this led to a sleepless nite Rooms also very small Breakfast also very basic and sparse , Staff helped in changing rooms on day 2 but it was to a lower category and smaller room facing the back quieter side of the hotel No refund was possible on the superior room rate charge that i had paid Although a complimentary bottle was given 
481474,Hotel Manin, One of the employer sold me ticket to La scale and inflated the price from 50 to 150 I did not know until I saw the ticket I did not expect a reputable hotel will get involved in this sculpting unlawful business , I like the location the size of the room and the breakfast Not enough drawers to store cloth
481475,Hotel Manin, The only problem of this nice hotel is the acustic among the bedroom aside and the upstairs bedroom You listen to every noise the other guests produce And they should change the windows to acoustic ones since until 11pm there s a lot of traffic on Via Manin , Comfort nice staff cleaning well preserved rooms beautiful view very close to Via della Spiga and Via Manzoni walking distance from Brera 
481476,Hotel Manin, the room was small and noisy you can hear people talk from other rooms and flush their toilets, the location was good very close to duomo breakfast was good
481477,Hotel Manin, The only problem is the parking Garage available but very expensive , Hotel Manin is a very convenient place to stay for its modern clean rooms central location professional staff nice breakfast buffet Brera Area Duomo nice restaurants in short walking distance The nearby park is excellent for jogging and strolling 
481478,Hotel Manin, We had to wait for breakfast extending breakfast until 11am would be nice especially during the weekend , Good location friendly staff nice view from the room 
481479,Hotel Manin, Female staff can be difficult Room looks old and outdated Far from everything be prepared to walk lots Just another overpriced hotel with fake reviews , Not much an overrated hotel maybe once it was a jewel but not now Breakfast was good 
481480,Hotel Manin, Poor staff service should have better training and learn how to smile Didnt introduce the hotel facility to me Breakfast staffs were rude , Room is nice big and spacious Location is okay
481481,Hotel Manin, Worst night ever in Milan i had AC was not working and we had to open windows to get some cold After it we got bitten as never happened in Asia by mosquitoes and it was impossible to fall a sleep again As well in this totally NOT 4 hotel this hotel is Asian 3 you should go downstairs by your own to pick up a dental kit room with a view to some house not to the park as it was in overview NOT recommended , Location
481482,Hotel Manin, The noise from the waterpipes in the walls is really load If somebody flushes or showers you hear this very well This effects comfort for sleeping and working , Location beatifull bathroom facilities bath and breakfast
481483,Hotel Manin, The lady on reception was the only person who didn t quite match up to the others She responded to us others in a rather abrupt and unhelpful manner , Very nice staff throughout the hotel who made every effort to help us during our stay Lovely rooms some with a balcony over the park Great location near the fashion area perfect for walking to all the important places 
481484,Hotel Manin, Nothing All hotels get a bit more expensive when the Formula 1 is in town , Central location to Milan Not far walk from central railway station either 
481485,Hotel Manin, It is a little loud within the hotel You can hear hair dryers and other people in their rooms , Simple clean and comfortable room Good Wifi and TV Breakfast and staff were excellent 
481486,Hotel Manin, The bathroom was dark Couldn t put makeup on because the lighting was incorrect Had to put it on in front of the window because there was some light , The room was clean and the bed was comfortable There were no drawers but lots of shelves Good breakfast buffet 
481487,Hotel Manin, I was promised to get a refund of about 200 euro into my account because i did not get the room a reserved however i still have not receive anything yet as they wouldn t let me get it in cash, Location is about 10 minutes walking distance from the dumo which created a nice walk for us Friendly stuff
481488,Hotel Manin, The small shower screen makes for an accident waiting to happen with water from the shower saturating the floor so bad that it has damaged the bottom of the wooden bathroom door , The view from my room across the balcony
481489,Hotel Manin, Unfriendly staff I arrived at the hotel at 14 45 and my room was not ready Had to wait 40 minutes On the second day I went to the room at 17 00 and it was not cleaned I had to ask dor it Internet is very poor This is not a four star hotel , Location is not that bad
