95969,The Hari London,No Negative, What A refreshing experience I am used to drab five star hotels in London and on arrival here it was the absolute wow factor from minute one I would put it up there as one of my best ever Hotel experiences in my many years of travel and would highly recommend it as the only hotel to stay at in London 
95970,The Hari London, Found blood stain in bed duvet which is irresponsible by management team and house keeping AC not working properly and capped at 22 degrees cannot go lower which I was sweating at night Location is very far from soho regent and oxfords , Nice rooms and bed Staff were nice Nice room service 
95971,The Hari London, Room was a little small and overlooked from across street Better on upper floors Air conditioning was either too cold or off despite attempts to adjust it and there were no written instructions Not possible to have bedside reading lights on individually either both on or off , Belgravia location excellent and quiet despite being so close to the shops and attractions of central London Staff very friendly Very comfortable bed Good bar that had plenty of activity but never too full Hotel was small but better for it 
95972,The Hari London, The breakfast buffet could be better Things like butter soy milk fresh whole fruit and healthy mueslis were missing , The atmosphere of the hotel was very good Things were efficient but in a slightly bohemian way A great combination 
95973,The Hari London,No Negative, We received a warm welcome upon our arrival This hotel is located in a nice area within walking distance to Harrods and the Hyde park Staff were exceptional very professional yet friendly and helpful The ability to take the hotel bikes was so great as we felt safe to bike to Hyde park from the hotel and back Great way to see the the whole of Hyde park The bar service was excellent 
95974,The Hari London, The bed were too hard for me but the hotel manager quickly fixed the mattress stiffness problem by adding a thin mattress on top It worked , Very nice cosy place Well located Staff was always super helpful 
95975,The Hari London, Nothing, The service was second to none The best service levels I hve seen in a long time All staff with no exceptions was outstanding Fantastic hotel 
95976,The Hari London, Nothing , The staff were very friendly and helpful The room is not big but not small by London standard either It s a little far away from any tube station but a very pleasant walk along the high fashion Sloan Street as long as the weather is not too bad Seems always some taxi waiting at the gate so not a problem at all for those don t plan to use public transportation Walking distance to some of the A list museums 
95977,The Hari London,No Negative, The airconditioning broke and within 30 minutes we were provided with a new room and an unpgrade into a suite The staff and especially the night manager were extremely friendly and helpful 
95978,The Hari London, Water in shower did not drain away properly and standing in cold water from the night before was unpleasant The shaving mirror is required on the dressing table when drying hair as there is no vanity mirror in reach of power sockets for the hair dryer Would have liked some real coffee in the room without requesting room service Its a new hotel and I am sure these teething problems will get sorted out quickly , Lovely quiet oasis just off Sloane Square Very friendly and helpful staff Fabulous atmosphere and very restful We would be happy to return to the Hari given the opportunity 
95979,The Hari London,No Negative, The staff at the Hari were incredible I traveled from California to London to celebrate graduating from a master s program It was a much needed vacation and everyone at the Hari made the trip as fabulous as I envisioned it to be 
95980,The Hari London, Unfortunately due to the heavy rain earlier the balcony roof was dripping a bit , Very friendly staff Room service menu was delicious Gorgeous shower bathroom Comfy room bed with sofa balconette area
95981,The Hari London, the breakfast which we found a little poor for such a hotel and price Continental Breakfast for 20 00 Pounds No cups for the egg no spoon horn for the egg no butter on the buffet or table we had to ask for and the filtered coffee was not filtered coffee We had the coffe ground in the cup and it did not taste at all We recommend the place nearby 5 min walk called L eto its Russian and means Summmer and serves fantastic breakfast , the room the view to the Chesham Place Garden
95982,The Hari London, Nothing , An absolutely faultless 2 day stay in a quiet Belgravia location close to Sloane street Harrods and Hyde Park Amazing customer service from the Hari Hotel team who do everything to go the extra mile for their customers 
95983,The Hari London, The breakfast is ok nothing special The fitness room is super small , Relatively new hotel in Belgravia upscale and quiet location There a few good restaurants in the area and many amazing shops The room was spacious and comfortable bed is nice and large Had a cocktail in the bar and it was really good The vibe in the bar is cool also people from outside are visiting I like the design of the hotel a lot it is modern and warm at the same time Definitely a good hotel would recommend and stay again 
95984,The Hari London,No Negative, The staff were very courteous and professional in dealing with a slight hiccup at check in the room was not ready Their excellent customer service more than made up for the slight delay Room very comfortable with pleasant view to the square in front of the hotel Conveniently located for the Chelsea Flower Show and underground stations Sloane Sq and Knightsbridge 
95985,The Hari London, The breakfast was of high quality and in general had everything we need only we would have loved to see fresh vegetables at breakfast as well , The staff is outstanding friendly and helpful the rooms are very clean and the restaurant has excellent food and service staff The even came up with a off the card offer of a mixed grill fish which was excellent It is close to Hyde Park and Harrods as well as to public transport to get to the center The hotel is absolutely worth its price We will recommend this hotel and be back ourselves 
95986,The Hari London,No Negative, Fantastic location in Belgravia We went to the Chelsea Flower Show from the hotel and it was the perfect distance allowing a nice walk through the lovely streets nearby Staff were also very helpful 
95987,The Hari London,No Negative, The attention to details is impeccable I love when ART is appreciated and goes hand in hand with the design Beautiful interiors and creative facade Highly recommended 
95988,The Hari London, we check in at 12 o clock but they let us to enter the room only at 16 o clock it was rather unpleasant the breakfast is too expensive comparison to what you can get there , the location is good not far from the center the nearest underground station is at 12 minutes of walking 
95989,The Hari London, We had one of the tiniest rooms in the hotel for the first night and it felt like we were being over sold on its appropriateness since it was at the top of the hotel and had a great view But we couldn t swing a cat in the there let alone find a place to open our suitcases Luckily we were able to get a different room for the rest of our stay and they provided us a complimentary breakfast to compensate for our discomfort The hotel restaurant prices were higher than we have experienced elsewhere in London The staff were always polite and available but maybe a little over the top sometimes It was hard to have some anonymity privacy as guests Inconsistent turn down service which was to be daily , Lovely hotel overall well maintained good location and personable staff 
95990,The Hari London, nothing everything about this hotel is perfect , excellent intelligent and amazing staff clean rooms and facilities great views proximity to points of interest 
95991,The Hari London,No Negative, Check in was fast staff are friendly location is perfect and love the lounge Love everything about The Hari from the atmosphere scenery to the friendly staff 
95992,The Hari London,No Negative, Small but very well equipt rooms everything needed was there Lovely staff super service minded who gave excellent service Nice restaurants in the area Will come back 
95993,The Hari London,No Negative, The staff went above and beyond to accommodate all of our needs during the stay The room was lovely the staff friendly and the location perfect for a romantic easter break 
95994,The Hari London, I was off to a bad start with one of the staff at the reception but the problem was dealt with in no time , Staff goes above and beyond to rectify any issues and make your stay pleasurable and memorable which was something I highly appreciated Rooms are nice clean and comfortable albeit small but that wasn t a major issue The staff was unbelievably friendly and polite and made us feel at home 
95995,The Hari London, The room was small and only one bottle of water per person per day the elevator was sooo small, I liked that they have concocted rooms the rooms was clean nice location the food was amazing
95996,The Hari London, The room was little bit small Its good for 1 person not more , I would like to send special thanks to Alin he was so helpful when i was checking out He even helped me to pack my last min things and offered me water when am about to get into the car He was so friendly and polite Thank you very much 
95997,The Hari London, Size if the room but not big issue , Decoration of the room and the style of the hotel it self the staff very frindlly and they are looking for the small deatiles house keeping is fantastic and room view was excellent staff will help you specially the staff on the main entrance
95998,The Hari London,No Negative, Everything was fantastic from the friendliness professionalism helpfulness of the staff to the cleanliness and comfort of the room and location 
95999,The Hari London, Nothing, I traveled with my 12 year old son We both felt so welcome and the staff helped us with our questions and requests Their care and service put a silver lining on our stay 
96000,The Hari London, room size is very small its usual for London however not for 5 stars stranded, the design and staff are very attention to all details room service is very fast early check in was offered with out request 
96001,The Hari London, Our room was opposite the storage cupboard on the 9th floor which made it quite noisy with staff accessing it all the time , Staff were very friendly and helpful with excellent attention to detail 
96002,The Hari London, The room was on the small side and despite asking for a quiet room I seemed to either be on a rather noisy corridor lots of door banging and loud conversations or the hotel is not very well sound proofed generally I think other hotels are better value , The breakfast was very good as was the service generally
96003,The Hari London, I couldn t complain about anything They really made the trip luxurious Would be nice to decrease the pricing but its totally worth what you pay for , Everything in the hotel was very high quality Completely loved using the little gym that they had The coffee was great and the breakfast porridge was even better The rooms are amazing not too big but still big for London standards My favorite was the shower Very high quality and even the beds are big and comfortable Staff are always super friendly and really it made my stay in London so much better than the usual The area is great very nice walk to Sloane Square Knightsbridge and even vauxhall station kings road etc 
96004,The Hari London, Fresh orange juice for breakfast would have been nice in such a good restaurant , Staff were most helpful and kind and made the stay very personal Great location Beautiful decor throughout the hotel 
96005,The Hari London, The smart phone idea was great but the choice of handset made it difficult to navigate , Beautiful understated interior with a masculine feel Very comfortable bed Nice bathroom Bay window with sofa
96006,The Hari London, The room was a bit on the small size I went down to the lounge on the 1st floor one evening to meet some friends where I was told beforehand that hotel guests were given priority I had called earlier to reserve a table and was told it was not necessary but that was not the case and the tables available were horrible , A tastefully decorated boutique hotel with a lot of attention to small details the number of international sockets for ex I was greeted with a warm welcome by the friendly attentive staff the location is very convenient just off sloan street and whenever I took an uber to get anywhere else it cost me a reasonable 6 7 
96007,The Hari London, Breakfast is quite basic and service in the morning is really bad and too slow Bedrooms of the Junior Suite are very small My Suite didn t corresponded to the photo of the room presented and duly confirmed to me by Booking com I am now more than convinced that in general hotels working with Booking com are allowing their lowest quality rooms to the Booking com guests , Design in general is quite modern Conciergerie and reception employees are in general efficient with a special mention to the two kind employees at the entrance very efficient and caring with their guests 
96008,The Hari London, Some noise from the street, When you walk into The Hari hotel you dont feel you are coming home because that comes with obligations Making dinner washing clothes etc The Hari hotel is more like a coming home to a good friend Warm smiles and behavior that realy shows they would like to take care of you and not an artificial smile that only care for you tip Design wise you got an feeling coming into Harrods 3rd floor luxury furniture department The rooms are big and spotless clean and the location is suberb if you like fine dining in Belgrave district and high end shopping in Sloan street and Harrods in the neighbourhood If you fancy a walk in the park you are only 5 minutes from Hyde Park 
96009,The Hari London,No Negative, Both facilities and staff are fantastic Special thanks to Alex Cohen Front Desk Manager and the amazing reception team for organizing a wonderful welcome and stay with my son Also a big Thank you to Violetta concierge for all the trouble she went scheduling and rescheduling my wishes always with a big smile Finally as always a big thank you to everyone at the bar and terrace who are continuously fantastic 
96010,The Hari London, Noise could hear our neighbours talking and moving about their room , Lovely welcome from Joanna and team fantastic attention to detail went above and beyond to make our stay perfect Room and bed were very comfortable and decor was beautiful 
96011,The Hari London, The isolation of the windows was bad the room kept on cooling down and the curtain was broken We were expecting a slightly bigger room , The staff was very competent and smily the room always clean and the water bottles with the chocolats given at the end of the day were highly appreciated The phone with 3G was and excellent tool and the bed was extremely comfortable 
96012,The Hari London, None, Excellent personal approach of the super friendly staff After visiting the Shard we came back to the hotel room and found a cake modeled in the shape of the tower Doorman Alin was very helpfull and gave us the complementary hotel bikes
96013,The Hari London, Wifi keeps disconnecting large bed is actually 2 twins brought together and topped with a mattress so quite uncomfortable especially in the middle, Great location very attentive and friendly staff cleanliness and great value for the money
96014,The Hari London, Breakfast is served is a bar so the tables are not convenient And I would say that breakfast itself is rather expensive and limited , The location of the hotel is very good about 5 min walk from metro Close to Harrods and Hyde park We had just a regular room and it seemed a bit small but it s typical for London They have a charger in the room for all kinds of sockets So no need to buy an adapter They prepare room for the night leaving small sweet things 
96015,The Hari London,No Negative, Fabulous Staff in all departments Exceptional Friendly Service Personal cosy and tasteful design lighting with a superb outdoor vine covered patio 
96016,The Hari London,No Negative, I always enjoy staying at this hotel but I had quite special stay this time The staff were very friendly and helpful The room was always clean and the bed was extremely comfortable 
96017,The Hari London, Water delivery at night every time we were in the room Why not putting it in the room whilst we were away Felt a bit disturbed in the privacy, Comfortable bed
96018,The Hari London, I didn t really enjoy the breakfast , Brilliant service all their staffs are very helpful friendly and patient I was very happy with their room service and front desk service I had tried a lot of 5 stars hotels in London Hari s service is the best I experienced ever I definitely would wish to choose Hari again 
96019,The Hari London, The only thing I can say is that it isn t a cheap stay but completely worth it , Let me put it this way there isn t anything I didn t like about the property Apart from it being slightly pricey I didn t mind paying due to the hospitality service location the layout of the hotel It s small but yet luxurious and extremely comfortable You never wait in line it s almost a private stay because no body bothers you The staff are extremely helpful and pay attention to detail I felt very comfortable and bed is heaven so comfortable I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to explore London because it s perfectly located near the main attractions Walking distance to harrods and Hyde park The tube was only 5 mins away anyways There are loads of restaurants and Shisha places near the hotel as well Don t take a taxi with the taxi that was expensive they wanted to charge me 60 and I took an Uber which cost me 29 So definitely take an Uber Also an Uber to Soho and Oxford street cost me around 5 6 which isn t a lot at all especially if it s raining 
96020,The Hari London, 2 VERY minor cleanliness maintenance housekeeping issues were dealt with swiftly and pleasantly , The location was perfect a little off the beaten track in a quiet neighbourhood but with only very short walks to major transport hubs shopping and restaurants Service from the Doorman to Management was faultless The house keeping issues referred to as negatives were compensated with a chocolate tray and handwritten note of apology nice touch 
96021,The Hari London, Christmas lunch was a bit of a let down both the food and atmosphere but probably our fault for not booking somewhere well in advance , The staff were very friendly with a great location just 5 minutes from Harrods and the great shops of Knightsbridge 
96022,The Hari London, rooms could be a bit bigger corridors a bit wider then again it s a city hotel and in london space is scarce, excellent location friendly and helpful staff stylish venue and rooms well equipped
96023,The Hari London, Breakfast was a bit too expensive , It s been absolutely outstanding and the staff did so many extra things for us incredible I ve never experienced such dedicated staff going beyond anything to make us feel super comfortable 
96024,The Hari London, The rooms are a bit too tight my luggage were too big for the rooms , The ambience and feel of the hotel very cozy The smell of the reception area when you first enter is amazing Will definitely be coming back 
96025,The Hari London, The hotel bar attracts too many non hotel residents that come daily which makes it difficult to find a place to sit and who are mostly young men from the UAE, Cosy very nice design and friendly staff
96026,The Hari London, Not much to complain about Price but one shouldn t expect good value to price in London anyhow , Compared to other London hotels their rooms are spacey and modern Especially loved the couch by the window 
96027,The Hari London, king superior is a misnomer the rooms are too tiny for 2 people staff was so amazingly helpful and changed us to another room of course with additional fee but at least our week end wasn t ruined, the bartender in the bar upstairs makes great drinks and was so nice staff in dining room were so nice front desk staff were so nice great location we enjoyed our stay
96028,The Hari London, The staff were overwhelmed there was not enough staff therefore the room service took longer the elevators were busy with doormen trying to bring down the luggage And the staff were not well enough experienced in terms of general 5 star service, Location and the fact that they are dog friendly 
96029,The Hari London, The room is too too too small the smallest room I ve ever been to, The service they are amazing whenever I order anything few seconds and it s in room
96030,The Hari London, I like everything , The staff is the friendliest I have encountered in a hotel Highly detailed highly effecient and extremely warm and personable The Belgraves makes you feel like you are returning home 
96031,The Hari London,No Negative, I am a regular customer in Belgrades Thomson hotel and to me it s one of the top hotels in London I found the staff very smooth in terms of customer service I did recommend this hotel to many of my friends and family Why don t you start giving customers something as a loyalty card or special rates for regular customers 
96032,The Hari London,No Negative, Excellent restaurant except morning buffet with pressed juices stylish beautiful hotel design with clean modern yet very comfortable rooms and common areas professional friendly helpful staff and excellent service all around comfortable bed and bedding my favorite was the lovely marble bathroom with a large bathtub for soaking room with tub is upon request 
96033,The Hari London, The bar and terrace were booked out most evenings for functions and could not be accessed by guests This is the reason I didnt rate facilities better gym could do with additional weight equipmemt, Great location in wonderful neighbourhood Smaller hotel with all facilities you need Room well maintained and furnished good housekeeping room made up early in the day seperate shower as opposed to shower in bath rooms although small gave the feeling space with big windows great Wifi
96034,The Hari London, Nothing all great, Its maybe my 5th time staying at this hotel Ive lost count after 3rd time and I love everything about this hotel location in Belgravia which is one of the most luxurious and safe area in London its 10 to 15 mins walk to Knightbridge station lots of stores and restaurants in walking distance the rooms are clean great size and amenities amazing views Staff are so friendly and always doing their best to help
96035,The Hari London, It was a bit difficult to contact the room service sometimes , Friendly Staff specially the concierge Diego who helped me a lot with some health issues we had I am very Grateful for his help Great Location beautiful hotel We were very happy with our choice
