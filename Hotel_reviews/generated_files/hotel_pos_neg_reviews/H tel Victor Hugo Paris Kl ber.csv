81553,H tel Victor Hugo Paris Kl ber, Well as I had a room at the front if you could organise for the local rubbish lorry to either pick up later or do it more quietly that would be amazing It woke me up very early each morning with all the banging and crashing Not the hotel s fault but it was a tad annoying I will stay at the hotel again as very good but will request a room at the back and hope that is quieter , very clean facilities particularly the bathroom Lovely

81555,H tel Victor Hugo Paris Kl ber, When we left we asked the front desk for a taxi and thought we would be informed when the taxi arrived as we always do Therefore we just sat in the lobby and waited No one told us that we actually needed to stay outside and kept an eye on the taxi by ourselves We missed the taxi and it took 30 minutes until we finally got a drive We missed the train , Overall we are very satisfied with the stay The location is amazing and staff are generally helpful All deliveries to the front desk are well kept until we pick them up or they are sent properly to our room This is a great place to stay in Paris You enjoy the quietness while not being away from the main shopping visiting areas Bonus point I am a huge fan of Victor Hugo
