282748,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Nothing, Excellent city hotel in central location Modern contemporary design which was very pleasing We were upgraded to an immaculate suite which was a pleasant surprise as we were celebrating our 28th wedding anniversary This had a very comfortable bed lovely large shower and bathroom Good breakfast choices Small well designed roof top infinity pool with seating and sunbathing area which we took advantage of for a few hours R R 
282749,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Only that we wanted to stay longer and we were there for 6 nights , Lovely staff the breakfast was really good loads of choice The roof pool and bar were lovely the best Gin and tonics We really liked our room good sized bed modern bathroom layout worked very well The light up sensor light in the wardrobes were fun 
282750,Olivia Balmes Hotel,No Negative, Prime location Fantastic rooms Attentive and helpful staff Great price When I m back in town will be my primary choice for accommodation again The proximity to most of the cultural attractions and top dining spots make Olivia Balmes a true gem in the heart of Barcelona 
282751,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Pool is amazing but get there early if you want a place to sit as it seems to always be full , Nice clean hotel Staff was amazing Food was great 
282752,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Only very minor things We didnt need clean towels every day but they were replaced anyway We are quite eco friendly so was surprised to see clean towels when we got back to the room Could hear some noise from the room next door heels clicking on the floor , Beautiful hotel modern clean and gorgeous rooftop pool The staff were friendly and helpful the girl on reception happily showed us some good places to visit on the map when we arrived And the Bar man by the Pool was so charming and helpful Would definitely be back 
282753,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Unfortunatley the walls are thin and every hotel room door bangs shut so it was very noisy when house keeping were cleaning rooms in the morning , The rooftop pool was great with a nice view The pool isn t very big but it heats up fast from the sun The location of the hotel was perfect just a few minutes walk to everything and right across the street from a gluten free bakery which sold amazing pastries 
282754,Olivia Balmes Hotel, nothing, The staff member was incredibly friendly and it has large clean and modern rooms on the roof there is a small pool which is really good if you are staying on summer in this hotel the buffet breakfast was amazing 
282755,Olivia Balmes Hotel, the room is really for a couple because after turning the sofa in a bed for our 11 years daughter you don t have enough space for your luggage Resuming if you want to stay in that hotel with kids I suggest you to find other options for couples is fine Also for a 4 star hotel breakfast must have more fruit options we normally found 2 options only, hotel location is good close to many of Barcelona main sightseeing also a very quiet region and close to Metro lines
282756,Olivia Balmes Hotel, I d like the restaurant to have more of an extensive menu I would have eaten there more for like a pre dinner and evening stroll drinks and snack place if it served more pinxtos and tapas dishes , The staff were extremely helpful they were very proactive and really anticipated what we needed The location is ideal close to Las Ramblas but also removed enough to provide a nice respite from the busyness and crowds 
282757,Olivia Balmes Hotel, There was a taxi strike because of Uber when we arrived at BCN The Metro was easy to navigate but we were a lot later getting to town than planned , Super nice staff with great restaurant recommendations Rooftop pool 
282758,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Expensive especially as had to pay extra 80 Euros for two breakfasts for me and my son for two days , Very cool room Liked wooden floor as it felt clean Friendly staff Very clean hotel trendy hotel Pool is small but ok and gym is good Lovely area 
282759,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Location is good but it is a bit of a walk from most of the main attractions which is fine but can be hard in the heat Breakfast was good and handy to eat in the hotel but expensive , Beautiful hotel with a great rooftop pool Beds comfy and rooms very clean and quiet Staff extremely helpful and friendly 
282760,Olivia Balmes Hotel, I think the restaurant of the hotel could do better The lighting is wrong with no ambiance too bright It is too open as it is next to the reception The prices are a little expensive Considering the great restaurants in the area I would think the hotel would do much better if they competed more with these restaurants More food variety more tapas lower prices and a better overall feel to the restaurant Its a great space so with the right vibe look and feel and better pricing it will bring in more business Staff are great though , The staff are really great Super warm welcoming and willing to help It was a pleasure interacting with them 
282761,Olivia Balmes Hotel, More breakfast verities would be an added bonus , The staff were very friendly and helpful the location was central but not in the busy part of Barcelona within walking distance from most attractions 
282762,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Nothing, The staff were awesome throughout our 4 day stay I travel a lot and can t compliment the quality relaxed nature and friendliness of staff enough very impressive 
282763,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Bed slipped on hard flooring minor detail , From the time I arrived 30 minutes from airport via Metro I was impressed with the Olivia Friendly greeting and check in and my room was even ready a bit before check in These rooms are smart clean and efficiently use the space Nice to open the window to the city Great location a few minutes walk to 2 different Metro stations and a few more minutes to many restaurants and shops Wish I had more time to check out the pool I will be back 
282764,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Maybe a better view really now nothing to blame the hotel , Very good breakfast until late Nespresso machines for coffee Tee and coffee also available in the room Big bath No problems even when we asked for late checkout Perfect 
282765,Olivia Balmes Hotel, nothing really , hotel car parking you need that in Barcelona nice welcoming drink in the bar lovely free goodies cookies in the room liked the breakfast Staff did a great job
282766,Olivia Balmes Hotel, One staff member at reception did not seem to care for the customer experience which the hotel values and which all other staff members portrayed towards their guests , The rooms are nice and modern and also had a small balcony which was great The ambience in the hotel is very good Most of the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made us feel welcome 
282767,Olivia Balmes Hotel, I was so looking forward to my five days at the hotel and there were some things that were truly great but it s always those annoying things that ruin a travel experience and for me they piled up a little too much at the Olivia Balmes Readers will have to judge for themselves whether any of these are a deal killer 1 Before I arrived I had several back and forth emails trying to get an answer regarding my booking and payment Was very frustrated with a few days to go before I left not having my urgent requests answered Just ignored my emails In the end I just chanced it that the booking was confirmed and it was 2 One day the lock did not activate and for hours my door was just not locked Door was shut but when I arrived back I just pushed it open and realized it had not locked Hotel did check it and it worked Nothing was taken 3 I love to swim and when I say the photo of the pool I thought it was a huge wonderful rooftop pool It was the main reason I booked It s actually not a pool for real swimming The lens distorts the size and it s actually a very very small barely lap pool not the one you see in the photos 4 If you don t like to hear your neighbors well the walls are quite thin in my opinion My neighbors came in late and when they lay on their bed it banged loudly against the shared wall You hear a lot in the corridor 5 One last thing They change the wifi password every day and you need to collect the new one from reception each morning Became a real frustration , 1 Fabulous location walking distance to main attractions shops restaurants 2 Impeccable service and food at the restaurant and the rooftop bar Oh except for the time I was having dinner and wine but happened to have a small bottle of sparkling water I d bought outside the hotel I asked for a glass and was told that despite being a guest for five days I could not have a glass for water bought outside the hotel One of the concierge s bought me a glass 3 Reception Overall good with some superb some not so 
282768,Olivia Balmes Hotel, There was a taxi strike just as we were leaving for the airport Apparently those who knew Spanish were aware that the strike was called that morning but the hotel did not inform us until we tried to get a cab , I can t say enough about the friendliness of the very professional staff I felt welcome immediately and it seemed they could not do enough for us Everyone had a smile an enthusiastic hello and seemed genuinely interested in our comfort and enjoyment of the hotel And we were there for a single night imagine how we would have been appreciated if we weren t running out the next morning Moving on to the hotel itself it is clean modern comfortable and every detail is well thought out The shower was spectacular think high end fixtures and water pressure Beds and pillows were very comfortable too Room size was European small but nothing was lacking very functional and well designed 
282769,Olivia Balmes Hotel, The shower seems to be outdated not only was it not so clean but as well the pressure was low, location of the hotel Staff very friendly and go the extra step for anything you need Size of the room Breakfast is great they have even Nespresso 
282770,Olivia Balmes Hotel,No Negative, Great location and property We loved the neighborhood location and proximity to town center gothic quarter Ramblas and Barcelona sites to explore Upon check in the concierge clued me into a couple of tips regarding advance ticket purchases that made our adventure event better Pool was lovely and a nice little escape at the end of the day 
282771,Olivia Balmes Hotel, We found nothing that should have been better , The location is extremely convenient next door to a metrostation Provenca the rooftop pool and bar provides good chill out and the room is comfy But what makes this hotel an extraordinary experience is the staff who are everyone of them consistently super friendly and make you feel more than welcome I can only recommend this hotel and while you are at it ask the barman Bernatt for some tips 
282772,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Sadly the bed was quite bad and the bathrooms have a very strange tap system Taps operate two outlets so to turn them off completely it is very difficult and kept dripping and making noise We were there for 9 nights we had a few tries Also the food they serve is ok but not great Room service choices limited, Good location even if not in central barrio gotico Staff very friendly and helpful Very good service The room was big and nice Nice roof terrace Small pool but nice Quiet room 
282773,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Nothing, Breakfast is served in the ground floor canteen with sufficient choices Staff is extra kind and helpful they answer our questions about direction for certain spaces where to buy swimsuits and accommodate our luggages To see a specially prepared cake plate with my name on the greeting cards in room is extra heart warming The location of the hotel is perfect only two blocks away from the shopping street La Gracia and two famous sight seeing spots And the hotel sits right outside the metro station balmes street A recommendation for visitors to Barcelona 
282774,Olivia Balmes Hotel,No Negative, The perfect stay Room was beautiful quiet calm and plush super comfy bed pillows Big shower with jet head and rainfall lots of closet space AC silent and quick to take effect Rooftop pool and bar was amazing perfect design great to see use of solar panels too Full gym also I did not and use on this trip however Lastly from the welcome inside with a cold drink and a full consult on the area and the to dos the smile served with each Sangria and the helping hands and warm send off to get us on our way again the staff here are an incredible asset to what is already a fabulous hotel Would always stay again and recommend this to anyone of any age and any travel type Hot tip BEST tapas and service in town are at Catalana around the corner it s busy but you never wait too long and worth it We ate there each day 
282775,Olivia Balmes Hotel,No Negative, Great customer friendly staff Hotel itself is extra clean and well furnished Room was quite spacious and had very fine and quiet air conditioning We enjoyed the rooftop pool a lot
282776,Olivia Balmes Hotel,No Negative, The staff were excellent and couldn t do enough for us The pool on the roof was a really bonus especially having two kids who love getting into the water after a day of sightseeing 
282777,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Small complaint but the pillows were a bit too soft and on floor 2 could feel the rumble of the metro below shouldn t put people off , Really helpful and friendly staff great rooftop spacious room and massive bed good location a walk from the main tourist route which means close to the best food places and bars 
282778,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Breakfast was expensive so didn t avail of it , Bathroom was split up so toilet shower were in separate rooms Sink was accessible to room even when toilet and shower were in use Power shower with large shower compartment Staff were very helpful booked our ticket to sagrada Familia saving us the queue and hassle Fab gluten free cafe located across the road a real treat 
282779,Olivia Balmes Hotel, No any dissatisfaction, Great location near to the main resort Casa Mila Casa Batllo just around 5 mins walk Close to the subway station easy reach to the Catalunia Square and Gran Via Really friendly and professional staff especially at the front desk receptionist they can give you some suggestions
282780,Olivia Balmes Hotel,No Negative, The Olivia Balmes hotel is an amazing modern hotel in the perfect location of Barcelona Everything from shopping to dinning to site seeing are all within walking distance or a short hop on the metro While a little chilly for the roof top pool it was a nice place to relax and soak up the sun I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great place to stay in barcelona 
282781,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Gym was too small , One of my favourites in Barcelona Great location for ones who love Exiample Close to Enric Granados street which has a lot of cool bars and restaurants Provenca metro is right next to the hotel Just 1 stop to Placa Catalunya station if you want to get to the crowds Very comfortable and quite large rooms

282786,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Rude waiters at breakfast Pool not heated but nice to sit around No bar up there in march In premium room the bathroom is in the room with not much privacy but it is very modern looking We weren t impressed with the room service menu list that could be much better Overall we would stay here again , Mostly very polite and extremely helpful staff see more comments below Lovely breakfast although the menu was the same for 3 consecutive days Cava included in breakfast Perfect location Individual thermostat in the room so you can set the room temperature 
282787,Olivia Balmes Hotel, I can t think of anything, A good variety of choice for breakfast the breakfast waiter roberto was very friendly He even remembered me and my daughter from our last visit The room was very clean and the bed extremely comfortablw
282788,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Proximity to metro is a plus but occasionally you could feel the rumble underneath walls to the hallway are a bit too thin, The bed was extra cosy the contemporary design was quite tasteful throughout the hotel the street views were scenic with good window soundproofing from traffic noise 
282789,Olivia Balmes Hotel, the pillows were a bit uncomfy feather would have been better but against their allergy policy , The staff were amazing very friendly and helpful and spoke excellent English The room was modern clean and well detailed with lots of space There was absolutely no noise from inside or outside the hotel and although you could feel the metro trains occasionally there was no noise and really not an issue see other reviews We had a suite which was perfect for families as my daughter had her own room with doors completely separating the lounge with comfy sofabed and bedroom Fab bathroom The restaurant was OK for emergencies in the evening but hotel staff recommended a great tapas bar almost next door Cerveseria Catalana which was much better than the ones in the centre of Barcelona and very reasonably priced Breakfast was however outstanding Amazing bread Spanish ham fresh fruit salad cheese hot breakfast and the best croissants The pool on the roof was a great sun trap and we chilled for a while in t shirts even in February The hotel is situated a few blocks from one of the main smart shopping streets nearby residential boutiques and restaurants It is 20min to walk to the centre but the metro is right on the doorstep and there s a taxi rank outside and taxis are cheep

282843,Olivia Balmes Hotel, No problems encountered , Probably the best service we have received at a hotel This was our first stay but whenever we return to Barcelona this is likely to be our choice We were touring by car and stayed one night We found locating the hotel straightforward and parking was fine for us Not a budget price hotel but for us the service made it value for money 
282844,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Nothing , The elevator OMG it s quintessential Parisian A beautiful Boutique style hotel on the outside but newly fitted out rooms on the inside No dinning room nor bar but plenty of options on the streets surrounding the hotel Room size is on the small side but I knew that when I made the booking Staff are friend and helpful Will come back again

282847,Olivia Balmes Hotel, We were charged a whole day parking fee 20 euro although we just stayed for about 20min It s unreasonable previous opinion Follow up The front desk manager of Olivia sent me an appologising email told me they made a mistake and refunded my parking charge They re highly appreciated for their professionalism , It s really a surpprise in our trip The services of Olivia are wonderful no matter the staffs or the facillties The front desk staff even welcomed us at the parking basement and guided us to hotel The air condition the beding and the light system are terrific and humanization My husband who is critical of the sleeping environment is very satisfied with Olivia

282850,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Expensive breakfast I didn t like the shower in the bedroom rather than a seperate bathroom There s no privacy you can see the other person in the shower , Lovely friendly staff Amazing clean hotel in a great location The pool is lovely and what you need after a hot day sight seeing 
282851,Olivia Balmes Hotel, The Shower for the kids was inconvenient, The Manager and all Staff were simply outstanding Whenever in Barcelona I would not change the venue in anyway 
282852,Olivia Balmes Hotel, I wish there was an a la carte breakfast menu that wasn t room service the breakfast buffet is 17 and well worth it the food selection is excellent but if you just want something light 17 is a hard pill to swallow , Perfect the rooftop pool the well appointed rooms no noise and EXCELLENT staff and service I am a travel guide and absolutely loved my short stay here The people that work here are top notch the location is ideal and I will recommend it to anyone going to Barcelona

282855,Olivia Balmes Hotel, The family tried to swim in the pool after it open but not only was the pool super tiny but when we swim apparently water were going over the side glass and down 7 floors below on to people trying to have breakfast so we were told to try not to make any splashes until at least for another hour Note we were just swimming and not playing water fight or anything That I believe is a design fault the glass should be higher Everyone around the pool ended up just staring at it for fear we get water on someone s head and we never went back Another small incident also on the first days of our stay was a housekeeper walked in without knocking while I was changing and it happened to both rooms Could have at least knock , Stayed 7 nights Staff were excellent i e Aleksi Ecaudo Godson etc were always there to help Anticipate client s needs without even us asking From smooth check in to proactively telling us what is around the hotel area wifi and being very well verse in restaurant recommendations and reservations directions etc always with a smile Rooms were clean things were refill Things were organized and we have all the necessity require Overall Staff was the thing that will get me to come back again

282859,Olivia Balmes Hotel, If you like privacy from each other for your bathroom activities you may find the room layout a little confronting , The staff were unfailingly polite helpful and generous in sharing tip and tidbits They ensured our experience was not just pleasant but genuinely enjoyable 
282860,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Only thing I noted was that the make up mirror did not adjust up or down so I had to dip down to see my face Hall side of the room could be just a bit quieter Could hear people leaving now and then It was a minor issue , Breakfast buffet was excellent with a variety of eggs meats breads pastries fruits salmon and coffees Bed and pillows were the best on my 3 weeks trip to multiple locations Front desk staff was superb They were extremely attentive and efficient Having been in the hotel business in the past this was a really pleasant experience I give Olivia Balmes a wholehearted thumbs up Awesome 
282861,Olivia Balmes Hotel, We could hear every flush and shower of our neighbors and also doors of neighboring rooms It was our morning wake up call The maid closet was directly across from the room and was a little awkward , The staff at the pool and the front desk were very friendly and helpful The room was very comfortable Great hair dryer which was very much appreciated 
282862,Olivia Balmes Hotel, The pool area is small so over weekends it can be hard to secure a sun lounger I propose they secure some more for the other side of the terrace The location is walkable to the centre but maybe 30 minutes although public transport is easy too I think I d prefer to be more central if and when I return The bathrooms in the bedrooms are wonderful so long as you are familiar with the person you re sharing a room with otherwise you may find the layout and not having a separate enclosed bathroom uncomfortable There is not daily complementary water in the rooms A small thing but makes a difference , The rooms are spacious modern and comfortable The staff incredibly helpful and polite we had heavy rain during our stay they had ran out of hotel umbrellas so the kind lady behind the desk leant her personal umbrella for us The pool is really lovely although small and the rooftop terrace so relaxing

282864,Olivia Balmes Hotel, The floor was covered by dust which spooled the first impression in the beginning but then the rooms were cleaned well , The location was perfect for us The location is five minutes of walk from the center 
282865,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Would be good to have more sun loungers and English tv channels but compared to everything else in this hotel these are minor issues , Best hotel which I have stayed on Very good location and only short walk to La Rambla and great restaurants Excellent service and Reda fantastic to handle the pool area 
282866,Olivia Balmes Hotel, not enough transat by the swimming pool so it s almost impossible to relax there system from the door s room quite nosy so if other rooms close or open their door you get awake cleaning lady cleaning on sunday morning 8 45 room next to me making lot of noise , staf really friendly specially the barman by the swimming pool who make delicious cocktails bed comfortable and good air conditioning good location of the hotel close to place Catalunya

282870,Olivia Balmes Hotel, The hotel was a little pricey but in the end a wonderful experience , The hotel was located blocks from a wonderful high end shopping district Diagonal street and right across the streer from the subway Close proximity to several great restaurants and an AWESOME Flamenco show The concierge and staff were very knowledgeable of happenings in the city A rooftop pool with spectacular view

282874,Olivia Balmes Hotel, The location though close to Passeig de Gr cia is not the very best The Balmes is quite a loud street even for the room at the upper floor and the view is not fantastic either An alternative to it an inner court view is equally appalling as it was overlooking some shabby house Inner sound proofing is not perfect we could hear what is happening in the corridor , Extremely friendly and attentive personnel Even for Barcelona 4s hotel standards the service is remarkable and clearly above expectations Spacious modern room kettle in the room good TV with a lot of international channels Nice attractive lobby

282886,Olivia Balmes Hotel, The hotel breakfast was way over priced for what it was 17 euros Lots of great breakfast places near by though, Clean modern hotel with a great roof top pool area and very friendly helpful staff Special shout out to Reda the roof top bar tender who was great It s also a perfectlocation with so many amazing restaurants near by

282901,Olivia Balmes Hotel, fitness facilities are limited the pool is very small so off season OK but during hot days may get too crowded The rooms and especially the bathroom is made of not so solid materials giving a little bit of a cheaper feeling, Great location and very beatiful hotel nice breakfast nice rooftop swimming pool I love the tall windows and great view on the square in front
282902,Olivia Balmes Hotel, One person at the bar was very unpleasant and spoiled the overall impression and the effort of everybody else Also they refilled our minibar only once in 7 nights At this price you would expect better , A new design hotel on an excellent location close to the designer shops Ramblas and other attractions

282913,Olivia Balmes Hotel, I wish the pool was heated I came in the spring so the weather wasn t warm enough yet , The staff front desk housekeeping restaurant was very nice They were always very helpful and always ready to help with a smile The location is amazing because it s very near metro stations that are main transfer points so easy to get to all over the city center It s very close about 5 min walk to Diagonal and Passeig de Gracia where many things are dining shopping and also museums like Cassa Mila and Cassa Batllo etc and yet it s removed enough from the main areas that it s nice to get back to the hotel in a relatively quieter area

282932,Olivia Balmes Hotel, The only downside was no Nespresso in the room A hotel this nice shouldn t have instant coffee , This is a very stylish hotel without being fussy or over the top Our room was large junior suite with a comfortable fold out couch for our 10yo daughter There was parking underneath and the staff were really helpful It was around a 20 minute stroll into the heart of the city which was perfect for walking off tapas 
282933,Olivia Balmes Hotel,No Negative, I have stayed here several times It is both a nice facility and a great value The rooms are modern and functional which is the style that I prefer I love the showers which have the option of hand held or rain The breakfast buffets have a wide variety and they will prepare eggs on a custom basis The restaurant menu at other meals is somewhat limited but very good The location is perhaps a 20 minute walk from Las Ramblas and this is also my preference 
282934,Olivia Balmes Hotel,No Negative, The very friendly and helpful staff like Ania Eduardo and team The hotel is new modern and clean The room was spacious for our tod to move around The location was just a block away from La Rambla We love just about everything at this hotel that we want to come back again

282942,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Noisy rooms sounds from other rooms slamming doors elevator The one staff member that checked me in was not particularly helpful and even rather unfriendly when I informed why my room was charged the same price for the night I spent alone as for the two nights my wife joined me , Excellent comfort and design Excellent location right in the centre of Eixample Friendly staff except for the one that checked me in 
282943,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Maid moved stuff around the room one day moved a table across the room moved shoes from one side to the other moved an alarm clock off of the shelf and onto the bed which then resulted in the alarm clock being lost in the laundry although hotel staff contacted us after they found it and are in the process of mailing it to us Chair in room really was t comfortable , Right across the street from Metro station just one stop from main Plaza Had its own smaller more local La Rambla street Really reminded me of a very modern W Hotel Very good sized room Very clean All the staff were excellent 
282944,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Our shower head was leaking so it would spray the room as there is no door So they fixed that right away which was great But the screw attaching the holder to the wall must have been stripped as it would rotate so if the handle was not put back in a certain position it would spray the room Some of the finishing in the room looks unfinished The paint in places and the led light strips Little details Otherwise great , Everyone we talked to was excellent Very helpful courteous and generous 
282945,Olivia Balmes Hotel,No Negative, Staff were wonderful and were able to offer us directions maps and book tickets for us to make planning trips easier recommending bars restaurants and even printing boarding passes We were made to feel very welcome right from the start with arrival drinks at the bar Room was very clean and modern and the rooftop pool was perfect for relaxing in the sun after a day of exploring Excellent location out of the more touristy areas but also within easy walking distance of them and only a few blocks from the nearest Metro station Easy to get to all the big attractions whether by walking or by using the Metro We chose not to have breakfast at the hotel there are plenty of cafes nearby which offer a nice alternative 
282946,Olivia Balmes Hotel, The layout is modern with not much privacy For couple is great Not so much for friends of both sexes if you are a bit conservative But I am nit picking There is nothing really bad about the hotel , Fabulous location and good staff Good value for money 
282947,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Restaurant is excellent value for money but severely lacking atmosphere not helped by the dominant TV showing 24 7 sporting coverage , Superb staff High level of attention to detail We were given a free upgrade which was greatly appreciated Didn t even get to the rooftop pool 
282948,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Watching tv from the sofa was difficult but I m not sure what could be done , Frankly the best hotel my wife and I have stayed in The location gives easy access to excellent restaurants shopping and the city of Barcelona The layout was fantastic You felt there was room to move around The hardwood floors were spotless and the plumbing effective and efficient Loved two sinks And the staff was very helpful and plesant and I personally loved to relax at the pool We also enjoyed breakfasts in the restaurant I repeat the best I have seen 
282949,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Nothing, Lenin at the front desk was so kind Hotel is spectacular for every aspect We really enjoyed getting superior room late check out and access to pool even after we checked out 
282950,Olivia Balmes Hotel, That I couldn t stay longer, This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in The service was exceptional from the time I got out of the taxi First an upgrade to a suite then a lovely glass of Csva I was made feel so welcome and pampered it was absolutely wonderful
282951,Olivia Balmes Hotel,No Negative, We enjoyed our stay the hotel room was clean and very comfortable the staff was great The hotel was within an easy walking distance to sight seeing shopping restaurants and cafes I wish we had more time to enjoy the terrace pool area which looked lovely 
282952,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Only tiny niggles like the vanity mirror wasn t properly fixed so you had to do the splits to use it Breakfast is adequate but not outstanding Room service menu is a bit limited but you re two minutes walk from great restaurants anyway , Excellent location within easy walking distance of all the major sights Lovely modern hotel very friendly staff we got a glass of cava on arrival a map without even asking and some tips on sights and restaurants as soon as we arrived They accommodated a late checkout without any fuss The pool and lounging area on the roof is an added bonus for chilling after a long day of walking 
282953,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Well Staff recommended a restaurant that gave my husband food poisoning , Excellent location for exploring Barcelona Room met all of our standards and needs Staff was very courteous professional and service oriented especially Josep 
282954,Olivia Balmes Hotel, I would have liked to see more in the gym Didn t fulfil my needs but there wasn t much room to do more , Loved the rooms Big modern clean The pool area is also really great Breakfast buffet was excellent and usually I complain about that in every hotel I stay Not this time 
282955,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Could probably do with a few more poolside beds as at busy times it was full, Excellent location Staff were fantastic and happy to help Very speedy check in Rooms were in very good condition
282956,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Nothing Loved it all , This hotel was honestly the best hotel I have ever stayed in The staff were incredible They could not do enough for us and we can t wait to go back next year 
282957,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Breakfast too expensive that s why we skipped it , Just about everything Location was good just two blocks away from main street Pretty quite location overall Also close to Metro which we used one evening Wasn t cheap but most comfortable 
282958,Olivia Balmes Hotel,No Negative, Perfect location Surrounding shops and cafes lovely Very Spanish and not at all touristy Gods to get back to area where hotel is after a day of sight seeing Pool fabulous to cool down and good relaxing atmosphere 
282959,Olivia Balmes Hotel, We could not have early check in which I understand but one would think they would take into consideration length of travel and try to expedite check in The bathroom didn t make sense There was no mirror above the sinks The closet in the main sleeping area could not accommodate anything longer than a shirt Poor view of an apartment complex with their laundry hanging out I don t agree with the other high ratings It was just a very very average hotel with absolutely nothing special or noteworthy about it I would not stay here again , Convenient location
282960,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Nothing, Great location of the hotel easy accessible by car and underground parking arranged by hotel The food and roof top pool are a great value in the hot August summer We traveled through Barcelona by our own car and this was very easy to do The location is great because it is out of the over crowded touristic area and located in a more quiet clean and beautiful neighbourhood Staff was super helpful and the comfort of the room was great 
282961,Olivia Balmes Hotel, The only wee down side was it would have been nice to have an English Channel other rather news channel to watch when you came back to room at night , Everything was just excellent Friendly staff very attentive and nothing was a problem for them 
282962,Olivia Balmes Hotel,No Negative, The brilliant people on reception and concierge super friendly and helpful with excellent recommendations for trips eating out Always had time for us and made the holiday for us 
282963,Olivia Balmes Hotel, leaving, the warm kind reception more than professional genuinely friendly and superb in every way you can spend more but you will not find better staff anywhere in barcelona 
282964,Olivia Balmes Hotel, We did not like the bathroom configuration in our room 604 Also the bedside lamp was inadequate difficult to switch on and off , Helpful and friendly staff 
282965,Olivia Balmes Hotel, The open plan element of the bathroom in the room , The modern look of the hotel and the attentive staff The location is great Close enough to the centre but not too close 
282966,Olivia Balmes Hotel,No Negative, Our experience completely exceeded expectations Last time we were in Barcelona we stayed at Hotel Arts but frankly enjoyed our experience at Olivia Balmes more We went to the Arts for lunch a couple of times during this trip and this reinforced our opinion that it could be much more pleasant to stay in a good centrally located 4 star hotel with warm staff than a big impersonal luxury resort We travelled as a group of 8 and reserved 3 different types of rooms double triple and suite and were very pleased with all of them They were all spacious and bright and clean Everyone at the hotel bent over backwards to be friendly and helpful As we arrived well before check in time we waited in the restaurant and had beer and coffee Upon requesting a bill we were told that those were our complimentary welcome drinks Later one member of the group had a minor health issue and needed to see a doctor The lady at the front desk couldn t have been more helpful She walked the guest to a nearby clinic and translated his ailment to the doctor who promptly and effectively dealt with the issue Although the hotel is centrally located it still exuded a sense of calm The entrance is very well appointed indeed there is space for cars to load and drop off and there is a taxi bay right across the street This will be our go to hotel in Barcelona We enjoyed hospitality at its best and at very reasonable prices with no nickeling and diming 
282967,Olivia Balmes Hotel, I didnt want to leave, The service and staff were so quick and professional gave us a drink of choice while reception was busy on arrival nice way to be welcolmed after long drive Location and Hotel were perfect Free and secure Car Park was a bonus
282968,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Swimming pool openig hours 9Am is too late and pool side too small, Front Office team very helpful and efficient Location is very convenient Room design
282969,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Too much noise from the inside of the hotel it has a structural fault slamming doors that shake walls and bed flushing toilets from other rooms talking guests and screaming children can be heard all the time walls seem paper thin guests on the second floor could hear and feel metro passing under the hotel I felt it in in the shower 4th floor etc If you want to get a good night s rest do not go to this hotel Windows are well isolated you cannot hear anything from the street Plus the pool is by far not as big as it seems on the photos the photos are a pure lie in this regard , Very friendly staff clean and nice looking rooms 
282970,Olivia Balmes Hotel, Quality of duvet could be better You are providing coffee tea facilities so a refill on the complimenraty water is recommended , Room design friendly staff especially Josep at the reception who was very helpful at arrival
