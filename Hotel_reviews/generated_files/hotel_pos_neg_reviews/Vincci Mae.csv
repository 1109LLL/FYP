277744,Vincci Mae, The location suited me perfectly close to restaurants excellent shopping and a taxi stand However you do have to walk a few blocks down to get to a metro stop Also my room was a little dark with not much sunlight making it in but that hardly mattered as I was out everyday I can t think of anything else and those things are so nit picky that they re funny It s a perfect hotel , I loved this hotel The bed was the most comfortable bed I have even slept in The staff were incredibly kind and thoughtful They took the time to greet me when I returned to the hotel each day The breakfast put all other hotel breakfasts to shame It was phenomenal The hotel room itself was so beautifully designed I enjoyed the walk in shower the welcome drink and the impeccable cleanliness Wow I literally want to live at this hotel If I m in Barcelona again it s a no brainer as to where I ll be staying 
277745,Vincci Mae, Would be nice to have more tea coffee milk supplied in the room I do like a few cups of coffee to drink , The bed and pillows were so comfy All the little extras supplied in the bathroom Everything so clean Nice bar and restaurant on the 9th floor with lovely seating area on outside terrace The staff are so friendly and helpful Have stayed there three separate times look forward to returning 
277746,Vincci Mae, We arrived by car and it can be a bit troublesome to unload and load there is limited space in front of the hotel , We received a great welcome from the staff and their attitude was consistently friendly throughout the stay Comfortable room with a good large bed and a spacious shower Nice area it is some distance from the centre but we had no trouble reaching it on foot and taxi and the bill was reasonable We had a small balcony with a very nice view of the Av Diagonal Pleasant breakfasts on the rooftop terrace with a choice of seating in the sun and the shade Good restaurants bars and shopping nearby 
277747,Vincci Mae, Coffee was fairly average at breakfast , The bed linens were really high quality and the bathroom was really big for that area of Barcelona The weather wasn t great but the pool looked great if it had been 
277748,Vincci Mae, No business center , Breakfast was great lots of variety The rooms appear sound proof and stairs were clean and easy to step walk on The staff except for one were very friendly and helpful 
277749,Vincci Mae, Nothing , One of the best value for money in town The hotel it s rooms the restaurant bar and terraces are stunning The staff always polite and helpful Great position with several bus lines on the door step and the chance to reach the ciutat viella old town by feet walking through the beautiful streets of Eixample 
277750,Vincci Mae, The decorations and the drawer were dusty The breakfast was good but not perfect The quality of the the food of restaurant was so so , The staff were friendly and helpful The room had nice balcony The facility was good The bread and cakes for breakfast was fresh and tasty 
277751,Vincci Mae, I didnt like that i lived in other hotels before , Brand new hotel that keeps standard facilities as they supposed to be in a good hotel Lobby great Rooms big and bright with calm comfortable design without screaming colors in design Proper bathroom with normal door not stupid glass door Shower cabin is the size of some hotels bathroom itself Powerful air conditioner good blinds on windows Really have totally nothing to complain about 
277752,Vincci Mae, Only small comment I left my room around 12 00 on tge last day and my taxi came around 16 00 So there was plantly of time for cleaning staff to notice that i left behind a sleeping bag of my child and to notify me That s all , Excellent staff 
277753,Vincci Mae, The room was a bit small and our window just looked at a concrete wall but maybe that s why the cost was reasonable The woman in room service was a bit rude and sometimes the front desk staff seemed confused or unorganized but they were very nice , The room was extremely clean and the bed very comfortable I liked the area because it didn t seem that touristy and it also felt very safe It was still walkable to the tourist attractions if you don t mind a long walk The rooftop was great 
277754,Vincci Mae, Not all rooms face the outside of the building we changed rooms The less expensive rooms tend to be dark and do not face the outside Again this should not detract as it is a balance between the price of the room and how much time you will actually spend in the room , Absolutely service oriented staff always will to help and suggest Great brekafast and again very sttentive staff in the restuarant 
277755,Vincci Mae, needs a more extensive menu for supper adn more tapas , excellent bedroom and great air circulation conditioning perfect wet room shower i really enjoyed my time there very comfortable
277756,Vincci Mae, Not having an iron and board in the room The laundry service would have been too expensive to use , Premium room was spacious and bed comfortable large bathroom with lots of toiletries and hair dryer bonus tea making facilities in the room Loved the rooftop bar and free tapas 
277757,Vincci Mae, when requesting view room they answer you booked standard room add 15 euro more per night and we will give you view , they clean room vey well but noticed they wont change bed sheets recption greets customer while going out or going in by saying Hola 
277758,Vincci Mae, Wifi works perfectly but is a bit cumbersome to get connected to No fitness facilities at the hotel , Very helpful and welcoming staff Nicely appointed rooms with references to style elements of the 30 s Some rooms have a balcony with a nice view of the city Excellent area with top restaurants Good location in the city centre and easy to get out of town as well Very good quality of the breakfast 
277759,Vincci Mae, The wifi was a little difficult to connect to took a long time and a lot of fiddling to persuade the log in page to appear but was fine once we managed to log in Location was good in terms of being in a lovely neighbourhood and central but wasn t particularly close to any metro stations However we ended up taking the bus there which stopped right outside the hotel , The staff were lovely and very helpful the rooftop bar and terrace had a great vibe and excellent views of the city We got a significant discount through booking com which made the room very good value for money Room was luxurious shower was wonderful and we had a little balcony with a great view from the 8th floor also meaning that the rooftop bar was just one flight of stairs from our room There were plenty of cafes and restaurants within walking distance Coffee making facilities in the room complete with take away cups were very welcome when we left for the airport at 4am 
277760,Vincci Mae, The food served during breakfast was excellent but to have coffee was a every morning nightmare Nespresso machines always with some problem and people waiting in line to get a coffee , Good hotel surrounded by lot of bars and restaurants and other amenities The room with a great view was very comfortable with a good bathroom 
277761,Vincci Mae, The wifi didn t work at first and after checking with the front desk there was a extra step required for apple devices to log in to the wifi this extra step should be told to guests when they check in to avoid time wasting It was difficult to find a spot to park and unload the bags at the front of the hotel , The room was a large size and very well appointed The bed was large and comfy with plenty of pillows The bathroom was also large well appointed and with a separate toilet As we were lucky to receive an upgraded room we also had a private balcony with great views Aircon worked well and was quiet We paid extra for breakfast on the rooftop which was well worth it a great start to the day 
277762,Vincci Mae, The pool should be called rooftop tub , Good breakfast superb and very friendly helpful staff Nice rooftop bar with stunning views of Barcelona
277763,Vincci Mae, No parking available at hotel You can get private parking nearby , Friendly and helpful staff The room was comfortable and clean and the bathroom was good The hotel is near a stop for the touristic bus easy access to the center by bus and walking distance to nice restaurants 
277764,Vincci Mae, The WiFi was a little complicated to connect to perhaps some better written instructions on how to do it The hotel is quite a walk from the beach not their fault of course and there is a bus right outside that will take you there but if you want to walk it s a good hour or so , The breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice The room was clean and nicely furnished with one of the biggest beds I ve seen The staff were very friendly and willing to help out at ever opportunity If you can get a high up 4th floor plus south facing room for wonderful views from the balcony 
277765,Vincci Mae, Horrible view from room When someone close their door your room literally shakes Too much noise , Wondeful breakfast and terrace Great view from terrace Very comfy beds Great location and neighbourhood Luxury rooms 
277766,Vincci Mae, Wi Fi didn t work very well, The location The decor The roof terrace bar The food in the restaurant The staff in the bar restaurant The family room set up 
277767,Vincci Mae, The building work going on outside the back of the hotel piling work on going , The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the hotel was extremely clean Good location for shopping and for ravelling around 
277768,Vincci Mae, would have been really handy to have a plain full length mirror in the bedroom perhaps inside the wardrobe but I can t fault the hotel Our stay was superb , We had an excellent 2 night stay at Vincci Mae The hotel is newly opened and has an elegant contemporary classic designer style We were given a free upgrade when we arrived which was a nice surprise Our room was on the 2nd floor with a good sized bedroom and lovely bathroom The bed was super king size and very comfy Plenty of pillows which was also really cosy There were coffee making facilities in the room which I have never seen before in Spain There were also dressing gowns and slippers Bathroom was spacious with a big walk in powerful shower Breakfast buffet was first class Beautifully presented and lots of choice They also offered gluten free option Breakfast is served in the restaurant and 2 terraces on the 9th floor with views over the city We also had drinks on the terrace at sunset a perfect setting The reception staff are first class polite helpful and well informed We bought tickets for the Barcelona Tourist Bus from the reception staff and they gave us information about how to use the service 
277769,Vincci Mae, Hotel restaurant is good although the selection of food is quite limited Strange room service hours you can order lunch until 14 00 and then nothing until 20 00 this is quite strange but there are plenty of restaurants nearby There is no gym and spa pool is very small no option of swimming in there , Deluxe room with terrace and Tibidabo views very much reccomended spacious and comfortable Breakfast is good and fresh served from 7 untill 11 00 am which is great Nice rooftopterrace for a drink or bite 
277770,Vincci Mae, not really worth the price for that standard got terrible dark room with the wall and electricity cables out of the window depressing very dark Changed after requested the next day with extra charge but for normal room with the view and the balcony , Location breakfast was nice little boring after 3 days and didn t offer anything for lactose allergies no veggies or so but in overall delicious pastries bread fresh spanish ham 
277771,Vincci Mae, We have ordered the deluxe room but it was not available for our arrival even though we have been warned of this We received 20 discount but this has not really fixed the issue of comfort We were promised something nice in the room for compensation but it was not really there The terrace in deluxe room facing active building process , Nice staff welcoming and pleasant Excellent staff in restaurant great breakfast Beautiful terrace 
277772,Vincci Mae, inconsistent daily room cleaning lack of standards poor function of the in room AC no fitness center average to poo quality of room service, Nice and spacious bedroom
277773,Vincci Mae,No Negative, Lovely hotel with a warm atmosphere location is also superb within walking to all the interesting hotspots and also close to the Barcelona stadium We will be back 
277774,Vincci Mae, There is no extractor fan in the bathroom but that is an easy compromise given the quality of the rest of the building service , Staff were extremely friendly helpful and accomodating We paid 10 extra for an early check in with a room upgrade Bar man on the rooftop was very helpful and gave us complimentary snacks with our drinks which was great Hotel was extremely clean Location is good 10 minute walk to the nearest metro station but the metro is easy to use which detracts from the walk We really enjoyed our stay 
277775,Vincci Mae, The room had an internal view basically view to a wall We could not open the window because of the smell of food in the patio During the day refurbishment works made quite a lot of noise quiet on Sunday though , Very good breakfast Friendly staff 
277776,Vincci Mae, I left an item of clothing in the wardrobe and have tried to contact the hotel on 2 occasion to retrieve it but no one has got back to me which is disappointing , The Hotel itself was really pretty on arrival the staff were really helpful and upgraded us for the night The room was different quirky but very nice 
277777,Vincci Mae, The bathroom didn t have any ventilation and got totally steamy The retro brass shower was hard to handle , The room was so nice clean and yet cosy The beds wonderful 
277778,Vincci Mae, Bathroom smelled terrible obvious plumbing problem Spent one night in smelly room with no window to outside Staff acted surprised when I mentioned the problem and did not follow up on my complaint Had to insist to be moved to another room Found out others experienced the same bad smell in the past Otherwise a decent establishment with great location ,No Positive
277779,Vincci Mae, Nothing, Very good location on the main Diagonal Street Close from El Cort Ingles and L illa which is a big shopping mall Very clean rooms with all necessary amenities Quite rooms
277780,Vincci Mae, Unfortunately in the room it smelled really bad window was without any view i suppose certain rooms in the lower floor are very dark A pitty i would go back but ask for another room The architect should check the problem with the smell No aeration in bathroom also, The stlyle the terrace and the people working on the rooftop restaurant Magazines to read water tea and coffe the decoration reasonable room service
277781,Vincci Mae, Guests throwing up at 2am you can hear everything from your room housekeeping then knocks on my door at 3am to wake me up After I said no she just walks into my room anyway 8am in the morning woken up by all the doors opening and closing as there is no soundproofing at all Didn t get much sleep which for me was the key purpose along with wifi also didn t work other than that room was ok ,No Positive
277782,Vincci Mae, none, rich and tasty breakfast comfortable bed great view from 9th floor where there is the restaurant and 2 terraces bus station in front of the hotel around 10m on foot to nearest subway station Hospital Clinic which is 3 stations away from Sagrada Familia
277783,Vincci Mae, The walls between the rooms are a bit thin You can hear the noise from the next door room if any, The linen was always fresh Never felt like anybody was in my space Absolute peace of mind 
277784,Vincci Mae,No Negative, Amazing location city centre but not touristy super friendly staff Nice room huge bed and cream de la cream bathroom AMAZING 
277785,Vincci Mae,No Negative, We had a fantastic time in this hotel The room was big and cozy the bed was comfortable the breakfast was tasty and the location was convenient Price quality ratio was amazing For sure we will return 
277786,Vincci Mae, The noise which comes from next rooms and the fact if you want to use AC you must wait 10 min after you start But for 3 nights with breakfast i was more than satisfiyed , I liked the breakfast location room was clean but to be honest its not in their dreams 4 star hotel its more like 3 star 
277787,Vincci Mae, Everything was perfect , We had a very pleasant stay Great experience in general but the bed was so so comfortable it was hard to wake up Staff is very friendly and nice Breakfast is really good lots of choice everything is fresh and delicious 
277788,Vincci Mae, Food for evening meal in the restaurant could have been better, Rooms were spotless and beautifully decorated bed linen clean and fresh bathroom was lovely Cosy restaurant on the 9th floor had two balconies overlooking the city Staff helpful and friendly 
277789,Vincci Mae, The bathroom was not perfectly equipped and the view from the room was awful , The hotel is in a very good location near to public transportation The staff is very kind and helpful the room is clean and comfortable and the breakfast is really nice 
277790,Vincci Mae, The Wi Fi was rather slow in the evenings There was some construction work going on outside which we heard very well from our room on the 1st floor This was of course not the fault of the hotel just thought to mention it for other light sleepers On the good side they only start work around 8 30 AM so if you re an early bird it might not bother you at all , The room was made with so much attention to detail from the USB plugs on both sides of the bed to the lighting to the extra large double bed probably the biggest one that I ve ever seen to the nice bed sheets to the large shelf space to the super nice shower in the bathroom to the little deco elements that give the room warmth and personality 
277791,Vincci Mae, Very pricey They don t even offer a free water bottle per day of stay in a town where the tap water is undrinkable , Clean quiet and very conveniently located hotel Very helpful and friendly staff Great terrace on top of the building 
277792,Vincci Mae, One of the sliding windows in the room did not lock even with the latch engaged it would let anyone slide it open There was a thin layer of dust on the shelves and decorative articles in the room , The staff were friendly and helpful Very quiet rooms despite being in a busy neighbourhood 
277793,Vincci Mae, Only regret is that we had to leave my friend and I , Came from 14th to 16th December from England Really great hotel easy to find and as soon as arrived really friendly and helpful staff Didn t get their names but the two receptionists women were really amazing and nothing was too much to ask The room was just WOW especially shower really comfortable and perfect size The bar was great and drinks aren t expensive at all Once again great staff Edo if Im right Here to help and smiling such a pleasure to come Thank you so much to all staff we met 
277794,Vincci Mae,No Negative, Good Location on the Diabonel Avenue 5 min in bus to the Cam Nou stadium Perfect rooms that include all the needed facilities New and clean Good value for money
277795,Vincci Mae, 15 euro for breakfast is a little bit expensive , New equipped hotel All systems are working properly Helpful staff Bus stop near the doors to hotel Fantastic view from the restaurant on the upper floor 
277796,Vincci Mae, There was construction in the roof although they didn t start until 8 am With jet lag we wanted to sleep in later than that WiFi didn t work but we went down the street to a great cafe and used it there , We felt relaxed Staff assisted us in finding great tapa spots and answered any questions we had very thoroughly Loved the variety of pillows and softness of sheets Location was perfect for exploring Barcelona and right down the street from our car rental 
277797,Vincci Mae,No Negative, Rooms are beautifuly designed well equipped and specious The upstairs restaurant is nice and the rooftop terrace offers a lively view Excellent location in thd fashion district of Av Diagonal Great team 
277798,Vincci Mae, Since the hotel opened just that day a few things still needed fixing The only thing I can complain about was that the TV in our room wasn t configured yet Such a small detaile though we didn t need to watch TV anyway , We checked in here the day the hotel opened The hotel and facilities were great modern and clean The staff were extremely welcoming and helpful The room was spacious and had everything we needed We even had a sea view from our balcony The roof top terrace was a plus Although the hotel is a bit off from most sites it is extremely easy to either walk or get taxis anywhere I would definitely stay here again when visiting Barcelona 
277799,Vincci Mae, Could hAve been more complementary drinks etc in room Paper cups Vey sensitive fire alarm went off briefly 3 times over 3 nights We were led to believe this was because bathrooms didn t have a fan in them , Bathroom was lovely and excellently cleaned each day Bedroom standard very good Very clean and well thought out
