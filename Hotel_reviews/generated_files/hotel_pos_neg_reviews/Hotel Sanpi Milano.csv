479993,Hotel Sanpi Milano, Room was really small and kind of worn Pictures at the site for booking and reality did not match much We were kind of disappointed and would have preferred some international hotel chain hotel instead And hotel was not that close to the Central Station as expected although we chose from the booking app by near the Central Station as we had to wake up at 5 to catch the bus to the airport beside Central Station , The location of the hotel was pretty good for just walking around 20 meters from the hotel was a great restaurant Il Carpaccio and park for walking was nearby

479997,Hotel Sanpi Milano, Cosy and intimate but the walls are very thin and you can hear a lot of noise from the neighbors We visited at the end of April and I guess it was a bit too chilly we requested and received a heating device that got us through but it was quite noisy during the night otherwise it would have been really too cold for comfort , The inner garden is an excellent lounge space lovely decorated You can sit there sipping an a prosecco enjoying the view Small but efficient gym room Plus point for the staff Close by to the public transportation and the fashion district 
479998,Hotel Sanpi Milano, TV was fixed flat so we had to sit in front on the bed instead of being relaxed in a chair , Very comfortable room and well equipped with little extras as kettle tea and coffee biscuits and chocolates mini bar We were in a superior room with these extras 
479999,Hotel Sanpi Milano, there was standing a rusty tap in the bathtub also curtain in the bathtub would be more practical and would avoid that the bath gets wet our room was dark although there is a window the curtain couldn t be opened to let the light into the room so also during the daylight we had to switch on the lights, breakfast was very good personal was friendly and helpfull location is good near to central station and corso buenos aires

480010,Hotel Sanpi Milano,No Negative, We needed the wifi badly that day and unfortunately there were no waves inside the room just in the lobby but I believe it was just for that day As for the rest everything was perfect and the staff awesome It is the right choice to make 
480011,Hotel Sanpi Milano, Rooms are awful I ve asked for quiet room And received the first room in the hall which is the noisiest Rooms have no noise isolation so be prepared to hear at 8am everyone who is running as a people galloping for breakfast Room is very small and the bathroom has a design somewhat from Eastern Europe of the 90s Can not believe that I ve paid almost 100 euros for 1 night, Staff is great were very friendly and helpful
480012,Hotel Sanpi Milano, The room had the smell of smoking although it was a non smoking room We had to wait for a table to become available in order to have breakfast as there were not enough tables for everyone This happened 2 mornings in a row ,No Positive

480017,Hotel Sanpi Milano, Small room, Good location between the central train and the city Center Good little cafe and polite staff Firm comfortable bed Let s face it at this price size isn t as important as location or comfort 
480018,Hotel Sanpi Milano, Didn t love the location not far from city centre but some dodgy looking people hanging out in the streets nearby and near the park Also the breakfast room and breakfast were below par , The staff were excellent and the room facilities were good The place was very clean and the room was quiet 
480019,Hotel Sanpi Milano, Some items on the breakfast buffet were not replaced very quickly however I only noticed this on the busiest day in the breakfast room , The staff were very helpful friendly and efficient The rooms were clean and comfortable and the breakfast had a good selection of items The location was between the train station and the centre of town and very close to a metro station which meant it was easy to access everything

480024,Hotel Sanpi Milano, Besides all over the hotel there are signs that says Vietato fumare No smoking the first room we get stank to smoke After we change the second room looked small cheap and crowded making it hard to move around The bathroom with the painted floor didn t look hygienic and the shower was a joke can t avoid hit my elbows with the walls Definitely is far away of the rooms they show in the pictures of booking a room that you don t expect to see in a 4 star hotel , The city and historic sites

480026,Hotel Sanpi Milano, Overall the room was clean but looks like there was no regular cleaning under the bed The room overlooking the street is quite noisy The service at the breakfast rush hour is a little bit hectic , Charming patio nice lobby with old furniture very friendly and helpful staff good location with two subway stations very close to the hotel restaurants with very good food just across the street and within a few minutes walk ask the guys at the reception 
480027,Hotel Sanpi Milano, The hotel does not turn on the Aircondition before May There were warm and humid nights during my stay in March and that made some of the nights uncomfortable , Staff are very friendly and cooperative The hotel is almost in the city Centre and near to all attractions Metro station is about 350 meter away and that makes it easy to travel around main attractions in Milan Prices are reasonable the breakfast was marvelous

480037,Hotel Sanpi Milano, The tub was a bit small but I didn t go to Milan to take baths anyway D The area around central station seems a bit dodgy by night but the hotel was far enough away to seem okay , The staff was very friendly and helpful I was 2 hours early for checkin which wasn t an issue and my room was ready too The room was small but comfortable and clean A big plus was the kettle which isn t standard in many European hotels The tram station is only a 2 minutes walk from the hotel All together I would definitely stay here again 
480038,Hotel Sanpi Milano, Nothing really Breakfast maybe could have had a broader selection but thats all I can think of , I booked a room at this hotel because unlike many other hotels in Milano their staff seemed very polite according to reviews Well my girl friend and me were certainly not disappointed Every single staff member be it receptionist waiter or cleaning personnel were really friendly and helpful Thats very important to me and made me feel welcome The hotel was also managed very profesionally When my girl friend pulled a misterious string in the shower cabin shortly later someone from the reception would call and ask if everything was ok Turned out it was an alarm you could use in case of an emergency They also called another day to ask if we need anything e g a fresh towel we had put out the do not distrub sign English is no problem in that hotel they speak it fluently You can also store your luggage at the hotel for free on the day you check out in case you still have time to explore the city but no place to leave your stuff The room we had was very nice clean and quiet I dont need any luxuries but that s what matters to me We also got a free upgrade which was a great surprise Beds were comfy Breakfast was certainly ok I have seen buffets with a broader selection though Coffee was excellent Hotel is located close to a tram stop and a metro stop All in all a very pleasant stay and would come back anytime
