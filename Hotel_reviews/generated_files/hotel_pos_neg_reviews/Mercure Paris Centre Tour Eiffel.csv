99600,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, We only stayed for one night however we had a member of staff walk into our room at 8 am I am assuming this was housekeeping however since we were checking out in three hours we saw this as pointless and quite rude There wasn t a knock or announcement the staff member just walked in , The location is perfect The Eiffel Tower was a 2 minute walk away which meant we could sneak out before the crowds and catch the sunrise over the Eiffel Tower then go back for breakfast The staff at check in check out were fast and efficient A large selection of food available for breakfast Go down early as it got really busy from 9 am onwards The price was a little steep however in comparison to other properties available it was worth the money 
99601,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Rooms too small Coffee cups very tiny paper disposable cups Smells at the corridors Front of hotel full of rubbishes, Location cannot see the effel tower from the hotel but it is 2min walk to the tower Staff nice Kids under12 free buffet
99602,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, We were left around waiting for a long time at check in and out We found reception to be without staff and you couldn t get through to reception while trying for 30 minutes so we gave up We had no hot water from 9am we last checked at 11am and still none to be told by reception that was normal We took drinks back to our room on Friday night and they were still left in the room on departure on Monday The mini bar was never refilled from Friday night over the whole weekend , The location was brilliant and the hotel was clean 
99603,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The view of Eiffel Tower was quite disappointed but you can see 60 of the tower , Great location Clean and useful interior Free mini bar It is modern and good hotel 
99604,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Everything was wonderful Perhaps there could have been more choice with room service but this is just a small observation , The rooms are very clean and beautifully decorated with comfortable beds and lovely bathrooms We had a two bed apartment which was huge This hotel has great ambience and the staff were very friendly 
99605,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The reception desk personal is not very professional Asked them to make a booking for a taxi to the airport and although I got a booking N the next morning transpired the taxi was not booked after all or they could not figure out which is the booked taxi company clueless We had to look for a random taxi in front of the hotel were late for the airport which with the current airport security measures it is a disaster , The location of the hotel is excellent there is a view of the Eiffel Tower it is close to metro and tram stations The menu of the restaurant is limited but the food is good and the service is good Restaurant personal is very friendly 
99606,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Having paid 310 per night the Duty Manager expected me to pay room service for some English breakfast tea bags that were not standard in the room but available freely in the breakfast room His reply was if we provide them for you we would have to supply 100s to other residents I was flabbergasted and bought the tea bags from a nearby shop for 3 euros Having stayed there the last five years IT WILL BE THE LAST ,No Positive

99609,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, When i reached hotel they informed me that the reservation is canceled and I have to show them that my booking was valid However they solved the problem, The room was very small for family and even for coubles with two big bags
99610,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Staff wasn t super helpful and we couldn t enter the parking lot with our driver or when we were just walking back to the property Bathroom was a separate tiny square in the room and hot with no ventilation We upgraded and I felt like it wasn t worth the extra money we spent I tried calling the house keeping to ask for missing items in our room and they never came We had breakfast one of the mornings and decided we could find better and less expensive by walking around the city to a bakery , Location was great for the Eiffel We got to watch it sparkle at night from our room which was magical 
99611,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The maid did not re stock the shower body wash or coffee for the room , The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating the hotel was in a very safe and secure location with fantastic views and easy commute 
99612,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The room was a little cramped for two people the tea coffee making facilities were very basic no breakfast tea bags we booked a breakfast on our last day which was poor value for money and they ran out of most things, The location was amazing right next to the Eiffel Tower the staff were helpful and the room was clean the fridge in the room was particularly useful as it was so hot whilst we were there we put drinks in there
99613,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, the staffs need to be well trained as they GAVE THE KEYS OF MY ROOM to another guest it s made me VERY WORRIED and VERY UNHAPPY that I couldn t trust leave my personal belongings in the room x I was taking my shower when the other guests opened my room door and let their self in , very good breakfast
99614,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The breakfast was generous but quality could be improved Coffee machine slow , Proximity to Eiffel Tower and transport Beds very comfortable Rooms very clean 
99615,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Restaurant manager I ordered beef carpaccio and they brought out salmon and he tried to tell me it was beef I had to get another member of staff to change it as manger just tried to walk away telling me yes it is beef then charged me 13 euro for a side of fries my actual meal was only 14 euros, Close to tour de Eiffel
99616,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Disastrous check in process the worst of any hotel I ve experienced Very inefficient at respecting my reservation details Very unfriendly lady checking in the breakfast guests Bathroom design is very poor leading to everything becoming wet if showering , good location
99617,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, I found it little expensive but still its value for money, I loved the location of property only 2 to 3 minute walk from effile tower The environment of the property was peacefull clean property Staff was coperative and friendly especially reception staff brilliant Efficent management with clear goals and objectives breakfast was amazing true picture of france hospitality values 
99618,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The restaurant was booked for a private functions on the first 3 nights of my stay I wasn t told about this when I checked in at 3 00 only when I arrived expecting dinner at 7 00pm, Staff were very helpful they spoke excellent english the food was excellent 
99619,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, No support from most of the stuff Room Small and they won t give you two connect rooms separated bath room from Toilet Parking expensive and sometimes no place to park All detailed in the 4 Stars hotels are missing There are no amenities even a slippers not available etc , Just the place and one of the receptionist called Ezziden was very cooperative 
99620,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The gardens in front and around the hotel can be improved to be more pleasing to the tourists , Location is excellent considering it is very near the Eiffel Tower which is one of the major attractions in the city 
99621,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, No milk in fridge for tea drinkers and only paper cups no china mugs , Size of room and location were good Got upgrade to a superior room Breakfast was good 
99622,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, What I didn t like is that when I did the reservation and got there they told me that the breakfast was included but then they told me that I had to pay for each breakfast which was too much That s very unacceptable by telling me that the breakfast was included but somehow it wasn t There was no room view and the bathroom is very uncomfortable , The staff and personnel is very kind They help their visitors with any type of concern I would probably book with this hotel again but most likely in a different room where I can have a view 
99623,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The draught beer in the bar was terrible two different brands from different pumps maybe the pipes need cleaning, Great selection at the breakfast buffet
99624,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, the shower took a long time to drain so if you have more than one person you have to stand in their old shower water , It was 90 degrees our first day there and air conditioner worked well 
99625,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, room could have been a little bigger for 3 adults very pricey but great location, nice selection of breakfast great walking distance to Eiffel tower staff was fairly helpful easy access to transportation and walking around the area
99626,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The staff on reception weren t as helpful or as friendly as I m used to I found the bed was quite hard and the pillows weren t comfortable either Breakfast was really expensive and I thought the dinner menu wasn t great either I m vegetarian and there were not many options , I loved the location the Eiffel Tower was literally two minutes walk from the front door of the hotel The design of the hotel itself was nice and the rooms were nice as well 
99627,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Our room was booked for three persons We got a typical one bedroom with a double and a sofa bed they removed the bedside table to allow room for the sofa bed and there was no chair No space to move around and for the price very bad and certainly would not re commend to anyone unless single , Staff were very attentive
99628,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Not enough milk to make coffee for the no of us sharing the room and on top of it thin plastic cups Tiny rooms Hardly any space to move Curtains looked untidy Ugly room view Very noisy cleaners they talk and laugh at the top of their voices So NO privacy and respect for tired guests sleeping in early morning because of touring and returning late at night The outlay of the room is very impracticle Very tight around mirror bar fridge and entrance Although the hotel is located very close to the Eiffel Tower which is a BIGG attraction it is overpriced for what it offers due to it s location and I found the decor and outlay quite poor Very expensive accomodation for what you get No breakfast incl in accomodation Reception understaffed always busy so guests are kept waiting to be served Laundry is s expensive especially over weekends and there is no retractable washing line in the bathroom Airconditioning is feeble , How close to the Eiffel Tower and some of the other sights it was in walking distance 
99629,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, They did forget about my booking but did sort it out , Love how close too the Eiffel Tower you was the staff was very nice and helpful the did forget about my booking but they upgraded me for that problem 
99630,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, None, Very near the eiffel tower accessible to all kinds of transportation has clean rooms and surroundings The staff are friendly and it s worth it 
99631,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, No complimentary for toothpaste and toothbrush no shampoo Room is too small for two The furniture is too small as like table and armchair , Friendly staff and good location
99632,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, I have nothing negative to say from my experience at the hotel , The staff were very friendly the suite was very comfortable the decor throughout was lovely and the distance to the Eiffel Tower was less than a 5 minute walk 
99633,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The room is a little small , The staff are very helpful very polite fantastic location 4 mins walking to the subway and many attractions are around the hotel 
99634,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Breakfast brunch was too expensive for the quantity and quality of food We ate at the Pullman in the morning Had to ask for extra soap at the desk The maids would not give anything extra when asked These items however were of minor issues the desk handled it all , Very accommodating staff at check in Location was very good Quiet and easy access to transportation 
99635,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The room was ok but not amazing No crockery paper cups No robe Very little in way of toileteries Maybe it s better if you have a suite we just had a twin room , Position of hotel was great very near Eiffel tower near to Seine and river boat bus tours Lots of nearby places for breakfast 
99636,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, It s ok as a bed for the night if you re spending all your time sightseeing This hotel is not 4 star standard in my opinion and very poor for an Accor owned hotel It s in need of a major facelift Don t expect anything but French TV No movie selections We also paid for a privilege room which was no different to most standard hotel rooms smaller in my opinion and didn t get a view of the Eiffel Tower I will be using Air BnB for my next stay in Paris , Easy access to Eiffel Tower Central Paris Great cafes nearby 
99637,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Staff are not helpful We found a leakage under the water basin and called the front desk they said will handle and we have no answer after 10 minutes We went down to the front desk and the staff said cannot change to another room because it was full and can only change for us on the next day we booked for 4 consecutive nights The next day morning no one follow up we have to talk to the staff morning shift again which wasted us a lot of time They request us to come back before 4pm to pack our luggage and change the room we were advised that if after 4pm the housekeeper may not be able to clean our room No shower caps provided I asked front desk again they said will bring to the room and again seems my message was being ignored I stayed here in 2012 and was very satisfied but now I would say I will never stay in this hotel anymore , Excellent location
99638,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Better showers we managed to get water all over the bathroom We are used to standing under the shower not used to hand held, Breakfast was great easy to use public transportation
99639,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Pretty much everything The bed was the worst it was a queen size bed for me and my partner but we felt like the edges made us roll off so we both tried squashing in the middle of the bed The service desk never picked up our calls There was no toothbrush or paste The room stunk every time we walked in Probably rather stay in a motel next time , Only thing I like was when walking OUT OF THE HOTEL you can see the Eiffel Tower 
99640,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, I love the Mercure hotels have stayed in many now but security on the door needs to be all night At the smoking area which is at the entrance to the hotel a chinese man was at the smoking area when two people came up to him and stole his bag off his arm It was so upsetting to see this man so upset They need tighter security at the entrance we come to Paris to enjoy the sights not to be stolen from I kept my bag over my body all the time so did the chinese man they distracted him and took his bag off his body I had a lovely four day break but unfortunately this is what I remember the most now, location good and beds comfortable

99642,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, I paid extra to get a view of Eiffel Tower but still my room was obstructed by Pullman hotel , Location very near Eiffel Tower as well as train metro station
99643,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, I hated the service I went out my room was not clean I have to request it to be cleaned they did not change the sheets and when I asked they says the change the sheets every 2 days the gel soap missing and they were none until the next day morning after I called for it more than 2 times The staff are not really helpful no responsiveness no empathy and reliability, The hotel was convenient located just a few minutes walk from Eifel tower and Bir Hakeim underground station No far to Champs Elysees and Arc de Triomphe Breakfast was very good with variaty choice the have restaurant on site but did not like the food 
99644,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, My bag is stolen in the lobby Uneducated security had to wait for a receptionist under an emergency No apologize no information After 2 days still waiting the details from them They try to avoid their responcibility ,No Positive
99645,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The room toilet was very small who planned the room Why they didn t put the toilet into the bathroom everything was perfect but the toilet The front desk staff was very gentle and keep smiling and helping But on the breakfast area the staff was very rude the behaviours and the mood were very negative , At breakfast Fruits and Croissants are very good plus honey and Nutella Also the room was very comfortable minibar was free also there was a safe for your valuables and your laptop Bathroom was very nice white and bright 
99646,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was immaculate The staff was friendly and room service was so quick I would definitely stay here again 
99647,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Bathroom is a bit small but not in an uncomfortable way , Location of this place is out of this world You literarily get out of the lobby and here you go the Eiffel tower is right in front of you 3 minutes walk and you can be right below it You save a ton of money if you book this as opposed to the one next to it Pullman which I checked and was ridiculously more expensive They are literarily next to each other Staff is super nice and helpful Since restaurants close at around 10 pm and we arrived at midnight they have some sandwiches and drinks in the lobby for purchase Room very clean

99654,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Toiletries very poor no conditioner or body cream and besides the body wash and shampoo being in one not good also the container in shower was empty and not enough pillows , The breakfast was excellent tasty sausages lovely fresh croissants coffee machines in poor condition 
99655,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Half door in the bathroom makes no sense as water still gets on the floor Also the restaurant does not have a kids menu for lunch and or dinner which makes dining with a child almost impossible Only thing my son liked on the menu was the ice cream dessert , The location was perfect A few mins from the Eiffel Tower and from 2 Metro stops Made getting around Paris super easy 
99656,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Quite expensive for an average size room and basic facilities but it s the location you re paying for , Average size room with good air con and as close as you can get really to the Eiffel Tower

99658,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Small rooms but we are in Paris after all And not really very cosy in the reception area s so didn t hang around much We were told their was no normal rooms left and only priviligre rooms but when we got there the difference in these rooms was a dressing gown and offer of a small free mini bar so not sure why we couldn t have had the normal room rate without the extra s put in for us , Easy to find easy to park clean and close to the Eiffel tower Great for pets as lots of grass nearby and walks Nice hotel 
99659,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, small baths bad cleaning the bathrooms smelled to urinate Small room uncomfortable poor care to enter very basic breakfast options It is a very basic hotel to be 4 star , CheckOut is very fast

99669,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, what could have been better ALL OF IT the fact that we had go practically beg for more sugar and milk for our coffee was awful i paid such a lot of money and i was expecting so much more than what i got i booked this hotel over all of the others because the pictures lead me to believe i could see the eiffel tower from my window totally not true i was completely fooled it s expensive and really not worth it at all , the staff were lovely
99670,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, This time the rate included breakfast and I took it however go for breakfast was not a good experience 2 Orange juice machines not working No glasses for juices Another coffee machine was not working either If the breakfast is self service everything has to be working perfectly, I usually use this hotel in Paris The location is perfect

99672,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Far to expensive cost me 186 per night and an additional 30 Euro per night for a view of the Eiffel Tower they did not mention that the view was just the top third of the tower as there is a huge hotel blocking the view The room was tiny and had only 1 bedside table and no dressing table No bath only shower and a tiny toilet cubicle it was like an airplane toilet cubicle Breakfast is rubbish too , Location was good
99673,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Rooms very small even upgraded superior Beds uncomfortable Breakfast like a six nations rolling maul Self service area poorly positioned , Great location

99676,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Being a privileged guest i was disappointed that i needed to ask for the mini bar to be replenished also only one bath robe and slippers and when the fridge was replenished there was just 2 coke and 1 orange juice also needed to remind staff about the champagne as they forgot to deliver it at the pacific time , The view of the eiffel tower was amazing from the bedroom floor 11 room 1135

99680,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Although the staff were not rude they weren t terribly friendly It was a bonjour and straight to the point and you were lucky if you got a smile this applied to every single member of staff I spoke to at the hotel A simple how are you or how was your journey isn t too much to ask On our third day there my sister was very unwell with a cold I rang up reception and asked for a bottle of water to which she replied you have had your one free bottle for the stay you will have to come down and pay for one I then pleaded that my sister was unwell and so the lady asked me to call housekeeping who did not pick up I m not sure how to describe how frustrating it was that a hotel would not give me one bottle of water when somebody was ill without me having to beg for it and even then I didn t receive it and had to walk down to the local shop I didn t bother complaining at reception because the staff were not approachable at all It s really a shame because it s a fantastic location and the staff really do just give me a negative connotation of mercure hotels now and I would hesistate before booking one again , Fantastic location clean room 
99681,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, More milk and tea in the room Scrambled egg was a bit too creamy and the bacon was almost cremated, Location brilliant Reception good Staff helpful Room nice 
99682,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Small rooms Mattress Smelly toilets cold room Booking com didn t understand that it wasn t this mercure that I was reserving I wanted the one close to the Champs Elys es That has a view of the Eiffel Tower So it doesn t work when you expect a location and end up somewhere else , Staff Cleanliness The view The food Early check in Express check out Location 
99683,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The bathroom is too small in the rooms I didn t like that the toilet and shower was in a separate room which was small and you didn t have enough room to move around The pictures online don t show how small the bathroom is I also think it was overpriced for the room I stayed at much better hotels for less than what I paid at Mercure And we arrived at night time and couldn t find the hotel because the display lights were off at the top of the hotel The hotel was located on the side of Pullman Hotel which was hard to find at night Luckily people were friendly enough to help us find the hotel , The breakfast buffet was good 
99684,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Excellent location within a couple of hundred yards of the Eiffel Tower Our room was on the upper floors and was lovely and quiet All the staff we met were very pleasant and extremely efficient and helpful

99686,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The fact I paid for a room that was supposed to have a Effel tower view but was stuck on the back side of hotel instead , It was at least close to Eiffel tower
99687,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Rooms Quite small Booked a triple room expecting 3 Singles But had a double and a pull out bed but it was comfy Toilet smelly and stained , Lovely Staff Especially Bruno the porter Ideal location right next to the eiffel tower although No view 
99688,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Only found one waiter who was friendly and helpful out of the entire staff at the hotel Hotel rooms were not replenished throughout the stay only had one bottle of water and six single serves of milk for the four days for two people Although the hotel looks spectacular the service and value for money lets it down the only positive is that it was close to the Eiffel Tower , Location
99689,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, the pic were mis leading and the aminties werent describe very well for what we paid for I could of stay at a another hotel that encluded everything w it very disappointed in the service all around and for three people very sad to say and our room was dirty and a dirty bed sheet we did not enjoyed it we even left a day earlie because of what happen , only thing that was nice about this hotel is the convience of walking everywhere and the eiftel tower was step away 
99690,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, bed was flat springs coils had no life left bathroom configuration was poorly designed Clash of doors at room entrance frustrating ALSO THE AMOUNT RESERVED ON CREDIT CARD AT CHECKING IN IS ABSOLUTELY ABSURD more than 70 above the room rate is ridiculous , location
99691,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Line at reception was often very long Might need more staff during holiday season , Able to get two adjoining rooms Housekeeping very helpful with basic requests Onsite parking reasonably priced 
99692,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The privilege room is a rip off you only have the potential for the Effiel Tower view and the rooms are a little small Parking is ridiculously expensive 24 hrs parking is 28 euro I parked there for about 32 hours and was charged 55 euro 20 euro for breakfast is way too expensive Never staying here again Wasn t terrible just not worth it Bed is super firm , Very close to the Effiel Tower Metro station close by Nice big shower 
99693,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Size of the room for the price was compact Could have been bigger, Fantastic location 2 min walk from the Eiffel Tower Parking available For a responsible price
99694,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, It took more than half an hour to check in waiting in long cue almost to the main gate Only one staff took care of check in in this season and this value hotel Disappointing , Room was very Cozy and hommy Beddings were comfortable

99804,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Lobby toilets were not very nice urine all over the seats and floor I had to run back up to my room Disappointing considering you have to ask for a key to use them View from the room wasn t great I could see all the rubbish bins etc which I wouldn t mind but some was spread across the floor not something you want to look out at in the morning Saying that next time I would probably book room with a view of the Eiffel Tower I might be a little picky here but we didn t feel very welcome in the bar not very chatty they dropped the bill half way through our drinks instead of asking us if we wanted another round which we did , Location is excellent Step out of the hotel and you re looking right at the Eiffel Tower which is incredible Great value for money Lovely clean room bathroom with comfortable beds Helpful staff on the front desk Even though I have a few bad points I honestly would recommend this hotel to anybody and I would definitely return it has everything that you need

99806,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The staff was unconcerned to the extent rude and not even wanting to listen and was argumentative type We had booked for 3 persons in a room and they charged over and above the rate we had paid and didn t listen to our submissions that we have already booked for 3 persons and paid at the time of booking and were not willing to listen and solve problem and no Manager was willing to come and talk and they really overcharged us There were no greetings by any staff member to any resident at any time and they showed a non concerned approach Except for the location there is nothing good in the hotel and next time we are not going to try any Mercure Hotel any where in the world, Nothing except its location
99807,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Paid 430 for 2 ngts in privilege room all photos show Eiffel Tower out of window so we were very upset to see a high rise block of flats out of our window as we were on the opposite side of hotel to the tower Surely you can not justify that price for both sides of the privilege floor , Overall location amazing Friendly helpful staff

99892,Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, It was our first time visiting the Eiffel Tower and we were really disappointed in the area nothing like we had expected The tower itself is amazing of course but is set in an area of average looking parkland There are few eating opportunities and the area between the tower and the hotel is of unattractive modern buildings We looked out of our hotel window to see a group of people sleeping rough on the roof of a neighbouring building , It is a clean and functional hotel Did the job for a single overnight stay
