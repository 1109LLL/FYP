397773,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The hotel is advertised as being adult only however I did see some children in the hotel There was also a child s hand print on the door of our room I don t have a problem with children being around and they did not cause any disturbance however I do feel that it was false advertising , I cannot praise the staff enough at this hotel They were incredibly helpful and friendly right down to the chef bringing around warm fresh crossaints to guests during breakfast The bed was very comfy the hot water actually stayed hot and we had a lovely view of the sea from our room window The gym was quite well equipped and I was lucky enough to have it all to myself one morning The lounge and pool area was a lovely place to catch some sunshine 
397774,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The only complaint i do have is that I think that paying for the beds on the pool terrace is very poor and very limited this should be a standard on any pool side as is the case in all hotels I ve been to all over the world especially that its only an adults hotel which means there should be no damage to them besides wear and tear,No Positive
397775,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Swiming pool and bar service are close at 8pm so you don t have proper place to chill out after a long day out Jacuzzy and Gym are in 2 floor really isoleted an close to the parking area For an hotel that advertise to be properly for adult people only it does not offer the services that you would expect to spent your days in a proper space in where you can relax comfortable, Really good service of breakfast and ubication so close to the beach
397776,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The hotel is quite a long walk from the city centre and many of the attractions as well as being far from the airport But we easily overcame this using the metro , Clean extremely comfortable bed great view of the sea Friendly staff and a very quick walk to the beach We were both really sad to leave 
397777,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, We have money stolen from us in the room Filed police rapport But no action on the end of the hotel to sort out the situation , Location Away from city
397778,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The bathrooms stink The canalization is old or not well maintained there are rooms with absolute no view you see just the wall of the next building The spa is not clean stinks and there is not a single chair to sit after a sauna, Close to the beach
397779,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The swimming pool is very small and the surrounding area is also small and they ask for minimum charge for the stretchers around the pool , Location
397780,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, information about the sun bed hire and the fact you had to pay 20 euros a day to sit on them no information about this prior to booking or when there unfriendly staff coming round telling you the prices and also telling you off for eating your own food and drink in that area again no information about this you had to buy from their menus 3 euros for a tiny bottle of water 5 euros for a very small glass of beer scandalous as a result the pool area was always very quiet first time I have stayed as a guest in a hotel and had to pay to sit next to a small pool on top , breakfast was good and reception staff very friendly and helfull
397781,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, I didn t like the extra cost for using the umbrellas and the sun chairs in the pool , I liked the breakfast and the bedroom The hotel was very clean 
397782,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Room wasn t ready until 3 30pm and wasn t cleaned the next day until the same time Which is quite late compared to other 4 star hotels From our room we could perfectly hear what was happening in the room next door which is really annoying Restaurant didn t have much choice for launch and dinner compared to the last time we were there , Staff is excellent Breakfast is excellent 
397783,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, You paid for both breakfast and sunloungers whilst I thought it was worth it would nice to have maybe one or the other included in the price or even some incentives to make you want to use them more , Breakfast was great it was on offer at a reasonable price of 12 per person However it was as much as you like It had everything you could want and even a chef to cook you an omelette with your choice of filling It was a great pool area for Barcelona very relaxed and great for couples Would definitely book this hotel again 
397784,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Excessive charge for breakfast Housekeeping was disorganised they were cleaning our room thinking we had checked out on day 2 of our 3 day stay On the Tuesday night on our return to our room there was an overwhelming smell of chlorine and when we entered our room our eyes were immediately burning The reception staff did find us another room but this was at the front of the hotel and very noisy The staff did not seem overly concerned that we could have come to a great deal of harm had we been asleep in the room They didn t provide an appropriate response or reason for the chlorine fumes , Close to the conference centre and walking distance to bars and restaurants 
397785,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, We only stayed one night it was expensive for the hours we were there as we were attending a festival nearby but all the hotels in that area are expensive, We were only there for about 5 hours in total but it was a lovely room clean comfy bed Staff were very friendly and responsive on reception Location good for the beaches bit of a trek into the centre of Barcelona
397786,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, nothing the only problem was sun burning at the beach , nice pool view clean comfort good bed perfect breakfast good location best facility kind nice staff
397787,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The breakfast is too expensive and should be included Sometines there is a strong fecal smell outside of the hotel due to the bad canalsiation system of the area , The location was excellent and close the beach 
397788,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only,No Negative, The only complaint would be that the pool was a little smaller than expected and very cold Other than that one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in 
397789,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Noise from the main road next to hotel We were on 7th floor and could still hear the road quite clearly in our room It could be with better double glazing to keep the noise out more , Nice swimming pool area Good breakfast choices Good location close to beach and not far to walk to Metro station 
397790,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, A little far from city centre small room and small pool I consider my stay 7 nights a little pricey , I loved the large bed truly healthy and rich breakfast I noticed the care that staff show to clients like personal notes welcome drink Cava mixed with fresh squeezed orange juice and help with directions 
397791,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The lift in the hotel to slow , Good location and brilliant breakfast However it s a struggle with the lift in the hotel It takes a awful long time to use it Sometimes you have to wait for several minutes I used the stairs instead Pool area is great with very friendly personal The old chef in the restaurant is great and they really did the best to make a nice breakfast for you Overall a very good hotel Supermarket close as well 3 min walk to the beach Gym is quite good as well I do train a lot so I was surprised A lot of hotel usually have no equipment and if that s the case I do not stay there 
397792,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Asked for a late check out and they tried to charge me without telling me and then they fixed Somebody tried to mug my bag at the corner of the hotel even though the waiter from the cafe saw me he just watched me no running after the guy or tried to help me I couldn t believe it The personnel is not that friendly or helpful except receptionists They dont change the towels daily and staff at the cafe maybe because of the language were not that friendly enough , Location is really convenient close to the beach 5 minutes walk 10 minutes walk to the mall diagonal mall and park Easy to find taxi in front of the hotel 
397793,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Nothing, Really lovely hotel and the location was perfect for us as we were going to Primavera Rooms were really spacious and comfortable and the staff were all lovely 
397794,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, We booked a double bed superior room for ca 160eur a night When we arrived we received a twin bed room As I was with my girlfriend on holiday I was not that happy We have been told that we can move the next day to another room so we waited On the next day we received another room with a double bed they said the double bed was just two twin beds put together with one sheet what the hell And this in a 4star hotel The room was also smaller dirtier there was pen ink on the toilet seat the sink was almost blocked I tried to complain over booking com but nothing was changed This is a big hotel managed by barcelo com It s a big corporation and you are just a name price category in their system Don t expect special care I m not booking any barcelo managed hotels anymore nor will I use booking com as an agency anymore as apperently they are only playing the middle man , Only the location if you want to be near the beach 
397795,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Rooms are getting a little tired You can see the wear , The staff was very helpful especially with a wheelchair we needed for one of our party 
397796,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, We were a bit surprised from the general behavior of the receptionists in a four stars hotel as when we passed through the reception they never hail smile or look at us and it is matter of courtesy but we were more concerned for the security in fact for example we entered in the hotel during the night and the receptionists didn t give neither a glance to us in this way everybody could enter without being checked When arrived we realized we have two single beds in the room then we asked for a matrimonial bed but the receptionist said it was not possible in that moment and that the day after we could switch room to take one with matrimonial bed The day after another receptionist changed the version saying they don t have matrimonial mattresses but that in our room they could join the two mattresses a bit disappointed because the first night we didn t touch the luggages because they said we have to change room The pool loungers are not for free The breakfast is not included on the site was written 15 per person but they took 17 , The room was clean and modern wi fi very efficient the staff in the external pool very nice breakfast was not included but very good with a huge variety External pool very nice to spend good and relaxing time If you are interest to the beach the position is perfect because you have it just in front of the hotel Far from city center about 20 minute walk but with 5 10 taxi you can reach port rambla 
397797,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Some staff members are rude especially to people from ethnic minority groups Also we emailed bookings com to ask for info about transport from the airport They replied to say that the hotel offered a complimentary collection from the airport This did not happen meaning we had to find alternative transport at last minute , The hotel is clean and tidy and the views are amazing Hydro pool is worth visiting
397798,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only,No Negative, Location was perfect for what we wanted not far from lovely bars on the beach and perfect for relaxing days Metro station close by an staff in hotel helped with us getting places About 30 minute walk to marina were more lively bars were but also bus behind hotel took 10 minutes Loved Barcelona can t wait to go back Hotel was spotless can t fault it
397799,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Nothing loved our stay , Definitely worth stay great hotel nice clean rooms in safe area Shopping Center and subway 5 mins walk away Center of the city not far away we went to town for dinner almost every night Definitely staying again Also great beach just across the road 
397800,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The room cleaning small room poor quality food for its price No tube line nearby Overall very expensive for a 4 stars hotel without the quality of one of them , The views staff attention
397801,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, having to reserve extortionately priced sun beds very expensively priced drinks we thought that the hotel would sell more if reasonably priced , the room was very comfy extra big bed breakfast extremely good comfy well laid out restaurant reception staff were superb very helpful literally 100 mt from the beach 
397802,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Our only negative is evening food not being available till 20 30 Forces you to go elsewhere Otherwise well done to all in the team we will be back ,No Positive
397803,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Nothing it was great, Perfect location super friendly helpful staff a really good hotel in every way it s like new I have been here for 5 days could nor see anyone ever disappointed staying here Mark Australia
397804,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only,No Negative, Booked this for my partners 21st birthday in May this year and cannot fault at all Property and staff exceeded our expectations and nothing was too much trouble during our stay Helped us create a memorable trip and make it just that little bit more special Thank you to everyone working at the hotel Phenomenal we will be returning 
397805,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only,No Negative, The view from the room was fantastic the sun deck and pool area where superb including the view chilled and relaxing aided by a cheeky cocktail from the bar Breakfast selection covered all requirements and staff where efficient and on hand at all times The rooms where spacious clean with very comfortable beds Location was over the road from the beach 10 minutes from metro station that could get you to any part of the city needed Around the hotel there was plenty of bars and resturants that where amazing And dotted around where little parks open areas to relax in Area was generally quiet no traffic even the main road the hotel is on caused no noise or issue I traveled with 4 others who all wanted something different from the holiday beach city sun soaking pool bars culture and the location as well as barcelona itself was the perfect spot to cover everyone s needs 
397806,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The cleaning maid was constantly entering our room without permission to see if we were there we went to Primavera Sound a music festival so expected to relax during the mornings and weren t really happy with having someone entering our room at will Never seen that before , Location and rooms in general Pool area 
397807,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The hot water took a long time to start working , The bed was so comfortable and so nice and big And I was especially impressed with the size of the bathroom and the shower head 
397808,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only,No Negative, We stayed at the hotel as it was close to Parc del Forum for Primavera Festival The cost was quite high which I imagine was due to the location at the time of the festival but it was within walking distance from parc del forum and the beach was a 5 minute walk Lots of little restaurants nearby in Poblonou and the H16 bus was 2 50 and took you all the way to the centre near la ramblas and the Gothic Quarter The rooftop pool and lounge area was perfect and although you had to pay to hire the loungers and beds which we felt was overpriced especially for guests already paying to stay there was plenty of space to lie on bean bags or ground area to lay your towel The rooms were cleaned daily and the hotel was very clean Staff were very attentive and we had a free bottle of cava as we were visiting for our honeymoon Overall a lovely stay and although very expensive it was in the perfect location for the festival 
397809,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The pool was not temperature controlled It s summer and the water is extremely chilly We re not too sure when would it ever be possible to use the pool in this hotel A bit disappointing for us as we were looking to go to the pool everyday ahead of the festival which was part of the decision for our group of 8 to book this particular hotel , Excellent location for us to get to the festival Primavera and rooms were very comfortable The staff are also very attentive and helpful 
397810,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, During check in nobody offered to take our luggage to the room despite the fact that the luggage guy was there or welcome drink The rooms are not so modern If you are booking a standart room 90 that you won t get a seaview instead you will have corner room with small window Also they have central air vent system that cannot be controlled by yourself You cannot set the temperature in the room because the room thermostat is centrally locked We were in the beginning of may and it was kind of chilly at night but due to the fact that airconditioning were giving non adjustable hot air and the only window you can open on half is 20 cm in width it was stuffy I asked the stuff three times first time they did totally nothing second time they send a repair guy which did not come at the third time they recommended me to open the window The pool is tiny maybe 60 cm in depth and non heatable at all Also I think that there is not enough place on roof terrace for sunbathing for such a big hotel during summer period The last day lunchbox was a total crap also I d better had a happy meal instead , The location is nice It is on the front sea line but actually you have still to come over a few roads and a few sidewalks to get to a beach approx 250m You can get a 500m walk to a bus station and get to the city center in 10 minutes The restaraunt and breakfast itself is nice Also you have a Nespresso machine in the room with free capsules every day Room cleaning works well 
397811,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The location is amazing across Mar Bella beach Swimming pool is very nice Room was comfy with an amazing view Gym was weirdly hidden in the underground but all in all it was good ,No Positive
397812,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Having to pay for sunbeds when staying at a hotel a little bit much Kept the pool area quiet , It s clean and comfortable with great customer service Felt they addressed all my needs and questions Right across the road from the beach Few issues with drainage smells but sorted straight away Views from the rooms were amazing 
397813,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Poor lounge bar area not very private or comfortable Poor selection at bar bar staff were not friendly I think the price was a bit high for the location , Overall a pleasant hotel Reception staff were helpful room comfortable but small Free safe was handy daily maid service was appreciated 
397814,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only,No Negative, The bed was super comfy and the staff very friendly It was our honey moon so the staff gave us a bottle of cava which was really nice The location is pretty far from the main part of the city though which was unfortunate but overall it was a nice stay The rooftop pool area is great but the price to rent a sunbed is extortionate Also the coffee served is from a nespresso machine I would have thought that would be included given the pods are on y 30 pence each and we were charged 3 euros a coffee 
397815,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The customer service was terrible There was no mention that all the sun beds etc would have to be hired You d think paying money in a hotel would allow you to use the sunbeds Also couldn t lay next to the pool however were given no reason why not Was told off for bringing outside water in the pool area on a hot day however no signs anywhere saying that this is not allowed My fianc got told off for wearing swimwear in the lobby when she was trying to find the bathrooms and the security embarrassed her and told her off in front of a group of customers checking in Also the wifi was terrible on our floor and whenever I called to enquire about it I was told it must be my device because theirs was fine even though 2 photos and an iPad had zero wifi connection For a hotel that is adults only they sure do treat you like children For the money you pay I WOULDN T stay here again and I ve stayed in a lot of hotels , The pool and the location to the beach 
397816,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, I couldn t figure out how to get the water running out of the shower head so had baths instead Found the tap tricky to figure out And hot water wasn t as strong as it could of been For me the location was a bit too far away from the city area where it was all happening it would of been nice to stay at this hotel in the hotter months it was still too cold for the beach in spring tho Would be great in summer I would probably stay closer to the city action while it s cooler got a bit expensive getting cabs to and from but the train station is a 15 min walk down the road so if you don t mind catching train then it wouldn t be so bad , It was a nice hotel and decent sized room The location was good right on the waterfront Would be good in summer 
397817,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Service was incredibly slow Getting a drink at the bar or pool lounge could take forever No one ever seemed to be able to take payment without going downstairs to check something with the manager Felt very hokey for a 4 star hotel that cost as much as it did Breakfast was also pretty terrible For 15E a person We just ate breakfast in one of the cafes on the beach Better scenery better service better price better food , Beds great Lovely location When the pool area was quiet it was also a lovely place to relax for the day 
397818,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The walls are extremely thin so we could hear our neigbour s phone calls every morning around 6 which was a bit disturbing Also it s a bit far from the city centre by public transport it takes 40 50 minutes to get in , The breakfast was really delicious and the staff was very nice and polite The rooms are always clean The beach is very close and not so crowded as Barcelonata 
397819,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Extra fee to access the sun terrace with the pool This came as a surprise and seems it s a seasonal thing , Few minutes walk to the beach nice breakfast reliable wifi 
397820,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, No kettle in the room, Staff were helpful and made every effort to make sure you enjoyed your stay The position of the hotel was excellent Breakfast was well presented and very comprehensive 
397821,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Nothing really could have more efficient service and housekeeping I guess , The area itself is so beautiful Could not have picked a better location to stay in local shops and cafes in walking distance as well as beaches too The clubs and main beaches are a 5min drive and the city centre is close enough too The rooftop terrace and infinity pool was mesmerising 
397822,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Some ofbthe rooms on the first floor are very isolated The airconditioner didn t work in our first room it was very cold first night and we had to change the room , The staff is very polite and helpful The area is perfect for walking and jogging The rooms are clean and there is very good complimentary coffee 
397823,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Only little negative points The room for the massage was perhaps a little cold and open to the ceiling so you can hear the people who are at the gym You have to wait a little so that the water in the shower is warm but nothing serious Unfortunately the Turkish bath did not work , I am once again very happy with the hotel chain Barcel The Occidental Atenea Mar is in a great location although a little far from the beaches of Barcelonette the metro station is a 10 min walk so very convenient The structure is modern and well maintained The reception the reception staff and all the staff in general is very cordial available and professional Very nice room with sea view even though there is a seaside road very clean with mini bar safe and coffee machine available The bed very comfortable the TV channels sufficient and the bathroom very functional We tried the room service the first night and the food was absolutely tasty with a very reasonable price The breakfast is always very good with plenty of choice and everything is absolutely fresh and good The little more the rose offered the day of Jordi a little attention very appreciated The Wi Fi in all the hotel works really well The massage was very good thanks to the lady from Argentina for her work Although I did not try the gym is very well equipped the Jacuzzi works very well The large terrace with lounge bar sunbeds and pool are absolutely wonderful Since the sun was at the rendez vous we were able to enjoy the sunbeds and the bar service thanks to Gomo for his kindness and availability You can relax have some great cocktails and even eat there 
397824,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, When I booked they took the cost of the hotel twice which took booking com a few weeks to sort out which was hassle I didn t need, Really lovely hotel exceptionally clean with really helpful staff
397825,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Rooms at first they gave as a room 132 at the end of the hall where you couldn t set the temperature This was very uncomfortable as it was quite chilly at night at the beginning of April As if that was not enough you could easily hear the traffic I reported the problem but only after 2 days did they offer to change the room So we received room 107 with sea view It was a little loud but it was warm On the next day we come in the room after a stroll on the beach to find the toilet in the middle of the bathroom There was no notice on the door no nothing They could at least inform us of the problem and apologize for the trouble But no The thing was that the cleaning lady reported the leaking toilet but it took a little while to repair it Thanks but that is no way to treat your guests Quite loud the hotel is situated on a one way street with 3 lanes and the windows don t do a good job of isolating the noise Payment policy after arriving they asked for my credit card to guarantee the reservation which I don t understand since they have my booking information Then when I gave them my ID I live in Germany but I am eastern european they wanted the whole amount in advance This was very peculiar because I have seen other guests paying at departure which is how you normally do it Pool very small , Good breakfast quite rich and tasty Good location next to the beach near to a shopping mall lots of restaurants in the area Poblenou very nice city quarter bus and metro stations in walking distance Very comfortable beds Parking possibility 
397826,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Simply nothing , The location was great away from the city and load noises just right next to the beach which s amazing the rooms are comfortable and the staff are friendly everything is great about this hotel
397827,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Unfortunately the hotel let itself down a lot Myself and friends have booked through booking com before and it has always been to a high standard this time however it was not Firstly for our entire time there we didn t have a shower when we first checked in I realised the shower was not working and went downstairs to complain the man at the desk said he was busy rude and there was no one else in the hotel this was a Sunday so he would have a look when he got the time too as we were going out he said he would leave us a note in the room once he had a look 8 hours later when we came back to the hotel the shower and still not been fixed so I went downstairs and asked a different male employee if he had any update on the shower he said I m sorry but the last guy didn t leave any note about your shower But he promised to send maintenance in the morning The next morning surprise surprise no one came The man said he had a look and the shower wasn t working thanks for confirming what we already knew but he would send maintenance Who never arrived We then asked a female employee the next day who said she would send maintenance but again no one came Overall very poor customer service I even asked them to tell the manager I wanted to speak to her him whenever they got a chance but nothing Shame House cleaning didn t replace our soap weird Air con had issues would become extremely cold and then hot without being touched Staff were useless The lady receptionist was the only one who even seemed to care Would not stay here again I told the staff I was not happy to pay approx 130 per night and not even have the opportunity to shower I feel let down by the hotel and booking com for suggesting it as they are usually excellent , Room was nice and not dated the location was good and the rooftop pool was enjoyable
397828,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The room for the massage was perhaps a little cold and open to the ceiling so you can hear the people who are at the gym The You have to wait a little so that the water in the shower is warm but nothing serious Unfortunately the Turkish bath did not work , I am once again very happy with the hotel chain Barcel The Occidental Atenea Mar is in a great location although a little far from the beaches of Barcelonette the metro station is a 10 min walk so very convenient The structure is modern and well maintained The reception the reception staff and all the staff in general is very cordial available and professional Very nice room with sea view even though there is a seaside road very clean with mini bar safe and coffee machine available The bed very comfortable the TV channels sufficient and the bathroom very functional We tried the room service the first night and the food was absolutely tasty with a very reasonable price The breakfast is always very good with plenty of choice and everything is absolutely fresh and good The little more the rose offered the day of Jordi a little attention very appreciated The Wi Fi in all the hotel works really well The massage was very good thanks to the lady from Argentina for her work Although I did not try the gym is very well equipped the Jacuzzi works very well The large terrace with lounge bar sunbeds and pool are absolutely wonderful Since the sun was at the rendez vous we were able to enjoy the sunbeds and the bar service thanks to Gomo for his kindness and availability You can relax have some great cocktails and even eat there I think thank you all the staff and I definitely think back to this hotel 
397829,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The hotel needs maintenance feelsmore like a 3 star cramped rooms very expensive for what you get, Good location free parking in front of hotel in weekends very good beds
397830,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The facilities were kinda old ventilation in bathroom almost didn t work You can hear the noise from hallway or in front of the hotel Getting into the parking is really weird I would be really worried if I would have gone with SUV or different expensive cars A little bit far from the city center , Nice view on the beach The look on hotel seems calm and peaceful You can walk directly on the beach just across the street Close to shopping mall Diagonal Mar 
397831,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Check in was not great The person checking us in was quite rude and unfriendly Luckily the rest of the staff were really nice and it was soon forgotten , The area was really nice with good bars and restaurants close by the pool was great and the rooms were clean and comfortable Being right next to the beach was amazing providing a really nice walk to and from the gothic quarter The people cleaning the rooms were also really friendly 
397832,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Unfortunately the hotel shows on Booking com as Occidental Athenea Mar on Paseo Garcia Faria HOWEVER the sat nav listed it as the Barcelona Athenea Mar on Passeig Garcia Faria so couldn t find it Very stressful when arriving in Barcelona for the first time by car after a very long drive , Extremely comfy beds brilliant shower great breakfast all in all any excellent stay 
397833,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Receptionist could have given us little bit of guidance on the best route to take for the nearest Metro station and the name too , The bed was very comfortable and the view of the town was really good 
397834,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, No view from very small room Not enough wardrobe space In fact I had to live out of my suitcase as there wasn t enough space, The size of the bed was fantastic and pillows amazing
397835,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, There s free sauna and fitness room for guests However there is no locker to put our clothes and no robe to go down to the the sauna rooms Where to leave the clothes The Jacuzzi water was cold so useless and the wet sauna did not work The rooms are small , The desk front staff are very helpful and smiling 
397836,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, I have requested double bed queen and I got to twin beds together for a young couple this is not so nice The room had street and some sea view but it is very nosy during the evenings being at first floor , staff facilities comfort
397837,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The hot tub steam room and tv remote didn t work Also we asked the staff some specific things not to do in the room and though they agreed it still wasn t done Lastly we booked a large double bed and got to single pushed together , The view was nice 
397838,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, all bed rooms facing the sea side are very noisy as facing the busy main road No air condition by night which make things worst as opening the windows by night make sleepless we change our bed room three times to other side of the hotel which facing not the city as it shows in their hotel details actually it is facing the huge c shape residential building and its gardens No air condition operate during this month and up what period no body knows which is very disappointed against what written in the hotel details as a policy of the hotel we have not good sleep at least two nights due to that Location quite far from centre of the city and at least 45 minutes by bus and eight metro stops, the bed rooms are clean and comfortable staff are helpful 
397839,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, No charm its a big hotel in a long line of others 45 min walk from city centre but taxis are cheap and its close to the beach , Comfy beds and since not in a busy area tranquil and quiet 
397840,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Air coditionning didn t work properly caused discomfort Said its air conditioning worked on website Pool wasn t heated, I liked the location beside the beach King sized bed and seaside view
397841,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The noise from the road was disturbing and did affect sleep The room was too hot on the first night heating only no air con so had to open the window and hence the noise Even with the window shut it was quite loud Hot water was plentiful but the tap had to run for about 10 mins before it arrived , Food was great very nice breakfast Location was superb lovely sea views Comfy bed and good WiFi Very clean Minibar and coffee tea and nice selection of toiletries Great spot for runners and cyclists with the coast path and beach just across the road 
397842,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The cleaning staff were not very good they didn t vacuum clean the room and the room had a bit of a smell so we had to open windows to air it a bit , Great hotel not far from the amenities and staff were great
397843,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The room service could have been better The selection on the menu isn t that good The restaurant menu could also do with having some more simple options on it In winter it would be nice to have the pool outside heated We would have definitely used it , The location is fantastic right on the beach and very central to the port and city centre The room and bathroom we had was large and the beds were so comfortable Our room was spotless Very nice views of the beach across the road The atmosphere in the hotel is really nice Taxi bay right outside the hotel is brilliant There is also a lovely restaurant next door to the hotel The hotel restaurant opens until 11pm which is handy if your on a late flight

397872,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The fact that our shower tap broke and continually spewed water out which could not be stopped When reported we were told that someone would come EARLY in the morning to fix it Obviously we would not accept this and we were moved at our suggestion to another room It was dealt with OK in the end but to suggest to a guest that they could listen to pouring water overnight and then be woken if they got any sleep by a maintenance person EARLY when they were on holiday was to say the least a little stupid and thoughless The new room was great better than the original one , Breakfast was superb could not fault it for the cost The restaurant looked fantastic with a good menu but sadly we did not get a chance to use it Very happy with our stay 
397873,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The room is in need of modernisation The floor tiles are nearly coming off The seat in the room is uncomfortable and old The towels have passed their use by date , It is well positioned on the sea front The room was spacious and reasonably quiet particularly being on a main road

397884,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, the location is a bit out of the way Me and my friend like to walk everywhere rather than be overcharged by the sneaky Spanish taxi drivers but it was a 60 minute walk into the centre of Barcelona Catalan which is a little heavy in the 28 degree heat However we did discover the true Barcelona culture because of this and there were shops and restaurants on the way which we decided to venture to instead , we got upgraded to the deluxe room and although the room was a little bit on the small size we put this down to the fact the bed was absolutely massive and soso comfy The rooftop terrace area with the bar and infinity pool are what made it for us very friendly staff Burger at the rooftop bar was the best burger I have ever had

397904,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Staff were poorly trained particularly at the roof bar where I often waited 20 minutes for a drink I found the staff to be quite dismissive and unhelpful On one occasion a manager was present who had excellent manner and I noted that staff performed better in his presence Rooms were not cleaned well The shower and hairdryer in the room broke intermittently Check in was delayed and this was relayed to us in a very rude manner On the whole there was a hostel like vibe at this hotel There was little attention to detail except when managers were present, Intermittently staff were helpful On one occasion the shower broke and a very helpful gentleman fixed it promptly 
397905,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The corridors I felt were a little dated and needed a bit of a refurb and the tiles near the lifts were all loose The jacuzzi was lovely but the room could do with a revamp its very musty and a bit dirty The breakfast is very overpriced and it wasn t very nice Although very friendly the staff could be pretty slow I think its a very overpriced hotel for drinks food and the sunbeds being 20 EURO for people already paying to stay there is a total rip off and 3 EURO for a small water in the mini bar , The beds were so comfy and great location minutes from Mar Bella beach Friendly helpful staff Jacuzzi and gym was great

397918,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, We got locked out of our room several times each time we had to go down to reception to tell them but the staff did not apologise for the inconvenience not they took any time to explain the problem despite me asking them We also found the staff at reception aren t very welcoming or cooperative or appear to be friendly happy , We like the new decor
397919,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Shower broke and they had to shut off our water for over 10 hours There wasn t any other room available so I had to shower at the gym Minimal sympathy from management All the extras we were looking for weren t really there mini fridge did not work safe deposit box in room didn t have batteries and front desk didn t have replacements no king size bed but two doubles made separately cost extra to rent a sunchair and umbrella by the pool one tiny ice machine for the entire hotel that constantly ran out of ice , Air conditioning worked well Very close to the beach Free towel usage for the beach Extra deep tub
397920,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Even though it s right by the beach it s a bit far from Barcelonata the main beach area and from the other main attractions at the centre A bit far from both the train bus stops 12 min away Internet was ok could be a bit faster Restaurants close by are a bit overpriced, Pool is really nice with a good view of the beach We asked for a an upper level room with Seaview and the very nice receptionist accommodated our request Breakfast was worth every penny Room size is decent and comfortable Availability of E bikes that you can rent Can take pool towels to the beach

397933,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, We were unluckily surprised when we had to wait one extra hour for our room to be prepared when checking in finally we had to complain about the room for not being what we have reserved via Booking com we ordered double room with 1 double bed 130 150 cm nad 1 single bed 90 110cm or so we got only two single beds and one extra bed which was not a proper bed bud folded out arm chair The new room in stead was a bit better but we got it after next 3 hours so lost 4 hours when checking in and the room was even smoky The last complain is about the room services when during 5 nights the room was cleaned only twice because the cleaning staff came always late when we were already in the room after 4pm or so First of all the hotel shouldn t offer a room for 3 the rooms are 4 rooms for two but for three it is like in small student dormitory and the price completely does not meet the dis comfort I would never again book this hotel and the only thing we did not complain and did not require reimbursement was that we did not want to waist our holiday time But the Booking com should check on the details and probably complain to the hotel instead of us We may be reimbursed some money but not the time we had to spend in the untidy and not corresponding room , very nice breakfasts nice roof swimming pool and gym location close to the sea

397935,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The first room we got was smelling like tobacco we had to ask to be moved to another room We have booked a superior double room in a 4 star hotel and we were only offered a small shower gel for two people There was no water boiler for making tea and the room facilities as such were quite basic The staff told me that a water boiler is only available in the deluxe type of rooms which I frankly find ridiculous that is the type of service you get even from a hostel I have also asked to be provided with more shower gel in 3 consecutive days but the room service people have always forgot Overall the staff felt somehow bothered by tourists I understand Barcelona gets busy in the summer but let s not forget we are paying for a service in a 4 star hotel and the expectations should be that they can deliver a better service than a hostel All in all while I have been to other Barcelo hotels and resorts and the service and facilities have been excellent the impression I got from this particular Barcelo hotel was not up to the quality of the Barcelo chain , Location was nice close to the beach and relatively central in Barcelona 
397936,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only,No Negative, Great people working at the Hotel from the Director of the hotel Michael and the management crew Nela and Esther They were able to solve initial problems and leave us with the best experience possible Very good breakfast served by great people especially Paco Verity of meats breads fruits freshly made juices and great ambient Close to the beach and just the right distance from city center

397947,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Could use a little more space in the room itself or a place to fit luggage in It seems like the bathroom is big so it takes the space of the main room , The location of the hotel is great for the primavera festival goers It is a 15 minutes walk to parc del forum Quiet rooms comfortable bed large bathroom and shower
397948,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, Huge disappointment They do not treat guest seriously We d booked hotel more than month before our stay We d had two requests one single bed which is available when you re choosing room and second high floor I recieved e mail from hotel that both are accepted Guess what we ve had two single beds and a room on a first floor The room was EXTREMELY NOISY because of cars and pedestrians Walls are like they were made from paper Broken shower broken toilet One is sure it was not like four star standard , Location is very well

397966,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, there were no TV channels in English apart from news channels This was disappointing I am not sure if this is common but there could have at least been subtitles in English , I liked the fact that it was so near the beach I like the selection at breakfast but would have liked there to be more of the basics of an English breakfast as well eg fried eggs beans The staff especially reception staff were very helpful and gave good directions to the main transport for tourist attractions I like the provision of complimentary biscuits and tea The beds were very comfortable the room was nice and had a good view
397967,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The room was a little tired Bits of paint had peeled from some surfaces and a few curtain hooks were hanging down , Great view of the beach and the sea We had room service which was delivered promptly by a very pleasant and professional member of staff

397970,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, There are two big avenues in front of the hotel and one can hear the cars even in the night It is not very loud but if you are used to complete silence to fall asleep it could be a little unpleasant , Very nice place We enjoyed the gym and the spa jacuzzi and sauna a lot after having walked for hours in Barcelona It is not very close to the center but in the end it was even better less crowded calmer The Poblenou Rambla is very close and it is better than the Rambla in the center at least you can have a walk without slaloming among people We tried the hotel restaurant once and it was quite good and not too expensive People are nice the bedrooms are comfortable clean and well equipped We are happy about our holidays

397997,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The noise from the street despite the windows being tightly shut It was advertised as a beach hotel and yet the beach was almost 400 500m away , The staff were friendly
397998,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The only problem about the hotel is definitly its location which is not close the night life places After midnight the only option to return back to hotel is to catch a cab The taxi drivers are not in a hurry because taximeters are running either you go or stop So when you stop in red lights which are quite frequent in the city you can pay different price in every occasion , This is a very simple but convenient fascility The rooms are kinda less is more The bed is comfortable The bathroom is clean The hotel has a sea view which is perfectly reflecting that you are in a sea city There is a metro station in close neighborhood One can access to everywhere either directly or with a train change

398003,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The breakfast room is quite small resulting in some queuing and the choice felt quite limited after a few days of the same thing On one or two occasions I felt that couples who spoke Spanish were given tables ahead of me despite being behind me in the queue When I checked out for my trip to Sitges I was advised that I owed money for borrowing beach towels and parasols during my stay The in room literature asks guests not to take room towels to the beach but to get a beach towel from Reception but makes no mention of a charge In fairness though when I expressed surprise as I hasn t been told about this the hotel waived the cost straight away As with most hotels in Europe it seems the only English TV channels available were news channels whereas other countries had more variety Obviously I wasn t there for the TV but it would have been nice to unwind after a hard day s sunbathing with something other than world news , The hotel is excellently situated for the beach which is just a 5 minute walk away There s also easy access to the city from the nearby Metro station The staff were very friendly with a special mention to Melissa who went out of her way to help I broke my stay at the hotel with 3 days in Sitges and when I returned to the Atenea Mar for my last night she made a point of welcoming me back When I was unable to arrange a late check out on my last day the hotel was fully booked she advised I could store my luggage and then when I d finished enjoying my last day on the beach I could use the showers in the basement gym to freshen up and supplied me with a keycard accordingly All the benefits of late check out without the extra cost The hotel restaurant was also good The gym and spa were a good way to unwind Tea and coffee facilities plus iron and ironing board were supplied in the room as standard a nice touch 
398004,Occidental Atenea Mar Adults Only, The mattrasses easily slipped away and the elastic springs stung hard in the back, 3 minutes to the beach Busstop and metro nearby Nice good organised and helpful personal
