309513,City Rooms,No Negative, A wonderful place to stay We arrived quite early in the morning and we were very fortunate to able to check in so early The room was clean spacious and very comfortable In a quiet area with lovely views out the window Would highly recommend and hope to return some day 
309514,City Rooms, 4 less positive issues no air conditioning in a very hot night a lot of noise coming from the neighboring rooms no stores to cut off the light and lack of waters in the distributor , Facilities central enough for the town very comfortable bed and well organized after hours check in 
309515,City Rooms, Facility is really poor Bed wardrobe and table Found no cups or glasses for water Think it is 2star hotel Bathroom smelled with smoking i think it was from ventilation, Location 10 min by walk to Rathaus
309516,City Rooms, The reception was open only between 9 12 and 13 17 We had a flight at night and checked out from the room Therefore our luggages were in some special room and we hadn t got the key So you can t expect a personal who is at the reception all the time , The location was perfect 
309517,City Rooms, There was not temperature control in the room and it was too warm We did open the windows but it was noisy at times Otherwise it was very comfortable ,No Positive
309518,City Rooms, Quite poor door between closet and bedroom Closed window did not allow to get any view on the street Poor noise insulation We could hear not only inhabitants but every trum going nearby , Decent location not far from RauntHause Quite cheap Easy to pay and order Good staff Soft and clean bed good bathroom 
309519,City Rooms, We were not informed about the construction going on in the hotel before and i was in shock when we were there see pictures Although they said it will be between 10 5pm noise started at 8 30 in the morning We could not even open the door because it was covered due to construction see from pictures If i knew i would definitely pick another hotel becase there are many nice hotels around for the same price It was really dissapointing Also only three floors in the building belongs to hotel and there was a huge party in 4th floor until 3 30am Since its not part of hotel nobody did anything there was no receptionist and we couldnt sleep that night I also could not connect to their wifi from different devices but this was really a minor problem compared to others Overall i do not recommend to stay there at least until construction is over , There was cleaning everyday and location was good Bus and tram stops are reallt close 
309520,City Rooms, THE ENTRANCE WAS VERY BAD AND DISAPPOINTING AND COULD MAKE ME LEAVE THE CITY ROOMS CHANGE IT THE REST PLACE AT THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOORS HAS GOOD APPEARANCE RUBBISH IN THE ENTRANCE AND NO ONE CLEAN THE PLACE FOR 3 DAYS SHAME NOISY AND NARROW BED ROOM BECAUSE OF A RESTAURANT UNDER MY WINDOW, VERY GOOD BREAKFAST VERY KIND AND HELPFUL STAFF AT THE RECEPTION AND THE KITCHEN
309521,City Rooms, there was no air conditioning in the room and it was very hot being summer so it was difficult to sleep, the location central ease of access close to university and lots of nice places to eat beautiful functional room
309522,City Rooms, We had a room leading onto the main street so in the mornings it could be a bit loud because of trams and general traffic , The breakfast buffet was rich and we could take as much as we needed the beds were comfy and the bathroom was clean and big enough 
309523,City Rooms, I had to change my room twice first due to strong smell of cigarettes and then because there was no hot water for 2 days on the third floor , The location is OK close enough to the Rathaus there is a bus stop of one of the Vienna airport lines 
309524,City Rooms, No reception staff available for the whole day night They are offering the rooms next to the reception which is quite inconvenient Reception staff No elevator from the entrance stairs which is inconvenient for lifting heavier baggage, The location
309525,City Rooms, As the others have said the entrance to the building is a bit off putting but only downstairs The carpeting in the room could definitely use some renovation and the drainage in the shower was slow The curtains didn t really block out the light in the morning The reception only works quite limited hours , The location was perfect for me close to the AKH campus where I needed to be and one minute from a tram stop The staff were extra helpful including things such as getting hold of a kettle which was not in the room by default or a pressing iron and board switching on the heating and taking care of a late arrival Didn t try the breakfast but there are excellent options nearby including the lovely Cafe Florianihof Of course it s not a Ritz but great value overall especially for Vienna 
309526,City Rooms,No Negative, Everything was just great The high quality service for this price seems a perfect ratio Nice big bathroom with a window very clean stuff is friendly always ready to help and multilingual nice breakfast fast WIFI Vending machine in the lobby where I could get some snacks was a good advantage I was a bit worrying because of the late check in as the front desk works till six but everything went smoothly with a keybox Also great location in the centre everything is within a walking distance Definitely will stay there again when coming to Vienna Thank you for making my stay in Vienna so comfy 
309527,City Rooms, The variety of food in the breakfast menu is poor and insufficient and the quality of the coffee leaves a lot to be desired I would recommend a decent coffee machine fruit yogurt different types of cheese also spreadable and the decent bread and baked goods Vienna is famous for , Spacious room Pleasant staff Good location 
309528,City Rooms, The coffee quality was bad and the breakfast boring I spent 3 days in the room without a rubbish bin I have told this to the cleaning lady but she did not understand , The room was comfortable and quite without noise Good for sleeping 
309529,City Rooms, there was a loud club underneath the rooms it was only a problem on one evening but i was so loud we couldn sleep ad it didn stop till 3 in the morning, friendly stff and extrememly handy for walking ino own
309530,City Rooms,No Negative, Excellent position close to the city center Tram lines 5 and 33 Laudongasse stop Bus 13A from Wien Hauptbahnhof cleaning of the room kindness of reception s staff 
309531,City Rooms, The WiFi was terribly slow not good when you are on business travel and not good enough to sustain a video Skype meeting The reception is only staffed four five hours a day which could be a problem if you arrive late for check in , Nice rooms with all your needs covered 
309532,City Rooms, We had to have an ice cold shower a couple of times as there was no hot water We would have had breakfast but it didn t look like there was much to choose from , Most comfortable bed I ve ever slept in Very clean apartment helpful staff and good transport links 
309533,City Rooms,No Negative, The lady working at the check in was really kind she even gave us the tip where to park our car and which tickets to get The guy that was with her was rather quiet and seemed uninteressted The bed was really comfortable The electricity is activate with the room key card which is good in one way cause you cant forget to turn off things but its bad cause you cant leave anything to charge while youre out But all in all it was an amazing stay and its really clean and cozy would do it again 
309534,City Rooms, The walls are very thin and you can listen to every little thing that is going on but we had very quiet neighbors You have to keep in mind that the reception is available only in certain hours every day especially if you want to check in out That is not an issue once you know it and can make your arrangements in advance Overall we had a very pleasant stay , The room was big comfortable and clean The hotel is located in a 25 walking distance from the city center but you can also use the tram or the bus to go where you want We really enjoyed staying there and would totally recommend it Also the staff was very kind and helpful 
309535,City Rooms, I didn t receieved a key code then in order to access to the room I had to make international calling which cost me extra money The refrigeration didn t work and the table lamp didn t work as well , Good location double bed is very comfortable private and clean toilet and very good internet connection
