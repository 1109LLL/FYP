500929,NH Danube City, Cleanliness location is great like 400 meters far from metro station and 1 station to the famous Danube shopping centre , The staff were extremely helpful and professional 
500930,NH Danube City, Nothing , The room that I was in was spacious and the bed was comfortable The work desk was also convenient for people who travel for work The WiFi was fast Breakfast was a good spread of Continental style While these may not be the fondest for tourists from Asia I had no contention with what was offered 
500931,NH Danube City, Cooling the temperature used to be 24 25 in the room Irrespective if you kwt the air con on for a few days in length, Air condition was not working at all we did not sleep for 5 nights as it was too hot Staff was very polite and helpful though they did all they can and also gave us a fan from the lobby in our room I understand that these places have rains and winters most of the time of the year but not any more due to global warming the climate across the globe is changing and keeping that n mind they need to boost their air conditioners We changed a few rooms but then understoood that the air condition strength was not as per the requirement of the climate 
500932,NH Danube City, Parking was not easy We had to use the little street behind the hotel building where there were no reserved parking places We were lucky to be able to find a free place , Extremely nice breakfast nice staff convenient bed clean room superb accommodation 
500933,NH Danube City,No Negative, Everything a lavish breakfast buffet The staff gave us an early check in almost 7 hours early and upgraded our room for a reasonable fee Very helpful and methodical staff Location is a bit outside the city but connectivity via metro is excellent 
500934,NH Danube City, There are no parking options at the hotel Fortunately during the weekend parking is free on the streets , Very nice room with a comfortable bed Breakfast was amazing tasty food with incredible variety Hotel is situated very close to the metro station 
500935,NH Danube City, I experienced a price mismatch during my booking The next day of my reservation the same option was offered at a lower price , Personnel was really helpful The refreshment offer in the lobby was also nice but it can be improved 
500936,NH Danube City, This hotel needs to significantly improve customers service First day I check the fridge and it did not work I was told to wait 15 minutes After 45 minutes nobody showed up Why nobody checked it before I came in Why I had to wait almost an hour and only after I called back I got someone taking care Second day I ordered something to eat I was told to wait 15 minutes After more than 1 hour nobody showed up Why nobody called me just to letting me know I had to call more than three times and every time the answer delayed the delivery in 20 minutes Third day the key did not work And many other issues Just does not worth the price , The hotel is quiet and clean 
500937,NH Danube City, There was king size bed in our booking as we were with a small baby But unfortunately we got an ordinary small bed for two Also everything in the room was equipped as for one guest All stuff towels blanket we had to look for in a cupboard which was not pleasant The impression was like they were welcomed only one person , The breakfast was nice The room is ordinary not bad Nice view from high floors 
500938,NH Danube City, No swimming pool no wellness only one tiny sauna Extremely confusing IT S NOT A WELLNESS HOTEL No parking lot I could only park in approx 800m from the hotel down the street , Underground is close to the thotel 
500939,NH Danube City, I didn t like the parking underground parking is 32 or 35Euro s per day and you must catch a parking space under the bridge of the subway or in the front street which is very hard to find Also the bathroom doesn t have ventilation , I like the room the staff was very friendly Lidia very nice girl the location is very close to the subway 
500940,NH Danube City, Noisy even on 16th floor aircon smelly and didn t work properly waited 45 mins for dinner Got confirmation on lower level room max 4th still got one on the 16th , Bed is comfortable
500941,NH Danube City, Bedding is not good at all They provide single beds bedding I really dont know how to sleep with them And also the aircorn blows cold air I ended having a serious flue , It is very close to the IAEA 
500942,NH Danube City, very noisy if like me you like to open the windows and room faces the street but really silent with windows closed , proximity to the Vienna International Center nice bar for hanging out nice views from higher floors
500943,NH Danube City, No, Location is great Staff was helpful Plus it is easy to get on the airport bus from the hotel There were free cookies in the reception and they tasted good 
500944,NH Danube City, They only gave a single duvet for a double bed there was supposed to be a second single duvet in the room but there wasn t We rang reception but had to wait over two hours for the second duvet to be brought to our room The fridge wasn t working, Bed was comfortable less the duvet Room was spacious
500945,NH Danube City, Apart from the drinks snacks to be paid for there could be some items freely available such as bottled water The free wi fi is also a bit slow and you have to pay to upgrade to a high speed one , The location is excellent for the Austria Centre Vienna 10 minutes walk or the Austrian International Centre 5 minutes walk The V3 coach from the airport also arrives at and leaves from literally in front of the hotel very convenient By taking the U1 metro you will be in the city centre within 8 minutes The hotel is clean and and staff are very friendly and helpful The nice restaurant and 24 hour pizza service is a real bonus if you are too busy with your business during the day 
500946,NH Danube City, Lifts were slow at conference time there were long waits , Very comfortable rooms Good breakfast and helpful staff VAL3 bus from airport will get you to the hotel inexpensively 
500947,NH Danube City, A little old could use new coat of paint The WIFI should be faster Could be a little cheaper , Breakfast and business center was excellent 
500948,NH Danube City, Nothing at point of writing, Very friendly and helpful staff i was offered late checkout on sunday and i really appreciated the staff s proactiveness as my plane departure is at 8pm 
500949,NH Danube City, My meal for the dinner pasta was not that good and the wifi in the rooms is so slow that we can say that there is not really a wifi connexion , My room 212 was great and comfortable The breakfast is nice as well 
500950,NH Danube City, The temperature in the room cannot be controlled by the guests I had my toddler with me and the room was super cold I asked the personnel at the reception to adjust it but they could not This was very unpleasent My co workers in other rooms had similar experience The comforters were extremely small narrow I had never seen such a thing Not comfortable at all during sleep , Similar to other NH hotels it was very quiet and very clean The breakfast was very good A suitable place for business trips 
500951,NH Danube City, The hotel s lobby and bar area where under renovations during my stay but I received no warning from Booking even though from signs in lobby apparently had been the case for over a week Honestly had I known I would have booked elsewhere as wanted a proper bar and restaurant upon arrival and that area of town has nothing around Breakfast was served in a conference room fine and the bar restaurant temporarily moved there as well such a sorry ambiance I didn t even use the free drink coupon was offered ,No Positive
500952,NH Danube City, Free wifi is terrible You can get additional speed for a fee , We got a very good deal on the price The hotel is very comfortable close to the subway and sightseeing buses stop There is some shops and a supermarket close by 
500953,NH Danube City, Furniture , During our stay we had contact to three different employees at the check in desk and two employees at the bar All of of them where very friendly without any exception When we checked in Ms Wilson offered us an upgrade of 10 per night A good deal which she sold well to us and was worth the money Very good beds with quality matresses Nice and clean bathroom Had a room on the 16th floor Perfect view Quiet It is of course always an advantage to have a room on a higher level It s the better rooms and the noise level is reduced street In addition there is a coffe machine with capsules in such rooms which I found very comfortable One thing you might won t like is that the furniture is not brand new but please if anything else is ok you have to overlook certain things So dont expect modern brand new rooms but you can and should expect clean and good equiped room room with as little marks an spots on walls and furniture as possible In our room that was the fact So you might consider an upgrade as well The room had a decent size Behind the Hotel there is public parking space for free The tube is very close approx 300m around the corner All together we found the Hotel worth the four stars 
500954,NH Danube City, There is a draining problem of the wash basin , The staffs are very friendly They also provide taxi transfer service to the airport The breakfast service is excellent Various cheese breads bacon crumble eggs and coffee are in a good taste 
500955,NH Danube City, There was a general WiFi outage which took 30hours to be fixed Totally unacceptable We had to use roaming data on the smartphones for which the Hotel did not offer any compensation , The location is perfect if you are attending a conference at the Vienna Conference Centre It s 5 minute by walk Getting to the city center is also easy with the subway 2min walk Rooms are spacious and comfortable Overall good experience and the hotel s restaurant is good 
500956,NH Danube City, Asked for double rooms in the Booking app but got both twins They don t seem to know too much about Booking com workflow Although I presented the booking number we spent 10 minutes trying to find the 2 rooms by name Did not get any Genius welcome drink , Clean rooms and varied breackfast Close to Alte Donau metro station to get to the city center 
500957,NH Danube City, I would prefer a bigger blanket , The breakfast was good and well served and the personnel had a very good attitude and were helpful The room had a nice view 
500958,NH Danube City, The kinchen closes a bit early so a late supper is not possible when you come back from the city centre , The hotel work very well for a business trip to Danube City VIC 5 min walk to subway takes you to the city center in another 10 min I asked for a quiet room it was indeed very quiet

500960,NH Danube City, Poor flow from shower some front desk staff a little cool and slow service in restaurant bar if busy, A very comfortable hotel with great views from upper floors very comfortable bed all amenities excellent Good restaurant choices and friendly staff
500961,NH Danube City, Still NH has high priced breakfast, That s a good example of NH hotels as a business hotel Nicely decorated professional staff comfortable rooms Accessing the wonderful gym round the corner for free is GREAT Fantastic WiFi 
500962,NH Danube City, I gave my credit card to reception before check in and they blocked few hundred Euros as a kind of gurantee Passed over a month since that moment and after many e mails corespondance with a lot of lies from them they are still laisy to do theyr duty to unblock that amount to my bank Unbelivable ,No Positive
500963,NH Danube City, The tour agency was not organized and failed to deliver its promises , Location residential business area Connect easily to river side or live city Thanks to the proximity to U bahn stations The place is always quiet and clean 
500964,NH Danube City, You couldn t find fried eggs and omelette Every day No pool, Hotel is only walking distance from metro station Very close to Danub Supermarket nearby Friendly staff Good breakfast
500965,NH Danube City, Too expensive vs the quality offered No heating working only cold feature was working and was 10 degrees Even i have asked for a king size bed in the booking i had 2 separate small single beds Pillows not comfortable and not option to select any other for such a price it s not acceptable , Location
500966,NH Danube City, the interior of the hotel is not worn but old fashioned rather 80ties style The restaurant is not very cosy One of the first evenings I forgot my book in the wellness area I went back the following day to the reception and was told that nobody from the housekeeping was there anymore and that I should return the next day I went back to the reception the next day the gentleman checked the computer and told me that nothing has been found I accepted but when I went back to the wellness there was another staff member who I asked about my book He was very kind and went to check after five minutes he was back with the book , friendly staff nice wellness area
500967,NH Danube City, We didn t rent car It is a little bit of a walk to the underground but not too bad It is in a safe part of town which made the walk feel secure , The breakfast was great The room was comfortable and clean The staff was warm and friendly We didn t spend much time in our room so it was very adequate It pays to book early the price goes up the closer to the date of your booking 
500968,NH Danube City, Plain furniture The colors were rather cold dirty yellow and blue and gave the room a very strange feeling The 2 windows were not in the middle of the wall but each near the walls and the wall between them was covered with a curtain Great illusion but overall I think the room was too dark and cold , Amazing breakfast Spacious room and bathroom with tub it was beyond our expectation The bed and the pillows were very comfortable too 
500969,NH Danube City, The buffet layout for breakfast could do with some work it was like Piccadilly Circus with trays and they have a very odd selection of speciality hamburgers on the menu they managed to supply me with the wrong one which featured but really really shouldn t have olives and Manchego cheese though the burger itself was good , Conveniently located for Vienna International Centre and close to a Metro stop 
500970,NH Danube City, Breakfast was quite chaotic waiters were moving tables around and at 9 30 a lot of bread cakes had finished Find a way not to use the local parking lot it is 34 a day , Staff was superb helping us in a few problem we got during our stay 
500971,NH Danube City, The mattress in our double bed was like a water mattress if one person moved the other person felt it too , After the first night we ask the receptionist to change our room The receptionist met us and offered us a new room with two single beds 
500972,NH Danube City, Reception gave by mistake our room key to another guest so in very early morning my pregnant naked wife found somebody else in our room while getting out of shower And this was actually good because inside room we had everything luggage with passports money cameras intranet connected job laptop keys of home keys of car and so on I travel around 200 days every year and this is the first time I experience something like this Price in the end was 10 euro more than what booked on booking com Embarrassing unacceptable unprofessional dangerous ,No Positive
500973,NH Danube City, Rooms could be refurbished Single bed very tight Value for money could be better , Nice location but not very central close to next public transport with connection to city center each few minutes walking distance 5 10 min 15 minute ride to city center Stephansdom Close to recreation area Donau Insel Neue alte Donau nice view especially from upper floor nice hotel bar area bathtube available bed was good pillow was good big bathroom nice and friendly staff check in check out fast enough and professional
500974,NH Danube City, Only one thing that I am disappointed was the bed isn t one double bed I never thought it will be 2 bed actually, All are good The staffs are so friendly and helpful
500975,NH Danube City, The welcome drink was not mentioned by the staff we don t care much about it and we parked on the street outside, Great choice for breakfast quiet room nice bathroom
500976,NH Danube City, the parking facility was too low the car luggage on top was too high the cocktail from the bar was awfull and expensive , everything was neat and tidy on arrival 
500977,NH Danube City, Parking is at the IZD building behind the hotel and costs 33 eur night however parking on the street is for free from Saturday 6pm till Monday morning so if you are coming over the weekend just park on the street , Was amazing one night stay convenient location spacious room clean and tidy upgraded to a superior room and really enjoyed it Breakfast was great selection 
500978,NH Danube City, The professionalism of front desk receptionist I ve forgotten in my room the power cord of my laptop source but the morning shift said they didn t find it I stayed in the hall few hours due to late hour of my flight and the front desk shift changed When I was about to leave I ve put the same question to new receptionist the power cord was found , The hotel was perfect for a business trip that I had for one day in Vienna I ve chosen this hotel due to its proximity to the office where I had the meeting 1 minute to walk in between The room was very generous which I liked very much I m not feeling comfortable when some space constraints occur my staying I had the room at 11th floor so the windows are not free to be widely opened it s common approach in order to prevent accidental falls from window or balcony met in many countries The air conditioner was functioning when I entered into the room very nice gesture given that the outside temperature was around 37 C Everything was shines cleaning The bathroom very spacious also equipped with all the necessary consumables In the morning I had a good breakfast buffet style 
500979,NH Danube City, nothing, The NH hotel is ideally located for the UN It is also on the direct U bahn to the city centre and in the other direction to the beaches on the alte donau The airport bus stops right outside for only 8 Euros leaving bus stop 9 at the airport every 10 mins past the hour

500986,NH Danube City, Remember to specify a double bed I got two singles The breakfast buffet was very expensive so I ordered a small breakfast to my room for about half the price It seems to be a business hotel so probably a lot of people charge it to their business expenses I had difficulty opening the door to my room A maid showed me the trick which was to swipe the card and then turn the handle hard and push hard The card also deactivated the day before I left When I arrive back I m generally tired from walking around Vienna and then I don t like having to return to reception , Clean reasonably priced good room service it s close to the underground the Vienna international centre and there are a few shops around Provides a taxi transfer service to the airport 40 Euro There s complimentary tea and coffee service in the room It has the ambience of a business hotel somewhat removed from the centre but close to the underground This helps to keep costs down
