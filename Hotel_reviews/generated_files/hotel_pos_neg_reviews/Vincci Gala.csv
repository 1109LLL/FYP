433036,Vincci Gala, nothing really everything was perfect, i liked every thing location is perfect almost near every thing Rambla street is in 5 min walk plaza center and the bus for airport is 5 min walk or less metro station is less than 1 min walk staff is very friendly Specially a great Mariano the guy work in the coffee shop the rooms are very nice and comfy with a very good isolation i stayed for 4 nights and was the best choice i made to see Barcelona highly recommended and definitely will repeat 
433037,Vincci Gala,No Negative, I think it s the best 4 star hotel in Barcelona been to a few but this one by far easily tops them all Got a 24 hr 7 11 in front of it and then he metro station less than 100 meters away plus room service food was amazing would highly recommend it 
433038,Vincci Gala, The free internment is very slow, Location is great and the rooms r very clean and comfortable the staff were very very very nice and friendly special thanx to Judith
433039,Vincci Gala, Nothing to report, Very warm staff at front desk They accommodated our wish of being in the top floor which offered us a brilliant view of the city and especially of Sagrada Familia Very positive impression about the decor and overall look Room was very comfortable and with a correct space Very good location allowing us to experience the city center without the noise and confusion attached to it 
433040,Vincci Gala, First of all after the first night we needed to change the room because it was to much noise from the street the windows are not properly sealed so you can hear all the noise from the street even people talking because it s a very crowded street They changed our room whit a smaller one but the bonus was that it was on the back side of the hotel and it had a terasse Even there at the first floor you can here and feel the subway train bellow When we changed the room we forgot some clothes 3 t shorts 2 pairs of pants and 2 night dresses so when we figured it out like in about a couple of hours we asked for the reception to check and to bring them to us but to our surprise the clothes was gone they couldn t find them they even asked if we were sure to forget them there After that we didn t trust them to clean the room anymore So we were pretty disappointed that they acted like this For sure i would not come back there anymore Also the personal was not friendly at all and the hotel was more like 3 stars and not 4 Last year we stayed at a 3 star hotel near the center and it was a far better experience and much cheaper , as you exit the hotel if you go to the left you will find a really good restaurant and impressive personal Also the good thing was that the hotel was situated near the center of the town 
433041,Vincci Gala, Walls a little thin as you could hear the next room Tv and we had kids next to us who came home 11 30pm and were very very noisy No street noise however internal guest noise was very loud , Location of hotel very good Maybe direction from the street metro exit could be clearer as it is a little confusing as it is at a big intersection
433042,Vincci Gala, Staff is the only problem when you enter the hotel at 10PM and have a child with you the best scenario is to be welcomed registered and invited to your room RATHER than spend 20 minutes for check in being asked to pay at check in and beeing charged for the kid even if NO extra bed is required Maybe the hotel policies would have to specify that extra charge is not for extra bed but simply for kids as I can perfectly understand that Also would be good not to answer the phone for some other client in order to minimize the time spent at check in by the client already waitting at 10 PM Check out has taken the same amount of time as most probably there are a lot of interns learning hotel bussines there So finaly you have to try to check out with the first one the second one and then finaly the senior one being able to do check out forms , The room was nice and the location was really close to metro station 
433043,Vincci Gala,No Negative, 5 min from Placa Catalunya from where you can catch the Aerobus to the airport a direct bus to Tibidabo 10 min from Arc de Triomf 20 min from La Pedrera and 30 min from La Sagrada Familia all on foot The Urquinaona metro station line L1 is around the corner There s a supermarket open 24h just across the street a pastry shop and small restaurant next to the hotel Spacious and clean room very big and comfortable double bed the biggest we ve had in years in a hotel excellent wi fi signal air condition worked perfectly on request they change the towels every day good selection for breakfast helpful and friendly staff cozy bar and terrace on the ground floor where you can chill out and relax 
433044,Vincci Gala, the price was high for this quality room wasn t clean enough hotel facilities was poor for ex room service, the location is good the staff was helpful
433045,Vincci Gala,No Negative, The Wifi was working everywhere the combination of modern inside and historical building is very nice Rooms are spacious staff very friendly It is ideal for Shopping and City tour but since this is a Business trip unfortunately too less time
433046,Vincci Gala, dont have any , Perfect location max 5 min to Pl Cataluna La Rambla etc Very good welcoming the rooms are big enough and well designed we did not take their breakfast so that I have no idea about it 
433047,Vincci Gala, The receptionist on duty the day we checked inn around 2300 hours wasn t friendly but helpful I guess she was new , Staffs are really helpful especially Mohammed at the front desk and the location is close to the metro and city centre
433048,Vincci Gala, The hotel safety is a bit weak everyone can enter and go to the rooms upstairs The elevators should be protected so only guests staying at the hotel can have access to the rooms upstairs, The bed was very comfortable and the personnel at the reception very helpful
433049,Vincci Gala,No Negative, The hotel is in a great location really easy walk to La Rambla for example The staff were very helpful The room was lovely very big bed and clean bathroom 
433050,Vincci Gala, The shower was a complex affair and impossible to fathom how to control Music in breakfast room loud and invasive so early in the day Steep stairs within room directly on entering so luggage had to be hauled up and down , Very comfortable bed Breakfast good Concierge and front desk helpful Lovely sofa alcoves Good location 
433051,Vincci Gala, Shower not too easy to handle Noisy people in next door room Very slow check in the slowest ever experienced , Comfort of the beds and pillows Cleanliness of the whole hotel Proximity to Catalunya Square Sweets and drink in reception Bar staff
433052,Vincci Gala, TV signal was really bad Sometimes there were channels without sound sometimes there were very blurry channels with sound Internal lock was broken which was not possible to lock the room from the inside , Easy to arrive from the airport 1 Take metro L9S from airport then transfer to L1 get out from station Urquinaona Hotel is 5 minutes of walk away 2 Take AeroBus from airport then get out from Pla a de Catalunya then walk 10 minutes to Hotel Vincci Gala Quite a few supermarkets and coffee shops nearby and post office is just 2 minutes of walk away Staff are nice and room is very clean we can even see La Sagrada Familia from our room

433066,Vincci Gala, room a bit small hotel employees english poor though not very disturbing noise coming from the street breakfast until 10 30, new hotel nice architecture location good bathroom big bed comfortable readily available water and in the afternoon champagne in reception good practice 
433067,Vincci Gala, Front desk staff was mixed quality the ones when we arrived were fun and helpful However the ones when we left made mistakes with compiling the bill and ordering taxi for airport very annoying when you need to catch an early morning flight Bar was rather expensive although they do happy hour with no guests and no atmosphere at the time we were in , Location Functional although little room Nice bathroom 
433068,Vincci Gala, it was very good but not a note of luxury for the listed price that we didn t pay so no complaints basic contemporary place we could hear any noise from the next room as mentioned by others but no problem very quiet period also if you require total privacy in the toilet forget this place , great location exceptionally friendly staff all of them ok looks features and comfort was listed as giant discount but we now doubt it Very happy to have stayed there in any case
433069,Vincci Gala, We could not workout how to use air conditioner and the air was a bit dusty so had to open the window at night It was getting down to 9 degrees so had to balance fresh air vs temperature It is a very minor negative though , Nice newish clean room Not very big but plenty of storage space A balcony Bathroom is big modern a spacious Wifi is decent capped though so do not expect watching videos and no need to re enter your personal access code just works Also wifi was given on arrival without a reminder Breakfast is very decent and runs until 10 30 which was perfect for us Room was overlooking the back and it was very quite even with window open Location is really good Airport transfer on A1 2 bus was a breeze with 5 mins walk from the bus stop Most sites are in walking distance too but several metro lines are easily accessible 
433070,Vincci Gala, The free WiFi is very bad Slow or no conectivity sometimes although the signal was good , Nice and modern rooms nice view over the balcony good breakfast friendly staff excellent location

433073,Vincci Gala, the room Temp was not working probably the room was super warm and the room indication was 16 c , Location was great close to Catalunya Sq and just across the street there is a Metro station 
433074,Vincci Gala,No Negative, We liked everything Cleanliness was second to none and the rooms were great with everything covered from soap and shower gel to shoe shine and sewing kit Very modern with huge beds Great 
433075,Vincci Gala, NOthing All was far away pleasant, The eficiency of the personal when I told them that I finaly changed my decission and I will stay only one night instead of 2 Fastly they canceled the second night and I didn t make an extra effort The reception personal treatment The design The good price
433076,Vincci Gala, Not a lot of things to eat for children during the breakfast like porridge etc typical for the majority of the hotels we stayed in, 1 Perfect location for families with kids walking distance to the biggest park zoo at the same time close to the center at the same time on a quiet street close to the taxi station metro 2 Decent breakfast with jamon 3 Helpful staff
433077,Vincci Gala,No Negative, This is the nicest hotels that we stayed in Excellent location and great service and especially the reception staff joselyn and mohamed always smiling and friendly
433078,Vincci Gala, For a first time visitor not well informed by the reception about where to visit in the city , Room was big and clean with a balcony and well equipped 
433079,Vincci Gala, The wall of rooms is not sound prevented I can hear the sound of television and speaking of neighbors loud and clear It is very annoying when this happened in the evening , Nice room and service Location is good 
433080,Vincci Gala, The walls between the rooms are really thin we could hear way too much from our neighbors rooms, The location is great for visiting a lot of different areas of Barcelona The hotel is modern and well kept members of staff are nice and helpful 
433081,Vincci Gala, Very bad smell from restaurant floor toilet room toilet it s very bad each day morning after breakfast could smell it when wait the lift to go upstairs , Nice staff nice design
433082,Vincci Gala,No Negative, The Vincci Gala s central location makes it extremely easy and convenient to discover Barcelona s fascinating sights and hidden treasures on foot The nearby metro stop is quick and easy if you don t feel like walking or if you want to go outside the city centre An added bonus is that it is within walking distance of the airport bus 
433083,Vincci Gala, Room 610 has a connecting door to a neighbouring room when the guests staying at this room arrived we suddenly discovered we had the full soundtrack to their activities thereafter this is unacceptable for a hotel of this standard I mentioned this to the staff at check out but what does one do when the noise starts at 11pm and 6am on your last day there I will not stay at this hotel again with this kind of risk not sure whether this was the case for all rooms but at EUR 130 per night in low season in Barcelona one would expect more, the location and staff and gluten free options at breakfast were all amazing
433084,Vincci Gala,No Negative, One of the best hotels I ve stayed in and I travel almost every week The staff was great the room was large and luxurious the bathroom was spacious and clean and the location is amazing close to major tourist attractions The breakfast is stellar great variety and choice 
433085,Vincci Gala,No Negative, Really nice and friendly staff The hotel has a great location close to the center Very clean rooms Great attention to details Definitely will come back 
433086,Vincci Gala, Really slow elevator Expensive parking , Easy to get around from here Just few minutes walk to Plaza Catalunya main metro hub the top of Las Ramblas The 45 bus 2 minute walk at Urquinaona will get you the port and Barceloneta beach in 10 minutes or so way easier than the metro 
433087,Vincci Gala, Too much noise from the housekeeping It was like and earthquake moving the beds from the rooms nearby We had to put a complaint in reception, The location
433088,Vincci Gala,No Negative, Location is very good 300 m from Placa Cataluya The hotel wes very clen imppaccible The shades were real good and stooped any light beam from getting in The window was soundproof at the highest leve 
433089,Vincci Gala, Too little service for a 4 star hotel No view no swimming pool no sauna no spa no roof terrace I would give this hotel strong 3 star Breakfast was average no highlight Too expensive for that level of service We had a Superior Double Room view on the street with a high traffic the shower was broken bath sink was clogged You can find for the same price 4star sea view hotel in Barceloneta , Modern design central location friendly and very helpful staff The room was cleaned on the next day on request Free water caffee tea Free toiletries and two bathrobes Minibar safe Close to the main shopping street 
433090,Vincci Gala,No Negative, Clean modern new comfy professional staff rooms large enough Nice restaurants around 5 mins walk to pla a catalunya Metro right across the street really nice
433091,Vincci Gala, booking com promised a 50 reduction because we booked the day before from 1000eu to 499 eu However in the hotel it appeared that the conventional price of our room was 499eu and not 1000eu so their was in fact a 0 reduction in price So we were tricked by the booking com system ,No Positive
433092,Vincci Gala, Furniture is very bad quality of Linin and service is very bad related to the hotel rating the hotel rating should be 3 stars as maximum and a lot of hotels more better than this hotel with lowest price miscommunication between staff I asked about a private shuttle to airport they got me a sharing one Very disappointed, Just the location nothing more
433093,Vincci Gala, Overpriced for the facilities offered Breakfast wasn t included even at room price of 235p n Constant smell of sewage in lift shaft and ground basement floor of hotel , Location D cor Room size 
433094,Vincci Gala, There were a lot of TV channels in different languages but no English entertainment channels , Good location clean rooms good breakfast friendly personnel 
433095,Vincci Gala, Internet was not that fast how i would expect, Clean comfortable room all small services included walking distance from old town and very beatiful design Price with discount was exceptable 
433096,Vincci Gala,No Negative, Location of the hotel is more than great on the Ronda Sant Pere street just couple hundred meters from Plaza Catalunya with very good direct access to from airport The main tourist attractions of Barcelona are in walking accessibility 30 minutes at most as well Rooms are clean cozy spacious and offer a great quality of sleeping I would highlight the great breakfast with huge variety of dishes including local cheeses salamis hams vegetables pastries etc as well as gluten free products 
433097,Vincci Gala, Rooms design comfort great location very helpful welcoming staff rich breakfast of highest quality , It s truly a great hotel that exceeded my expectations Way above any 4 star hotel I ve ever stayed at Actually it s very close to a 5 star hotel
