241583,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, the amenities in the room are very poor no mini bar no toothbrush haircomb q tips only one glass that was not even one designed for mouth wash purposes The room was extremely small the old room service menu was hidden in the cupboard no choice but columbian food and poor options all together The pillows on the bed were terrible absolutely shapeless and hard to sleep on something that melts under you no way this would satisfy most clients No way this deserves to be a 4 star hotel , the design was nice and very original Cool lightings in the room Nice staff for check in 
241584,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Nothing wrong worth mentioning , Room was beautiful quirky comfortable Staff could not have been more friendly and helpful throughout our stay Superb location with lots of bars and places to eat a few steps away the Bastille a short walk down the road and around the corner and very well connected to metro routes to other parts of Paris such a breeze to get about Blackout curtains in the room were great and the lighting fixtures e g tiny lights inbedded into the bathroom walls were particularly snazzy 
241585,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, It s a great hotel for sure but for the price I guess I expected more of the finer details that I ve enjoyed at other 4 Star hotels There was a kettle in the cupboard but no tea coffee station No mini bar No bathrobes Synthetic pillows etc , Cute decor Great bathroom AMAZING shower Friendly front desk Superb location 
241586,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, I have no complaints Some might be put off by the very small size of the rooms but it s Paris , The staff was incredibly accommodating and friendly They let me leave my luggage and when I checked in early they had even already brought my bag up to my room Lovely toiletry products beautiful room water bottles included along with a kettle I bring my own tea wherever I go so this was great and I particularly liked the decor and the tiny lights in the bathroom Even the elevator music and graffiti inside was impressive Cute boutique hotel and I would love to stay here again on my next trip to Paris Very pleased overall 
241587,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Should have stayed longer I will return , Quirky boutique hotel in an excellent location near the metro Staff were friendly and price was good value for Paris 
241588,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Rooms pretty small but manageable The only issue is related to bed the bed is in fact 2 small beds which is a bit annoying , Location was great excellent staff very friendly and helpfull Cosy and beautiful decoration good breakfast We had a great stay there 
241589,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, I wish the room was a bit more spacious it was not easy to simply go around the bed hardly any space I wish the bed was not just too single beds joined together we could feel the gap in between I wish there were some mint earl grey tea bags in the room as there was a kettle but to tea , It was Easy to find Lovely staff they do actually care good general atmosphere funky design sometimes over done but still in a good funny way lovely shower cool stars in the shower
241590,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Couldn t fault it, Easy to find and get to Close to railway and metro system Close to attractions Close to great eating options Great decor Great staff
241591,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, the rooms are pretty small although we had read about this in other reviews and understand this is common in Paris but it was still a surprise to see how small they were the double bed is actually a twin bed with separate mattresses which I personally find not too comfortable for a couple , We loved the extremely original and colourful design of the rooms the waterfall shower and the star like lighting in the bathroom the retro and artistic flavour of the hotel as a whole the graffiti in the elevator are unique its location which is walking distance from a number of interesting neighbourhoods of Paris such as Marais Roquette and Bastille and close to various metro and bus stops
241592,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, It was not clear exactly what was included in the price some hot drinks were charged for even though there was a suggestion that they were free Insulation was poor extremely noisy pipes and cleaning noises early in the morning from upstairs , Nicely decorated
241593,H tel Exquis by Elegancia,No Negative, The hotel was extremely beautiful All the rooms had fantastic colors and I loved the tiles in the bathrooms Extremely good experience New favourite place in Paris without a doubt 
241594,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, The rooms are pretty small but this is Paris and they made excellent use of the space so we were very happy here , The staff is excellent extremely friendly and helpful and were willing to converse in either French or English depending on what suited us each time And they made the beds every day even if we spent ages in the room 
241595,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Room was a little small but no problem really 14Euros for Breakfast which I thought was a little pricey , Friendly hotel staff immaculate room chic and quirky style Very comfortable 
241596,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Nothing at all, Great situation and QUIET near several metros in an interesting area with a range of cafes and restaurants nearby DELIGHTFUL friendly cheerful happy staff who all spoke Excellent English VERY VERY clean comfortable rooms Excellent breakfasts perfect poached egg machine A pleasant relaxed hotel to stay in 
241597,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Not really a complaint but it was a bit odd having to wash our hands in the room the toilet was in a separate little booth , The location of the hotel was perfect The rooms are small but that was to be expected but they have used the space effectively resulting in a cozy and comfortable place to stay We were very impressed by the staff who were friendly and helpful 
241598,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, The breakfast is rather expensive but there are plenty of nice boulangeries and coffee places close by , Is it a very convenient hotel with small but cosy rooms The room is full of details with little lights everywhere Especially the bathroom is amazing with a great rain shower and tiny little light between the tiles which creatures a very nice atmosphere The bed is very big and comfortable The hotel is a 10 minute walk away from Bastille but the neighbourhood is full of people and very safe also at night 
241599,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Rooms a bit small but this is Paris and a bit Noisy whistelling water piping starting at 6am , The staff the modern and stylish of the rooms and the location in a very good neibourhood of Paris 
241600,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Room small but that s Paris for you but everything else makes up for it, The decor the lighting the shower the bed the free smartphone the service
241601,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, The room we had was on the small side but suitable for a short visit The funky decor will appeal to many people , Very pleasant staff and very accommodating 
241602,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, I can t think of anything , The rooms were beautifully designed and the beds were comfortable I had a view on to the street like a proper Parisian 
241603,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, The only remark would be the 5 10 minutes walk to the nearby metro station just to be aware , The hotel looks new and the room we stayed in was very well decorated It s cool really It s difficult to find other comparable options in Paris with this quality location price combination Breakfast is excellent by the way 
241604,H tel Exquis by Elegancia,No Negative, Everything was perfect Lovely staff with amazing recommendations Very fun rooms with beautiful lighting and wallpaper Location was great still central but not touristy at all Good food around the corner We loved it
241605,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Pillows were horrible for us , Breakfast was the boost of energy to start off the day nice selection of cheese good location very helpful staff special thanks to Pompea Michaela room was perfectly decorated and size wasn t an issue at all 
241606,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, The rooms facing the street is very noisy I asked to change room and even it was weekend they changed my room for my satisfaction, Nice staff Fill like family hotel
241607,H tel Exquis by Elegancia,No Negative, The entire experience here was fantastic We speak no French and the staff could not have been kinder or more helpful despite that The rooms are gorgeous and for two people you don t mind the size Loved the shower There were many great restaurants within only a block or two and it was very easy to navigate the city 
241608,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Small room but it is not big discomfort for short stay, Good location very comfortable bed clean room delicious breakfast cozy and unusual interior friendly staff Everything was good 
241609,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Not quite close to the city center, The room was good but the bathroom was incredible The staff were quite nice as well It was in a good neighbourhood 
241610,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, We would have enjoyed our room even more if it would be just a touch larger , Extremely cozy room with beautiful decor well thought through interior and friendly staff Located in a quiet quarter with connections to all sightings by bus or subway Close to different shopping streets and a few minutes by foot to bar areas 
241611,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Thin walls and windows well this is Paris I would advise to use earplugs if you re a light sleeper , Nice beautiful rooms with original arty decoration but modern equipments Excellent beds The hotel is charming orignal and well located I would recommand especially for a en amoureux stay 
241612,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, The room is very small 10sqms area with a double bed in there there was hardly any space to keep the suitcases The table is actually a little sewing machine Also internet was either too slow or dropped off from time to time it was frustrating , Great location very handy to the metro station local shops restaurants 
241613,H tel Exquis by Elegancia,No Negative, Hotel provided us with a smartphone to use during our trip So helpful saved us while navigating the metro If I return I will be staying here again Facilities were clean and modern staff was friendly and location is convenient walking distance to metro and great restaurants across the street 
241614,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Would have liked the room to have been a bit bigger but it is Paris , The decor of the hotel was very aesthetically pleasing and the staff were very helpful 
241615,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Had to walk 11 mins to get cheap parking , The staff were great We had trouble ordering a pizza to the hotel as French was not our strong point so we asked the manager She delightfully solved the problem and ordered our pizza This was exceptional service for a warm and romantic hotel 
241616,H tel Exquis by Elegancia,No Negative, Great staff who were friendly and helpful Stylish rooms and comfortable bed Good location in itself for amenities and nightlife with the metro nearby to venture elsewhere 
241617,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, The room was small WiFi rather weak , The staff were ALL fantastic and the reception staff all spoke great English The location is close to two metro stations and in fact only a 30 minute walk to Notre Dame Spotlessly clean piping hot water everything newly renovated 
241618,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, none, location was good located at a convenient quartier where there are lots of food options We were given a smart phone with internet access for free for the duration of stay spacious washroom
241619,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Slightly late entry to room , Decor is gorgeous room layout perfect doesn t feel cramped for a small space bathrooms lovely with great showers use of free hand held device with tourist info was an amazing bonus Flat rate airport transfer on leaving was also a fabulous extra Was extremely quiet Was hard to believe such a central location was so quiet inside even with the windows open overnight 
241620,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, The room might be small but no worries everything you need is there , The location is good for a citytrip to Paris feels safe to walk around during the evening easy access by subway Very nice bakery next door for some good croissants for breakfast A very good idea was the 4G mobile phone you can use Really handy to google maps around Comfortable bed good shower nice staff 
241621,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Only downside was no coffee making facilities in the actual room , Hotel is quirky great design and decor touches quiet and very comfortable with really friendly and helpful staff Location is great for the Metro and the local area is full of great little bars and bistros 
241622,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Rooms were too small , Location of the hotel They handed us a mobile phone with free 4G Internet and international calling which is a great idea for leisure travellers 
241623,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, The breakfast could be more affordable especially since it has to compete with a lot of good alternatives nearby No coffee or tea facilities in the room , Very cozy artistic rooms with a lot of unique elements Free cellphone with 4G internet to navigate around Paris Nice area with plenty bars restaurants to be found Good French bakery just around the corner 
241624,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, The metro lines near it are not very convenient often requiring multiple exchanges , Room was creatively decorated comfortable and clean My best stay in Paris I will come back for sure 
241625,H tel Exquis by Elegancia,No Negative, The room was clean though a little small Bed was comfortable The location was ideal for getting around close to the Charonne and Bastille metro stations and felt safe The smartphone was an added bonus Lots of restaurants in the area to choose from 
241626,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, The hotel is tiny You do not feel at large anywhere in the hotel the hallways are so narrow that if you meet someone else you need to negotiate to get by Lest not even talk about getting around the cleaning cart The room is very very small When I read the reviews I thought rooms are always small in Paris well this was a new level of smallness The queen bed is against the wall so it feels way smaller than a queen There is only room to open one carry on bag To open the second bag we had to clear the desk and put everything that was on it on the floor under it and use that space To pack or access the suitcases we had to take turns while one person sat on the bed and no we are not overweight The neighborhood is dirty and very far from everything I recommend to stay close to Republic Square instead much easier access to everything The bed is not comfortable at all the mattress is fine but they have put a mattress cover that makes a loud plasticky noise every time anyone moves so not very pleasant sleep The air conditioning is stet in such a way that it hits your face very strongly when in bed and there was no way to turn the fan speed any lower or angle it somewhere else , Very clean hotel smartly decorated Free smart phone 
241627,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, The room was very small but perfect for a short stay , The location was great close to nice shopping area and restaurants Although our window was facing the street the sound isolation was protecting the room very well The room was very clean and with creative lighting in it 
241628,H tel Exquis by Elegancia,No Negative, The staff were very obliging and welcoming The rooms were artistic and original I loved the stars in the shower Excellent location and value for money 
241629,H tel Exquis by Elegancia,No Negative, The hosts were extremely nice and helpful The hotel lets you use a cool device with 4G to help you navigate through the city It is a bit slow but it s the thought that counts Cool bars and restaurants around 
241630,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, N A, Loved the rooms each very unique and well done Tech wifi phones in the hotel is brilliant Very pleasant stay in a supremely comfortable bed Staff extremely friendly a rarity in Paris 
241631,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Internet connection not so good for streaming but it does not matter much if you consider we were in Paris for vacation and spend little time in the room , Accomodations are cozy with a great and playful design 
241632,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Room we had was very small so we found it difficult with our luggage , Location is wonderful close to metro and many good eateries Rooms are individual and comfotable Prebook Septime for lunch or dinner as it is across the road or walk for 5 minutes and find some local eateries that are truly Parisian 
241633,H tel Exquis by Elegancia,No Negative, Very beautiful hotel Nice employee and very good English they are friendly and helpful hotel s facilities are really over expectation they have a phone with google map could be used whiling you are traveling out Can t forget the night in Paris 
241634,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Nothing except the size of the room but for that price in Paris it was great as is , Minimalist Perfectly located Superb interior design Functional Staff was great 
241635,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Breakfast not included, A very clever use of spaces and an original furnishing and design Friendly staff arranged a room in no time A smartphone to bring with you in Paris with free calls and data 
241636,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, It would have been good to have tea coffee making facilities in the room , We only stayed in the apartment for one night however it was a great stay The hotel is in an ideal location walkable from Gare du Lyon and a short taxi ride from Gare du Nord The staff were really friendly and helpful The room was luxurious small but cosy and the bed was really comfortable The shower was brilliant and the whole room was spotless 
241637,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, We knew to expect a small room but were still surprised how crammed it actually was The room layout was pretty impractical the sink was in the room instead of the bathroom for example The room was rather cold and adjusting the heating didn t seem to do much good Also the sink started leaking one evening the receptionist hacked it back together somehow There was only one double sized duvet in the bed We requested another one and ended up with two double sized duvets There were not too many English channels on the TV , The room and the common spaces were very nicely decorated Breakfast was ok Staff was helpful Wi Fi worked very well There are lots of decent restaurants and grocery stores nearby and a good boulangerie just downstairs 
241638,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, As mentioned the hotel was quite nice just a bit expensive , The location of the hotel Bastille was perfect not far from the center and quite lively with plenty restaurants and bars quite close without being too noisy or touristic The hotel felt quite new and very well taken care of everything was clean and the room despite being on the small side was very comfortable and with a lovely modern decoration Breakfast was not included so we just went to the wonderful Boulangerie by the corner to get some delicious pastries and take away coffee we went back there on the last day s afternoon to bring back home some stock 
241639,H tel Exquis by Elegancia,No Negative, This is a modern hotel with well designed rooms centrally located in a trendy area with a wide variety of nice restaurants and fashion boutiques Perfect spot to enjoy the local trendy Paris Rooms are a bit small but that s what you get in Paris when you don t want to pay a million for a room 
241640,H tel Exquis by Elegancia,No Negative, Excellent service from all staff I did not use the cafe so I cannot comment on the food Although the rooms are not huge overall they were comfortable I would certainly recommend to friends and stay there again should I visit paris In terms of transport it is just 5 10 mins from two metro stations which offer different lines There were loads of bar cafe and restaurants in the area 
241641,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, The downside very very small room Did I say small Couldn t have been any smaller and still had room for a double bed , The staff were exceptionally kind and went out of their way to be helpful The decor was fun the bed comfortable and the bathroom a real winner top notch shower brand new and very clean Good value for a good location 
241642,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Space for baggage We had two small ones yet it occupied completely one aisle Well it is not really important considering the overall square meter problem of the city If you want to have more space in Paris you pay more for a 4 5 star hotel or an appartment I see no point in taking breakfast for 14 per person you simply make a few steps in any direction from the hotel and find a caf of any type and pay about the same price for two , Shower is really comfortable and spacious for a 3 star hotel in Paris Design of the bathroom which makes a starry night impression Good shampoo and shower gel The price we had for 2 nights around 200 Magnifying glass is available if somebody needs it
241643,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Didn t use the caf too many options in bastille nearby why would you Facilities in room good without sounding like an old f t tea and coffee making facilities would be good in each room but otherwise cannot fault it Perfect crash pad in great area, Room was small but modern and clean perfect to dump stuff and go
241644,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, the room size was very small and we found it a bit difficult for 2 persons to move around , the hotel staff are friendly and helpfull and the rooms were nicely designed well equipped and clean
241645,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, The queu at the Paris Hanoi restaurant , Small room but well equiped Good matress and shower We really liked the neighbourhood with lots of good bars and restaurants 
241646,H tel Exquis by Elegancia,No Negative, Great location The stuff has been really helpful Loved the shower The room is clean cozy and nicely decorated a bit small but more than enough if you plan to spend most of the time outside Willing to come back to Exquis 
241647,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, The lighting could have been stronger in both the room and the dining room , Nice retro furniture at the hotel Romantic and fresh bathroom Friendly helpful staff Exellent location 
241648,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, It wasn t as close to the Marais as hoped But the Bastille area is a buzzing neighbourhood just not the neighbourhood where we out other friends and family were based , Design shower friendliness of staff received free upgrade as we arrived early 
241649,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Rooms are a bit small but most of the time you will spend outside the hotel There is so much to explore in Paris , The hotel is located in a nice vibrant area with loads of restaurants and bars 
241650,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, The bedspread was not thick enough And the white colour not appropriate , The friendly staff the Cafe ambiance at the basement the cleanest room i ve ever seen Like new 100 original Perfect for couples 
241651,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, The price of the breakfast and all the city taxes , The staff is very friendly and eager to help The room is clean and nice and the area is a safe one 
241652,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, For the price 14 the breakfast was slightly disappointing when it comes to freshness and versatility And if you don t speak any French I m not sure whether the whole staff speaks English at least on my arrival day the lady didn t , Definitely the best budget priced hotel in Paris where I have ever stayed nowadays I visit the city 4 to 6 times a year Well renovated charming stylish warm in winter Quiet rooms very comfortable beds good showers Excellent location on one of the best restaurant and bar streets of Paris Highly recommend 
241653,H tel Exquis by Elegancia,No Negative, Staff were friendly and helpful during a stressful time we stayed during the terror attacks in Paris and offered lots of support Asides from this the hotel is stylish and trendy and in a great area for young people going out 
241654,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, When booking I was promised a room with a city view In fact I got a room on the ground floor and opened his window lobby Could not knowing the day or night the room is not fan the subsequent All this even though I asked a room on the top floor, Compact and nice Bathroom equipped very well
241655,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, There was a chair at the end of the bed that wouldn t let me walk around to the wardrobe That was useless , I liked the location It s close to the subway that I need to move around in the evening when traffic jam is high even though it closes from 1 to 5 in the morning The hotel location is also convenient because it s not too far from the Air France bus stop The hotel itself was nice and clean The room was well decorated I loved the lightening design and definitely the shower which had small led lights that would look like a sky full of stars That s very nice 
241656,H tel Exquis by Elegancia, Room was small but that s why it s so affordable for Paris Didn t try breakfast too expensive at 14 Euros but plenty of alternatives nearby , Stylish makeover for the former Hotel Hi Matic Comfortable bed smart bathroom excellent shower Brilliant location close to Metro and great restaurants and wine bars within easy staggering distance
