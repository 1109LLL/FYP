239610,H tel Lancaster Paris Champs Elys es, I don t like the facility I supposed to enter 5 stars hotel but there was no coffee or tea no water only in the first night Not like other hotels even 4 stars provide coffee and tea, I like the location
239611,H tel Lancaster Paris Champs Elys es, slightly noisy but this is due to the historic original details of the property such as beautiful historical double windows and original doors, Impeccable staff extremely attentive friendly and efficient very good location beautiful room historic wood panelling real antiques stylish design very high stucco ceilings very good bar with a cute inner courtyard and a 2 Michelin star restaurant
239612,H tel Lancaster Paris Champs Elys es, The restaurant experience and house keeping turndown service leave something to be desired and at times the single staff member on the bar meant slow service , The concierge was very good the decor and ambience perfect and the bed very comfy We had a beautiful suite during our stay which was perfect and peaceful Fab mojitos 
239613,H tel Lancaster Paris Champs Elys es, Nothing, Loved the place form the kindness of all the staff cleanness and being a an antique building Few stems to the champs Sitting in any area taking coffee or tea makes you feel home 
239614,H tel Lancaster Paris Champs Elys es, bathroom fixtures a bit on the old nice bar garden but no facilities like swimming pool etc , boutique hotel very cosy and quiet big rooms nice decor and full equipment
239615,H tel Lancaster Paris Champs Elys es, They have a superb restaurant in the hotel so we were just a little bit disappointed with the food in the rest of the hotel particularly in the bar and the room service breakfast the prices are high so you expect the same level of taste and presentation, The team are excellent at Hotel Lancaster nothing is too much trouble they re friendly warm helpful and knowledgable really loved our stay there The property itself is both historic and well maintained we loved our room its little balcony out on to the garden and the lovely spacious bathrom
239616,H tel Lancaster Paris Champs Elys es,No Negative, From the perspective of location this hotel is perfect Just off the Champs de Elyse and a short walk to the Metro George V you have ease of access to the city and all the must sees From the moment of arrival this quintessential Parisian boutique hotel was everything one would wish for expect and be pleasantly surprised From all staff knowing our names and engaging us in respect of where we lived the doorman was interested in talking about our local football team to the wonderful attention to detail from roses petals on the bed and a daily rose this establishment ticks all the boxes Upon entry into the foyer you are immediately aware you are somewhere special and each and every experience from there does not disappoint The hotel bar is simply elegant and a beautiful escape from the ever busy city streets Our room was just divine An elegant balance of Parisian history in what obviously is a 19th century building with modern conveniences The bed was extraordinarily comfortable the bathroom large for a city hotel and the space in the apartment itself ensured we were not falling over each other The antique period furniture provided a beautiful ambience The touch of handing your room key every time you leave to reception is a touch from a bygone era and its value is realised when they hand it to you as you walk through reception knowing who you are and your room number without you asking with the warmest of greetings and query as to whether they can do anything extra for you Location to restaurants and caf s both on the Champs de Elyse and Rue de Berri provides great choice You will be left with lasting memories and a feeling of loss when you leave This truly was one of those hotels that added to the experience of Paris in the most positive of ways and we cannot recommend this establishment without a higher regard 
239617,H tel Lancaster Paris Champs Elys es, My toilet was so tiny that I had constantly keep the door open Walls were thin I heard everybody around Also felt that hotel haven t been renovated in last 5 years at all towels not that new carpet looked nasty and my sink looked like it went trough a war , Lockation is great I had a room with windows facing a garden was very peaceful
