432828,Roger de Ll ria, room was tiny dark and noisy close to the elevator so I could hear the elevators up and down I ask for a room change but they did not have nor they follow up if one became available , service clean room location
432829,Roger de Ll ria, Nothing, Wonderful location walking distance to most central locations and beach everything reachable within 20 25 mins walk Beautiful rooms fully air conditioned comfortable furnishings fantastic Bed and a beautiful bathroom with an extensive range of high quality toiletries Staff at the property are incredibly helpful and exceptionally friendly This is a really lovely Hotel
432830,Roger de Ll ria, Breakfast was vastly overpriced There are plenty of cafes and bars nearby where a good continental breakfast can be had for about 4 The hot breakfast in the hotel was cold and therefore rather unpleasant The bed in our room was very hard The receptionist decided he would lecture us on our inability to speak fluent Spanish ,No Positive
432831,Roger de Ll ria, Breakfast was expensive but I think this is common to Barcelona hotels but there are plenty of good cafes very nearby , Staff were very friendly and helpful Room was quiet and cool Location good for metro 
432832,Roger de Ll ria, fridge or mini bar not working reported many times kettle not working very expensive priced breakfast can get across the road for half the price poor room service very expensive room rate for this room we could have stayed in a better place at cheaper price the downstairs lobby toilet was filthy with toilet paper all over the floor as per photos , THE BED WAS OK
432833,Roger de Ll ria, Nothing, Very friendly reception staff I was offered a room upgrade at no extra cost when I returned They offered me an umbrella to take when I checked out on a day it was raining Returned it 3 weeks later 
432834,Roger de Ll ria, Problem 1 Almost no WiFi bandwidth When asking to have WiFi fixed I was told that my computer needed update while 1 it was up to date and 2 I commute every week to other hotels where I have no issue with WiFi so their WiFi network is poor and needs fixing sorry Problem 2 the noise made by the elevator I booked a soundproofed room It was soundproofed from other residents from the same floor not from the ceiling though could hear people walking but certainly not soundproofed from the elevator which makes a loud noise each time it is in use , Location staff
432835,Roger de Ll ria, The room was too noisy Unfortunately there was a Service Room attached to my room and there was banging noise all the time 24 7 and it made sleeping almost impossible Breakfast not being included is a negative point and it is very expensive to have it at the property 22 per day , The location is great and if you like walking you ll get to many places by foot Public transportation and taxi is also available easily Staff at front desk were friendly and supportive and even supported me when I had issues with my Credit Card for booking the hotel 
432836,Roger de Ll ria, The carpet in the room felt very thin and old The black out curtain was hanging off the railing and was not noticed by cleaning staff, Staff were very friendly helpful efficient Good that we could leave our luggage securely post check out till we went to airport Quiet yet in Eixample 
432837,Roger de Ll ria, The room was not sound proof at all Couldn t sleep it s like you are in the middle of public showers you hear every tap opening every toilet wash Mini bar was replaced because it didn t work and grew a lot of mold inside , Location Staff Umbrella Clean
432838,Roger de Ll ria, No mirror in the room apart from bathroom , The location was excellent Lots of good restuarants nearby We had our room upgraded which was a wonderful surprise 
432839,Roger de Ll ria, The family room was not laid out particularly well for instance all four of us slept in the same room but there were two very hard double beds We have one boy and girl who had to share a bed not very young children so this was an issue When asked at the reception if they has any mattress toppers or way of making the beds more comfortable we were told no They could not help or offer any assistance An expensive room for the comfort level provided Breakfast was also very expensive at 19 euros pppn 76 euros for breakfast I think not So we ate breakfast at one of the many local places for approx 24 euros for all four of us No onsite restaurant for an evening meal if we did not want to venture out , The Location was good the maids kept the room clean
