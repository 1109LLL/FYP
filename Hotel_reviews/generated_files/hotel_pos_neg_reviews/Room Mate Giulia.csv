449608,Room Mate Giulia, We were initially checked into rooms on the 6th floor they were generally nice but the windows were small and did not open as this was the top floor attic On the second day we had an unexpected plumbing issue with dust dirt coming through the shower in both rooms We later found out the issue was due to some construction work nearby The staff were very apologetic and we were upgraded into other rooms 5th floor with a better view for the rest of our stay , The hotel has an excellent location very close to the duomo The staff are friendly and tried their best to accommodate us when we had a plumbing issue in our initial rooms The hotel has a unique design which we highly enjoyed and the extra attention to details was a nice touch welcome notes upon arrival funny messages on toiletries etc The rooms were very clean beds were comfy the bathrooms were spacious and the showers had good water pressure Would recommend this hotel to others

449610,Room Mate Giulia, The only glitch was the elevators use the keycard for security but it didn t work at first and I needed to reissue my key , Great lobby and warm staff welcome Also they were able to accommodate my early check in request I liked how there s water available on arrival The location is fantastic just steps from Duomo and Park Hyatt The room was comfortable and clean There was no view from my room 605 but it was OK as I was only sleeping there The toiletry packaging is cute I would definitely stay here again and found the service much better than the Boscolo which I had stayed at another time 
449611,Room Mate Giulia, Parking in Rinascente offsite there is a little complicated and stressful Perhaps have a hand out with self explanatory and comprehensive instructions for that including a map of how to drive there and how to walk back and where how to pay at the parking payment machine , Amazing location Helpful staff Hip vibe 
449612,Room Mate Giulia, There were noicy construction works in front of our windows but when asked the staff they immediatelly moved us to another quite room , Super friendly staff Location can t be better We had a perfect stay

449618,Room Mate Giulia, No bath tub which is important as I used to hv a bath after a very tiring walk for a whole day The room size is not standard I reserved two rooms one is Superior double and one is Superior twin The twin room is only 2 3 size of the superior and I thought it is only a standard twin Nevertheless I requested for a change in room and they managed to change for me on the second night Despite the room size is specigied in their website superior room from 23 sq m to 35sq m while a standard is only 20sq m it seems like quite unfair to put the 23sq m room as a superior room when we know other guest is having a 35sq m room Bear in mind we paid the same amount of money , Excellent location near metro or just 5 15 min walk to a lot tourists spot and shopping areas Friendly and very helpful staff
449619,Room Mate Giulia, There was a slight smell in our room on entering which was addressed by the staff immediately , The staff was absolutely the best Friendly and super helpful Love that they are young and so international The room was of adequate size clean and the bathroom was big and clean with all the toiletries one needed I loved the breakfast and the art on the walls and around the hotel Wi fi connectivity was super I was there a day after my birthday and I loved the personalized note and bag of chocolates not to forget the welcome glass of prosecco On our way back the hotel organized a car flat 100 euros in a spanking new E class Thank you we will certainly make Room Maye our home away from home again 
449620,Room Mate Giulia, The Superior room vary in size and you cannot quarantee which room size is allicated to you I reserved two rooms one superior double for myself and one superior twin for my kids The superior twins was so small and basically we cant open our luggage on the floor We then go and requested gor a change in room and they could only change for us in the second night Anyway the staff are helpful and answer your request at their very best effort , Excellent location friendly and helpful staff Each room is a bit different in design Very nice

449624,Room Mate Giulia, That I had to leave, Really everything was perfect the location the clean and modern room comfortable bed and linens the breakfast the unique toiletries etc However it was the staff that really make this place special always with a greeting when you get off the elevator or walk theough the soor and not a wooden fake one but with a genuine smie and always helpful with reccomendations and reservations at quality not over prced restaurants I would reccomend this place to anyone and everyone
449625,Room Mate Giulia, By booking search you can find the hotel with parking place But after you book the hotel you figure out that it is public parking So why on earth it is in searching All hotels in the city then have parking place It s better check in advance if Spa is working or it is out of order Also if any reconstruction around the hotel is happening noise and dust , Location is perfect 
449626,Room Mate Giulia, Breakfast room was a little small and overcrowded , You cannot find a better location and proximity to the Duomo Galleria etc Rooms are spotlessly clean and of a very high standard Most well stocked mini bar I have seen in any hotel Will definitely stay there again
449627,Room Mate Giulia, Make sure you ask for a room at the front of the building We booked a superior room only to find that we were at the back of the hotel in a dark room with a view of a wall and refuse bins However reception staff changed our room without hesitation and we were delighted with our new room at the front of the building Apparently both rooms were classed as superior but there was certainly a huge difference so make sure you get what you are paying for , Outstanding location in a lovely old building Quirky decor but comfortably so and not contrived Extremely welcoming efficient and friendly staff Puglia next door for great breakfasts and the Hyatt across the road for cocktails couldn t be better

449631,Room Mate Giulia, On the day we checked out there was a group of people holding posters and yelling in front of the building The taxi driver told us they were protesting they said they worked for the hotel but didn t receive their salaries We didn t know what exactly happened just felt a bit disappointed about this issue It can be seen the hotel has a high occupancy and great review scores on Booking com It seems that the business is doing pretty well Hope the hotel do the right thing to the workers and treat them fairly , The location is perfect for shopping It takes just 2 minutes walk to Duomo The price is reasonable compare to other hotels nearby The reception staffs were helpful and attentive We live in Switzerland and visit Milano every month for shopping making hairstyle and enjoying the food Overall it was a good stay in Room Mate Hotel

449651,Room Mate Giulia, I prefered to stay another room that I can see the street or Cathedral instead of inner court view But if you book from booking com or same sites its always problem If they say it to us while making reservation it would be better , Location is amazing and we can reach everywhere by walk within 5 10 minutes Breakfast is so good and there are a lot of things to eat

449682,Room Mate Giulia, Staff was helpful and polite enough but not very friendly, The location of the hotel was very near the metro and right in the centre of the shopping district and the beautiful duomo
449683,Room Mate Giulia, Our room was so dark that it spoilt the experience Would ask for a higher floor next time , Could not have been better placed location wise Went on shopping trip with a girlfriend and it was so easy to go back to the hotel to drop off bags Staff were amazing and the hotel cocktails hit the spot

449690,Room Mate Giulia,No Negative, Rome Mate Giulia is just a stones throw from the Duomo and the interior design was to die for The receptionist gave us a dining recommendation on our first night and it ended up being the best meal of our entire trip We loved this hotel 
449691,Room Mate Giulia, Parking isn t easy to find in this area so prepare for some walking shorter distance or circling by car longer distance Fitness room isn t appealing , Nice breakfast choices definitely more than we expected Cool design and a fantastic location

449693,Room Mate Giulia, Local TV channels provide very little English program Some rooms can be noisy from nearby nightlife, Decoration style and comfort The bedroom bathroom planning and furniture are great All for top convenience Everything works perfectly well in room 
449694,Room Mate Giulia, The room was small for a double there s no real seating or desk if one wants to do some work The air conditioning was very noisy on the first night but that was fixed by turning it down not really needed in October but I guess this could be a problem in the summer Breakfast was not included in the deal I chose but was reasonably priced on hotel standards however was fairly standard fare The gym is small and rudimentary only one treadmill for e g No iron in room Overall this is a nice hotel but really not what I d expect for over A400 night , Room Mate Giulia is in a spectacular location a stone s throw from the Duomo in central Milan and I guess that s what you are paying for The staff are cheerful welcoming and helpful and the place has a very up beat atmosphere The room was comfortable and there s a well stocked and not expensive minibar and snacks

449700,Room Mate Giulia, The staff told us incorrect information about the start time of a soccer game and the fixed price of a taxi to the airport We double checked the start time and found it was 6 pm not 8 45 The hotel arranged taxi driver requested 100 euro although we were informed by the front staff that the flat rate was 90 euro , The location is perfect Very convenient to visit major sites and do shopping Facilities and amenities are sufficient for busy travelers who stay the hotel for sleep The staff was friendly and supportive 
449701,Room Mate Giulia,No Negative, Interior design brilliant There was thoughtful interesting detail for the eye and mind at every turn Very quiet despite location which was so central Helpful enthusiastic people on the desk Was pitched for business people but was so much more
449702,Room Mate Giulia,No Negative, I did not have the eggs but the bed was indeed like a cloud This hotel is the ultimate in comfort and elegance and the location couldn t be better This hotel is right in the middle of the city and mere steps away from some of histories most amazing buildings and sculptures The staff was incredibly helpful and welcoming would def recommend this hotel and any in its chain
449703,Room Mate Giulia, Alot The elevator was very poor and has old mode l The AC at the room was leaking a lot of water and when I reported to reception they deal with it by very stupid and Foolish way they hang a towel from the AC till the floor and it was blocking the entrance of the room we just take it off and thank god it was one night only Last thing they came to us when its almost midnight and says some of you smoking in the room because the alarm started although we didn t hear anything and no one of us ever smoked they didnt smell anything and left, Nice piano was there
449704,Room Mate Giulia, It would have been better or helpful to have a list of good restaurants from Michelin rating to just good value for money We only had one chance to have dinner in Milan and requested for one of the best restaurants to be booked Not their fault perhaps it was the best to them however recommended us to a place wherein staff were great but the food and value were not Bella Italia would rate 10x excellent compared to this on both counts Wouldn t mind paying much if it was worth it but at about 70 per head for 2 course plain meal and a wine Felt ripped off , Excellent location for Duomo and shopping Didn t need travel adapter because USB ports are part of the sockets and allow gadgets to charge directly Friendly staff 
449705,Room Mate Giulia,No Negative, Loved staying here Not only are the rooms nice and spacious for the cost but the best part of this hotel is the amazing people that work there Everyone was just amazing and helpful The hotel is also in an amazing location Whilst the hotel does not have room service they always allowed us to raid the breakfast room for yoghurt or fruit for our little boy

449721,Room Mate Giulia, Staff were welcoming friendly and nice however not so helpful and are a bit slow when you ask for help eg good local and non touristy restaurants to eat at use of their iron or special Italian coffee in the breakfast room In the end we just lowered our expectations , You cannot beat the location Other things we like about this hotel includes the beautiful funky interior breakfast free wifi spacious room room amenities toiletries powerful hair dryer in room safe spacious wardrobe with lots of hangers great big comfy bed USB points for charging and welcoming and friendly staff 
449722,Room Mate Giulia,No Negative, The location cannot be beat and the room was lovely and very up to date The front desk was extremely helpful in arranging things I would highly recommend this place and definitely plan on staying here in my future travels to Milan

449728,Room Mate Giulia, Hadn t expected one but room had no view except for interior of some building Parking not available but there is a 20 discount on a nearby parking still costs you EUR 25 30 a day We asked to use the steam bath and sauna and waited for them to heat up but when we arrived the floor of the steam bath and the entire sauna were still cold After our complaint we gave it a 2nd chance and 30 45 min later after staff had notified us that it was now really ready we went back to find a slightly warmer steam bath and sauna but still not heated enough so we didn t spend much time there I guess this is the only really negative point we have One of us witnessed an unpleasant discussion between the welcoming staff member and another staff member the welcoming staff member perhaps being a little too enthusiastic and not professional enough , Fabulous hotel on a fabulous location just steps away from the Duomo in the city s center with great shopping and restaurants The lobby is well decorated the room very smartly decorated we loved every single bit of it Great bed and bathroom large TV fantastic toiletries coffee tea facilities Breakfast was one of the best we ve ever had A wide variety of high quality food items original items healthy items Staff are extremely friendly and helpful from the reception desk to the breakfast space 
449729,Room Mate Giulia, Nothing it was perfect, This hotel has opened almost 3 months ago and here it is on top of all hotels in Milan and there is more than enough reasons for it actually from our stay here we decided to lookup Room Mate as the first option wherever we go hoping this will be a chain standard This is still growing chain hailing from Spain and is currently expanding internationally best of luck guys and keep it up I even looked up some of their other hotels and they are towards the top in each city I looked up The reason for the raving reviews is very simple they put their selves in the travellers shoes and acted accordingly whatever pains you when staying at a hotel is not here like Spacious rooms we had a triple room with double king size bed and single bed and still the room felt spacious at par with some 5 tar hotels electrical outlets conveniently placed very well lit spacious bathroom with two basins and both a bathtub and a big walk in shower with rain forest head toiletries that you are happy to use breakfast till noon free wifi is not only in premises but you can ask for the free wifi portable router to take it with you on the go with free 100 mbs everyday throughout your stay a storage room if you need to leave your luggage or as we did keep the baby stroller there instead of taking it up to the room everyday staff are remarkable in every aspect special thanks go to Piero Francesco Andrea Hany Hassan and Sara for making every encounter more pleasant than the one before and taking all measures to make us feel at home If you look up the address via Google Earth you will not find the hotel as the street was photographed while Giulia was under construction so the hotel is the construction work you find when zooming in to street level till google updates the photo this is an amazing location at the door of the hotel you re a couple of steps to the left to Duomo and another couple of steps to the right to Vittorio Emmanuelle gallery Duomo metro is 
449730,Room Mate Giulia, There is no bar coffee facility in the hotel other than in your room minibar and kettle and the breakfast room is small so can get busy at popular times Coffee tea at breakfast is via a machine not what you might expect in a 4 star hotel and there is only one machine which does not work very quickly so did lead to a bit of a queue again not what you might expect in a smart 4 star hotel , Perfect location for the Duomo and central Milan Extremely friendly and helpful reception staff very approachable Late check out and breakfast until 12 00 is really helpful if you are on holiday Rooms are very smart and quite large

449760,Room Mate Giulia, The WC flush needed maintenance Parking not an option , The staff were really friendly and helpful and the hotel really couldn t have been closer to the places we wanted to go The room reception and our room were distinctively styled and we had the largest walk in shower we have encountered in a hotel 
449761,Room Mate Giulia, The hotel check in process is very slow and her service was inappropriate We have been waiting for nearly two hours I suggest you to improve your reception now because it s the first impression for your hotel And staff in recption isn t smile I have ever been stay in Florence It s impressed , Bell boy is very nice The deco is modern

449767,Room Mate Giulia, Breakfast OK but typical southern european breakfast with little fibers and lots of sugar Coffee not served from the cafe you had to take coffee yourself from a machine , Close to the duomo and galleria vittorio emanuelle just around the corner 
449768,Room Mate Giulia, Unfortunately the breakfast was very disappointing There was hardly anything to chose from and you couldn t order any hot food My recommendation is not to pay for breakfast but to step out and grab something This was the only negative , The interiors were very funky and fun and it was great to experience a hotel designed by Patricia Urquiola It is a new hotel also so there is always something nice about that The location couldn t have been better And the staff were super friendly helpful and stylish as you would expect in Milan

449774,Room Mate Giulia,No Negative, The positive attitude of the staff matched up to the physical aspect of the hotel design cleanliness and location of the hotel We lost a phone in a taxi coming into the hotel and all the staff members at front desk and concierge were very helpful and very very supportive include translation and physical cheering when we hired another taxi to successfully track down our mobile phone 5 stars and more 
449775,Room Mate Giulia, We were unlucky to have the room with windows looking onto the courtyard where they began to tamper with trash bins at some ungodly hour like 6am or even earlier Hardly something which could be improved just a feature which comes with the location I guess , Terrific location and most friendly staff Also the room design made it both comfortable and modern at the same time It actually felt cool to be in the room kudos to the interior designers Good breakfast which somehow does not get overcrowded at rush hour

449779,Room Mate Giulia, The slow service to get a drink in the lobby at night Especially with a HAPPY HOUR sign so loud and clear , Everything The look and feel the breakfast 
449780,Room Mate Giulia, Room was dysfunctional and small Working on desk hardly impossible due to limited space but seemingly it is assumed that nobody would sit on a desk to work in Milano Everybody wants you to become shopping frenzy , The location is difficult to be topped cannot be more central 
449781,Room Mate Giulia, Not a thing it might be the best hotel for value design and location we ve ever stayed in The first night however we were in a room that experienced noisy recycling rubbish collection Make sure to request a room away from the bottles and cans they collect early in the AM though we were also impressed with how quiet the retrofitted windows were , The design of this hotel was sophisticated without being too serious and fun without being goofy We loved how the colors and mood reflected the unique palette of Milan ochres terracottas blacks and greens Our deluxe room was spacious with soaring ceilings and bathroom you could dance in with none of the stupid modern hotel design like windows to the tub or frosted glass toilet rooms 
449782,Room Mate Giulia, The room was a little cramped and not much variety of food during breakfast, Staff comfort of the room location Main dislikes The room was a little cramped and not much variety of food during breakfast

449786,Room Mate Giulia, They put us in a room overlooking all the garbage The smell was awful like being in a sewer It would be horrendous in the hight of summer Getting back to the room was really unpleasant because of it Was terrible with windows closed and horrendous with windows open Couldn t spend more time here than necessary due to the smell in our room as such didn t get to utilise the amenities I don t know what the interior designer was thinking The interiors in the actual rooms is dreadful Green and orange I know that retro is trendy but this is awful at best Trying too hard to be different here and haven t pulled it off I would suggest requesting a room not overlooking the bins if you stay here A great hotel but ruined by our stinky room , Staff were great and no better location around for central Milan Breakfast great and funky interiors for main lobby area and dining area It s actually a great hotel just ruined by the room we were in 
449787,Room Mate Giulia, Simply nothing negative, Hotel is a very nice modern style and very brand new facility Location is excellent Breakfast buffet Food is good and convenient Health club and spa facility is also convenient In general it was a perfect experience

449793,Room Mate Giulia, Can t find anything to complain about , Wonderful and super helpful staff Super close to Duomo square practically 50 steps away Great breakfast the sauna and gym facilities were a super bonus 
449794,Room Mate Giulia, If you are looking for a view from the hotel room the windows are small and you can t see the view Maybe it s different at other rooms , Excellent location just 3 minutes from Duomo You feel really good at the first minute you enter the hotel met by very kind smiling and friendly people Nicely designed large rooms comfortable beds nice breakfast They even give you a device you connect your phone so that you can use wi fi when you are going around the city Very new hotel hope they never change their style I would love to stay there again 
449795,Room Mate Giulia, I can t stay anything negative Except one morning at 7am the breakfast wasn t ready so I just had to have fruit I think they had a staffing problem recently opened that day but they were so apologetic about it The next day it was fine , This was such a great hotel I know this chain of hotels as it is a Spanish one First and foremost the staff were beyond polite and were just brilliant I hope this service keeps up as the hotel had just opened and I suppose they are new and motivated The location is perfect right next to attached almost to the Gallery and the Cathedral The rooms are great too I would have loved to see more of Milan but I was there for work To conclude highly recommended 
449796,Room Mate Giulia, Could not fault anything can t wait to stay again , Location was outstanding in a little lane just off the northwest corner of the Duomo plaza 10 steps out of your front door is the breathtaking sight of the Duomo Eclectic decor was fun not stuffy like a chain hotel Scrupulously clean with friendly attentive staff Excellent breakfast selection until midday for late risers Da Ponti restaurant across the road was a popular choice for locals and tourists alike and very handy for quick lunches and dinners Will be my hotel of choice from now on Would like to say that noise from the street in the mornings is unavoidable when staying centrally excellent location more than makes up for 60 seconds of rubbish collection racket 
449797,Room Mate Giulia, Breakfast selection should be more and different everyday, I loved the Faboulus location and the friendly staff especially Sandra Carmen Thlia Hani And Sarah the design of the hotel is creative One more thing I love it about the hotel they provide you with free wifi device if you want to go out 
449798,Room Mate Giulia, the free buffet had little choices but they promise to provide more dishes or per, Everything in this hotel was excellent the staff the location free my wifi mobile net router 100 mb day the building was just opened Hotel staff wrote a kind welcome letter for us with a compliment chocolate and refreshing cold water The design of the hotel is creative and the location is just seconds to the Duomo The heart of Milan

449803,Room Mate Giulia, Staff at reception needs proper training There are so my of them literally to learn the basics of hotel business I need it to remind one of the guys that I m a pro traveller and book the hotel just because it s newly opened and would like to experience it and that I will write the review as is After big time arguments what is interconnecting room and what is main street view and backstreet rubbish bins view I was checked in 1 5 hour later again in a wrong room facing the rubbish bins as an upgrade Since I had requested prior to my stay a street view room I was put under ultimatum that I can either take the rubbish bins view or wait another 4hours to get a Main Street view room with two queens instead of king bedroom A total mess Illiterate receptionist could be sometimes very stubborn and uncooperative as some of the staff at Room mate Guilia is I had no time to waist and opt for the view Overall made me regret that booked with them since for the same price one could stay at Park Hayat which is just facing Room mate If you are not eager to experience the hotel place your bets on well established hotels around and forget about Guilia There are so many of them with a better service and less expensive They don t provide an ironing service and when you request an iron to do it yourself the answer is we don t have irons , Location since I book it to be close to the high end shopping streets and be able to go daily to Duomo 
449804,Room Mate Giulia, Maybe the breakfast doesn t have that variety but it was very fine with me 2 kind of cheese 3 kinds of cold cuts while 2 includes pork and ham good pastry 3 kind of fruits butter and jams eggs and mashrooms the water takes a bit time to go worm but the MAIN drawback of this hotel is that they don t have laundy section or even ironing as they deal with an exterior vendor and takes full day to finish AND they don t offer ironing device for security purposes , The room was spacious Amazing location Superb friendly staff Clean room and over all they care about donations which is quite impressive and very kind
