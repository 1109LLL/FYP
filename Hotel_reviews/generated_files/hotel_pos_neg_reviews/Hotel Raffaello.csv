494939,Hotel Raffaello, We had a room on the fifth floor and it was very hot The AC could not handel the hot room tempertute , Wonderful staff Close to a shoping center and the tram stations Impressive breakfast 
494940,Hotel Raffaello, The worst experience we have ever had in a 4 starts hotel Bad WIFI it lost connection every now and then Not tidy room first night there was a roach in the room then we had to change to another one Water leak from air condition , Good breakfast 
494941,Hotel Raffaello, location and slow tram into centre , Handy location of tram station opposite but a slow journey into centre attractions Helpful checkout in early hours Quick friendly check in Clean room 
494942,Hotel Raffaello, Would have liked tea coffee making facilities in the room as there was a well stocked mini bar, The staff spoke English were professional and friendly the hotel was more of a friendly run motel which was excellent
494943,Hotel Raffaello, The 30mins tram trip to the centre, The Handy device they were offering in the room An all timer internet device with the tourist apps A great thing that s a must for all hotels The complimentary detox water they were offering at the lobby The breakfast with warm croissants etc the tram station in front of the hotel
494944,Hotel Raffaello, Location is far from center but tram in front of door Reception girl is quite passive in helping you out you have to ask everything such as when is breakfast where is breakfast how does tram work etc Don t forget 5 euros tourist taxes per person per day and parking at 10 euros per day is expensive but with surveillance No good parking available in the neighbourhood just on the dirty streets of Milan , Very clean good rooms silent excellent breakfast with lots of choice fruit etc Also kind staff for breakfast You get 2 different and large pillows each to suit your needs one hard one soft They installed a smartphone which you can use for free international calls but we haven t tried Very nice restaurant just around the corner called l immagine highly recommended Top 15 in Milan and normally priced 
494945,Hotel Raffaello, 2300 euros were stolen from my room in my absence just the euros were taken all other currency was left behind, Nice staff prompt service very close public transport 
494946,Hotel Raffaello,No Negative, We stay at this Hotel only for one night but it was far beyond my expectations little bit far from the centre but with Direct tram line excaclty outside of the hotel Everything was nice specially the jacuzzi cabin in the toilet the room very comfortable and big very clean very generous breakfast The most importand was the value of money definately worth every euro on it On my next visit to milan definetaly it will be again my No1 choice 
494947,Hotel Raffaello, The hotel doesn t give the water to drink I arrived at night and I had to buy water in mini bar The first guy from the staff was tired and didn t want to serve me I spent only 7 hours in this hotel and when I wanted to pay and to get the receipt at night he said me that I do that morning before leaving It wasn t nice , Very good breakfast The room was clean but it s 4 star hotel so it s normal 
494948,Hotel Raffaello, Thank you , The staff was very friendly and helpful The room was tiny but very cosy The amenities are offered in the bathroom The underground was just next to the hotel 
494949,Hotel Raffaello, 1 The wifi could be faster or there could be an option to upgrade to faster one 2 The gym equipment could be upgraded but we understand that this is a massive cost , It is our 3rd stay in this hotel and we must say that they are working on improvements The staff is great the breakfast buffet is fantastic very vegetarian friendly and they now have 2 kinds of plant milk The rooms are spacious and the beds are very comfy 
494950,Hotel Raffaello, There was nothing really that I didn t like The Bar didn t handle cash which was inconvenient , I loved the room we were allocated It over looked the front of the hotel and allowed the sun to shine in most mornings The front desk staff were amazingly helpful and had no problem with giving us advice on where to eat drink night life along with pointing out places of interest to visit and highlighting them on a map for us We checked our rather early but the hotel had a service for holding luggage so we could come back later for it which was fantastic There is a tram Line on the streets both in front and behind the Hotel which brings you right into Milan City Center in 15 20 mins Its an ideal hotel for a weekend visit Easy access to public transport Friendly hand helpful staff Classy and comfortable Overall just a great hotel to stay in 
494951,Hotel Raffaello, The hotel is located right in the 14 tram station but it takes a bit long to get from the central railway station to the property , great breakfast clean room comfortable bed
494952,Hotel Raffaello,No Negative, food was very good coffee was very tasty room was clean bathroom was big and clean Near is tram metro with tram you can go to Duomo cathedral or in other places 
494953,Hotel Raffaello, Hotel needs to improve the WiFi signal on some floors and also the sign up process This was really annoying , The room was surprisingly big nice and clean I just loved the mattress and my sleeping quality there I liked the bathroom and shower as well it was very clean and comfortable Receptionist and hotel manager was very kind and helpful during our stay and helped me with my booking cancelation issues without the any doubt I really appriciated this Overall it is just a great hotel with it s great staff I will definitely come back here again 
494954,Hotel Raffaello, The location So far from city centre As we didn t know it we had to walk 40 minutes from metro to the hotel , Amazing breakfast such a good variety of food The room is clean and quite big to be honest The staff were very helpful Located 100m from mcdonalds and tram station which leads to city centre 
494955,Hotel Raffaello,No Negative, Hotel was nice beds very comfortable Stuff supportive Lots of restaurants around and city center just couple of minutes drive away Our room was really huge but it most probably was an upgrade Breakfast was excellent just breakfast loccation could be a bit bigger as we hd to wait for free table
494956,Hotel Raffaello, I wish I could have a bath robe , Nice Hotel and friendly staff members Great location Easy access to the center of Milano Nice and clean room Shopping malls including great super market are walking distance Breakfast is pleasing and has variety of selections No complain 
494957,Hotel Raffaello, Bathroom was big but had some flaws Two sinks but one was clogged No bathtub High tech massage shower cabin that we never really got to work Shower water too hot no matter the setting of the regulator , Spacious nice family room that was really more of a suite Out of town location but the tram stops right across the street Nice pasta pizza fish place also across the street 
494958,Hotel Raffaello, We stayed in the same hotel few months earlier as it was a good location for us However now certain aspects changed e g we were told that we cannot be given an iron and the ironing service takes 24h That was a bit of a shock for us specially that the member of staff went to great detail how we should have transported our shirts so they would not get creased etc We would simply expect more understanding and kindness towards business visitors , The wifi is very fast and the beds are comfy The breakfast is very good too 
494959,Hotel Raffaello, Lift small in our part of hotel, Car parking direct access from hotel Adjacent rooms for family Breakfast fine wide selection and choice Tram stop for Centre across the road Room Bathroom clean and spacious Bed smooth and comfortable linen
494960,Hotel Raffaello, Reaching the hotel with the tram was easy but took most of our time Because the line which stops in front of the hotel was too slow The room which we stayed was in the street side and it had the noise problem in the night , It was very clean and comfortable The breakfast was really good 
494961,Hotel Raffaello,No Negative, Very warm comfortable room Amazing service with a smile and very civilised efficient and helpful Breakfast was good and plentiful Our room was tidied and beds made everyday without fail 
494962,Hotel Raffaello, Very hard beds Not much night life around the locale, My room was very quiet and clean The hotel was well decorated and clean Location is good as long as you don t mind traveling in on the trams each day
494963,Hotel Raffaello, Bathroom was quite old felt like hospital Room was dark no proper lightning No carpet in rooms so it s quite cold to stay there No kettle in rooms for tea coffee so you have to order it costs extra through the reception Breakfast okay I wouldn t recommend choosing this hotel if you get there without a car no tubes nearby so you end up walking quite a lot , Staff was friendly price okay 
494964,Hotel Raffaello, A little bit far away for shopping center should take bus for 30 mins , Plenty of choice for breakfast Neat Clean comfortable room for sleep and the room is big enough for 2 28 inch luggage The receptionists are very kind and enthusiastic to help the guests 
494965,Hotel Raffaello, The beds were extremely hard when we arrived the bar fridge did not close properly so everything was warm and the air conditioning was not working , The rooms were of a good size and the staff were very nice
494966,Hotel Raffaello, I would have expected an iron to be readily available as standard or a room that has ironing facilities A service that starts at 10am the following day and returning them at 6pm is not sufficient ,No Positive
494967,Hotel Raffaello, distance to city centre was not as described on bookings com and no variety on breakfast wifi signal was not very good , staff was amazing very helpful and professional clean and comfortable hotel 
494968,Hotel Raffaello, This hotel can be everything but 4 star It really doesn t meet the standards of a 4 star hotel I would say probably 2 or even 1 star I hope I am mistaken but I had to remove the blanket in order to be able to sleep otherwise I could not sleep because of itching I hope they understand what I mean and do something immediately They ruined the reputation of Great Raffaello The photos I saw while reservation were far from the room I received And even they charged me more than what it was scheduled The best word to explain this hotel is TERRIBLE ,No Positive
494969,Hotel Raffaello, Poor wifi infrastructure low speed and mess with numerous access points inner yard looks good but early morning is very noisy due to hotel s stuff activities, Clean and nice breakfast 
494970,Hotel Raffaello, An overrated 4 star property Do not have basic amenities such as iron for pressing adapter for charging plastic glasses for drinking uncomfortable beds and air con not working No dining facilities 2 star hotels better, Nothing at all
494971,Hotel Raffaello, It wasn t so much what we didn t like more like personal preference items that weren t there There were no tea coffee making facilities in the room which us Brits are used to so that was a slight downer The bed and pillows were very firm and not quite comfortable enough for us personally The location from central Milan was good but the road it is on is very busy and quite loud So in the summer you would find it very noisy even at night and would not want to leave the door open for air Although I m sure the aircon could combat that issue It was a shame they didn t have an evening menu as it would ve been nice to stay in the hotel to eat if we d been there longer , It was a very clean tidy hotel and the staff were lovely and very friendly and helpful The room we had a triple was a very good size and clean airy and had almost everything you need The physical location was good with tram stops right opposite and a few restaurants just a short walk away Breakfast buffet was quite comprehensive and had something for everyone in our opinion
494972,Hotel Raffaello, This hote never like to 4 star , They never call for wake up and say tomorrow we ll call but never do it Safety box not work The hotel shuttle at afternoon sometimes not coming form ITMA to hotel 
494973,Hotel Raffaello, I was charged 60 euros extra because i was told this is imposed by Government It was no where mentioned in the booking I was in rush to catch my flight for which I could not argue much There are not many attractions nearby the hotel itself , We went to Milan for the expo and got this hotel Staff was very helpful and there was a tram nearby Breakfast was very nice especially the fresh baked croissants and coffee 
494974,Hotel Raffaello, The dust e g on the towels radiato on and under the furniture The shutters are manual Shower options are unusable I do not like the covers that seem so I slept with only the clean sheets , The hotel staff seemed professional Efficient on many levels The room size is comfortable tv is a tiny too small for the size of the room May need some renovation but status is very acceptable 
494975,Hotel Raffaello, Parking apparently was not included in our booking as we found out upon arrival We had to pay an extra 15 euros to reserve a parking space However when we arrived back at the hotel late at night the receptionist told us that the parking is full and there is nothing he could do about it After arguing with him he let us park our car in the middle of the parking terrace and we left the car keys at the reception desk in case the car had to be moved At 7 30am we received a wake up call telling us that we had to move the car ourselves The receptionist apologised for the inconvenience but apologies are not enough for a 4 hotel the least they should have done would be to refund us the parking fee which they didn t Additionally the hotel was overpriced probably due to the expo or some other city event we paid a total of 245 for 1 night ,No Positive
494976,Hotel Raffaello, instead of single queen size bed they gave us two twin size bed attached together Bathroom was lacking bath tubs The food was average, The roam was spacious but lacked the quality of a four star hotel
494977,Hotel Raffaello, none, I liked everything about my stay The only downside is that it is a little off the beaten track Takes a 15 carbide just to get to the Station Centrale But it s a great hotel and at a very good price 
494978,Hotel Raffaello, The english knowledge of some staff was quite poor but in generell another person could help quickly, The relationship of price and overall satisfaction is very good The rooms are nice and clean The breakfast has a wide offer of different breads fruits cereals
