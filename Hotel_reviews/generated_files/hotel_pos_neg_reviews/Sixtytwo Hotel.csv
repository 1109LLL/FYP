399732,Sixtytwo Hotel, nothing to mention, everything was perfect as we expected they offer us deluxe double room for our standard room reservation we were upgraded to better room that was very friendly and unexpected breakfast was very good and we had coffee through out the day free of charge
399733,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, The location was perfect for a short break literally on door step to train to airport and walking distance to most things The staff were fantastic and really helpful nice to have mid afternoon drinks and pastries available too Great city to visit on short stay 
399734,Sixtytwo Hotel, My only regret at staying at the Hotel Sixty Two is the fact that I couldn t stay longer And by longer I mean for life If I could move in to this hotel on a permanent basis I would do so , I booked a standard double room the same day as check in and was upgraded to heaven and beyond upon arrival at the hotel The kind and professional staff gave me the Deluxe Suite with a roof terrace jacuzzi view of Paseig de Gracia and the Casa Batll This is the best room in our hotel sir 
399735,Sixtytwo Hotel, Everything was wonderful , Very friendly reception Excellant breakfast Modern updated rooms Perfect location for Gaudi s Casas and Sagrada Familia 
399736,Sixtytwo Hotel, Nothing the place was awesome , Excellent first impression for Barcelona My husband and I shared a room with my dad and it was comfortable for three people We had a welcome champagne in our room location was perfect five minutes from metro and the room was modern Free coffee tea and biscuits during the day and a free happy hour at 6pm Great location extremely friendly and bilingual staff We didn t eat breakfast in the hotel as we wanted to experience different places We had issues with the wifi in the room and they immediately provided us with a hotspot to use during our visit for free This was awesome since we didn t have a sim card and could use wifi all through the city We stored our luggage after check out and they let us continue using the hotspot until we had to leave for the airport We would totally stay here again Great service 
399737,Sixtytwo Hotel, No real problems at all Only bump was that I hit my leg couple times to bed frame which is much larger than mattress and dark in color , Room was extremely nice with many practical features Really loved it Best room light system I ve ever seen in hotel room Staff was extremely nice and always doing their best to help Prompt service as well Location of hotel is central to say 
399738,Sixtytwo Hotel, Our whole suite had one lighting system so whenever i used the bathroom shower toilet during the night or in the early morning hours the whole room had to be illuminated There isn t a separate bathroom light Husband was NOT a happy camper In room snacks and drinks weren t refilled after we ate drank them Would ve liked to enjoy them again Blackout roller shades needed some attention They were quite squeaky when rolling up or down which takes some time , Staff was eager to help when possible Taxi stand right outside Upgraded us to a suite Shower was heavenly Great coffee shops and eateries just steps away 
399739,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic experience staff very helpful and recommended some great restaurants The room was modern and spacious and overlooking the Beautiful tree lined boulevard Breakfast was fabulous Hotel is central and close to great restaurants and shops We will definitely be returning
399740,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, Super friendly staff Everyone is very helpful and always wears a smile Love the welcome drinks free apples at the entrance and free coffee and cookies in a comfortable public area Great breakfast with good quality Besides the buffet there is a good spread of eggs that you could order from the kitchen including Spanish omelette scramble eggs boiled eggs American omelette egg white option and even soup noodle 
399741,Sixtytwo Hotel, No complaints, SixtyTwo was set in a super convenient location The staff were excellent and courteous and the room with free coffee and nibbles was a nice touch Our rooms were a little small but very comfortable bed and linen was especially comfy His places oozes class and the 4 stars is definitely warranted in this case 
399742,Sixtytwo Hotel, I really do not like the light setting If you choose the WC light on then your welcome light may off And you have to click the bottom a lot of times to make the room lighter This part is annoying , Overall the room is good Great location for shopping and visiting Casa Milan Casa Ballet The room is clean and tidy as well as the bathroom The staff are helpful and patient 
399743,Sixtytwo Hotel, Nothing one of my best hotel experiences, We travelled with a young baby and the staff were so attentive and accommodating and made our stay very comfortable The service was excellent the room very comfortable and the location perfect for us 
399744,Sixtytwo Hotel, Extra choice of juices should be available Only orange juice was offered at breakfast As non coffee or tea drinkers we weren t left with much choice , Bottle of sparkling rose wine with sweet treats on arrival was a lovely touch and they all tasted fantastic Staff were always very helpful and proactive with advice about which tourist sites needed advanced booking Hotel in a great site We loved the court yard or balcony space at the back of the room it gave a sense of space and relaxation 
399745,Sixtytwo Hotel, the narrow corridors which is inherent in an old refurbished building and no water sprinklers in the rooms I m not sure if they have fire safety procedures , It was a thoughtful gesture for the hotel to offer all day access to the lounge for free Cava at 6 pm and coffee The front office staff were helpful in providing information even if they are short handed and had to all the guests request which is characteristic of a boutique hotel 
399746,Sixtytwo Hotel, The breakfast was very nice but understaffed We often had to wait for coffee because the machine would quickly run out of water Tables weren t cleared fast enough This is not a negative on the breakfast staff they were lovely I just think they need an extra person or perhaps a different system , Location is perfect Staff was wonderful Lovely hotel 
399747,Sixtytwo Hotel, No drawers or dressing table, Breakfast great Bed was large king really comfortable Separate shower AND one over bath Bottle water daily Free glass prosecco early evening
399748,Sixtytwo Hotel, Some details in the bathroom should be renovated better maintained , Situation is very good walking distance from Gaudi La Pedrera and casa Batllo as well as Pla a Cataluna Hotel is modern clean breakfast is very good staff is very nice and helpful 
399749,Sixtytwo Hotel, We came early and were told that we cannot check in although we are genius booking members We waited until 2 but still we didn t check in on time as they told us the room wasn t ready We had to wait again , The location The design The breakfast The breakfast waitress was sooo good and the lounge at the first floor is amazing 
399750,Sixtytwo Hotel, Nothing, Just got back from a superb stay at The 62 I absolutely loved it From the friendly staff nice room with terrace a fantastic location for exploring the Eixample quarter with Gaudi amazing architecture and luxury shopping everything here Already planning a trip back My best hotels group in Barcelona it s meens 62 for couple and for travelling with fiends or alone and 64 appartaments for family 
399751,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, Perfect cleanness perfect breakfast and friendly stuff Loved the place and location I guess only thing which was not so great is that you could have seen of facilities being used and is not brand new recently new however it does not concern me 
399752,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was so cute and clean Staff was soo friendly and helpfull For my husbands birthday they made us a favor and arranged us a room with balcony looking at the city The location was perfect from the airport you can directly go to the hotel by metro or train Both of them are infront of the hotel Breakfast is also enough and you should try omlette You can walk to most of the places to visit And hop on hop of bus station is also soo close If its your first visit to Barcelona mine was it so its the best hotel to go Dont waste time to look for another hotel 
399753,Sixtytwo Hotel, Nothing although we were staying 5 nights so some drawers or a shelf for clothes would have been great, This is a fantastic hotel location is perfect close to everything including 2 Gaudi properties just up the road We were upgraded to a junior suite with a lovely outdoor area for sun bathing and just sitting with a glass of wine This had protected views over the street but still was not noisy we left the window open all night the bed was enormous with beautiful linen fresh pillowcases everyday Great breakfast only 16 friendly efficient staff can t fault it at all helped make a great stay in Barcelona 
399754,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, We loved our room it was quiet and the bed was really comfortable with good quality bed linen The staff were friendly and helpful and they made our stay which was for my daughters 30th birthday fantastic 
399755,Sixtytwo Hotel, Nothing , Nice as we came with small kids one month and 2 years the hotel was very good It was the best breakfast that we ate not big but exactly like we like and we didnt want anything else
399756,Sixtytwo Hotel, Nothing, Lovely big bed Hotel was very clean Friendly and helpful staff Our little baby unfortunately was poorly during our stay but the night staff helped us arrange a doctor and taxi and called the following morning to see she was ok Would highly recommend this hotel 
399757,Sixtytwo Hotel, The hotel was very warm but that is a personal choice and opening a window helped cool our room , Perfect location with friendly and efficient staff Breakfast was wonderful with a huge range of cold choices and individuality prepared cooked options The free glass of cava in the early evening was a great bonus 
399758,Sixtytwo Hotel, The sound proofing between rooms was not as good as it should be for a hotel of this standard Other than that for a city centre room ours was quiet , The location is perfect for walking to the old town and also seeing the other sights It is very close 100m from a metro station and also the Renfe station linking to the airport Lots of places to eat and drink nearby The beds are big comfortable with excellent duvets and pillows There is a nice lounge looking out over the main street 
399759,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, We had an absolutely amazing experience at Sixtytwo Hotel This was our first trip to Barcelona and the location couldn t be more perfect The amenities at the hotel are excellent everything was modern clean and comfortable But the best thing about the hotel was the staff and particularly Laura She did a wonderful job helping us figure out where to start our tour of Barcelona helped us buy tickets to a few attractions and even gave us a portable wi fi device for free Next time we are in Barcelona we are staying here again 
399760,Sixtytwo Hotel, Nothing , Location was excellent 5 minute walk from train station Direct to airport Within walking distance to everywhere Breakfast cooked to order as well as pastries meats fruit and yogurts available Fresh orange juice Really nice toiletries Lovely staff I cannot fault this hotel 
399761,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, Staff on Reception went out of their way to help us allowing us to amend booking on the day we arrived Location of hotel is fabulous close to Rodalies for airport and metro connections plus price was very good early in January Bed extremely comfortable bathroom was fantastic plus views to Passeig de Gracia following room upgrade Thoroughly recommended 
399762,Sixtytwo Hotel, The pillows were too flat and did not give enough comfort , The hotel may be small but conveniently located There are restaurants and shops just downstairs and the metro is within minutes away It is also away from the crowd of La Rambla and makes this more exclusive
399763,Sixtytwo Hotel, Tv was pretty poor selection of channels Mostly Spanish Cleaning staff unable to speak English but friendly and always safe leaving iPad etc around the room , Fresh water Nespresso for caffeine boost Big bathroom Balcony view great Clean No bed bugs Friendly helpful staff 
399764,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, The staff of the hotel is very friendly and accommodating with great recommendations for restaurants Great selection of local food for breakfast The hotel is also in a good location to allow for walking to and from some of the tourist sights of Barcelona 
399765,Sixtytwo Hotel, Nothing not to like, The location was great staff super friendly and helpful modern hotel Great bed with best ever pillows Metro stop outside for the airport Free coffee all day in the lounge as well as Presecco early evening Book it now 
399766,Sixtytwo Hotel, The pillows the size of the bed not long enough for me I am quite tall and the ventilation did not work warm , The space the bathroom the situation 
399767,Sixtytwo Hotel, Took a few tries to fully figure out the lights Pretty straight forward afterwards, Great city location and access to all key sites in Barcelona Shoppers paradise Staff were great and breakfast menu fabulous Ultramodern boutique hotel 
399768,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, Conveniently located on the posh shopping belt on Passeig de Gr cia Sixty Two Hotel is just a 10 min walk from the AEROB S at Pla a Catalunya and directly across the street from Gaud s Casa Batll Friendly hotel staff upgraded us to a bigger room and we even had a delicious chocolate bar with a personalized message waiting for us when we arrived Despite being in the heart of town and facing the main road the room was quiet enough There is complimentary tea and Nespresso coffee on level 2 which is a nice touch for a small boutique hotel 
399769,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, Service was super as were added touches e g Cava between 6 6 30pm each day comfortable surroundings location excellent Will be back Transport system to airport just beside hotel 
399770,Sixtytwo Hotel, can t think of a thing all was great , Entire property is gorgeous beautiful and chic rooms decor vibe comfort and modern best service at front desk welcome bag at room samsung tv Nespresso shower Natura Bisse toiletries 
399771,Sixtytwo Hotel, The housekeeping staffs I put the do not disturb sign clearly and the staff just came barged in around 9 30AM when i was dressing and half naked when its CLEAR that i had my DND sign on It was rude and i feel violated , Location is perfect 
399772,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, This hotel is the perfect choice when visiting Barcelona Situated in the best possible location walking distance is all the famous sights best tapas restaurants The staff are really helpful friendly We received a complementary upgrade to an apartment on the top floor it was incredible Had 2 balconies amazing views of the city Wish we could of stayed longer We will be back

399776,Sixtytwo Hotel, Bed wasn t super comfortable No bathrobe or slippers in my apartment, Given an upgrade to an apartment which was huge Staff are excellent very helpful with reservations 
399777,Sixtytwo Hotel, Nothing , Room was clean large for Europe standards Amenities provided were nice Bag of biscotti on arrival bottles of water everyday and toiletries were very generous Free wi fi a plus Would highly recommend this hotel Breakfast everyday was wonderful 
399778,Sixtytwo Hotel, A second glass of bubbles at happy hour would have been nice but the first was great , The staff was very helpful knowledgeable Our room was modern quiet clean and had lots of amenities Best of all it was in a very central location 
399779,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, Good location right near two metro stops that you can get pretty much everywhere from Our room got upgraded on arrival which is always nice Big room clean and well presented 
399780,Sixtytwo Hotel, The cleanliness of the room was very disappointing the bedding was stained the carpet looked and was dirty the bathroom had fingerprints on the glass and toilet flush the bed surround was material which is a definite no no with so many people using it The room was very dusty The third bed was a lumpy uncomfortable setee Not impressed , The staff were very friendly and the location was great 
399781,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic central location Staff were attentative and very accommodating We were unable to check in early however we were upgraded to a junior suite for our wedding anniversary Cannot recommend the hotel highly enough 
399782,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, The location is wonderful It s just opposite to Gaudi s Casa Batllo and lots of shops and restaurants nearby The staffs are friendly and helpful The hotel even provided free remote wifi which made the visit more convenient

399786,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, I liked everything about this Hotel spacious room and the stuff was extremely helpful friendly and collaborative Loved the complementary gift upon my arrival to the room and the bath supplies were absolutely amazing definitely will be staying at it again whenever i visit Barcelona next 
399787,Sixtytwo Hotel, The bathtub was a bit slippery , We got free upgrade to deluxe room facing Passeig de Gracia A receptionist called Chris and another guy who I forgot the name of were super friendly and helpful The location is perfect I liked the complimentary gift nice 
399788,Sixtytwo Hotel, Rooms could be a bit larger but positioned as chic boutique hotel in a great location so all good on that Needs more in the 1st floor rest area during the day , Design style comfort location and breakfasts were excellent 
399789,Sixtytwo Hotel, Lobby smelled like a toilette and noise from the street was somewhat disturbing during the early morning , Location was good Room design was good Breakfast had nice options Staff were pleasant but night manager was not helpful when I had a request 
399790,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, Everything was perfect The staff are very friendly and responsive The breakfast is delicious I loved the cheese selection The rooms have complementary water and Nespresso coffee The manager was very kind living small gifts at our rooms after our check in It was a wonderful stay in Barcelona 
399791,Sixtytwo Hotel, Not a thing everything was amazing, The staff did everything to ensure our family was set and my special needs Daughter had everything she needed The apartment was wonderful and we were very comfortable 
399792,Sixtytwo Hotel, Lights to bathroom need to be on separate control to bedroom no drawers in bedroom to store items, Junior suite terrace is worth the extra money Breakfast lovely relaxed enjoyed the complimentary cava at 6pm really friendly staff great lcoation
399793,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, Simply best services too friendly stuff each and everyone in the hotel goes extra mile to assist Perfect location to access everywhere For sure I m booking here on my next visit
399794,Sixtytwo Hotel, I liked everything very much the only minus was that I could only stay one night , The hotel is just a few steps from the train station with direct trains to the airport in the noble part of Barcelona I got a lovely room with an amazing terrace overlooking the roofs around The room had a modern design unusual but charming layout pleasant colours and interior materials The building is an elegantly refurbished historic building The staff were pleasant and helpful breakfast delicious lot of local and organic products home made cakes Tea and coffee is available through the whole day there was a welcome glass of cava I will definitely come back 
399795,Sixtytwo Hotel, The hotel charged me around 150 euro for six nights when i got reservation for using extra services in firs floor they claim that in booking com in with this services you have special facilities like soft drink and snacks and chips but that was awlful and it was not fair on the other hand The staff did not have uniform and you could not guess this is hotel or apartment , Location AND WIFI
399796,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, The staff were great on arrival and knew that it was my wife s birthday so upgraded us to a larger room They d also left a small gift in our room nice touch Loved the free glass of cava snacks we received in the lounge each evening from 6 pm extra touches that make you feel really at home 
399797,Sixtytwo Hotel, Small details not really in line with the level of the hotel, Modern design wonderful breakfast warm welcome location is very convenient for enjoying Barcelona
399798,Sixtytwo Hotel, Little and unconfortable sink I expected more oj the room , Excellent location and very helpful staff Nice free drinks along the day and great breakfast
399799,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, Great location a major metro staition nearby very helpfull staf Christophe was present most of the time and gave very good indications no need to buy a sim card because they give you a wifi router to use during the stay Very good internet signal in the room and in the common areas Good places around to have breakfast if you want a simpler one and meals Very good room size with an outside area with chairs and table 
399800,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, Very nice modern hotel quite glamorous It s somewhere you could see James Bond staying Beside that I actually don t think I ve ever had better service at a hotel which is number one for me and my family We had our 15 month old boy with us and when we entered our suite we were pleasantly surprised to see a cot already set up with a cuddly toy within it The complimentary tea juice fruit and baked goods was a nice touch as well available all day and evening The staff here were absolutely incredible can t say it enough We ordered room service and they ran out of ice cream one of the staff actually went to the shops to get ice cream even though I told him there was no need Above and beyond To top the experience off the location is perfect with everything at your doorstep You certainly will enjoy your stay here 
399801,Sixtytwo Hotel, There was a funny smel in the reception and we couldn t find the cocktail lounge , We had a lovely big room and the staff were very attentive We also got a free router which gave us unlimited wifi around the city excellent We had a problem with our shower draining and they came and fixed it straight away and even gave us a bottle of champagne A nice touch 
399802,Sixtytwo Hotel, I didnt like the fact that the sun woke me in the morning it was right in my face even with the blinds shut I would have llike to wake up naturally They do with thicker blinds and one that actually joined together properly , The staff was very helful and freindly especially Xenia the waitress 
399803,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, Location of the hotel was great Away from the most touristy part but within walking distance to the shopping area and Gaudi buildings The subway was also at the door step for those who would like to venture further away Front desk staff was very patient and helpful especially Laura We had a junior suite and the space planning and design made the room bigger than actual measurement The terrace that is part of the room was great to chill out Very cosy room overall with different light setting options Will definitely recommend accommodation to others 
399804,Sixtytwo Hotel, Could not get the wifi connection with my laptop and very good with my iPhone Not dependent of the hotel but the public parking downstairs is awfully expensive if you are with your car over 54 night , The hotel is very well located in city center and very cosy
399805,Sixtytwo Hotel, Unfortunately we had loud neighbors which made it difficult for us to stay asleep , I loved that they had cold champagne and assorted types of cheese meat and crackers in our junior suite the day we arrived which was the day of our anniversary The room and bathroom are very modern and clean The location of the hotel is at the heart of a major shopping street where you can find well known brands We found this Ramein restaurant that is around the corner of the hotel it is by far one of the best dinning we ve had in Barcelona The hotel is also near two of Gaudi s creation which were beautiful and magnificent FYI Restaurants don t open until 8pm 20 00 so be sure to have a late lunch 
399806,Sixtytwo Hotel,No Negative, Great location easy to get to from cruise port and train station On metro line and lots of restaurants close by Spacious breakfast lounging area with big windows Lovely patio through our balcony doors

399811,Sixtytwo Hotel, Can get sometimes a bit noisy in the morning as they tried to clean the room at 9am and then at 10am even though we asked them to come back later Beds are small the 2 twin beds are attached next to each other , Fantastic Location as its situated right on the Main Street of the luxury shopping district with many restaurants around Within five mins walk from gaudi s casa Batllo and casa mila Room and bathroom is spacious and beds are very comfortable with nice small balcony with nice view of the Main Street Clean and modern design Provides free wifi egg which can be used all around Barcelona which is a great bonus On the first floor they provide free nespresso coffee and mint lemon water
