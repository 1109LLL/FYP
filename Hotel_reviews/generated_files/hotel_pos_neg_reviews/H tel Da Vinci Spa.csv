122341,H tel Da Vinci Spa, it was a bit expensive but worth the splurge for our anniversary We loved it Wish we had time to use the spa but we were only there for 2 nights so we wanted to see as much of the city as possible , the staff was great we were so surprised to find a rose petal heart on the bed for our 30th anniversary and they also brought a bottle of bubbly we loved the location close to the river and the fact that they had an elevator we had heavy bags and nice cold air conditioning as it was pretty hot walking around all day in the city 
122342,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Nothing , We knew we wanted to stay in Saint Germain des Pres and narrowed it down to two small hotels We ended up choosing Hotel Da Vinci because of location closer proximity to river because we planned to walk to most attractions and the private spa We couldn t be happier with our choice The room and bathroom were small but perfect Everything was well designed to maximize use of space and the size made it easy to get ready in the morning The shower was THE BEST with unbelievably great water pressure The hairdryer could dry any head of hair in no time flat The room was very quiet and the bed very comfortable Most important everything was spotless The spa was wonderful but please book early to get desired time The bottle of Prosecco at check in was thoroughly enjoyed We loved every minute Thank you to all of the gracious staff 
122343,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Price of the hotel however it is accurate to the area But at least you get a great night of sleep in well taken care of hotel , Very clean I loved how attentive staff was Getting a foot massage after all day sight seeing from Louis was a excellent idea loved loved staying there
122344,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Small room expensive considering we had family staying 1 minute walk up the road and their room was half the price of our room and was a similar quality, Great location
122345,H tel Da Vinci Spa, A few minor but important details no coffee unless you paid 19 for their continental breakfast that was majorly weird and disappointing for a four star hotel Also what seems to be a steamy hot tub room is really a very pleasantly temperature pool No way to put it in hot water and no way to turn up the temperature We had a great time down there but it was disappointing at first I thought it was really a spa where we could steam and so forth Thinking of it more of a private pool made it a lot more fun , An oasis in one of the nicest neighborhoods in Paris Five minute walk to the louvre and while the number of semi furnished posh boutiques made me slightly uncomfortable it was a great base for exploring Paris I would stay here again Great bed great air conditioning really nice staff No complaints at all and I m extremely picky about hotels 
122346,H tel Da Vinci Spa, There was no heat in the room which was absurd given the 600 night cost There was mold in the bathroom The custom airport pickup was 1 hour late The room size was perfect if you were 3 feet tall , The staff was accommodating when we checked out 50 early 
122347,H tel Da Vinci Spa, The breakfast in it s strange pricing system Yet it was delicious , The staff were wonderful extremely helpful and courteous particularly the jewel of a lady Miruna
122348,H tel Da Vinci Spa, experienced senior staff needed staff try hard but there is a lack of elegance and I got stressed after problem in bath tub drainage facility problem happens though it could been handled differently including follow ups ,No Positive
122349,H tel Da Vinci Spa,No Negative, Croissants were incredible but the staff was the best part of the hotel They were warm and friendly and very helpful The location is perfect close to the Louvre and Musee D Orsay as well as shopping in the St Germain district There are many restaurants to choose from in the area Stay here if you enjoy convenience and hospitality and a really great shower 
122350,H tel Da Vinci Spa, The food catering was very bad quality however , This was a very pleasant discovery in Paris The staff is impeccable The comfort is guaranteed and the products are top luxury Great value for money in the best area of Paris 
122351,H tel Da Vinci Spa,No Negative, The staff go above and beyond As a solo traveller the blonde lady in reception is incredible she gave me so much advice and was so caring and genuine The location is truly prime Saint germain is the best part of Paris would recommend this hotel and stay here again 
122352,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Personally I don t like duvets but as it was only one night we didn t see if there was an option in consequence the room seemed a bit warm but we opened the balcony doors and cooled things off , Staff very friendly and helpful The hotel is tiny but wonderfully well thought out and we would stay there again Great for couples 
122353,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Room we were in was small for a couple Large people would struggle, Beds very comfortable Very good location to find quality restaurants at reasonable prices e g Petite Zince
122354,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Nothing, The Receptionist was excellent very helpful her name was Rafaela I think The Spa was really excellent and great to relax after a long flight The breakfast was very good fair price
122355,H tel Da Vinci Spa, I didn t like how little time we had and that we missed the delicious breakfast , The hotel staff were amazing We had an emergency and had to cut the trip short by two days The hotel helped us get immediate transportation to the airport ensured we had fresh croissants and pastries tucked away for our long trip ahead and helped load our luggage into the taxi despite pouring rain that morning Before boarding the plane the hotel sent me a personal email wishing us well and informing me that they would not charge us for the two additional nights despite leaving without any prior notice The hotel itself is beautiful and somewhere you d aspire to stay More moving though the staff Truly in a time when good customer service seems hard to find this hotel went beyond customer service and showed empathy and regard like I ve never experienced Whenever I m in Paris again there s no doubt where I ll stay And in terms of word of mouth any friend or family traveling to Paris now knows where to stay without question 
122356,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Low number of services marketing pictures instead of reality this is a 3star hotel Small rooms No room service only during the evening We had to wait 40 minutes for the taxi and missed the our meeting which was aim of our visit in Paris ,No Positive
122357,H tel Da Vinci Spa, When we went to breakfast in the hotel dining room the hot food was almost gone We did sleep in but breakfast is served until 11 00 so we were surprised at the tiny bit of eggs that were left and only two sausages The cost for breakfast was 18 each , The room was very quiet in spite of being above the street which was quite busy during the day 
122358,H tel Da Vinci Spa,No Negative, All of the staff were warm welcoming professional efficient kind and helpful This is what makes all the difference in a really good hotel Thank you 
122359,H tel Da Vinci Spa,No Negative, It was a very romantic and cozy place to stay I liked the honesty bar and the bed was really comfortable Also the spa pool downstairs was a nice touch 
122360,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Not much maybe breakfast room a bit cosy , The unique feel to the hotel and room the beds were extremely comfy and the staff exceptionally polite and spoke very good English as my French is not the greatest We were given the room of the adorator who stole the Mona Lisa painting and hid it in the exact same room on the 6th floor of the Hotel Felt a part of history 
122361,H tel Da Vinci Spa, bathroom bedroom a little too small but we understand that it is somewhat typical as space in Paris is at a premium , excellent breakfast and extremely comfortable bed 
122362,H tel Da Vinci Spa, The only issue that we had is one that most people will not have to worry about medical issues that are irritated by perfumes The hotel has a signature scent like many Parisian establishments For us the amount of scent sprayed and showcased in the public areas was just too much Our room was pretty much scent free however the beautiful small sitting area and cafe was too inundated with scent to be able to breath comfortably , The staff and location were amazing I don t think I ve ever stayed anywhere where the staff was so eager to help attentive and for those of us who don t speak French had excellent English The private spa tub was wonderful after a long day tickets for museums saved time the cleaning staff were probably the best ever the room and bathroom were always sparkling The room was very small by American standards but this is Paris and this is a boutique hotel The quality of the decor and finish of the bathroom and the room itself were beautiful and completely made up for having a small room What you don t get in room space you get in location we walked everywhere Many of the major attractions are within easy walking distance The small shop next door is a bounty of amazing home made delicacies and high end pastries We were there every day for baked goods and treated ourselves to various things that we ate on our hotel balcony There was a great crepe place across the street and down a couple doors and the post office one block up a must for sending postcards The hotel was quiet at night as was the street and the bed and bedding were great after a long day There was only one thing we didn t do well with and sadly that would be a deal breaker for us for future visits see other comment section however if you don t have our issues then we would gladly recommend this establishment A huge thank you to everyone who made our stay so wonderful 
122363,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Room size Our room was tiny Probably OK for guests with little or no luggage Insufficient hanging space in room , Staff were very friendly and helpful bed was very comfortable 
122364,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Rooms a little on the small side but then it is Paris , Beautiful boutique hotel very friendly staff and lovely rooms Would certainly stay here again 
122365,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Smoking outside our window , Location was excellent and the decor was pleasant My daughter really loved this hotel She thought the beds were comfortable too 
122366,H tel Da Vinci Spa, We would have liked a larger room We were unaware the room was so small We will consider a better size next time , Friendly and very helpful staff Good restaurant recommendations Overall excellent service Good air conditioning Honor bar 
122367,H tel Da Vinci Spa, The double room was incredibly small though well planned and nicely decorated You should not have to offer guests room for your suitcases elsewhere in the hotel It is the smallest double bedroom even in Paris that we have experienced in a four star hotel The other complaint was the internet provision It is free but you had to keep logging in to access it it was also very slow , The staff were outstanding in their helpfulness and charm The lady on reception could not have been more helpful in suggesting restaurants and providing walking routes to interesting places The location of the hotel was superb but the smallness of the room would stop us going back to this hotel The breakfast was good though given the number of English and American guests it is surprising that they do not provide toast
122368,H tel Da Vinci Spa,No Negative, The bed was super comfortable We had a small private patio which was lovely The bathroom was clean and functional Hotel staff were very accommodating The room is small which did not bother us as we were out and about a lot 
122369,H tel Da Vinci Spa,No Negative, This hotel is lovely The rooms are on the small side but they are creatively furnished Location of the hotel could not be bettered the team are so helpful 
122370,H tel Da Vinci Spa, The toilet seat in the room was quite loose when we arrived and despite making reception aware straightaway it wasn t fixed for the duration of our stay only 2 nights mind you The hotel also felt very compact and whilst this isn t necessarily a problem wasn t what i expected Also the cooked food for breakfast ran low on both days from the buffet and wasn t replenished so I was left with the dregs I would have liked to have seen more awareness from the staff when it was low without having to ask , loved the morning breakfast with its artisan croissants and pain au chocolate they were fantastic rooms were comfortable and very well furnished location was also great staff were very friendly and knowledgeable we also got upgraded without having to ask which was very nice 
122371,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Although most amenities were there the room was uncomfortably small There was no storage and nowhere to hang more than one towel We could barely turn around in the tiny bathroom Would recommend some hooks to hang things on as space was so limited , Lovely little boutique hotel The location was great Very central and within walking distance of many attractions Loved the spa 
122372,H tel Da Vinci Spa, The price is very expensive for such a small hotel Everything is lovely excepting the staircase up to ones room which doesn t fit the style elegance of the rest of the hotel and there is no view So I feel it is overpriced , Service fabulous and hotel very cozy Great location Breakfast Bread croissants could have been heated so as to be less hard but choice was very good and both the setting and the waiter were absolutely charming 
122373,H tel Da Vinci Spa,No Negative, Very kind staff superb location love the theme nice to be in a historic setting with an interesting past Love the decor This is our second visit and won t be the last Want to stay here every time in Paris 
122374,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Nothing Perfect hotel base from which to explore Paris day and night , Super location within easy walking distance of 8 10 top attractions Lovely restaraunts 1 2 blocks away Small but very well designed comfortable rooms Friendly helpful staff 
122375,H tel Da Vinci Spa,No Negative, Very handy facilities room was an excellent standard and little touches made the weekend trip special Location was also spot on Will be going here every time I visit Paris 
122376,H tel Da Vinci Spa, We found the rooms a bit too small Actually everything in the hotel is very small I guess that s what you get when you re staying in one of the best neighborhoods of Paris , The staff was super helpful from the first moment They made a difference in our stay The hotel is very well located and the rooms are super comfortable and clean 
122377,H tel Da Vinci Spa, May be some of the room can be a little small The decorating and the best shower will make you forget anything which could be negative , The wonderful accueil of this great located hotel with all the charm of Italy in France is the place to stay on the famous left bank They will do everything to be helpful to you The best breakfast buffet with a great selection 
122378,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Room and elevator bit small but I guess it would be the same in Paris , Very good location Awesome staff everyone is welcoming Love the spa Nice decor in the hotel 
122379,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Room was exceptionally small we could barely move around OK value for money but only thanks to the booking com 30 discount It s definitely not worth the full price The pool room is nice but the water temperature should be much higher , Great location very friendly staff and clean room
122380,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Breakfast area quite cramped and not enough space for number of residents, Very friendly helpful staff Luxurious rooms although quite small Very nice continental breakfast
122381,H tel Da Vinci Spa, The bedroom was quite small which I think is common in central Paris The bathroom was even smaller than the last time we stayed at this hotel However everything about our stay was as expected Excellent , The hotel is in a great location Staff are very friendly and helpful 
122382,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Rooms on the 6th floor are tiny , Amazing staff and great location The spa is wonderful It can be booked for an hour and it s totally private very relaxing indeed There is a beautiful aroma around this hotel warm spicy oud scent floats around the hotel Elegant and classy 
122383,H tel Da Vinci Spa,No Negative, The staff were fabulous all were very helpful The location is also very good Whilst the room was small it matched our expectation and was decorated very nicely 
122384,H tel Da Vinci Spa,No Negative, The hotel is fantastic everything you would expect from a decent hotel but unique enough to make it an enjoyable experience And not just a random name the Mona Lisa was stolen and hidden here for a while Location was perfect within walking distance to everywhere that we wanted with plenty of great cafes and restaurants close by Above all the welcome and customer service was exceptional which can t help but make you happy thank you 
122385,H tel Da Vinci Spa, We had no bad experiences , We loved everything about the Da Vinci Hotel It is small and quaint and beautifully decorated The room was small but very comfortable The staff is available to help with your every need We will definitely return 
122386,H tel Da Vinci Spa, The breakfast menu had 3 price levels for what level of breakfast you wanted which we found a little difficult to handle first thing in the morning As the Hotel wasn t cheap I think they could have reduced the overall cost of the buffet breakfast giving you a single price take it or leave it , The staff were fantastic and couldn t do enough for you The rooms were small and compact but like a swiss army knife everything worked and was extremely well laid out Very nice location within easy walking distance to shops bars restaurants The Louvre and Notre Dame Cathedral 
122387,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Well I accept that we are in Paris downtown but the surfaces are indeed very limited and the bathroom size rather modest in such a case I have difficulties to understand why a bath is privileged instead of an adequate shower facility , Great location and the bed was very comfortable
122388,H tel Da Vinci Spa,No Negative, We booked the Hotel da Vinci for the final night of our two week honeymoon in Europe We had been staying mostly in B Bs and decided to splurge on a fancy hotel for the last night of our trip It was so worth it The hotel was beautiful and the service was excellent We booked some time in the pool for the afternoon of our arrival and enjoyed it so much that we booked additional time the next morning The neighborhood is lively and very interesting to walk around and there are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby We chose to go directly next door to Saint P res Fleurs picerie and purchased food to go so that we could enjoy it in our lovely room While the hotel was certainly more expensive than our other accommodations it was well worth it to spend our final night in Europe living luxuriously The front desk staff were helpful accommodating and incredibly attentive to detail We would absolutely recommend staying here 
122389,H tel Da Vinci Spa, We had one day out of 2 without internet, Really a lovely small hotel Rooms are small but well appointed and the impact of the recent renovation shows The front desk staff went out of their way to help us get taxes and manage baggage there is no elevator 
122390,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Only slight negative was the extremely small size of the room No problem for a two night stay but might be a bit of an issue for a longer stay , Such friendly helpful staff and the excellent location Very comfortable bed and no street noise Would most definitely stay again Lovely neigbourhood and so close to many of the main attractions in Paris 
122391,H tel Da Vinci Spa, The room was a little on the bijoux side , The concierge was extremely helpful and went above and beyond her duties to make sure we enjoyed our brief stay in Paris The location was also rather fabulous being a stones throw to most of the famous tourist attractions including the Louvre Notre Dame and famous eateries
122392,H tel Da Vinci Spa, NOTHING BAD WOUlpLD BE NICE TO HAVE BASIC ROOM SERVICE AVAILABLE FOR THE PRICE AND ALSO ONE ENGLUSH LANGUAGE ENTERTAINMENT CHANNEL MINIOR THINGS ONLY AS WE WOULD DEFINATELY GO BACK , THE STAFF WERE EXCEPTIONAL MOST HELPFUL AND PLEASANT I HAVE EXPERIENCED ROOM WAS BEAUTIFUL AND IMMACULATELY CLEAN LOCATION IS SUPERB 
122393,H tel Da Vinci Spa,No Negative, The staff where so friendly and made my birthday very special The spa pool we booked for private use and enjoyed a few hours relaxing with a bottle of bubbly it really made my birthday Must stay here again soon 
122394,H tel Da Vinci Spa, One small comment I would have loved to be able to make a warm drink in the bedroom during the early hours On my next visit I must make a note to enquire about this , Loved the ambience of the Hotel It has an artistic feel The rooms are spotless and the beds are very comfortable The staff made every effort to ensure you enjoyed the stay Christina Anna and their colleagues were extremely helpful always courteous and so friendly that it really made our stay very special The Location of the hotel is just perfect within walking distance of great restaurants shops and the louvre etc Lots of museums and galleries yet to be visited on our next trip We definitely will return 
122395,H tel Da Vinci Spa, All good , The staff were brilliant the location was brilliant the hotel room and style was brilliant Is that enough brilliants ha ha I m away on business must weeks and stay at different hotels the service here was the best I d experienced in a long time 
122396,H tel Da Vinci Spa,No Negative, Staff were fantastic extremely helpful nothing was an effort the hotel was cosy and homely a short walking distance of the Louvre and Arcde Triomphe and fantastic small cafe s in the streets behind Laundry close by as well The bathroom it self was a bit small however the shower was a good size and the toilet was in a separate room 
122397,H tel Da Vinci Spa,No Negative, This was our second stay in 2 years We love everything about Da Vinci Anna is extremely helpful with restaurants It is close to numerous museums 
122398,H tel Da Vinci Spa,No Negative, This is one of the best hotels I have been in The staff was friendly professional and helpful in every way The room though small was completely soundproof a great help in this neighborhood I look forward to returning

122401,H tel Da Vinci Spa,No Negative, The staff were very welcoming and friendly and went above and beyond to make sure not only our stay in the hotel was comfortable but our experience in Paris as well You felt you could ask them anything They offered excellent dining suggestions as well as jazz clubs and the best places to shop The hotel is beautifully decorated whilst keeping in theme of its history and the central location was perfect We didn t require any form of transport to look around the area and my mother requires a walking stick Overall had the most wonderful time just wish we could have stayed longer 
122402,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Nothing bad to say, Loved the location and the staff were so friendly The room was small but perfectly formed and we loved having a G T on the balcony before heading out 
122403,H tel Da Vinci Spa, The hotel overall is extremely small so you have to be prepared for this the room itself which was superior with a balcony interior I think it s biggest that they have is very very small to the extent that I can reach to any where in the room without moving from the bed because there was no room for me and my wife to stand or pass from one place to another without one of us jumps on the bed to let the other pass , the staff are nice location is really amazing if you are a solo traveller or petit then this hotel is definetly for you since you will fit in the room
122404,H tel Da Vinci Spa, It would have been nice to have the smallest breakfast option coffee croissants included in the hotel rate with an option to pay more for the larger breakfasts offered , It was clean comfortable and nicely decorated and the staff was warm and helpful Great location close to the river and museums 
122405,H tel Da Vinci Spa, Nothing bad to day at all It was all excellent for us , Staff are so friendly and always willing and eager to help in away way Room was absolutely gorgeous small but it s paris and all you need to do is sleep in comfort which was so easy here There was also zero noise from other rooms or outside which was lovely to be able to completely relax and shut off the outside so you can get a good nights sleep ready for a busy day walking around paris
