365418,Hotel Daniel Vienna, restaurant food was very average a bit of a let down here as it actually lowered overall grade we got buy one get one free frappe coupon when we checked in Nice touch sure but as it was crazy hot we asked at restaurant if we could get anything cold instead coke ice tea whatever one waitress said that she does not know what that coupon is and that it says frappe the other one echoed the same but she called somebody and asked if we can get something else and the answer was no frappe means frappe In the meantime she made quite non friendly comment about our question in German language not knowing that I actually speak German approached both ladies in English so my wife knows what we are talking about Just to point out this lady basically ruined nice check in experience we had as much as room interior is indeed interesting and different the fully look through shower cabin in the middle of the room is quite controversial idea We found it just weird while I can imagine some people would not like it I think this should be mentioned at check in , staff was nice apart from two ladies in restaurant mentioned in not like section this is an original hotel meaning that they try to be different in design style and customer approach Mostly it works in plus however there are small disadvantages again look at not like section location close to main train station very close to Belvedere 20 25 minutes walking to city centre train to city centre just next to the hotel very interesting room interior really urban
365419,Hotel Daniel Vienna, I woke up at 7 on the first day because even with the curtains didn t bloke any light I ask the reception help she gives me eye mask On the sexond day I woke up at 8 even with the eye mask the room was so bright On the last day I tell her when I leave the hotel And only there she told me that they were darker rooms , Very design and cool
365420,Hotel Daniel Vienna, This hotel is a converted office block The public space furniture is mainly recycled wooden shipping pallets All very plebeian and aimed at younger travellers All pipe work totally exposed under ceiling level in public area just adds to feeling Of being in a warehouse No sign of other usual hotel amenities Room small Despite booking for two there was only one set of bedding and towels on arrival more had to be ordered There is no wardrobe space and insufficient coat hangers more had to be sent up Very strange arrangement of hand basin and mirror Mirror at 90 degrees from basin so had to shave from a very odd position , Hotel chosen for proximity to Belvedere our reason for visiting Vienna excellent position five minutes walk
365421,Hotel Daniel Vienna, I didn t ask so I cannot say they re not available but directly in the room there where no reading lamps available , Friendly and effcient staff wonderful breakfast sexy panoramic shower very confortable beds cute hotel 
365422,Hotel Daniel Vienna,No Negative, Absolutely wonderful family run hotel The staff is very friendly and professional the breakfast was fantastic exceeded all expectations The hotel location is perfect as well everything walking distance and transport is in front of the door If I will return to Innsbruck sure I will stay here again 
365423,Hotel Daniel Vienna, this is a cool hotel for people who appreciate design but not the most comfortable or family friendly one hotel charged 10euro a night extra to provide a baby cot this is usually complementary it is after all not an extra bed While the hotel prides itself on being a design hotel the rooms are so minimalist they are bare bones there is no mini bar not even an empty fridge to store baby food or milk you have tag and run down to the reception who will store it for you no coffee or tea making facilities in the room and no complementary water bottle even if Vienna tap water is the best in Europe a complementary bottle of sparkling or still water is a nice gesture while the other amenties such as shampoo are good quality they provide the minimum shampoo wash combo and lotion no hair conditioner or anything else given the price per night i would expect a tough more pampering the light system is interesting design wise but wholly unsuited if you have a baby that needs to sleep early as you cannot turn on the sidelamps which are above the bed separately from the rest of the room you can only dim the light the washbasin is tiny for some reason forget washing a baby let alone a small child in it given there is only a shower albeit a nice one and no bathtub bath time becomes something of an ordeal while the hammock looks cool but it s a waste of space as there is no couch or other cozy seating area to hang out once the baby sleeps other than the bed , Good location trendy hotel nice vibe in the restaurant bar nice outside seating area in the summer very cool historic building spacious room 
365424,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Small rooms No closet no table no chair Too modern bathroom for my taste should have been shown in photos , Beautiful reception and the restaurant 
365425,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Pillows were a little soft but that s just if I had to say anything critical , Very friendly staff entertained my poor attempts at German but had no issues when I failed 
365426,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Not a bad thing for everyone but the pillows were a little soft But each to their own , The location was within walking distance of the city itself and very easy to get around Interesting shower layout make sure you look through the pictures first Friendly staff and quite helpful Clean and simple rooms with nice food from the bar 
365427,Hotel Daniel Vienna,No Negative, Awesome hotel The breakfast was incredible room clean and big staff friendly location close to U bahn and train station and walkable to centre in 20 mins trendy and relaxed vibe loved it 
365428,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Unfortunately the staff of the hotel was very unhelpful sometimes even bordering with being rude which is a pity the hotel has a very nice concept otherwise ,No Positive
365429,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Not much around immediate area in terms of other food options Tea and coffee in room would have been nice , Trendy modern hotel next to garden and palace Corner room had two walls of glass and plenty of light Breakfast varied and generous and included fresh cooked items Restaurant on site 
365430,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Windows in the rooms don t isolate from the road noise Also blinds on the windows make an impression that you are staying in the office Some kind of curtains could have made the rooms looking more cozy Apart from that the hotel is quite far for walking to the city center , Easy connection with the airport via RJ train from the main railway station which is in 5 mins walk from the hotel Modern style of interior in the rooms and throughout the hotel 
365431,Hotel Daniel Vienna, There is no wardrobe in the room Only a few hangers hung on hooks on the wall Also the windows overlook the road and it was quite noisy at the room , Nice restaurant downstairs The bed was soft and comfortable Room and shower toilet were clean Service was perfectly nice 
365432,Hotel Daniel Vienna,No Negative, Very alternative stylish and cozy place Excellent breakfast Indeed very close to Main Railway Station and in the same time few hundreds meters from the center Excellent jogging paths and parks around very green location 
365433,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Would have liked tea coffee in the rooms No disabled access that we could see We travelled with our baby and had to carry the pram up the steps Also the lift is very small , Fabulous restaurant food Very nice atmosphere Rooms very comfortable Great lockers for luggage storage 
365434,Hotel Daniel Vienna, When we checked out the guy behind the desk gave one of my twin daughters a cookie Just one of them Yes I am annoyed at him Other than him the staff is great , The breakfasts are the best The location is great particularly if you like being slightly away from the center Nearly all of the staff are great see didn t like and helpful 
365435,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Parking elevator has been broken, Hotel design something that is too different looks too good urban style Shower guys will love it you can see you girl all the time Breakfast i wish to have same breakfast at home everyday Labels somebody took a great job all labels are funny Family atmosphere
365436,Hotel Daniel Vienna, I would have liked an English speaking news service on tv but no deal breaker that s for sure, I liked the reception area and the restaurant because they were quite informal and funky
365437,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Room is rather small and oddly shaped toilet on one and sink on the other end of the room Everything was ok but for the price I m sure I could have better overall facility somewhere else , Location is really good just few stops with a tram to the centre and few steps from the Belvedere castle Food is great staff are really really friendly and beds are really comfy 
365438,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The hotel has great design but it is very noisy half of the hotel is facing main street and as the windows are thin and without any noise cancellation materials all of it comes to the room and it is dificult to sleep So go for the room in the backyard , The food in the restaurant was great 
365439,Hotel Daniel Vienna, only for real urban lovers room equiped very basic and in real raw urban style only bed and one chair shower with pure glass wall so no privacy at all Noisy street in front of Hotel and this noise you can hear also with closed windows Wifi in very poor quality in room Definitelly no enough value for this Price I was in other Hotels in Wien and you can get more for the same price , Good breakfast
365440,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Really these are only small things that would have been nice An extra pillow on the bed and some bathe robes There is a lot of glass windows Perhaps a few more comfy chairs in the lobby area for busy times like Saturday breakfast time , Hotel Daniel staff went out of their way to be helpful as we were not German speakers Their English was excellent The bar and restaurant had a great atmosphere and wonderful food The bartender was full of knowledge about the wine list and I ended up trying some great Viennese wines due to his reccomendations The breakfast and hotel bakery were very very tasty It s very hard to create a relaxed hotel lobby bar and restuarnt that you want to hang out in but they have done an excellent job The hotel is unusual and quirky as it s an old converted office block but has all the modern conveniences great design and some unusual features such as hammocks and see through glass showers in the rooms Very fun 
365441,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Breakfast is a bit pricey but the dining room is really beautiful , We really loved how light and airy room is And the hammock is really great addition Impeccable design in whole hotel 
365442,Hotel Daniel Vienna, I was surprised to discover a transparent shower cabin in the room and the staff in the bar downstairs seemed to be ignoring us during breakfast, Very nice rooms with a great design
365443,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The room seemed a bit too small despite being a Superior and the hotel was not even full Also there was only one towel and the bed was ready only for one person and not a couple , Location is perfect Staff is very friendly The room was very clean and warm The shower was fantastic 
365444,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Not possible to completely darken the room Very dry air, Very welcoming and professional staff excellent breakfast and food 24 7 reception The rooms are tastefully designed with comfy bed and shower Well connected with public transport 
365445,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Small things Room was boiling had to fight the heating No privacy when showering the glass is clear and next to the bed so be prepared to be on show when soaping up No shower cap extras , Loved the open airy modern quirky dining and lounge area Food was great and available all day breakfast excellent wines good choice good value Staff were all lovely Fabulous atmosphere humorous brand touches 
365446,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Lack of toiletries like cotton etc for the bathroom Just one shampoo and no conditioner body wash etc No minibar Overall lacks a lot of amendments , The design of the hotel and the excellent breakfast buffet 
365447,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Absolutely nothing , This is probably the loveliest hotel we have ever stayed in It s relaxing quirky and everything is chilled and styled in a lovely individual way The room was lovely with a cool hammock and great shower and big window with view The breakfast was fabulous and the staff just so lovely I couldn t say anything better and we will certainly be recommending to all our friends who are planning on visiting in the next few years Keep doing what your doing Hotel Daniel it s perfect 
365448,Hotel Daniel Vienna, nothing to be better at , Great place very good architecture great location the staff were incredible friendly the food at the restaurant downstairs very very good 
365449,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Nowhere to put underwear and t shirts no drawers or equivalent Music sometimes too loud and techno, An oasis of comfort Liked the beds liked the restaurant Liked the ambiance Liked the funky design
365450,Hotel Daniel Vienna, No coffee making facilities in the room and although the hammock was quirky a wardrobe would have been a it more helpful for a five night stay The road which the hotel sits on is very busy and can be quite noisy if you are looking for peace and quiet but the panoramic rooms have a lovely situ , The staff are very pleasant and efficient the bed was very comfy and breakfast was excellent Also the Hotel Daniel toiletries smell gorgeous 
365451,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Staff was rude at the bakery part They could have been nicer to guests Check before you clean the table whether the customer has finished eating or not Or try to smile customer s face once they first arrived the hotel , I like the variety of breakfast at this hotel It is close to the center takes only 4 stops by tram to reach the Opera Building 
365452,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Nothing really it s good value for money We traveled as a couple and were given a room with king bed and see through shower in the same room A peculiarity not a flaw , I liked the fact that when I needed to change the dates of my stay the hotel was very accommodating I also enjoyed very much the rich breakfast and the location next to the subway station and tram D takes you directly to the Opera House in 10 minutes 
365453,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The only thing we could point out is that there was a small constant noise in the room we believe coming from the shower extractor fan , Location is excellent especially if you are travelling by train literally next to the Hauptbahnhof station and situated next to the beautiful Belvedere palace and gardens The breakfast is amazing Everyone should purchase this in advance The decoration is very nice and modern 
365454,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Air conditioning was difficult to control Housekeeping did not make up our room on the 2nd night , Beds were comfy Convenient location Trendy design 
365455,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Just rooms are little small and I think heating system is not ok some times quite hot , I did like the Resturant they are amazing and nice food also cleaness indeed and fast replying of people and staff there 
365456,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Breakfast was a total mess at 9 in a weekday Too many people having breakfast and not too much food The waitress and the rest of the team were collapsed, Decoration was good in the Lobby and bar Employees at reception were keen with us but they couldn t respond to some of the questions we had
365457,Hotel Daniel Vienna,No Negative, The hotel is in a very convenient location for the Central train station and all the sights one wishes to visit It has a nice welcoming atmosphere without being too fussy The staff are very nice and helpful 
365458,Hotel Daniel Vienna, I didn t take the breakfast because it was a little bit too pricey for me And also coffee tea maker could be added to the room , I liked the overall look of the hotel and location of it Staff was friendly and helpful The room was great and I liked the bed and shower Wifi was okay I liked hotel s location you can go on foot to the city centre and visit beautiful places Belvedere is just around the corner 
365459,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The location is not so good ii takes longer time to get to center by walk Aircondition is little bit loud , Tasty breakfast comfortable bed very good restaurant nice hotel with perfect style Very kind stuff 
365460,Hotel Daniel Vienna, No tea or coffee in room and no room service Breakfast should have some other options as it is not worth 18 00 if you do not eat everything on offer Would have liked some more pillows in the room , Lovely lounge and restaurant area Food was great and nice selection of cocktails 
365461,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Because the room has no openable windows could be controlling ventilation more user friendly , Good location to the center near the Belvedere Relaxed atmosphere great design funny glass shower 
365462,Hotel Daniel Vienna, uncomfortable mattress breakfast was large variety but buffet looked a bit messy eggs at breakfast were fried with too much oil AC very noisy in room however if you do not put AC there is no fresh air window cannot be opened and therefore it is too warm, breakfast Burchermuesli was delicious funky lobby area Daniel body cream in bathroom location close to Belvedere Smart room concept nice touches in the room like dimmed light option and hairdryer in every room etc
365463,Hotel Daniel Vienna, We stayed at a panorama room that has to window faces that at night close very well with shutters but when the sun comes up I can see how it would affect some people who are most susceptible to light in the morning My advice get up early and enjoy the city or stay in the wonderful bed with a blindfold , Very cool little hotel It doesn t have the cookie cuter feel of a chain It has really fun quirks like the hammock witch we had in our room had an instruction manual saying stuff like don t do anything here you could tell your mother about Attentive staff little shop in the lobby where they sell the soap and lotion they have in the rooms and tons of other stuff The restaurant bakery is a must visit for people staying at the hotel and also for outsiders At the weekend the place was packed The rooms are cozy big enough and the bathroom has an unusual layout But it s all good as long as the toilet is in a separate room I m ok with a glass shower We stayed at a panorama room witch I highly recommend Corner view to the Belvedere garden and Palace 
365464,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Breakfast was expensive although the choice was good not many people can eat that much to be able to get your money worth Most of the cups plates were chipped this is not hygienic and doesn t represent the price paid , The hammocks were really cool Loved the double aspect windows in the deluxe rooms Bar restaurant area was really nice and welcoming Breakfast times were good Powerful Hairdryer
365465,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Perhaps a little too far out I don t usually mind walking a lot on city breaks but we went out in the morning and stayed out all day as walking back was a bit too far There is an underground quite close by though Really didn t like the shower with glass even though I shared with my husband Shower time should be a person s me time Would hate to have been friends or family sharing a room , Funky hotel great vibe lovely bar Staff were friendly and welcoming really clean and fresh 
365466,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Hotel staff at the desk were helpful and friendly Some of those working in the restaurant less so we weren t up for the big 17 Euro breakfast every day of our four day stay and asked for coffee and croissants two mornings la carte We were not given a full table and were treated very rudely by the albeit busy waitress who by then knew we were hotel guests , Creative repurposed industrial design with all the basics met and a few additional welcome touches powerful hair dryer remote control blinds Lounge is somewhere others in Vienna want to be Location is great for being near to train station and the beautiful Schloss Schoenbrunn does mean a tram or 30 minute walk into the inner stadt which we were often happy to do to work off Vienna s decadent food 
365467,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Rooms facing the main road are quite noisy even if the traffic is much better during the night If you are sensitive to noise or light while sleeping you might want to pack a pair of earplugs and a sleeping mask , Location staff breakfast and overall condition of the hotel was excellent 
365468,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Go and try to get a bottle opener fastest frustration ever, I liked everything but i think the room prices are slightly higher when compared to my other stops that are very similar 
365469,Hotel Daniel Vienna, For me the location was not the best because it is not close enough to the U Bahn In addition the lack of drawers and closet and the fact that the shower was in the middle of the room with no curtain were not the best , In general the hotel was just wonderful and provided all the services I needed easily accessible wifi heating good shower facilities excellent restaurant very helpful staff 
365470,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The hotel is rated 4 yet it has no room service in room amenities fridge drinks snacks possibility to darken the room breakfast buffet is bare minimum hotel is old office building redone so the rooms are ridiculously small no privacy in shower glass all around , The front desk staff really is friendly and helpful
365471,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Breakfast could be less expensive , Good location room super practical very clean amazing breakfast cool and comfortable environment Very cost effective 
365472,Hotel Daniel Vienna, We felt for price paid they could have provided tea coffee in the room While bed was comfy rooms were very basic I have stayed in modern funky hotels with more comfort for less money , The hotel staff were friendly helpful The facilities were clean Location to train station good Very comfy bed 
365473,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The burgers at the retraurant were not well prepared, The rooms were fantastic the whole ambiance of the hotel is not like any other hotel we had ever soon awesome place 
365474,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Breakfast is too expensive 18 20, Very good breakfast friendly staff and loved the decoration of the room Even though there is no closet for a couple of nights is perfect Close to the train station 
365475,Hotel Daniel Vienna, There was a little chaos while paying my bill but in the end everything was correct and fine , The breakfast is amazing the rooms have a very urban style The staff is extremely friendly 
365476,Hotel Daniel Vienna, I wish I would have known that the room had an all glass shower in the middle of the room This was a little weird because I was traveling with my daughter , The buffet breakfast is amazing Really cool vibe in the lobby 
365477,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The air conditioner at the room 506 was not working and temperature raised up to 28 5C by noon We reported to reception and they went to fix it It only worked for that night then stop working again We stayed there 4 days and 3 nights I would have expected management to find another room or compensate us in anyway because the room was beautiful but a real sauna Impossible to sleep Also need to provide potable water in the room There is no minibar or water to drink at the rooms and bar is closed at nights Other than that the place is really good , Design sustainable modern Breakfast is superb And the unexpected details like hammock in the room the vespas and natural toiletries are awesome Very refreshing place 
365478,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The hand basin in Room 216 was the least user friendly aspect because it was rather narrow with a leaky plug and set at right angles to a mirror , It has a delightful modern eccentric style but gets the important things right There is a general industrial feel about the place which gives it its character Even though it stands beside the Vienna Ring sound and light proofing was excellent although a bit compromised by the air conditioning sound The food was of excellent quality and it arrived very fresh and hot The staff were extremely helpful and worked very hard dealing with customers needs rapidly Everything very clean beds comfortable 
365479,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The hotel was about 20 mins walk away from the centre so we did use taxis quite a bit but as there were 4 of us this was quite cost effective compared to trams Everything else was perfect , The beds were very comfortable The air con was great which allowed us to sleep The staff were very obliging and very friendly Gave us ideas of where to visit and places to eat etc The power shower was brilliant 
365480,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Wi fi was quite slow quite a bit of background road noise in the south facing rooms realised as we were leaving we hadn t been provided with hammocks in the rooms, Very trendy with lots of appealing quirky touches good location near to Belvedere and access to public transport friendly staff lovely breakfast
365481,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The place was a little hot in the sun Know there s not much you can do about it Also you should sell your shower gel in 100ml so people can take them with them on plane , Great staff very service orientated 
365482,Hotel Daniel Vienna, It was disappointing that considering the hotel prided itself on being sustainable caring for the planet vegans were not catered for very well , The hotel was really comfortable clean modern the design concept was excellent All in all it was a great place to keep returning to every day 
365483,Hotel Daniel Vienna,No Negative, Room design is nice staff provided a good service and willing to help Location is good too the famous and must go museum is beside the hotel and the S line transport is opposite the hotel 15mins will arrived Vienna town Can try the breakfast which is additional added part remember to reserve a table at least one day before to get a special offer 
365484,Hotel Daniel Vienna,No Negative, We had a great time Big rooms well appointed cool urban feel easy going efficient staff great product The hotel hire out Vespa s so we took one for 15 insurance excess cover 12 cheaper than one taxi and we bounced around Vienna following the hotel s guide which was a great way to spend the afternoon Oh and don t be tempted to eat out the restaurant has great produce well cooked charmingly served easy atmosphere definitely worth trying 
365485,Hotel Daniel Vienna, 1 Menus in Austrian German alienate foreign guests Do something about this please The staff can not be expected to effectively convey translate the menu into similar foreign tastes that they have little to no experience of It makes the dininng experience some what limiting and un comfortable 2 Sink in the room was way too small , Nice staff very energetic and without negative attitude 10 10
365486,Hotel Daniel Vienna, It would be nice if the extract ventilation was just that little bit more powerful as the shower was actually in the room , Very welcoming staff room was spotless and the bed super comfy The shower was just wonderful and the little details like international travel socket adapters and the moisturising lotion made all the difference If you are staying in Daniel Hotel do make sure you also have their breakfast it was delicious This was the first hotel I truly felt and understood the Urban description and loved it We would definitely stay there again should we make a trip to Vienna in future 
365487,Hotel Daniel Vienna,No Negative, Location was very good There was just next to the belvedere Palace We went for a walk in the morning to Belvedere Palace Airconditioner is good working 
365488,Hotel Daniel Vienna,No Negative, Loved being close to the palace Wonderful surprise It s close to the train station that has a lot of shops and places to eat right there A taxi to the main shopping street is only 13 euro You can also walk if you enjoy walking It gives you a chance to find more beautiful historic buildings Loved our stay there 
365489,Hotel Daniel Vienna, This place will suit someone who appreciates modern design creativity and minimalism I loved it Just be aware that the shower is integrated with the room with a glass window so no privacy in case you are sharing room with someone and no wardrobe just a hanging rack , The panoramic room was amazing very modern design which made it a perfect place to relax Great panormaic views on this room Staff were very welcoming and helpful Location is perfect a few meters away from Belvedere gardens and tram Loved this place I am going back there for another two nights 
365490,Hotel Daniel Vienna, We prefer a separate combined bathroom basin WC unit rather than spaced across the room , Good location for access from the main station Nice outdoor terrace Good breakfast 
365491,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The shower in the room was fun but the room was actually pretty small and the layout was strange with the toilet by the door and the shower in the middle There went great facility for the price But Vienna is expensive , Breakfast was great really expensive but there was nice pastries and someone cooking eggs It is really close to the station and the Schloss which is really worth a look 
365492,Hotel Daniel Vienna, No privacy screen in the shower which has clear glass facing bed Shared with my sister father in next room so we took it in turns to leave the other to privacy , Staff very friendly and knowledgable Food at breakfast and dinner excellant Well positioned hotel to get around easily Very funky and modern 
365493,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Breakfast was too expensive 18eur per person , The restaurant of the hotel was very good Nice terrace The room was big very clean and its design was very original in particular the shower I definitely recommend it 
365494,Hotel Daniel Vienna,No Negative, The staff was kind helpful went out of their way to be helpful I m surprised to read a negative review of the staff here in my experience they were great Room was bigger than I expected for an urban boutique very nice Loved having the restaurant in the hotel food was great w healthy choices too 
365495,Hotel Daniel Vienna, No gluten free bread for breakfast and the room ceiling was underconstruction so the room seemed not so cosy , Beatiful breaktast hotel design image and intimacy Location is perfect 
365496,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Staff were not very welcoming friendly, Modern clean and in a good location Great mojitos too We hired bikes at a very reasonable price as well 
365497,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Noisy could not open windows , Modern mixture of old new stylish vintage all in one concept Nearby Bellevedere and with the tram quickly in the center 
365498,Hotel Daniel Vienna, elevators power next to the working table , the presentation of food is not nice but the taste is do good it forces you to forget about the look bed is very comfy shower is artistic i recommend the panoramic room 
365499,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Not sure I like the concrete grey ceilings and walls but that s a matter of taste Apart from that can t say anything negative and I m quite fussy , Urban modern comfortable very clean Literally next to Belvedere museum and not far from main station Underground parking available at neighbouring garage Great breakfast buffet plenty of choice Will definitely be returning to this hotel as close to Marx Globe theatre
365500,Hotel Daniel Vienna, No armoire closet in the room The breakfast is too expensive for what they offer I m not being extra picky it s an expensive place and they try too hard to be hip so having at least fresh croissants natural juices fluffy pancakes and a larger salad bar would really help them, Clean and located right next to Belvedere and a train stop although a bit far from the center The bed was the best I ve slept in a while and the room was clean and super comfortable
365501,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Room layout what do they thing is priority certainly not basin washing privacy , Location excellent bike and scooter hire Cool interior for 30 something 
365502,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Hotel is on main road so we had a very noisy room on the 1st floor , Restaurant is good Staff friendly and helpful Room was very comfortable Good lockers for luggage 
365503,Hotel Daniel Vienna, No complaints , Marvelous place Excellent location next to Belvedere 10 15 min walk to Wien Hauptbahnhof Extremely cool design big bunch of humor Tasty breakfast Just outstanding 
365504,Hotel Daniel Vienna, When we arrived the staffs said the room is full We have to stay at the brother hotel where takes 10 mins drive So i got mad then they provide the upgrade room , It s 10 mins walk from Main train station Nice breakfast but too expensive Clean room 
365505,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Pillows were too thin But we ve asked too the reception and they have provided additional pillows to us Also terrible soundproofing Not originating from street noise but other rooms , Cool hotel and staff Good breakfast Close to the main train station 
365506,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Could do with more hanging space in room , Food interesting unfussy Staff friendly and efficient Interesting decor all that matters e g Bedding good quality 
365507,Hotel Daniel Vienna, View of construction across from panoramic room but understandably unavoidable Staff could have mentioned it upon check in , Smart bike use service tasteful contemporary interiors relaxing lounge dining area and an interesting retail space The welcome staff were conversational and warm 
365508,Hotel Daniel Vienna, I travelled with my parents We booked a room for two it was my fault The funny thing is it is really a room for two and must be a couple actually because the bathroom is transparent , I love this hotel since I saw on booking com Once I stepped into the hotel I really loved more It s the inspired hotel with lots of ideas around you Brilliant design and concept of the hotel Don t worry about the service they are definitely good Its restaurant is quite nice and the food s awesome Our bedroom is very clean and comfortable It s also close to the Wien HBF just about 15 minute walk Don t be hesitated This hotel s COOL 
365509,Hotel Daniel Vienna, very noisy seems to have completely no noise proofing I could hear the cars outside but also all the people toilets etc in the hotel For someone being here for work this can be a problem and when you cannot sleep the cool design becomes irrelevant bike rental is listed in Booking com as a hotel facility but when I asked about there were no bikes available I think when they give it as facility they should make sure it is available or specify it is limited breakfast very expensive at 18 Euro in Vienna one can have a complete evening meal for that money , the overall design clean nice beds and bedsheets
365510,Hotel Daniel Vienna, I apologise for length but it is worth reading We were placed on the first floor at the back of the hotel I had requested the back of the hotel as I had read reviews about traffic noise at the front We came back after midnight following an evening out and the music in the kitchen bar was very loud despite very few people being in there and I assumed it would soon close After further time with the music vibrating through the floor ceiling and staff stood out the back talking loudly under our bedroom window I called reception to ask how much longer this would be going on I was rudely informed that the music would go off when the kitchen closes at 2am the information provided states the kitchen closes at 11pm I also asked if they could do something about the staff talking loudly below my window and was informed that they couldn t smoke inside so they must smoke outside I tried to explain that talking loudly was not a requirement of smoking and could he kindly ask them to talk quietly if they must smoke right under guests windows The guy on reception left me in no doubt that the ability for him and his colleagues to smoke and talk however loud they liked was far more important than guests paying circa 100 euro per night to sleep He said that if I really wanted I could move rooms in the middle of the night however added sarcastically that it would be just as loud as all our rooms have windows then proceeded to chuckle to himself at which point I hung up clearly getting nowhere As it happened the music went down almost immediately which left me wondering why he had to be so rude and also left me with the impression that it was only on for the staff s benefit The talking continued until about 2am however and started up again approx 6am presumably when the breakfast staff started , The impact of the hotel is immediate its very cool with and American airstream outside the front and scooters for hire Inside there are wonderful designer features and a very nice kitchen bar The hotel has a hipster and mid century vibe and the rooms are excellent in size and the beds and shower are excellent Some of the staff were fantastic and friendly others not so read negatives The location is slightly out of the main Vienna inner ring however this is not a problem there is a station 2 mins walk away and the main station that takes you anywhere is only 5 mins walk there is also Tram D just outside which takes you right into the centre within 10 mins There are free to use lockers on the basement floor which is excellent for checking out especially as its so close to the main station There are lots of things I like about this hotel first impressions are very good and instantly warms you to the place and because it is so cool it makes you almost desperate to forgive the imperfections and consider staying here again however for the reasons stated in the negative section I probably don t think I could justify it with myself but if I did I would request a room at the back on the 3rd or 4th floor and take ear plugs 
365511,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The breakfast was very descent but didn t value even close to 17 euros person Although the room was very clean there was no airfreshener at the bathroom very unpleasant The shades at the Windows allow all the light enter the room as a result you wake up from 6 00 am, Very clean rooms helpful staff at the reception and very good location
365512,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The rooms are very small and there is no wardrobe so you have 6 hangers for all your clothes not enough space There was no mini bar so we couldn t have any cold drinks in the room There was no kettle or hot drink facility either we upgraded our room to a panorama but these issues remained The hammock really got in the way when we were trying to get ready It was pretty noisy from traffic outside if you re a light sleeper that would be a problem but we were fine because we re used to the sounds of the city Finally the shower cubicle means you give a full frontal to anyone who is brushing their teeth fine if you re a couple but not so good if it s a bunch of friends sharing , The staff were welcoming and friendly they made us feel at home and were really accommodating The Bakery Restaurant was great we spent the whole of one afternoon just drinking and grazing on the menu we didn t want to leave The decor of the whole hotel was amazing I love the tone of voice throughout the hotel and the scooters and mopeds to hire are cool The location is great with the Belvedere right round the corner which makes for a lovely stroll into the city 
365513,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The rooms were very warm even when we d switched off the radiator , All of the staff were friendly and helpful The rooms were clean and comfortable 
365514,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Bedrooms a little bland on first impression but still nice and clean , The staff were amazingly helpful and the design of the main areas were amazing Fantastic food Also great that they had a disabled room on the ground floor for my dad in his wheelchair 
365515,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The room 205 was right on the corner of the hotel so was adjacent to two busy roads which were very noisy This wasn t helped by the building next door undergoing building work which started pretty early on Monday morning Overall I think if you re going to have panoramic windows they need to be soundproofed or just warn people to bring earplugs We also weren t too keen on the location of the hotel and would have preferred to stay within walking distance of the centre of Vienna , Really cool hotel lovely interior design and the breakfast was probably the best hotel breakfast I ve ever had We got a panoramic room which was really spacious the bed was comfy and the shower was great The staff were really helpful and let us check out at 3 30pm for free after a miscommunication using booking com 
365516,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The bakery was very average The breakfast was also over priced , Rooms were clean and stylish The location is excellent for easy access without being too central 
365517,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Breakfast while excellent is a little expensive for guests and the location is a little tough It is very well connected with public transport but if you prefer to walk it is about 3 km from the center of the city This hotel is at such a high level one wishes the area had more to offer of the same caliber , I cannot stress what a great experience this was Absolutely excellent Love it Fantastic breakfast gorgeous views Wonderful sense of humor but extremely professional Very hip Design is on point here Such a cute gift shop Fantastic restaurant and bar If you were coming to Vienna to just stay in this hotel all day you would be very very happy 
365518,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Room was too hot Second room was too hot Second room had pubic hairs on bed Find a different hotel to stay at , Front desk responded quickly to uncomfortable rooms but didn t achieve much after responding 
365519,Hotel Daniel Vienna, panoramic rooms not really panoramic just go for the normal ones and save your money facilities none existent not even a fridge , Unique hotel it was nice to stay in such an hotel 
365520,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Sound isolation to the outside does not exist at least in our room That is not a problem during the night but in the morning it got pretty loud from the traffic and some building work being done down the road, Stunning interior and service absolutely fantastic food and a very charming and fun vibe all around 
365521,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Location is not in the center but the city tram is less than a block away and you re in the city in a flash Easy to get everywhere , Excellent vibe This place is great We loved the breakfast Organic and fresh Omelet and homemade Bircher and hummus Bar is open late and is trendy and fun The shower was excellent Room is simple and modern and although small worked really well for us 
365522,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Almost non existing amenities in the room Just body hair wash That s not convenient for a short citytrip , Place is all about design Great restaurant as well Book a larger room for more comfort 
365523,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The breakfast can be crowded it is also open for non guests and there is no priority for guests, Large very clean room Nicely decorated with a large in room shower with glass wall Very silent rooms Hotel is in a quiet area but very easy to travel to 
365524,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Perhaps there could be a 2nd pillow for the beds and probably curtains because the blinds are not shutting off the light entirely , Amazing view from the 6th floor especially in corner rooms The hammock is a great addittion to the room experience Overall the aisthetics design of the hotel was superb refreshing 
365525,Hotel Daniel Vienna,No Negative, Loved the decorations in the room and also the comfy beds and pillows was very relaxing after the busy day Also the breakfast was healty and delicous 
365526,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Lack of pillows and the room as boiling we couldn t seem to turn the air con on , The hotel was beautiful and clean with a great breakfast staff were very helpful
365527,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The fact that there was not a wardrobe and not enough hanging space for cloths Plus no toiletries to speak of Plus no fridge and no kettle You had for coffee outside breakfast hours which I only found out on the last day Prior to this was told no free coffee at all No reception to greet me when I first arrived Had to go and ask at restaurant for attention Not impressed , Location was good in that it was close to tram that took you to the train Bed was comfortable Room was very clean Sheets were good quality I liked the locker idea to store your cases for pick up later 
365528,Hotel Daniel Vienna,No Negative, This quirky hotel is friendly and welcoming We have stayed here several times The lobby dining area is nice with good quality breakfast meals and drinks The location is great for driving into Vienna and it s a also a short walk to HBF train station It s a bit of a long walk into the city center but the tram stop is very close and easy The rooms are comfortable but I wish they offered more and firmer pillows You just get one thin one per person A mini bar in the room would also be nice 
365529,Hotel Daniel Vienna,No Negative, My partner and I had a great stay here I noticed a lot of really negative reviews about the hotel breakfast and I was hesitant to eat there But the food was absolutely amazing and fresh Yes it was expensive but the quality is there As a nutritionist and someone who has travelled throughout Europe I know what to expect from the average hotel breakfast The breakfast here was remarkable Plenty of fruit vegetables eggs and clean ingredients And there are also plenty of gluten free options available which I found to be rare in Vienna My breakfast at this hotel was the only decent gluten free meal I could find in Vienna 
365530,Hotel Daniel Vienna, I paid extra for a panoramic room but that is just an room with a large window facing another building so you have to keep the shutters closed anyway Not really added value The noise in the room was around 50 db in the morning when the traffic started and that woke me up at 6 30 in the morning I paid 15 euros for the parking per night which was ok but i was not informed on these costs beforehand Complained about the noise but sofar no reaction received All in all for the visit and the money next time I will find a hotel nearer the centre with no big window , comfortable room bit different than standard hotel rooms 
365531,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Slow too late reply to e mail enquiries When we arrived the room was set up as a single and we had to request additional bedding and towels Definitely a younger peoples venue, Receptionist very helpful
365532,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The room we got didn t have any drawers or wardrobes which was a little uncomfortable , Excellent rooms with a modern design The bakery is superb and the food is delicious Renting a moped is also really cheap and a lot of fun 
365533,Hotel Daniel Vienna, No curtain which on window No clothes cupboard TV is not working it was unplugged but then no channels available Glass wall bathroom We put blanket cover with our shoes at top of bathroom , Superb atmosphere design Wonderful staff Clean room
365534,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The only negative point is a rather large one I m afraid it s level of noise from the streets as there is no double glazing My partner and I aren t used to such a noisy environment and so we barely slept We asked to change rooms which was graciously done but I m afraid that the second room was only a slight improvement , It looks wonderfully modern with a great sense of design and culture the staff were both helpful and friendly and the location couldn t have been more perfect 
365535,Hotel Daniel Vienna, I consider that the price of the room 156 without breakfast which was 17 dinner 15 a hamburger and drinks 4 5 a local beer was too high according to the quality and no amenities The wifi had good signal but didn t allow me to watch a simple youtube video , Everything in general was quite good I spent one night in the Panorama room without breakfast It is placed next to Belvedere palace and you also have a tram next to the hotel which takes you to the center 
365536,Hotel Daniel Vienna, No wardrobes zero storage just 4 coathangers on the wall Badly fitting windows possibly only single glazed so very busy road makes it very noisy all night Blinds no curtains so very light from 5 a m , Excellent breakfast comfortable bed great shower Good menu if you like to eat in the hotel we enjoyed a tasty burger and steak
365537,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Room A C couldn t handle the weather Hallways were nice and cold Breakfast was way overpriced 16 for a poached egg , The novelty of the surroundings The room value Modern and comfortable 
365538,Hotel Daniel Vienna, The fold up bed we had was very very noise as you moved around it for 35euros a night it should have been a much better bed , The atmosphere was lovely 
365539,Hotel Daniel Vienna, I travelled with my brother so having the glass shower didn t really work for us but it s perfect for couples , The room was comfortable and staff friendly Location was good but not within walking distance however public transport was right in front of the hotel Parking underground was excellent 
365540,Hotel Daniel Vienna, bathrooms are see through but that is part of the look would be problematic if you went there with a friend , very hip place great staff great location resto was awesome 
365541,Hotel Daniel Vienna,No Negative, great localization three minutes walk from Belveder great design superb atmosphere espeically in the restaurant downstairs with great drinks and cakes and if it was a separate local I d go there anyway helpful and friendly staff clean rooms There were six of us 5 adults from 21 to 46 and one teenager and surprisingly everyone was satisfied with the standard of the hotel 
365542,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Breakfast is too expensiv and shoukd be included for the price of room , We loved the funky interior hammock in room panaramic view and see through shower The room was comfortable and clean It was easy to rent a vespa to tour the city and there was a lovely terrace area for eating on or relaxing with a drink 
365543,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Nothing am fond of the hotel even it is not in the centre of the city , Very good athmospere in the whole hotel you feel you are really taken care about Simple furniture very clean very good breakfast and restaurant Very helpful staff Really smart luxury

365545,Hotel Daniel Vienna, Breakfast is expensive no kettle in room, Lovely parking great area to stay as its very close to the belvedere palace renting out bikes was an amazing experience
365546,Hotel Daniel Vienna, I didn t like that the shade of the window didn t open taking away half of the pleasure of the view with stripes And not allowing for the window to open a bit therefore forcing the use of air conditioner I missed some water in the room As turists we never know where is ok to drink from the tap And it s not in every tap that the water tastes good The taste of the tap water was not very good so would be nice to have either a rested tap water in a bottle in the room or to have the option to buy a bottle of water inside the room , The building is nice
