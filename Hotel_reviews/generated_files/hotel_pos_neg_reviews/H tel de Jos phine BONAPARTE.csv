21843,H tel de Jos phine BONAPARTE, Rooms very small and dark and quite noisy in the evenings when trying to sleep bring earplugs , Great location very central Staff friendly particularly the female staff members 
21844,H tel de Jos phine BONAPARTE, Breakfast is pretty basic but hey you re in Paris why are you eating at the hotel when there are 20 cafes on each block , Hotel JoBo is cute exotic and is in excellent location Walk to scores of restaurants in minutes Public transport is just around the corner Staff were super friendly and helpful Rooms are Paris small sized but JoBo managed to fit in a huge comparatively bathroom and all the amenities into the room including a mini fridge for that all important cold water after summer days out walking 
21845,H tel de Jos phine BONAPARTE, We had a very early check out and we were unable to get breakfast because the deliveries had had arrived yet however that was minor The smell of perfume throughout the hotel for overwhelming for me My daughter like the smell of the perfume though and said it was cool , I particularly loved the bathroom shower The staff were kind and friendly and Steins who was our front desk clerk on the evening shift went above and beyond to assist the family when my wedding ring was stuck on my finger He called the doctor for me and did everything in his power to help to make me more comfortable with the swelling of my finger Thank you for doing all that you could to assist the family with my finger injury Steins 
21846,H tel de Jos phine BONAPARTE, Rooms are a bit on the small size but this is Paris after all , Super stylish and centrally located boutique hotel Staff is nice Will definitely return 
21847,H tel de Jos phine BONAPARTE, Nothing great for what I needed , Beautiful bathroom funky unique decor comfortable bed and more personable experience The room was on the smaller side but big enough for one person Modern conveniences like a USB connection etc Quite close to a lot of restaurants Metro lively area with lots to do and lots to eat 
21848,H tel de Jos phine BONAPARTE, The coffee from downstairs could improve and it would have been nice if the croissants were warm However this would NOT stop me staying here again , I liked just about everything in this hotel Especially the quiet and convenience of location Such a great area 
21849,H tel de Jos phine BONAPARTE, Being charged for milk for our coffee there was coffee maker in the but no creamer so we went to the kitchen to get some seemed strange to be charged a room service fee for that No shampoo Small rooms , location friendly woman at desk who offered us drinks and snacks until our room was ready
21850,H tel de Jos phine BONAPARTE, There were no toiletries in the room which I believe 4star hotel should have in place Also the rooms were way smaller than presented than on the web I came for business and stayed for two nights on my own and it was acceptable Staying for leisure or any time longer would be in such small and rather less equipped room not be pleasant , I liked the location of the hotel 
21851,H tel de Jos phine BONAPARTE,No Negative, Funky sexy decoration Very punk sort of vibe but stayed true to the place with very Parisian sort of style Best for couples or solo travelers looking to spend a weekend shopping in one of the best districts of Paris 
21852,H tel de Jos phine BONAPARTE, Room temperature could not be adjusted Hot water never got above like warm Room poorly soundproofed We heard every doorstep and every conversation outside It is across the street from the paramedics so constant sirens Terrible hotel for 350 euro night ,No Positive
21853,H tel de Jos phine BONAPARTE, Room a little small , Location was excellant staff also except for little tiff on departure Rooms a little smaller than expected bathroom ok Had been recently renovated creating an atmosphere very much matched to the history of Paris Will stay again
21854,H tel de Jos phine BONAPARTE, Breakfast was a tad disappointing The eggs were a bit mushy and the pancakes were cold A bit expensive for what it was , 10 out of 10 for comfort friendliness and uniqueness Location was ideal Decor was so cool and quirky 
21855,H tel de Jos phine BONAPARTE, The room was very small and the bathroom had no bath Sorry but for 250 euros a night that is unacceptable We loved the hotel but it is far too expensive , Excellent staff Location and comfort 
21856,H tel de Jos phine BONAPARTE, The coffee machine didn t work in one if the rooms No individual shampoos or shower caps etc the items you have to have in a hotel especially if you are only staying overnight No milk in room for the coffee Robe but no slippers etc really poor, The male concierge was so helpful the decoration was wonderful and the bed really comfortable
21857,H tel de Jos phine BONAPARTE,No Negative, Nice hotel with a very special design Double room is not so big but very comfortable nice and super clean Coffee machine kettle tea toiletries sparkling and still water for free every day Amazing salong with beautiful paintings Helpfull professional staff Nice breakfast welcome drink Close to Metro aprox 3 min walking distance to many places of interest in center nice neighbourhood very quiet area Shopping center Marais in 5 min walking We liked everything at this hotel Will definately come back

21860,H tel de Jos phine BONAPARTE, even with all the lights on the room was dark the heavy tapestries and moquette were a little bit overwhelming even if part of the hotels atmosphere I don t really like a soap dispenser in the shower I wish you didn t have to ask the reception for a room service menu we came in late one night and just wanted food brought up , The staff was very welcoming and helpful they provided us with plenty of information whenever we asked The room had a beautiful bathroom with a larger than usual shower especially considering the room size 
21861,H tel de Jos phine BONAPARTE, Some staff appeared to be not very knowledgeable about restaurants etc Decor intended to be ironic I suppose but to me was just odd , On weekdays this hotel is a good deal for Paris Fabulous location in Le Marais about a block from St Paul church
