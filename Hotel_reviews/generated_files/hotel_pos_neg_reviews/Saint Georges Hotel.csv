47496,Saint Georges Hotel, The hotel generally is a bit shabby and being tucked down a corridor in a very scruffy room past where the cleaners congregate with their equipment in the morning I m glad I was only there one night, Location is great
47497,Saint Georges Hotel, 1 No hand douche in bathtub 2 Location Just pay attention Ox Circus Tube extremely packed late afternoons , 1 A very good location 3 m walk to Oxford Circus Tube Station see remarks 3 Cosy room clean panoramic view from high floor acomodation rooms between 10th to 14th fl 3 Nice and helpful staff 
47498,Saint Georges Hotel, I come to this hotel all the time but was very disapointed i brought my brother and his wife with us because i told him about the nice rooms but we were put on the nineth floor where the rooms have not been refurbished i will be comin back and hope to get better rooms as i love this hotel,No Positive
47499,Saint Georges Hotel, Price of breakfast, Hotel booked based on location which met all our needs Did not have breakfast as felt the price was expensive and not included in the room price Even though was a hot day and evening the room was comfortable to sleep in 
47500,Saint Georges Hotel, The rooms were dirty and the bed uncomfortable So much so I attempted sleeping on the floor in the middle of the night Exposed wires in the bathroom as well as water dripping down a light in the bath room I wouldn t recommend anyone to stay here , The location was good
47501,Saint Georges Hotel, It s a bit shabby but really this didn t matter The location couldn t have been better , The location is excellent Beds were really comfortable and the room a good size Rooms in London tend to be tiny and claustrophobic this wasn t It was clean and functional Given the location it was good value 
47502,Saint Georges Hotel, Room was small air conditioning was not very effective , The hotel was centrally located Hot water system was not working but it was promptly fixed Staff friendly and ready to assist ie hot water 
47503,Saint Georges Hotel, The restaurant is very tired and needs a makeover It could be so much better with it s views and situation and better food , Room reasonable restaurant bizarre 
47504,Saint Georges Hotel, The cleanliness is is below average You can not let it bother you if you are not spending much time in the hotel The bed feels old and one side was sunken in and the room feels very dusty The toilet seems newly renovated but the shower system is not user friendly Most of the facilities in the room were worn out and very very in need of replacement , The location is really the best Just 2 minutes walk to all the shopping in Oxford circus Staff were nice and helpful and generally no big issues with the hotel Price was really awesome for the location in summer 
47505,Saint Georges Hotel, Some minor refurb needed e g doors scuffed window sill in 1202 needs attention A towel rail in the bathroom would be helpful These things wouldn t stop me staying there again , Clean comfortable friendly helpful staff wonderful welcome excellent location 15th floor bar restaurant comfortable good size bed plenty of room
47506,Saint Georges Hotel, Rooms are not well maintained carpets are not clean Look more like 3 stars hotel not 4, Excellent location 5 minutes to underground station Oxford Street Clean spacy room with comfortable bed 
47507,Saint Georges Hotel, Doors in corridor looked shabby WiFi slow The heights shut too early on a Saturday night closed we returned from show hello, Location view space around the bed and comfortable room
47508,Saint Georges Hotel, Incompetent staff at reception kettle in room didn t work Bar does not stay open in the evening for residents so be sure if you go to a late show don t expect a drink at the hotel afterwards Breakfast was average nothing special The hotel is exceptionally overpriced as is the continental breakfast delusions of grandeur and not worth the excessive prices charged there are better in the area for less money , NOT A GREAT DEAL The only good point is the location 
47509,Saint Georges Hotel, The furniture looks like from James Bond s movies from 80 s Feels of a location somewhere in eastern Europe during socialism era so anyone liking retro style might actually enjoy it Wi Fi was not working or was terribly slow but perhaps my room was far away from the router Fridge was not working either room cleanliness was questionable but there is not so much one can do when furniture and carpets have best years behind , Hotel location is perfect Big plus to staff s attitude 
47510,Saint Georges Hotel, The air condition could be more strong as is was pretty warm in the room , The location is perfect for discovering London and shopping The view from the windows is great The building is multi stored and elevator is available The bathroom is large and comfortable The room could be considered to be a little bigger than usually in London hotels The beds are comfortable 
47511,Saint Georges Hotel, The light switches were very confusing The minibar wasn t cold At times the water temperature of the shower was a little inconsistent but the vast majority of the time it was totally fine Room 1203 , The bed was big and comfy the air con was blissfully good while outside temperatures were around 30 C outside and they kindly gave me a room close to a lift so I wouldn t have to walk far from the lobby that was for disability reasons and it was enormously helpful Gorgeous views from the room 
47512,Saint Georges Hotel, Living off its past reputation Very very tired bedroom with dated and scuffed furniture Bathroom had old cigarette burn marks and the towel rail disintegrated due to shoddy repair Extraordinarily in this hotel if you don t put the Please service room sign on the door it wont be done as we discovered when we returned late in the evening to an non serviced room Very much overpriced for essentially a bed and no breakfast , The location was excellent for our purposes
47513,Saint Georges Hotel, The property itself looks a bit tired incide, location was perfect for us as we planned our time as a mixture of business and leisure with some shopping Very close to the oxford circus and public transportation with lots of restaurant nearby 
47514,Saint Georges Hotel, Cleaning was good but one day our room was not made up at all By the time we noticed there was no cleaning staff there , Location was great Rooms fairly large for a London hotel 
47515,Saint Georges Hotel,No Negative, I liked the bar and view I think you may want to redevelop the bar area Focus on the view and cocktails WIN WIN I got the impression it is a bit of a hidden gem You may want to get more info out to non guests 
47516,Saint Georges Hotel, Even when we set the Do not disturb sign on the door and told the staff not to service the room they still came in twice that day The second time we were there taking a nap The wifi was terrible and i mean completely useless i just ended up using my mobile data connection for everything There were no power outlets near the bed maybe this is not important for everyone but i work with my phone and having it all the way across the room while in bed was annoying , The location was great and the view from my room was pretty good also 
47517,Saint Georges Hotel, The free WiFi internet connection suffers with bad response time I needed to use my 4G roaming to access the internet from the room Maybe the management of the hotel should also supply each room with some socket adapters from EU to UK format because I had to buy my own adapters to charge my mobile phone , Quite good value for money hotel around this area Perfect position in the center of London and very close to Soho Visiting everything by foot The staff was very kind and willing to help I don t know about the food or breakfast because I didn t order but it seems to be good from what I saw The room was old but it was comfortable and seems to be clean They change towels and bathroom soaps everyday The room has nice view No problem with noise No problem with the beds 
47518,Saint Georges Hotel, Very expensive for what really was quite basic accommodation Double bed was in fact two singles joined together with an uncomfortable join in the middle I arrived at 10 15pm after a long journey and no food available I expected more for 200 a night , Central location was convenient and staff friendly 
47519,Saint Georges Hotel, Can t think of anything , Fantastic value for a Central London Hotel The staff are always friendly and helpful When I visit London I always use the St George s Hotel 
47520,Saint Georges Hotel, Their service is pretty terrible We initially got a room where the air conditioning and some lights weren t working so we were moved to another room however we were later told that the following day we need to move again to another room because someone else had already booked this room I looked at 4 different rooms and none of them were up to mark basic things like light and air conditioning not working and the manager basically said too bad you have to pick one we have nothing else I would understand if I was being unnecessarily fussy but I would expect working lights the rooms are already quite dark and basic air conditioning , Location is amazing and the rooms are quite spacious for London standards
47521,Saint Georges Hotel, Hotel needs updating especially one rooms looks tired needs redecorating, Staff helpful friendly Location was excellent for access to Oxford street for the shops
47522,Saint Georges Hotel, No WiFi Bed uncofortable Woken at 05 00 as my room was below the top floor kitchen For the price the low level of standard in both the room and bathroom, Location
47523,Saint Georges Hotel, The Hotel is pretty old and needs some renovation in the rooms also there is practically no closet to put your cloth WiFi is very poor and almost not avaialable , The location was superb within a short walking distance to SoHo with all the bars clubs and nightlife Also all the major shopping brands and shops within a short walk 
47524,Saint Georges Hotel,No Negative, Up on the 12th floor Huge Windows allowed us full view of the London skyline Light morning sunshine Very helpful staff Pizza Express just next door if as I do you adore their chicken salad 
47525,Saint Georges Hotel, St George s fulfilled our needs, We arrived quite a bit early but had been up and travelling since 4qm the receptionist found us a room and we were napping at noon That perked us up greatly Invited a friend for cocktails in the rooftop bar which was great
47526,Saint Georges Hotel, The tea and coffee was very sparse and no where near enough milk for 2 people when we asked for more it took 45 minutes to bring us 4 tiny milk portions and 2 coffee sachets It was 17 for a cooked breakfast so we ate in a cafe just down the road for less than half of the price , The location was good for shopping the room was adequate 
47527,Saint Georges Hotel, The lights in the rooms are too dim the bath smelled of sewage I was given another room The decor is very shabby and ugly Permanent stains on the carpet shower sprayed all over flooding the floor moth , mini fridge and coffee and tea the times delivered to room very nice staff location great
47528,Saint Georges Hotel, The Hotel was generally run down The ladies toilette in the top Floor Restaurant didn t work at all The owners of the Hotel want to renovate the whole Hotel and develop it into a smart Boutique Hotel I Hope very soon ,No Positive
47529,Saint Georges Hotel, The hotel is poor in every aspect The last redecoration overhaul is over 25 years ago WiFi has the poorest performance imaginable Worst croissants in my life, The hotel is on a prime location 
47530,Saint Georges Hotel, Rooms looked a bit tired corridors tired Bathrooms i think should be modernised Myself and my colleague could have been put in rooms next to each other Value for money probably for london Not for me though But nothing really stands out that you cant get in a premier inn or travelodge , It was well placed for location Staff good and attentive especially at the bar where staff were very freindly and helpful Reception very helpful 
47531,Saint Georges Hotel, The bed was too small wifi barely worked at all the shower leaked all over the floor no matter what we tried the towels stunk of petrochemicals and the carpets and windows need a good clean , The location of the hotel was good close to public transport but away from the busy streets 
47532,Saint Georges Hotel, Great location the are around the location was clean Great shopping and food near by , Great price and great location The hotel was clean and the staff were friendly 
47533,Saint Georges Hotel, Very tired decor paper peeling off the wall lumps out of the plaster and skirting boards The carpet when was it last hoovered Biscuit crumbs all over the floor and other debris Situated next to the service lift and housekeeping so we were disturbed both mornings The shower only a quarter of the jets worked fortuitous under the circumstance as it flooded significantly over the bathroom floor Reception was efficient but no welcome no smile no offer of assistance , Bed was comfy fab view filter coffee and mineral water welcome 
47534,Saint Georges Hotel, The wi fi was very slow The hotel was run down and needed refurbishment but it was very old building, It was quiet and very close to the shops and fabulous views from top terrance
47535,Saint Georges Hotel, this is pretty much a place where you would bring a lady of the night The fact that the first guest I saw walking in here was such a lady was just a hilarious coincidence The room was clean but looked a bit beaten up serious cosmetic damages Stained shower curtain lamps used bathrobe in the closet cracked walls door just added to the ambiance Thankfully I had no neighbors actively using the squeaky bed , location and relatively cheap
47536,Saint Georges Hotel, The hotel is in major need of renovation the place is very old The room and bathroom were not clean at all The bed mattress was not comfortable but I had arrived in the morning and was too tired at night to care I was glad I was only there for one night The reason I stayed at that hotel was because it was next to my friend s flat which is where I spent the remainder of my stay in London , Location
47537,Saint Georges Hotel, Room and hotel was worn and dated Staff took a long time to find a room for me on my arrival even though I had pre warned my flight was arriving late after 10PM Staff member was cheerful about it but it should have been quicker , The hotel is close to Oxford street and the city view was a pleasant surprise 
47538,Saint Georges Hotel, The sound proofing of the windows isn t up to modern hotel standards In the middle of the city that means noise until late at night The Wifi was pretty slow , The location could hardly be any better With just a 2 minute walk to Oxford Circus you can get anywhere by bus or by subway One of the world s best bars the Artisian is right across the street the BBC broadcasting house is just around the corner and there are a lot of restaurants and shops nearby Just the few meters to Oxford Circus alone leave you with a choice of 5 restaurants and at least 5 shops Once you reach Oxford Street you can go on a real shopping spree You even have museums like the British Museum in close walking distance The staff was nice and welcoming There is no hustle with getting in late if you are out for longer The room was big enough and the bathroom was clean 
47539,Saint Georges Hotel, the room was hot because of the sun they could have closed the curtains or turned on the air conditioning It smelled of cigarettes and the carpet was filthy we asked for another room and they proposed a room at the back with a small double bed instead of the twin room we had booked so we refused the lever of the bath and shower mixer was missing so we had to pull on the bolt in the common sitting room the upholstery of the sofas was torn and worn out the carpet was being held together with tape this is not a 4 star hotel Booking com has mislead us seriously , apart from the location there is nothing to like about the hotel
47540,Saint Georges Hotel, I have stayed here a few times and the decoration is definitely needing to be looked at but if you are hardly in your room that doesn t really matter , Location good for walking but also close o underground Quick and efficient check in out Hotel bar restaurant has brilliant views over London with windows all around 
47541,Saint Georges Hotel, The ladies toilette was out of order Our Quick English breakfasts took about 20 minutes to arrive Limited selection of beers in the bar , The location is very good and the staff helpful 
47542,Saint Georges Hotel, Would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking to have a relaxing stay in London Rude staff that will open your room s door without notice or apology The rooms are not well maintained Our room had a horrible rancid smell with that issue the hotel moved us to three different rooms which were smaller than the one we booked and paid for Very disappointing ,No Positive
47543,Saint Georges Hotel, Room was needing a complete over haul and update Room was very noisy due to heating or lift Over priced for what it was Bar needs complete refurbishment and does not entice people to eat in it ,No Positive
47544,Saint Georges Hotel, Rather tired interior difficult to get really clean I guess Slow WiFi unless you pay extra , Excellent location Very nice and helpful staff 
47545,Saint Georges Hotel, This is an old hotel so it felt and it looked like one had the feeling of the 60 s and it gives the impression that even the furniture and carpets are from the same period The bathroom could do with an upgrade especially the shower and the flush , The hotel is very conveniently located and there are lots of things to do and see all within walking distance The room was cosy and comfortable and the reception staff was very helpful and friendly 
47546,Saint Georges Hotel, Room very dimly lit two light bulbs were out and in one case the concierge did not have a replacement at all and in the other case he had a replacement that didn t fit the lamp shade Promised to sort it out during the following day but nothing was done , Proper coffee and cafetiere in the room comfortable sofa table to work at Good view over London and extremely quiet as the rooms start on the 10th floor spacious bathroom 
47547,Saint Georges Hotel, The 1st receptionist we met was not the friendliest person I have ever met The other 2 were better The room was old The furniture had wear The bathroom curtain had stains The bathroom door had wear The bathroom sink was getting full of water very quick when the water was running , Excellent location Great view from 10th floor Many appliances available flip flops hairdresser soap shampoo etc 
47548,Saint Georges Hotel, The room is beginning to look a bit tired but is still good value for central London , The hotel is central and in easy reach of all parts of central London right beside the BBC Transport is good and there are plenty of places to eat nearby Iberica in Gt Portland St is especially good The room was clean and the bed comfortable We were on the 12th floor so had great views over London The bar restaurant on the 15th floor looks good too although it was nearly empty on the evening we were there and we only had a drink so can t comment on the food Staff were friendly and helpful 
47549,Saint Georges Hotel, Service is extremely poor barely any staff at the reception The hotel is very old and will need a renovation soon Overall super expensive for what it really is a part from its location nothing satisfied me , Location is perfect
47550,Saint Georges Hotel, No hot water in the shower Shower tray did not drain and filled up completely and almost overflow Pipe into shower head not fitted correctly and water leaking from the connection on the showerhead They moved me into another room Aircon did not work Water preasure of the shower is low Bathrooms are dated but clean , Location is good and some good views from the 12th floor Staff at reception very friendly Linen is good Soft carpets Shower products are good quality 
47551,Saint Georges Hotel, Facilities are very poor compared to our previous stay some 18months ago No dining facility only bar snacks available unless you have room service and every service is closed at around 10pm, Cleanliness of room and comfortable
47552,Saint Georges Hotel, Have stayed many times with work staff need serious training Probably not their fault that theyre a bit useless general politeness and attitudes need adjusting also Cleaning staff very good though , Location Risotto is great Nothing else is worth the money 
47553,Saint Georges Hotel, Needs a complete re furbishment looking very tired Please get rid of the wrap around shower curtain Bathroom needs an extraction system for the steam condensation , Excellent location 
47554,Saint Georges Hotel, The floor in bathroom was damaged so I cut myself hope it get fixed soon , Staff is helpful they let you late check in and out on request View is nice you are pretty high located in building 
47555,Saint Georges Hotel, I was placed in a room directly opposite the lift the constant bustle of people outside my room was very distracting and noisey and as a result I had a very bad night s sleep I would have appreciated being placed anywhere but outside the lift , Being provided with free mineral water biscuits etc Nice touch 
47556,Saint Georges Hotel, Bed sheets were dirty Weak wifi not sure if it is due to the fact that it was a corner room Rooms were quite poorly lit at night insufficient lightings , Comfy bed and fresh towels New soaps shower gels were replenished every day Superb effort 
47557,Saint Georges Hotel, The bathroom ended up with a bad smell a bit like wee after I d had a shower Same thing happened the next day when my friend had a shower There was also a bit of dust around the TV There were only two pillows each and they weren t very thick but there were no others available Also check out was meant to be 12 00 but people came to clean the room at 11 15 Luckily we were just about to leave the room when they came round I had also assumed that the money would be taken from my card automatically when we checked in but had to use my card when we got there This caused problems as I hadn t got the card I booked with that had the money on Fortunately I was able to get it sorted , The view was amazing and it was a 25 minute walk from Euston station The staff seemed quite friendly and helpful in the couple of times I talked to them There was a hairdryer and toiletries and it was a decent size room We ended up being earlier than expected but were able to check in at 1 30 
47558,Saint Georges Hotel, One pillow case wasn t the cleanest but as I took it off they changed it for a new one the next day Something small and was easily fixed , Tony the Concierge was extremely helpful as we had taxi issues on our return trip to the airport Tony did everything he could to help us get back in time to the airport You cant get more central than there Beds are comfy and recommend a room on the hotel entrance side Rooms are from the 9th floor up so you definitely avoid possible noise Also eventhough its just right off Oxford Circus there is no noise Would go there again for sure 
47559,Saint Georges Hotel, The rooms have been beautifully refurbished however the corridor leading to the room hasn t it looked a little tired , Room was fabulous Service was excellent
47560,Saint Georges Hotel, I always worry when I don t book directly with the hotel and this was one of those times For the price paid the decor was terrible The room had a carpet you did not want to even think about removing your shoes to walk on The shower did not work You either had boiling hot water or freezing cold I was not impressed When I was moved to another room I pulled back the bed cover and the quilt had a huge stain on it Nope not doing that one again Please Just because I am a single traveller does not mean I will put up with sub standard hotel rooms I think it s just plain rude ,No Positive
47561,Saint Georges Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location near to Oxford and Regent street walking distance to Piccadilly and central London attractions Good value for money I slept at St Georges for the sixt time and I was always satisfied 
47562,Saint Georges Hotel, WiFi non existent so couldn t work air conditioning only so heating through separate heaters not sufficient so very cold and boiler faulty so no hot water in the morning 15 discount not good enough so waiting on reply from GM Upon checkout others also complaining about same issues , Room size
47563,Saint Georges Hotel, I don t think I have ever written a negative review m until now We stayed on the 14th floor so was woken up every morning between 0630 0700 by what sounded like tables being dragged around the floor upstairs from the bar This is the last thing you want when you are on a break away , Nice location Nice view 
47564,Saint Georges Hotel, The hotel is a bit dated that didn t stop us from enjoying it Central heating was not as good as could be expected however the room more than made up for that with space heaters in the room , Could not have picked a better location for the price The view alone was worth the money we spent consider that we were on the 14th floor and our room overlooked London from the West to the Southwest we could see London Eye Westminster Abbey Tower of London full view of the Shard partial view of the Gherkin and could look down and see Oxford street shopping shopping shopping Awesome location decent price for a downtown hotel 
47565,Saint Georges Hotel, Tired dated scruffy the lock on the door was stuck together with electrical tape there was intermittent hot water and questionable hygiene on the cushions laid on pillows etc General appearance of the hotel is awful , Location
47566,Saint Georges Hotel, There was a sign about complementary water in the room but without water The toilet seat was detached The shower head worked poorly water going side ways The room was rather dark and some of the light bulb did not work The breakfast was poor and cost 16 pounds you can get better one just nearby outside half the price In overall not expensive room but bad value for money , The location was nice to too far from Oxford street The price was not expensive 
47567,Saint Georges Hotel, There was no hot water on the Sunday morning so my partner and I had to have COLD and I mean cold shower The room could do with a tart up mould on the window frame But location ideal for what we needed,No Positive
47568,Saint Georges Hotel, Breakfast was awful for 16 75 was not impressed at all Will never eat there again My breakfast was overcooked when I send it back it came back cold not impressed at all , just the view and location
47569,Saint Georges Hotel, Wifi terrible hot water in shower sporadic Very tired and in much need of renovation But cheap so a trade off , Very handy to everything Staff extremely helpful 
47570,Saint Georges Hotel, Accommodation very dated terrible hairdryer which didn t work properly then stopped completely The corridor smelled really badly , Beautiful views excellent location 
47571,Saint Georges Hotel,No Negative, Really great location and great value for money We will definitely stay there again Staff was very helpful they gave us keys short while before check in and after check out they stored our luggages
47572,Saint Georges Hotel,No Negative, Nothing much The room needed a total revamp Mould on the windows Wallpaper starting to peel Heating in room and bathroom not working Really disappointed 
47573,Saint Georges Hotel, 1 the shower could have more force water trickled out of the shower head 2 Rooms need maintenance toilet door was scrapping the floor and tiles on the bathroom floor loose 3 Mattress could do with a new one in room 1110 Never saw any staff around ,No Positive
47574,Saint Georges Hotel, The shower was broken the air condition was not working They bring a heather for me The room and bathroom was a bit dirty There was something in sink , The location is great Stuff are so kind and lovely 
47575,Saint Georges Hotel, Heating didn t work just offered portable heater that was old and smelled No apology Restaurant staff were mixed one was quite rude acted like I was interrupting her when I asked if I could order some food no manners Cold bathroom as heater didn t work in there , Location was excellent View from room was great Bed comfortable Good shower 
47576,Saint Georges Hotel, Everything else The room was dingy The wifi was beyond horrible worst than dial up we re in 2017 No internet should be that SLOW , Not a whole lot The experience was horrible Worst hotel stay in my life The only okay thing was the bathroom It was a bit updated but still very tiny 
47577,Saint Georges Hotel, The gloomy lighting I was working so 1 bright task lamp would help The feather pillows should have been thrown away if they can t support themselves they can t support your head , Brilliant value for the location comfy bed helpful responsive staff
47578,Saint Georges Hotel, The whole experience no heating avaliable hot water was slow waited 9 minutes for the water Before running a bath bathroom freezing due to no air con heating just basically sub standard and not what is expected for the cost , The TV
47579,Saint Georges Hotel, The shower didn t regulate temperature so went from hot to cold throughout , Great location quiet with a comfy bed larger room than expected Good towels and complimentary mineral water was a nice addition 
47580,Saint Georges Hotel, Heating unit not working Couldn t find switch for light above desk Concierge very helpful found switch on light which I couldn t reach except by standing on chair and then one of the bulbs wasn t working and brought an oil filled radiator He did everything he could However the hotel seems to be assuming that because of its location it can get away with inadequate maintenance , Excellent location Offer price January good Not worth regular price 
47581,Saint Georges Hotel, A pair of dirty socks were found under the desk unit in our room when we checked in and 2 lights did not work nor did the heated towel rail Someone needs to check the cleaners Bathroom had mold on ceiling and room generally needed refreshing as lots of scrapes on doors and tatty paint , Toiletries supplied mini fridge and complimentary water view from breakfast room and good value breakfast with helpful friendly staff 
47582,Saint Georges Hotel, Reception staff when we first arrived very unwelcoming made to feel that we were being a burden booking in Other staff encountered after this woman were friendly and accommodating Hotel is very tired looking and is in need of a refurbishment , The views from bedroom and bar area 
47583,Saint Georges Hotel, Room was comfortable and clean and had good facilities but probably time for decorating and refit of bathroom and window double glazing , Very comfortable beds good food in the bar and at breakfast and very pleasant for drinks in the evening Excellent location for theatre and shopping 
47584,Saint Georges Hotel,No Negative, Central location hotel comprises upper floors only of building so all have good views with big picture windows room spotless in room facilities very good with generous inclusive tea and coffee supplies and soft drinks very good value for money given location and standard excellent top floor restaurant and bar 
47585,Saint Georges Hotel, Bar prices extortionate Wanted to eat at the hotel restaurant but could not work out if it was open or not Bar staff seemed very grumpy and seemed they really didn t want to be there , Location is excellent Rooms were a little small but adequate Check in staff friendly 
47586,Saint Georges Hotel, Larger beds They were a very small Double beds which was stretching the truth a bit as there was barely enough room for two people sharing Every thing else was fine ,No Positive
47587,Saint Georges Hotel, Reception was a bit abrupt when I checked in and advised if I wanted breakfast included in the rate I should have booked direct and not through booking com Room cold and room controls seemed to make no difference Aircon system quite noisy in room even though switched off in my room , Iron and board in room free water lovely breakfast on top floor with express cooked option
47588,Saint Georges Hotel, No heating and hot water in the rooms 17 breakfast Very dated rooms Some staff members rude and liars , Some of the staff were friendly no other positives
47589,Saint Georges Hotel, The hotel is in a great location and because of the location is good value However the hotel really needs renovation I was woken up at 1am by water pouring through my ceiling from upstairs I was moved to a room where the heating didn t work and the taps on the bath didn t turn on I was given a 15 discount because of this but this didn t particularly warm me up Some of the staff are friendly but I found that most lacked the basic manners and courtesy required in the hospitality industry Plus the relentless banging on doors in the morning even with a do not disturb sign hanging to clean the room and provide maintenance did not result in a restful lie in ,No Positive
47590,Saint Georges Hotel, The interior was a bit shabby and the lighting in the room was way too low perhaps to hide the shabby bits The toilet handle went right round although it did work and the toilet roll holder was not fixed to the wall properly and moved One of the bed side lights was broken and didn t work There was a large patch in the corner of the ceiling which was a different colour to the rest of the ceiling The doors to the rooms from the corridor were scuffed and scratched Apart from the lighting all superficial things that could be fixed quite easily , The location was excellent 
47591,Saint Georges Hotel, The rooms were dirty and we found blood spots in the upper bed sheets, Only the location and the young guy in the reception was very handy and helpful comparing to other hotels in london
47592,Saint Georges Hotel, the room was terrible old not renovated in fact the whole hotel needs a huge renovation price quality not ok , the view was very nice staff is friendly location is great 
47593,Saint Georges Hotel, The rooms need updating and minor repairs chips in wall old bedspreads and there wasn t a closet door only a thin curtain , The location is great close to major subway tube lines and shopping streets but relatively quiet It definitely isn t fancy but felt clean and safe Overall it was fair for the price And I had a great view looking at the steeple with the London Eye in the distance which is beautiful at night 
47594,Saint Georges Hotel, The hotel is very shabby could do with a makeover Carpets in the lounge very dated had shrunk over time and seams were taped with black masking tape The view from the dining room bar was terrific but no atmosphere there due to dated and tired decor , It was located near where we needed to be which was great Apart from that the stay was OK We didn t have breakfast as the shabby dining room put us off no care for decor we felt there would be no care for food preparation either Had a coffee and sandwich at the Starbucks down the road which kept us in good stead for the morning 
47595,Saint Georges Hotel, The waiters at the bar were not there to make us feel comfortable they were not rude simply completely uninterested and plain no welcome no warmth The meat in my hamburger was of really poor quality , We liked the location and the view from the bar restaurant 
47596,Saint Georges Hotel, needs some updating , wonderful location rooms comfortable I understand they will all be updated in the near future Staff very obliging and friendly Restaurant convenient with wonderful views 
47597,Saint Georges Hotel, Very tired d cor and the net curtains were grubby Only a small thing but this hotel just needs a little TLC , Location is the best and the staff very nice
47598,Saint Georges Hotel, the linen was a bit old fashioned and outdated It was clean but just not what you would expect for the price and location , The location was very good and the view was beautiful

47609,Saint Georges Hotel, the internet connection was terrible Their answer was the hotel is very crowded and that s why the connection ls not available I paid a high cost for this hotel and I believe they must arrange a good internet connetion even if the hotel is very crowded Also there was a problem in the toilet , location
47610,Saint Georges Hotel, Wifi was desperately poor On the 14th floor there was a lot of noise from 05 00 which woke me up and kept me awake Also the walls must be thin as I could hear everything going on with my neighbour , Fantastic location I didn t try any of the food nor go to the restaurant so can t comment on that Paid extra for a superior room and had an amazing view of London

47623,Saint Georges Hotel, The hotel was a bit old and not all rooms are refurbished But considering the location we will certainly stay there again , The location was very good The room we got first was a bit noisy from the street as it only had double glazed windows Thanks to the very friendly manager Mrs Alisha we could change to another room which was refurbished very quiet and had a great view We also liked to have drinks in the bar restaurant at the top An extra plus was the choice of various breakfast types such as the express breakfast 
47624,Saint Georges Hotel, I left my room at approximately 8 30am for breakfast only to return one hour later to find my room already made up and all my personal belongings removed I travel regularly all over the world and my understanding is that rooms where not entered and made up until you have checked out I did not receive an acceptable reason why this had happened ,No Positive

47632,Saint Georges Hotel, bathroom had old taps cannot mix hot and cold water shower not very very good, situation very central near Oxford Circus nice restaurant on the top floor
47633,Saint Georges Hotel, My bathroom had had one or two tiles removed at some point just under the sink probably to do a repair and they were stuck back on very roughly with white silicone This looked a little sloppy and cheapened the overlook look of the bathroom It was an observation but it certainly didn t spoil my stay , The standard double room I was in was not necessarily large but had what I needed and was very clean iron hairdryer tea coffee facilities safe mini shower gel shampoo sets Stayed just the one night so didn t really use any of the other hotel facilities or breakfast We did have a drink in the bar and the staff were very pleasant as were reception Very handy location not far from Oxford Street

47637,Saint Georges Hotel, Bar has a lovely view but not very good food , The room was good with a comfortable bed hair dryer safe fridge ironing board kettle and tea and coffee The receptionist was outstanding He thought we had overpaid by 50 and gave us the note back We were surprised as had counted carefully In the event it turned out that he was wrong and we gave the note back again with many thanks for his kind thoughtfulness even if it had turned out to be wrong 
47638,Saint Georges Hotel, Bed very unconfortable with the box springs really sticking out and not guaranteeing a good night of sleep Bedroom was a litlle worn out the alternative options for breakfast were cheaper but far from being good , People were very friendly at the reception Location was very close to the main atractions Good size lift 
47639,Saint Georges Hotel, The hotel could do with some investment great bar on the top floor with spectacular views but needs to be decorated An opportunity missed , Great location and views from the room easy access to some of the main visiting places in London 
47640,Saint Georges Hotel, Very ugly building from the 1960 70s probably the ugliest in the whole area I am pretty sure that many parts of the building haven t been renovated since The hotel needs massive modernisation refurbishing The 15th floor restaurant was so sad I left it immediately Beautiful views at least It took literally 15 minutes for the water to get warm in the shower what a waste of water resources Taking a quick shower is not possible at this hotel Where does the hot water come from The middle of the earth Even then the temperature was not constant I was given a first room with very poor wifi reception I got moved to a second room which was next door to a lift shaft and it was pretty noisy London is expensive for hotels But honestly who gives stars to hotels in UK 4 stars for this place Cmon, Honestly the only good thing about this hotel is the location 
47641,Saint Georges Hotel, The exterior of the building is a bit shabby the interior common area decoration is a bit tired reception lifts hallways , The location is unbeatable and once you got to the room they were very nicely done 
47642,Saint Georges Hotel, All the doors in the hotel are scratched and scraped it needs attention by the owners and painting it looks very old , The hotel was great and very close to Oxford Street 
47643,Saint Georges Hotel, Bathroom was tired could do with updating even though everything worked well Sockets were a bit dodgey it was difficult to get plugs in them and there weren t enough for me 3 in total without turning the tv or fridge off , Staff that go the extra mile helping me find my lost train tickets Location next to shops tube station park and iconic BBC studios Hairdryer iron in the room Spacious room with a great view Free toiletries wifi Complimentary water as a nice touch and a fridge to cool it in 
47644,Saint Georges Hotel, The hotel is looking tired especially the passageways The shower room fiitments were coming off the wall could take 3 4 minutes to get hot water the glazing of the windows was in need of repair howling wind kept us awake , Manageg to park on site
47645,Saint Georges Hotel, The evening bar and restaurant staff did very little to promote the facility Polite yes but lacking any real interest in the customer Disappointing and maybe the occasional smile might have helped Also the hotel in general looks a little tired , Reception staff arriving and departing very helpful and location very central for the purpose of my visit 
47646,Saint Georges Hotel, Hotel policy would not allow my company to pay for the room by card over the phone even though I had been advised that this would be possible when I checked in As a consequence I had to personally pay for myself and my colleague s business trip , Wonderful view from bedroom window up on the 11th floor 
47647,Saint Georges Hotel, I was staying in the Langham London on the opposite side of the street for 3 nights on business I decided to move hotels for 1 night due to cost but did not expect such a drop in standards given the location of the hotel The general condition of the hotel was very tired and worn The staff were at best ok but certainly not well trained given that they are in a service industry , The location was terrific 
47648,Saint Georges Hotel, Because I book the rooms for my staff I need to pay for the rooms in advance The hotel is unable to take payments over the phone which is inconvenient , I put my staff here when we have meetings or work going on in Oxford Street or Great Portland Street This hotel is just a short walk from these locations 
47649,Saint Georges Hotel, Poor standard for price clean but very shabby single beds rather than double leaking air conditioning unit which left a large wet puddle on carpet and dripped constantly and when I complained about it they said someone would look at it and nobody did which I thought was really bad wasn t happy about how much I had to pay due to that, Location
47650,Saint Georges Hotel, Hotel wasn t very clean staff weren t very helpful and the food was atrocious For price you are paying to stay at this hotel really only covers the excellent location , Location was very good right in the heart of the busy central London a 2 min walk to Oxford Street and also the train station 
47651,Saint Georges Hotel, There is no privacy at all the cleaners keeps entering the room while i was sleeping making conversations with me while am in my bed The receptionist keeps calling very early in the morning for selly reasons The place is not clean ive been to london more than 40 times This hotel is the worst hotel ive ever been to i would definitely recommend it for some that i hate to mess with his vacation, Location

47654,Saint Georges Hotel, When I checked in at 6 30pm and was given the key I discovered that my room had not been made up Yes as other reviews say this hotel is in need of some refurbishment but the location a stones throw from Oxford Street is worth it , Once the room was made and the hotel staff were apologetic it was fine Tea coffee facilities were good they give you real coffee with a cafeti re Great bar restaurant area on the 15th floor with fantastic views of London 
47655,Saint Georges Hotel, The bed was a standard double kingsize would have fitted in the room The room was clean and well fitted out but needed a new carpet The corridors and stairs need redecoration, Room included good toiletries robes minibar coffee maker comfy settee good views We got a good deal for the reduced price we paid
47656,Saint Georges Hotel, When I came I want to pay and since I had euro instead to change me on the rate of the hotel they give me a card and send me on purpose to The Worst exchange on Oxford street and for 960 I received 565pounds instead of 823 257 Less After one week of conversation with all staff one of the manager mr Tony was kind enough to recalculate to The hotel rate and refound me 132 half of my lost wach out And if you see 2 receipts s cause the hotel was 502 and after first exchange the amount was not enough to pay The hotel , Location

47660,Saint Georges Hotel, The rooms are not cleaned very well The hotel and rooms are very tired The whole building needs a refurb and for the amount of money you pay I expect a lot more Wouldn t stay there again, There isn t much to say about this hotel apart from the location which is less than 5mins walk to Oxford Circus station
47661,Saint Georges Hotel, Bed was small double Cleaning staff were very noisy very early, Despite a lot of the reviews the room on the 12th floor was comfortable light and had tea coffee making facilities water toiletries and robes The view was fabulous Great value for money

47667,Saint Georges Hotel, As others have mentioned the decor is a bit old and the rooms need some TLC but we didn t spend much time in the room so it didn t really matter , Great location at the top of Regent St walking distance to a lot of things Spacious and comfortable room bright with big windows that open 
47668,Saint Georges Hotel, We were told breakfast was on special half price offer but the staff in restaurant did not know about it but when we questioned the bill they did change it to the price we had been quoted but a bit embarrassing , Great view So close to Oxford Circus

47672,Saint Georges Hotel, Hotel was very shabby in both decor and furniture Our room was a deluxe double really Settee especially in our room extremely worn Bath was discoloured in places The hotel needs a complete refurb worn carpets with strips of duct tape and scuffed furniture in lounge We are used to 4 hotels and did not consider this was of that standard We had a sense of a tired and neglected business with staff doing their best , Views from room and particularly 15th floor lounge 
47673,Saint Georges Hotel, My room was a bit disappointing for a superior room a bit tired in terms of quality of furnishings certainly not luxury as I had hoped , Staff were extremely friendly and accommodating 
47674,Saint Georges Hotel, Toilet does not flush properly no hangers in the room asked for eight but only got 4 not enough glasses in the room key card had to be replaced or activated everyday reception can greet coming and going and ask if there is anything we need , It was clean in the bathroom and in the room the size of the room friendlystaff but not exactly in reseption no one said have a good day or noticed when we came in 
47675,Saint Georges Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was more than we expected perfect location for the queens theatre just a hope on the tube away and central to shops bars and restaurants It rained on the way to the theatre the gentleman behind the desk gave me an umbrella and was really helpful The room was a lot bigger than I expected can t wait to book again and go back Me and my boyfriend found it overall a great hotel for central London

47678,Saint Georges Hotel, It is a little bit an old hotel it is not the type of hotel to enjoy its facilities but the location is more than perfect, The location is perfect it is between regent oxford street if you want to enjoy London and to be in the middle of attractions this hotel is your choice
47679,Saint Georges Hotel, Staff were not really friendly and interacted as little as possible Certainly officious but without warmth Hallways were dated dark and dingy Bed was rock hard but pillows were comfortable Shower was not able to be regulated so it went from hot to cold back to hot 4 5 times a minute If it wasn t for the location I doubt that I would stay there , Location was handy for work Rooms were modern and nicely appointed Pillows were comfortable If it wasn t for the location I doubt that I would stay there

47682,Saint Georges Hotel, Very poor starter at evening meal deal Hardly worth eating for amount and taste Main course had run out at 7pm of main vegetable spring onion mash so as I didn t want chips I was given mash alone without any seasoning Not good especially for a 4star hotel in that location I would stay again but not eat there ,No Positive

47710,Saint Georges Hotel, the room was dirty rubbish on the floor and hair everywhere There was stains in the shower that looked like blood and the drain was blocked so the tub would fill while you shower The room was also right next door to the elevator that was running all night and was incredibly loud , location is great that s about all
47711,Saint Georges Hotel, The bed needed to be replaced old and worn but the rest of the room was great , Location location location the view was pretty awesome too Large and comfortable room by London standards Great area for walking shopping and dining safe and accessible to the tube I would definitely stay here again 
47712,Saint Georges Hotel, widow sill definitely needed a wipe some construction works outside the hotel although there were no works carried out over the weekend , Great Location comfortable beds and friendly staff 
47713,Saint Georges Hotel, Our room was beneath the kitchen and so noisy we only had 4hours slee Having been looking forward to a night without my young children I was very disappointed,No Positive
47714,Saint Georges Hotel, I had to ask to change rooms on 3 occasions Due to construction and poor cleanliness of room one smelled of raw Sewage and staff thought it was acceptable to spray items on the floor and leave me a spray to keep the smell low The construction work was horrendous and couldn t sleep in morning after long nights of business meetings Rooms didn t look like web page and when asked staff if they had one like the web page they laughed in my face Also tried to put an unexpected 3 70 On my bill for something never used Will not recommend until some sort of apology or rebate is discussed in person Regards Mr H Goudie 07828064307, The hotel location was next to none It s close to all major sites and shopping areas which is a partners dream Location for restaurants is amazing and we had some amazing food in some amazing restaurants Location is so amazing 
47715,Saint Georges Hotel,No Negative, The best location for a London trip We have stayed here many times Clean quiet with helpful staff free wi fi good breakfast and a few hundred feet from Oxford Circus 
47716,Saint Georges Hotel, The hotel is old and needs an upgrade The wooden trimmings down the corridors are all old and battered as are the doors , View from bedroom and 15th floor great 
47717,Saint Georges Hotel, The room was not comfortable for example only place for proper light was the reading light Air conditioning was ok for heat but the room was so hot all time I had to open the window in the end to get some cool air in Can t imagine how it is in the summer as even in the beginning of March the afternoon sun heated the room very much All front desk staff that I spoke to during the 4 days stay were indifferent in their communication which was strange to me as it was a small hotel Expected them to be more friendly and communicative Breakfast option was really disappointing very expensive and not very appealing There are many options to eat in the area Would prefer to eat in the hotel if the was a decent VFM breakfast, The hotel is in a great location minutes from Oxford Circus That was the best thing about this hotel The bathroom was ok not trivial in London It was nice to have the option to make coffee tea in the room
47718,Saint Georges Hotel, bathroom is tiny can barely move heater takes a long time to operate phone is not working hotel does not have a room for securely storing luggages had to leave ours by the lobby no elevator triple room usually has 3 single beds ours had 2 single beds and 1 sofa bed , inclusion of english breakfast
47719,Saint Georges Hotel, Would have expected a room with a better quality from a 4 star hotel There was a hole in the sofa room looked dirty poor lighting and wifi connection was terrible We had one light in the room that had motion sensor and that was really annoying if you need the lamp on all the time you need to move otherwise it will turn off automatically , Superb location 
47720,Saint Georges Hotel,No Negative, I like everything I have no complaints what so ever its was a great trip and the hotel and its location was perfect for me I will return in the future for sure x
47721,Saint Georges Hotel, Air supply The 14th floor is rather noisy in late evening and early morning due to trolleys being moved around on the floor above We thought it was trolleys or some other movable objects on wheels also works in progress on hotel a bit disturbing but we did know some work was being done in advance of our stay , Not able to open window for air air conditioning not alterable Room OK asked for extra bed covers and got very good service plus bath robes on request All staff very polite 
47722,Saint Georges Hotel, that s my 2nd stay in saint georges we have been checked in in an old unrenovated room 1109 and after we requested a change to a slightly better room yet wifi wasn t working in our room 1206 , location
47723,Saint Georges Hotel, There is a temporary obstruction on the front entrance of the hotel during the time of our stay which makes it inconvenient There is a notice in the website about window works but they should have identified the obstruction to be in the front entrance of the hotel It is clean but the shower walls needs better scrubbing and cleaning as there were yellowish marks on the wall of the shower and in the tile grout which was not given proper attention , Excellent location Friendly staffs Pleasant stay 
47724,Saint Georges Hotel, Inadequate heating there was 10 15C when I arrived and for the first 4 hours I had to wear my jacket inside Wireless did not work I managed to access a website only once during a week , Location is great Very clean and nice place 
47725,Saint Georges Hotel, Initially given a very tired room on the 9th floor with peeling paper holes in the walls and unsightly cables trailing down the wall from the tv Distinct lack of interest or understanding when I asked for a better room and told to meet someone on the 12th floor This is all we can give you was the hardly apologetic offer Apparently the hotel is having a complete refurb which should be noted when you book Small bed in this room the lights tripped when plugging in a verified phone charger and had to wait for this to be fixed Drilling and hammering from 0800 the following morning which is the refurb happening The Heights bar known for its views was actually closed by 1050pm on the night I stayed there so no chance of a night cap either after the theatre Very surprising for a supposedly full hotel in central London , The view from the 12th floor room
47726,Saint Georges Hotel, the hotel is currently under construction early the next morning I was woken up by the sounds of drilling and knocking What I didn t like was that fact that the hotel staff did not mention anything regarding the noise due to the hotel renovation It would be helpful if they could have briefed us that the hotel is currently being renovated and construction work starts in the morning around 8 That way we could better prepare ourselves i e getting ear plugs etc , The room was very spacious and warm The hotel even provided toiletries i e shampoo body gel and body lotion 
47727,Saint Georges Hotel, There was a cold breeze from the windows Had to call to reception because we was cold and he brought an additional heater The thermostat heater wasn t working 2 hairs on the bath Robes were a bit rough and cardboard like The bed wasn t too comfy either we both had sore necks the next day Bathroom door was hard to shut Light above dresser wasn t working , Room was nice and spacious and welcoming Hot drinks selection was good although I don t rate the biscuits staff were very nice lifts were nice and quick and we had an iron which was good 
47728,Saint Georges Hotel, Room was next to staff lift Can be a little noisy when bar restaurant closes after 11 30pm , Value for money during period of re furbishment is excellent Rapid response to a leaking pipe fixed within 15 mins 
47729,Saint Georges Hotel, The front staff service nobody behind front desk at times anyone can walk in from the street hotel seems very lonely and desolate the construction infront of the hotel was an eye sore I checked out 1 day early and they still charged me still waiting to hear from the manager, Nothing
47730,Saint Georges Hotel, As usual checkout was very slow I have given up waiting and usually just don t bother with a receipt It s painful waiting for reception to wake up and they make you enter your card details three times for every stay online then when you check in and again when you leave Duvet rather thin and scratchy Bath chipped as usual , Great view Stayed twice this week first time receptionist was very friendly and upgraded me usually the staff are slow to say or do anything so this was impressive 
47731,Saint Georges Hotel, Was a bit noisy starting from 8 20 am due to construction works that are taking place in the building Might depend on the location of the room though Cold in the bathroom due to the old windows The rest is exceptional in terms of quality price , Staff was really helpful the location of the hotel is perfect in terms of shopping visiting cultural sights or just dining out A short walk or ride to everywhere in central london
47732,Saint Georges Hotel, I didnt have breakfast as there wasnt a full vegetarian hot opinion and wasnt prepared to pay the full money for just eggs and beans and i didnt want cold food such as cereal fruit etc, Location fantastic hotel clean comfortable rooms excellent size and cleanliness
47733,Saint Georges Hotel, Hotel is old and still under renovation House keeping limited until 2pm Internet bad in most rooms, good location Reception staff are good Close to all Main Street and restaurants
47734,Saint Georges Hotel, cold shower in the morning cold room air conditioner did not work properly The structure has a very good potential but requires refurbishment , perfect position good dimension of the room great view from the room window 
47735,Saint Georges Hotel, Things that where ment to be in room was not etc also how much we paid for the room I ve stayed in a lot better for a lot less on web site rooms look lovely but wasn t that good and we upgraded , Where hotel was very good location
47736,Saint Georges Hotel, The mirror in the bathroom wasn t clean from the previous guest since everytime we went to take a shower we could see their names written on the mirror because of the steam , The location is perfect 2 minutes away from the underground and a minute away from Oxford Street Great view of London from the 12th floor 
47737,Saint Georges Hotel, All good apart from the fact that it took a long time for the hot water to come through but that was a very minor glitch , Close to Oxford Street and also Palladium Theatre Comfortable bed and relaxing pillow Wonderful views over London from 15th floor bar and restaurant Lite bites available as well as formal meals 
47738,Saint Georges Hotel,No Negative, Great location 5 minutes on foot from Oxford Circus Our room had an incredible view Breakfast with a good choice of products is served in the restaurant and lounge on the 15th floor again with a great view Friendly staff very good rate quality price 
47739,Saint Georges Hotel, Rooms were very tired and shabby which was a shame as this was our 40th wedding anniversary and we spent our honeymoon here , bar was located well and gave a good view over London
47740,Saint Georges Hotel, Room was very hot when I arrived heating set to 32 degrees The cleaner knocked on the door at about 8 10 am I was running fairly late and about to leave but this seems very early to start knocking on doors , Room was nice large with a lovely view Best of the 8 hotels I have stayed in in this neighbourhood in the last 6 weeks 
47741,Saint Georges Hotel, Scaffolding all around the building made it difficult to find the entrance , So convenient for Oxford street shopping Loved the bar on the 15th floor with views over London 
47742,Saint Georges Hotel, This hotel needs a huge overhaul the bedrooms were so dirty grubby and run down the walls and ceiling are covered in grubby stains and there are more stains on the ceiling from what looks to be a water leak the headboard was covered in stains the bathroom looked like it hadn t been cleaned in years dust on every surface carpets worn to a thread in places Windows can t be opened and as the rooms are so small it was very stuffy never saw a staff member smile unfriendly Location is excellent but nothing else going for this hotel , The only good thing about this hotel is the location 
47743,Saint Georges Hotel, The rooms could do with a little makeover getting a bit tatty around the edges Room service stops providing alcohol at 1am, Perfect location for our evening They let us have a late checkout at no extra cost
47744,Saint Georges Hotel,No Negative, Staff were so lovely we stayed her New Year s Eve room was lovely light and big excellent veiws and without a doubt perfect location literally on Oxford street right near all the shops bars and restaurants would deffo stay here again staff couldn t do enough for us as we asked for extra tea and milk 
47745,Saint Georges Hotel,No Negative, Brilliant location excellent staff room cleaned every day with fresh coffee and tea Couldn t have asked for anything more Visited for New Years Eve and we went to the hotels Heights Bar after our meal in Savile Row and the hotel staff allowed us to go into the fire exit to see the fireworks It was brilliant could not recommend enough 
47746,Saint Georges Hotel, Nothing really Wasn t clear if bar was open as just a bar but I didn t get back till late anyway, location is great Room was quiet well equipped thoughtful tea coffee tray free mineral water very spacious for central London
47747,Saint Georges Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic location a few mins from Oxford Circus and great bars and restaurants Just be aware that there are only a few parking bays so you must reserve in advance if you need one 
47748,Saint Georges Hotel, Staff were not seen a lot not that helpful when asked questions and drink refreshment women walked into our room when we were in bed , Hotel Room was really nice
47749,Saint Georges Hotel, Smelly old fashioned and lacking in care Although I have been informed renovations are under way , The location is perfect for Oxford st The rooms are large and offers great views over London The staff were friendly 
47750,Saint Georges Hotel,No Negative, Great room good size bed very comfortable Complimentary mineral water welcome Being 9 floors up meant any street noise at a minimum but also very little noise coming through from next door rooms Location brilliant for getting round London centre 
47751,Saint Georges Hotel, The first room we were given was very very tired and we payed extra for superior room it was basic small and furniture was well past it s time with rips and stains the bottom of the bath looked like it had rust marks and the walls were in poor condition We were moved to another room it was a little better but still very tired , Staff were very helpful
47752,Saint Georges Hotel, Beds were incredibly hard and uncomfortable just need to get some new mattresses Also quite noisy in night from doors slamming , Loved the room staff and location
47753,Saint Georges Hotel, Thin walls and resultant noisiness of guests in adjoining rooms no wash cloths which we U S A Western guests are accustomed to in homes lodging, Location cleanliness friendliness of staff in room coffee service
47754,Saint Georges Hotel, Could do with a lick of paint and corridors carpet abut tired but clean and comfortable Housekeeping call too early 745 on Saturday Please, Excellent location Upgraded free by booking com
47755,Saint Georges Hotel, our experience was good overall but the d cor of the corridor needs attention torn carpets tapped down health and safety issue, Our stay was lovely very convenient location especially beside the BBC studios Great views of the Shard London Eye Our daughter met the Vamps in the hotel so no pressure to stay there again 
47756,Saint Georges Hotel, We thought the breakfast was poor in quality very overpriced even for London and we were rushed by dining room staff We were rather surprised by the casual security measures of the Reception staff who did not always challenge people accessing lifts to the bedroom floors , Good location for Palladium Theatre and Oxford Street and surrounding area Room very comfortable clean and superb views 
47757,Saint Georges Hotel,No Negative, staff where aware that we had a disabled guest and pulled out all the stops to make our stay as comfortable and stress free as possible from placing our rooms beside the lifts to keeping a ramp at the front steps for easy hassle free entry and exit 
47758,Saint Georges Hotel, Room was a little small No iron in room though they did eventually find one to give us Mini bar too expensive No sense of personal service this time We ve stayed there 4 times and this was the worst room by far Not our idea of superior double room compared to last trip and we had paid an upgrade Thinking of changing our regular Hotel when visiting London now , Great location next to BBC headquarters 
47759,Saint Georges Hotel,No Negative, Great location in Central London Clean and well equipped room with modern d cor Wonderful views across London from room 1019 Quiet room with no noise disturbance 
47760,Saint Georges Hotel, Smell of wc everywhere poor and very old rooms beds windows cabinets No repairs like 30 years or more Smell is so strong that you can not breath Price was like for 5 star hotels I know london is a place for tourists and idiots you can not expect good food or good hotel But if you pay 200 pounds for a night And you booked hotel 1 5 month before Will never stay there again I was surprised of rates for this hotel My rate is 3 points and of course 2 star hotel , Location is very good great coffee in 100m Kaffeine 66 Great Titchfield St London W1W 7QJ 
47761,Saint Georges Hotel, It looks tired and in need of a thorough refit in all areas The often seen grotty grout around the bath shower was lacking in power some broken tiles , Excellent location friendly staff comfortable bed good breakfast
47762,Saint Georges Hotel, the hotel needs a refurbishment as it is very threadbare e g carpets are worn and held together with duct tape wood badly scratched Beds springy and sheets well worn etc, the position of the hotel was the best feature and the views from the restaurant and bar were very good
47763,Saint Georges Hotel, Breakfast average and expensive hotel getting a little tired , Great location for shopping and the West End and nice bar with a view Great value on our last minute booking 
47764,Saint Georges Hotel, Even though the beds and bathroom were very clean the room itself was shabby broken telephone socket chairs and window screen cover, The view was fab of the London skyline from our 14th floor room which had windows the entire width of the bedroom
47765,Saint Georges Hotel,No Negative, The location is PERFECT Staff very friendly and helpfull We have been there many times but the room we got this time was a bit worn out to look at 
47766,Saint Georges Hotel, No complaints at all, The location is perfect and the restaurant and bar on the top floor really opulent to be able to watch over the bustling crossroads of regents street and Oxford street as the sun sets is wonderful 
47767,Saint Georges Hotel, Woken up startled at 1 30am to a very loud mechanical type noise within the air con cents which went on for about 1min I paid for a superior room my wallpaper had holes in with chunks missing from the the wall there was a crack and damp in the ceiling above my bed the windows looked like they hadn t been cleaned for a long time , Good Location
47768,Saint Georges Hotel, Nothing is really bad , The hotel location is great if you want to be near shopping areas some touristic attractions and if you are travelling for medical purposes also 
47769,Saint Georges Hotel, hotel seemed very tired Cramped and untidy reception area dirty carpets sullen looking cleaning staff in the corridors Generally all just a bit shabby especially considering the price This was certainly not one of the best London hotels I have stayed in, good location friendly reception and bar staff although waiting staff at breakfast were very distracted and forgot to bring our toast despite a request 
47770,Saint Georges Hotel, Surely not value for money Linen was not changed in 7 days When I moved the beds after the stay to check if I had left something behind dirt and old broken ear phones were left behind so definitely the beds weren t moved to clean, Location was great
47771,Saint Georges Hotel, The cleaning lady was not very friendly I talked to her one morning as my roomate had spoiled water in her bed She was irritated and pissed because the bed was wet and she didn t do anything to show it She cleaned our room but forgot or skipped to place a new duvet on one of the beds Not good The 15 floor bar closed way to early , I loved the great location With Regent street just outside the door and Oxford street Soho Mayfair and Covent Garden in walking distance 
47772,Saint Georges Hotel, This place needs updating The carpet hallways are so dated The first impression was negative , Large room excellent location It has the potential of being 4 stars 
47773,Saint Georges Hotel, cost high for room only The d cor is outdated and bedrooms and common areas need to be refurbished , Central location easy accessibility to shops restaurants 
47774,Saint Georges Hotel, The hotel needs renovation to be more modern and replace fixtures that get worn out Keeping them clean helps but renovation is still needed Mattress a bit hard , Bathroom absolutely spotless fluffy white towels basic toiletries The room smelled of soap and shampoo which i found strangely comforting Bed linen of good quality Great view on the city Staff very friendly and helpful Wifi quite fast Great that instead of ac I could open the window Right in the shopping area yet very quiet Close to metro 
47775,Saint Georges Hotel, The breakfast was disappointing fried eggs came over cooked and coffee was warm not hot Toast was under cooked Service was good, Location of Staint George very good All the front desk assistants very good and helpful Tony was fantastic in organising a taxi for 5 people to Tilbury docks Good service 
47776,Saint Georges Hotel, We stayed in this hotel 5 years ago which is why we stayed again great memories and at the time the hotel was in good condition with some elements of luxury Unfortunately little if anything has been done to the hotel in the past 5 years and the cleaning practices have obviously faltered Its in desperate need if some TLC and renovation in the rooms Very tired given the rate paid the breakfast is poor your right in the heart of the city so far better to skip the extortionate below average breakfast and head to one of the many caf s , Great views across the city including the BT tower Easy access to the tube and great location for shopping 
47777,Saint Georges Hotel, I could clearly hear the neighbours light switches and bathroom fan to my left and the staff service lift to my right So despite asking for a 12th floor room for quietness I didn t get to sleep until late and consequently woke up very tired Walls are made of paper , Central location
47778,Saint Georges Hotel, Total disaster This hotel barely would deserve a 1 if in London there would be a real star classification system Small room looking like it hasnt been refurbished since 1950 ,No Positive
47779,Saint Georges Hotel, The fact that my first room was full of fungus till I got asthma during my trip Staff was nice I asked him to change the room and he did right away and my new room was nice But I spent half day in dirty room and have to move to new room in the middle of the night because I couldn t stand and couldn t breath anymore , I like the location the most It s very convenient The room is big with nice decoration The staff were very nice 
47780,Saint Georges Hotel, There was a strong smell of cigarette smoke and deep heat ointment coming through the ventilation I did report this on check out staff apologised and said they would check it out , Location and value 
47781,Saint Georges Hotel, The hotel needs a little bit of love only a little but enough to notice The bathroom door didn t lock and needed a little bit of paint value for money wise I m happy with the condition for the amount I paid , This hotel s real attraction is it s location It s positioned perfectly at the end of Regent Street right next to the BBC building 2 mins walk from Oxford Circus station Carnaby Street Goodge Street and serves as a brilliant base for galavanting around London 
47782,Saint Georges Hotel, 1 there is no service in the hotel to help for your luggage 2 if you have any problem they didn t fix it in the same time 3 we booked 4 rooms and all of them in 14th flour there was one of them very very very bad smell we requested to change it many time in the third day of our stay they change it while this days we was sleeping in the rest of our rooms because we can t use this room at all , 1 location near of underground station 2 near of starbucks cafe
47783,Saint Georges Hotel, Decided against eating there after manager in bar made an incredible seen about why he didn t put salt on frozen margarita rim completely unnecessary and rude even lectured staff within earshot for 20 mins after Very uncomfortable when my husband had only asked for a salt shaker and did not complain at all had one predinner drink and left ,No Positive
