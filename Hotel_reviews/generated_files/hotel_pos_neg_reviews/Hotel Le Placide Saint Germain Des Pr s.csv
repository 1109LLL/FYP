221784,Hotel Le Placide Saint Germain Des Pr s, The carpet in the room needs to be replaced a full size mirror needs to be installed so you can look at yourself after getting dressed and they should offer a full shower head other than the held hand one , We loved the location and the staff was very helpful accommodating and very nice 
221785,Hotel Le Placide Saint Germain Des Pr s, rooms have no sound proofing you can hear your neighbors in their rooms or anyone in the very narrow hallway there are 2 rooms per floor and an elevator that takes you to your room note that a junior suite is what I would consider a regular sized room double room but this is paris , amazing location across from Bon Marche walking distance to Saint Germain Luxembourg Garden Invalides Notre Dame etc beautiful modern room very nice staff 
221786,Hotel Le Placide Saint Germain Des Pr s,No Negative, This hotel is in sight of Le Bon Marche in the comfortable St Germain des Pres it is small and rather private all pluses Pleasant decor and very accommodating breakfast setup 
221787,Hotel Le Placide Saint Germain Des Pr s, The tube and shower in the bathroom terrible for people over 70 like me Very dangerous to go in and out from the tube they did not ofer any solution like a step To help, The bed was good
221788,Hotel Le Placide Saint Germain Des Pr s, If only they could take the carpeting out and change the drapes the room would be picture perfect But this only to my personal taste of course , The concierge made us feel as we were coming home We had a room on the top floor with a large terrace which is very hard to find in Paris The size of the room was also great compared to most hotel rooms which are very tiny The location is the best almost next to the Bon March and metro S vres Bathrobes slippers a scale they think of everything we ll choose this hotel again for our next visit 
221789,Hotel Le Placide Saint Germain Des Pr s, No shower Curtains but it seems to be the practice in France because our hotel in Provence had no shower curtains too , Stayed here for 5 nights with my husband and 3 teenage boys We absolutely LOVED Le Placide and it s very personalized service Friendly and helpful staff who made sure they were able to help in whatever way they can I left my shopping bag in a Cafe with an old scarf which I loved and I asked if they could call the cafe and just tell them to hold it for me and I would pass for it the next day To my delight one of the staff went to the store personally and I had my stuff in the hotel after I came back from a day of sightseeing I really appreciated the gesture We also left a few items behind after we checked out and they kept them for us until we could go back from Provence to pick them up Beds are definitely comfortable and bathrooms were clean Room size was just right even for my 3 boys who shared a room Location is amazing and near Bon March and many cafes and places to shop But the real gem of this hotel are the people managing it Would definitely stay in Le Placide and recommend it to friends 
221790,Hotel Le Placide Saint Germain Des Pr s, the room was a nice small size and perfect for one If you were staying for long and it was two people one might think it was too small , Sweet boutique hotel located in the middle of St Germain and a close to main sights shops and restaurants Across the street from a big Bon Marche store and right in the heart of the chic left bank it s a great location The room was very pleasant with nice white clean modern bathrooms It s a great little gem for staying in Paris 
221791,Hotel Le Placide Saint Germain Des Pr s, On the other hand if you take out the location factor This hotel is not even qualified to be called as 2 star for some reason this was a 4 star hotel maybe the paris standards The breakfast was such a disappointment the rooms were so cramped Junior Suite was a joke played on us The whole facility looked like sham , The only best thing about this hotel and all the central hotels in paris is the location and proximity to all things interesting 
221792,Hotel Le Placide Saint Germain Des Pr s,No Negative, The Staff were very nice and helpful The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was very big The room was very clean and tidy and the location just amazing
221793,Hotel Le Placide Saint Germain Des Pr s, Nothing major a few minor points No shower curtain Water pressure was very good but my husband had to sit in bath to shower as no curtain to prevent getting water everywhere and floor slippy No milk or powdered milk with tea coffee in room We could probably have asked though Had to ask for some brekkie items to be topped up i e cereal juice as run out and after a while asked for the bits we wanted Took a while to figure out dvd player not quite like the intructions in the book to make it work , Staff were extremely helpful and friendly and knowledgable Bathroom was spacious had a lovely deep bath and very clean Bed was comfy enoough including pillows Good facilities overall dvd player good mini bar useful and several choices safe very handy Slippers robes were nice touches We were able to borrow umbrellas the hotel had as it was raining Plenty of storage space there were 3 of us in a double really so this was surprising but good Room a good size for 2 people maybe a little small for 3 but we were fine for 3 nights Quiet no noise issues Room light and airy as windows both ends one in the bedroom and one in bathroom Breakfast options good for continental also offered hot bacon eggs also if we wanted which is nice 
221794,Hotel Le Placide Saint Germain Des Pr s, Amazing tiny elevator adds to the charm but completely unnefficient , Very friendly staff Location location location Cross the street and have a light meal at the Bon Marche barrestaurants Amazing 
221795,Hotel Le Placide Saint Germain Des Pr s,No Negative, everything was perfect the room the location the staff the wonderful breakfast will stay there next time in paris IAn email was waiting for me on my return thanking me for being with them and telling me i had left a sweater in the room and asking how they could return it Asked for help on a number of occasions re restaurants travelling around the city could not have been kinder or more pleasent all the staff we encountered were marvellous
221796,Hotel Le Placide Saint Germain Des Pr s, No hot water in the shower in the morning experienced by all in our group for both days Also during breakfast we had to wait long before there was enough to eat for all of us if you wanted something else than butter an jam , Location was excellent Quiet in the evening with no distrurbance from traffic noise etc Comfortable beds 
221797,Hotel Le Placide Saint Germain Des Pr s, The shower was poor The temperature veered between scorching and freezing and the water stopped once mid shower , We loved the room which was on top floor and had a private balcony Comfy bed spotlessly clean stylishly furnished Wi fi was fast and worked perfectly in the room Staff at front desk were always friendly and helpful
