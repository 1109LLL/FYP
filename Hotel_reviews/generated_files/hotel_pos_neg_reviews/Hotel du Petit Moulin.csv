132065,Hotel du Petit Moulin, Our room needed a bit more light I realized the current lighting is part of the sexy and fabulous design but it was difficult to pack our suitcases in the early morning without the help of the sun through the open curtains , We loved everything about this hotel It is intimate with a unique style that is like no other hotel where we have stayed The staff were there 24 hours and were extremely accomodating and friendly This is a 5 star in our book and we will be back

132070,Hotel du Petit Moulin, Should have requested a seperate shower , Exceptional staff Gorgeous Maud at reception went far and beyond to to assist with a travel booking issue that arose All staff were very helpful and welcoming Good sized room and excellent location in the Marais 
132071,Hotel du Petit Moulin, I want to stay longer , The staff on reception were AMAZING and such friendly girls The rooms are fantastic each one different and we got to CHOOSE our favourite once The location is perfect for anyone who wants to hang out in la Marais district We walked everywhere and I am very pregnant We left early and were given a free take away coffee Nice touch
132072,Hotel du Petit Moulin, N A, The rooms are very nice and comfortable and the location is perfect Across the street is a great little local restaurant that has survived the booming growth of the Marais It is a great area to walk around in and close to several cultural sites shopping and transportation Very knowledgable staff the parent Hotel is as good as it gets 
132073,Hotel du Petit Moulin,No Negative, We enjoyed our stay so much that we actually changed our flights to book an additional night The bed is really comfortable we loved the big clawfoot tub the quirky designs of the two rooms we had were fun and the location is excellent just a stone s throw from loads of small galleries bars caf s and restaurants and just minutes from the Picasso museum The staff are professional discreet and efficient We would certainly book here again and in fact we have already done so 
132074,Hotel du Petit Moulin, The hot water wasn t hot The shower head was too close to the wall meaning it was quite difficult to have a shower , The decor was fantastic the breakfast was great the staff were really helpful the rooms were really clean and finished to a very high standard The location is also perfect for bars shops museums etc 
132075,Hotel du Petit Moulin, Our room was really hot when we arrived and despite our best efforts to cool it off by opening the window still was a little warm I think the AC had been suspended for the season after all this was the end of October but unfortunately we could have used it , Super great location and quiet room Great bathroom very spacious and good water pressure Loved the quirky decor The breakfast looked nice but we couldn t take advantage due to early morning flight 
132076,Hotel du Petit Moulin, would have liked a shower head because my husband is tall We had a bathtub with sprayer but it was really fine and very Parisien, adorable place in perfect location Near metro and in the great Le Marais area of Paris
132077,Hotel du Petit Moulin, Nothing to dislike we were on the fifth floor with an elevator to the fourth floor only It certainly didn t worry us as we are fit and only had a small suitcase , The location in Le Marais plus the the comfort cleanliness and convenience of this boutique hotel 
132078,Hotel du Petit Moulin, I did not like having to leave , Greatest location in Paris beds are superb The staff are lovely and you are right in the heart of the oldest district of paris My home away from home 
132079,Hotel du Petit Moulin, The hotel ordered us a taxi to go to L Eglise de la Madeleine and the driver charged us more than 20 Euro the return journey we booked ourselves cost only 9 , The staff were particularly helpful The room was very nice and found the location convenient 
132080,Hotel du Petit Moulin, There was nothing to not like, The location was great Walking distance to all attractions we had time for in our short stay The staff were very helpful with great recommendations for places to eat Rooms clean and bed comfy 
132081,Hotel du Petit Moulin, nothing really I got the room on sale b c it was July in Paris but it s a little on the steep side ordinarily however you get what you pay for in Paris , Pretty much EVERYTHING it s a boutique hotel with luxury amenities It s small yet sophisticated and intimate I happen to love Christian LaCroix and his designs and they are definitely reflected in the decor as it s a very unique place Additionally I found the staff to be super helpful and hands on and willing to do all those little extra things that really do matter The location is terrific and Le Marais is at your doorstep literally I really can t say enough good things about this little gem Bravo Hotel du Petit Moulin Bravo 
132082,Hotel du Petit Moulin, Not a single complaint , We loved this fabulous unique hotel The staff were lovely and so helpful organising dinner bookings at restaurants prior to our arrival Rooms are gorgeous and the bath is deep and heavenly The position of the hotel in the Marais is sensational We will definitely stay there when we return to Paris 
132083,Hotel du Petit Moulin,No Negative, The staff are excellent and very helpful with suggestions Our room was upgraded on arrival which was amazing Loved everything about the hotel and would stay there again 
132084,Hotel du Petit Moulin, I was put on the room on the first floor next to the lobby restaurant I can hear all the noise outside and everyone can hear me Also the heater was too hot and I can t change the temperature so I have to open the window but it was directly in front of the street which might be dangerous , Room was beautiful spacious
132085,Hotel du Petit Moulin, I just think the management should understand to stay at the top maintenance has to be done This is not a budget hotel so an eye for details is necessary , the overall atmosphere the reception and the lounge The staff was indeed very helpful and full of attention The location is perfect for enjoying Marais area and you can easily get everywhere You can easily catch the metro and reach CGD in more or less 1 15 hours I did enjoying having breakfast It was quite and very reserved

132087,Hotel du Petit Moulin, There s no gym or business center or anything that I would need for a business trip or a long stay Internet was TERRIBLE , Adorable hotel in a perfect location Rooms are charming clean unique Staff is friendly 
132088,Hotel du Petit Moulin, Nothing really it was excellent hotel If there was one thing it was finding the third floor down on the carpark the entrance to the lower floor is tucked away so hard to see unless you know its there , Very friendly hotel the girls on the front desk were very helpful and polite The room was beautifully decorated and the ceiling completely mirrored We only stayed one night as on way down to Nice so didn t try all facilities but what we did try was excellent The car was also safe in their underground carpark Would definitely stay there again
132089,Hotel du Petit Moulin, The free WiFi wasn t very good I could always connect with my iPhone but I would often lose the connection I wasn t thrilled that my room was so close to the reception area and the breakfast room and people walking by on the street could see into my room unless I drew the curtains but it didn t cause any major disturbances , The location was very nice just outside of the heart of the Marais and pretty close to the Chatelet Les Halles RER station so it was easy to access from to the airport The staff were very helpful and friendly and the hotel is beautifully designed I also loved the rain shower head and the Herm s bath products were a nice detail
