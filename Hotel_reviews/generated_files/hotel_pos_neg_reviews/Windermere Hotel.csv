51224,Windermere Hotel,No Negative, Breakfast had nice variety and enough good food for a good start to day Small but quaint what I expect in boutique hotel abroad Room was crowded for 3 women and our 5 luggage pieces But we had a c in room 
51225,Windermere Hotel, room d cor needed attention also bathroom shower in bath which was everso high to step into indeed very dangerous for us with disabilities, hotelowners were excellent very hands on and always there to assist
51226,Windermere Hotel, The hotel is in a quiet area about a half mile from the closest tube station at Victoria This is a short walk if you do it once a day but gets tiresome if you need to do multiple trips or have an partner with a low tolerance for walking The benefit obviously is that the hotel is removed from the noise and bustle around the station , All staff from front desk to breakfast room to housekeeping were absolutely fantastic Helpful with additional info and go out of their way to arrange extras such as a light breakfast at 3AM before you leave for airport There are many restaurants and groceries within a few blocks walk 
51227,Windermere Hotel,No Negative, Windermere is one of the four hotels I stayed during my trip in the UK and it is the best To be fair the other hotels are also good however you can find the same ones everywhere around the world Windermere is unique Every minute I spent there I knew I am in London Thank Emily for recommending the Tate 2 Tate ferry which made our journey easier and timesaving Thank Muna the route to the airport you advised was double helpful And the generous young man your name I can speak but feel hard to spell thank you so much assisting my friend in negotiating with the cab driver she said that you had rescued her 
51228,Windermere Hotel,No Negative, Great localisation close to the Victoria Station Nice surroundings Helpfull staff Very good breakfast Room was not very spacious but clean with comfortable bed and clean bathroom It will be my choice for the next stop in London 
51229,Windermere Hotel, Basement room Couldn t adjust heating very hot in room , Comfortable bed Adjacent to bar and restaurant Excellent en suite Toiletries provided
51230,Windermere Hotel, The tea coffee in room was very limited and the guy on bought reception when I asked for more he said are you sure you have used it all why would I ask for more if we still had some in the room , Bed very comfortable and room clean
51231,Windermere Hotel, The LittleBen room was a little small but comfortable nonetheless , Outstanding hospitality by Nick who runs this hotel Every morning he would personally greet guests and make sure that everyone s happy and comfortable 
51232,Windermere Hotel,No Negative, Staff friendly and very accommodating Good customer service Good location and hotel was within working distance to the underground to access central London Would definitely book again 
51233,Windermere Hotel, Nothing everything was great and better than some of the big chain hotels we have stopped in before, Great location around 8 minutes from Victoria underground a lovely homely hotel Staff were excellent really friendly and helpful Room was great three beds with ensure the ensuite is small but really clean and it does the job Complimentary shampoo shower gel is great to have plus team and coffee in the room Room service is great if you want it Beds are really comfortable and the room had big fluffy towels so good Breakfast was excellent we had cereal fullenglish fruit and you got and toast what more could you ask for plus service was great Thank you Windermere for making our stay in London more special definitely be back again
51234,Windermere Hotel, The room and bathroom were very small Ok for 2 nights but pretty crowded when carrying a lot of luggage , Location was excellent Room was comfortable and very clean Staff were welcoming and breakfast was very good 
51235,Windermere Hotel, very noisy when someone runs or moves in de room above probably because of wooden floors despite the carpet , nice cosy building bit old fashioned but clean well secured good facilities perfect breakfast
51236,Windermere Hotel, We were disappointed with breakfast as I do not eat a lot of full English items and when my place came I received one bacon hashbrown and sausage which did not fill me up in the least before a day of sightseeing Also as the bathroom is a long and narrow hallway it is difficult to manoeuvre around Lastly the noise from guests in the room above was quite disturbing , Staff were very friendly and added a bottle of prosecco to our room as I requested Room was lovely and bed extra comfy 
51237,Windermere Hotel, Can t think of anything Will always try to stay here when I visit London , Reception staff on arrival were extremely helpful and knowledgeable of the events happening close buy Great location Outstanding comfortable beds Excellent breakfast cooked to order
51238,Windermere Hotel,No Negative, The staff was very helpful The room had a king bed and was perfectly fine size wise The room was not as big as a typical U S hotel room but everything is London is smaller We had two large suitcases and 2 carry ons and there was enough room We walked to the Westminster Abbey a few times It was roughly a pleasant 20 minute walk There are a slew of hotels out there for the same nightly rate that deliver a lot less This is an excellent choice in the Booking Com 4 star category The Victoria Coach Station is a short 6 minute walk away 5 additional minutes gets you to the Victoria train station and the Victoria underground station From these three options you can get anywhere within or outside of London We had an excellent stay 
51239,Windermere Hotel, Just a tiny bit disappointed with the cleanliness of the bathroom But we were only there for one night so it really wasn t a problem , The staff were friendly attentive and welcoming Your Chef barman waiter looked after my sister and myself 
51240,Windermere Hotel, the booking went wrong because i thought i ordered a twin bed and got a double which was very uncomfortable very small room it was smaller than my cabin on river cruise it did not represent good value for money and deflected by good location and good staff , the staff werre friendly and helpful

51248,Windermere Hotel, we were first given a room close to reception and the sink was outside of the bathroom of which the bathroom was ridiculously small i was not impressed with this as especially the price was standard like the otherooms we complained and then were provided another room on second floor they took out complaint seriously and were soon moved within 40 minutes, staff very professional and courteous very clean and the breakfast is of very good standard

51251,Windermere Hotel, This is a quiet hotel perfect for mature couples Small bar in the dining breakfast room where drinks are available but no other facilities or meeting areas, Staff were helpful and attentive heated bathroom floor very cosy room tea and coffee making facilities good Had dinner on two occasions and the food was excellent Breakfast was of limited choice but perfectly adequate and the cooked breakfast was good 
51252,Windermere Hotel,No Negative, The staff is very friendly and helpful We enjoyed our stay at the Windermere Hotel and would recommend it to our friends The walking distance to Victoria Station makes it a good location for visiting London 
51253,Windermere Hotel, Ground floor twin room was tiny Shower room cramped no room for sink which was out in bedroom About 3inches between twin beds Thin walls neighbours and reception clearly audible at all hours Breakfast very average Dodgy wiring on bedside light This is not a 4 star hotel Much better value accommodation available locally with far better facilities Won t be going there again , Friendly helpful staff easy walking distance from Victoria and Westminster

51258,Windermere Hotel,No Negative, Close to both Victoria rail and coach station about 5 10 mins walk but not on a main road so it is quite quiet The rooms are spotlessly clean classical wood furniture and the beds are very comfortable The chef in the restaurant was not only a good cook but was very friendly I highly recommend his cooking Breakfast was efficiently served by two waitresses Both the cooked and the buffet continental food were delicious Overall the staff were pleasant and helpful and we enjoyed our stay 
51259,Windermere Hotel, What s not to like , Friendly staff great breakfast close to Victoria Station and within walking distance of lots of attractions Some rooms are compact but very clean and overall good value for money for central London Excellent communication on booking

51261,Windermere Hotel, The lower ground bedroom was extremely noisy which made it difficult to sleep The floor above the room creaked very loudly when people walked about and I could hear every word spoken by people in the room next door The shower box was uncomfortably small , I did not like it

51265,Windermere Hotel, Room size was as expected and ok for a couple of nights but might be a squeeze for a longer holiday if you have bigger luggage The people in the room above were extremely noisy and heavy on their feet so I guess the carpets are not very thick If you don t want to be woken very early perhaps request a room on the top floor ,No Positive
