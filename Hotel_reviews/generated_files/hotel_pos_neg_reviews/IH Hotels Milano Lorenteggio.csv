480505,IH Hotels Milano Lorenteggio, Overall bad experience but the worst was the malfunctioning door key On average I had to come back to reception 3 times per day to activate the key card until finally a receptionist would open my room door for me On top of that there were no apologies all I got was a shoulder shrug , The only hotel that still had availability on short notice

480509,IH Hotels Milano Lorenteggio, I travel a lot and have so far visited a countless number of hotels But this one is a true rarity Considering that such a brand is in a such condition I trust one should pay great efforts to find it Unbelievable In order to survive and remain safe and sound in this hotel you would need a spacesuit For starters to protect you from an invading army of germs and bacteria located all over the room carpets curtains drapes walls furniture etc not cleaned for years Though if you would like to see some animal species in action then the surprises are located above and under your bed But in order for all of this to be displayed first you need to enter your room In order for that to be possible you would have to ride in the elevator for dozen of times back and forth so that you convince the receptionist that the e key card she gave you for entering the room is dysfunctional preventing you from accessing the room even after her several unsuccessful undertakings to reprogram it After all of that they eventually decide it is time you get an assistance from the bellhop Though I would recommend you d better keep your distance from him should you like to breathe normally in the elevator We entered the room finally And what a surprise I changed three rooms in the attempt to decide in which one of them I wouldn t be more harmed and have higher chances of survival In the end I offered all my arguments means and persuasiveness to be accommodated at last and in decent conditions after such a lengthy agony And just guess the financial means won by putting an end to my torment I was asked to pay more in order to get a new special superior room with a pool view of which I m sending you couple of photos Luckily there was no carpet in it My dear travellers I wish you fully enjoy all 4 stars of this hotel Should I m asked to rate it my question is do you have rates starting from 0 and below Thank you ,No Positive

480513,IH Hotels Milano Lorenteggio, The location is too far away from Milan about 30min Then there are no ticket machines for using the tram bus nearby which makes it impossible to use the public transport over the weekend unless you buy tickets in advance highly recommended The bathroom was definitively not a 4star bathroom it was a bit old and rusty , The staff was nice The breakfast was very good The Wifi was working mostly well 
480514,IH Hotels Milano Lorenteggio, I d ont think this hotel should be rate a 4 star hotel as the rooms have not been updated in many years The bathroom is in terrible condition door frame is rotten on the bottom the shower squirts everywhere the toil seat is yellow the flusher is broken the sink refurnishment is dirty Not very 4 star The carpet in the room is all staiined and the furniture is all chipped Like I said not worth the 4 stars , Location 200 300 metre walking distance to tram terminal Abbundant breakfast The fact that you can check in 24 hrs a day
