490354,TownHouse Galleria, the house keeping and the concierge who forgot to one piece of the languages in the car and we had to pay for it to be delivered to air port, I liked the location and size of room and bath
490355,TownHouse Galleria, Breakfast Overpriced with no eggs and the so called terrace in our room with half dead ivy watering constantly making it a mosquito nest The service of rooms is approximate , Location
490356,TownHouse Galleria, Shower did not work Too much light in the room Noise from neighbors For the description of a five star hotel this was not 5 star standard at all , The overhead shower had scalding hot water The facilities were not managed and looked after properly The gym shower did not work It has an excellent location but needs better facilities management I would pull on a lever in the bathroom and it would pop out When I complained I felt the manager seemed just to shift the blame instead of taking responsibility and action for the situation The room also gets a lot of light from the courtyard so if you have sleeping issues not the best location to be in 
490357,TownHouse Galleria,No Negative, Amazing hotel with a very professional and friendly staff the concierge arranges anything you need tickets private transfer to the airport dinner in a restaurant etc Comfortable air conditioned big room with a spectacular view of the Galleria Luxury restaurant delicious breakfast and once more great view of the passage Surely recommendable 
490358,TownHouse Galleria, Despite the fact that all of the staff were courteous and extremely helpful the fact is that the hotel felt as though it had seen better days and is trading on past reputation and its enviable location For an establishment of this rating and in comparison to similar hotels we have stayed in elsewhere the basic requirements were somewhat lacking The room whilst acceptable in size was not what we had thought we had booked had questionable air conditioning and required a fairly extensive makeover Some key issues broken toilet seat faulty lighting poor quality of towels and basic house keeping errors which meant that on 3 occasions out of a 3 night stay we had to telephone for missing items Both the room and some of the external areas would have benefitted from re painting shabby chic is one thing but some parts of the hotel were just a little too shabby unfortunately When paying in excess 400 euro a night for just accommodation Breakfast is 30 euro per person extra there is quite rightly an expectation that the basic hygiene issues are dealt with seamlessly in an effort to ensure the stay is as stress free as possible It is also highly unusual to find that the only complimentary consumable within what purports to be a 5 establishment is one bottle of water per day and even that was missing on the final evening Unfortunately we came away feeling somewhat short changed for what should have been a real highlight of our stay in the city Dinner in the hotel s Ottagono restaurant was unecessarily pretentious and in fairness rather clumsy and slow although the food was very good I have a feeling that again past reputation is being leaned on quite heavily as by 9pm optimal time for dining in Milan we were the only diners in the restaurant , The staff were attentive and friendly and a good night s sleep was assured with a very comfortable bed The location right in the middle of the city was superb 
490359,TownHouse Galleria, Smart tv wadnt put into use as supposed to be , It was our honeymoon and the offered us complementary wine and delicious cake the room was beautiful and the view was exceptionally breathtaking 
490360,TownHouse Galleria, If you love Italy you will accept a few inefficiencies during your stay Our initial room had a few defects and finally we were offered another room Some recommendations on where to go from the front desk staff were not accurate e g Dinner place prior to La Scala visit but staff was generally very friendly and helpful , Great Hotel nicely refurbished and with spectacular view into the galleria incl Room balcony Very friendly personnel Location is right in the heart of Milano downtown If you arrive at Linate airport its a short 25 minute ride by cab 
490361,TownHouse Galleria, Everything Amenities replacement only if you ask Curtains hanging like a hostel TV system complicated rescan all the time Breakfast selection very poor, Location
490362,TownHouse Galleria,No Negative, Very luxurious stay with Perfect location with the Galleria view good for shopping and the Dummo is just a few steps away There are some amazing restaurants in the Galleria 
490363,TownHouse Galleria, Very thin walls You can hear the noise from the galleria in your room and we couldn t sleep very well House keeping failed to supply room with water or other amenities like toilet paper we had to ask every time Towels and bed sheets didn t smell very fresh and smelled weirer Very overpriced considering the level of service, Centrally located near all main attractions
490364,TownHouse Galleria, The smell of the corridor at the second floor is very bad due to the preparation kitchen which is there breakfast menu is far from 5 star hotel and the stuff are totally unprofissional and unfriendly A lot of noise coming from collecting the trash between 5 30am to 7 00am , The location
490365,TownHouse Galleria, some pieces of the furniture were clearly worn out I did not like the lighting in the room wasn t atmospheric at all The floor was crooked in the bathroom The phone they provided me with cell phone was not charged , Location is great and the staff were extremely welcoming and very friendly 
490366,TownHouse Galleria, Absolutely nothing , Best location in Milano Staff is very helpful Concierge is the best in town Very big and cosy room with high ceiling and huge bathroom with balcony Inside the galleria under 1 min walking to the best restaurants and 5 min walking to the best shopping avenue 
490367,TownHouse Galleria, Being very picky it would have been nice to have a gym , Location is excellent and the room was really nice with a very comfortable and huge bed Bathroom was lovely and had the extra touch of his and hers toiletries Great service from the staff and cleaning was timed around your movements so there was no inconvenience also there was a turn down service was good too 
490368,TownHouse Galleria, i booked a junior suite which has 2 levels but this kind of room is not efficient no reason for second level , everything but most important Leonardo the concierge is superb 
490369,TownHouse Galleria, The hot water was inconsistent This is a huge deterrent for me during winter time During the same shower the water would turn lukewarm suddenly Then it would turn extremely hot again My bathroom looks great but wasn t practical at all There wasn t any towel warmers in the bathroom and no place to hang bath towels This happened to both my kids and our bedrooms Overall looks good but very unpractical , The location is fantastic Pillows and beds were very firm Room was huge 
490370,TownHouse Galleria, The heater doesn t work at all in the room and couldn t sleep all night from the cold Alot of noise of people going up and down the stairs of the roof of the hotel making so much noise and u can hear them fight till morning Most likely drunks The room looks so much bigger in pics but reality it s small Breakfast is way too poor for a 5 star hotel U can t drive to this hotel due to the worst traffic ever in that area sure will never return to this hotel , The location only 
490371,TownHouse Galleria, No negative comments All great , Location just perfect literally 1 minute walk to Duomo and the Galleria and so unusual but nice to have our room looking inside the Galleria Staff were great so friendly and welcoming on arrival and departure We were also doing our wedding pre nuptial photo shoot in the area and took a few shots inside the hotel lobby which really look good Bed so comfortable and great bathroom toiletries Loved this hotel and cannot wait to stay here again 
490372,TownHouse Galleria, No hot dishes for the breakfast , Location of dining room is great with an excellent view to the Galleria Room is of a good size Very polite personnel 
490373,TownHouse Galleria, Everything except the location service was awful some things were working and somethings werent working eg Wifi sockets some worked and some were broken the air conditioner was broken so i had to request a fan To be honest it felt more like a 2 star hotel than 5 star my recommendation is for you not to make the same mistake there are many other hotels around cheaper and better , Only the location 
490374,TownHouse Galleria, Nothing was a class act from start to finish, Wonderful hotel oozing with style Fabulous location and super friendly staff Traveled to Milan for a concert but will defiantly return because the hotel is a gem 
490375,TownHouse Galleria, Bathroom washbasin is not working properly and Internet is not working too food is very bad quality ordered pizza nobody eat it ordered waffles and hot chocolate it was also very bad, Nothing
490376,TownHouse Galleria,No Negative, Location is great Room is of decent size and comfortable However it s notable that the amenities are getting a bit old temperature of shower is inconsistent or hard to control power points in the room are coming off But all in all I enjoyed my stay here There s only a small bar cafe in this hotel but the staff are amazingly friendly and professional Love the wine and food here even though choices are limited 
490377,TownHouse Galleria,No Negative, The staff were extremely courteous and professional always thinking ahead to help with our stay and any plans for travel within Milan A junior suite which was definitely A Room With A View and what a view it was too 
490378,TownHouse Galleria, Deluxe room very small Upon arrival the room was very hot it took hours to have it cooled Safe out of order Impractical interior wardrobes Very simple walk in shower not draining, Location and Concierge
490379,TownHouse Galleria, Slight lack of attention to detail in the room Stain on curtain few marks on walls shower knobs were all loose , The view from the room was great and the room itself was very large The location of the hotel was perfect and it had a lovely bar with great waiting staff 
490380,TownHouse Galleria, We took a room with a balcony and was far from the elevator its was room no 504 and the mosquitos and spider from the trees outside, Near to everything 
490381,TownHouse Galleria, The entrance of the hotel does not indicate at all that you are entering into a 5 star hotel and their lobby is just too small for a 5 star hotel We were given an upgrade which did not look at all like an upgrade and we were shifted to a partner hotel on the same building which honestly didnt feel like a 5 star hotel it honestly felt like a downgrade After going back home i reallized that they have blocked some amount from my credit card even thought the room was prepaid in full and we havent billed anything to the room during our stay , They have an excellent location in the heart of milans main attractions
490382,TownHouse Galleria, Our room was along a very long corridor there must have been rooms closer than ours we are older people The restaurant though great for breakfast was not supposed to be open for dinner The staff kindly let us order from the room service menu which was excellent , Being in the middle of Milano was bliss Just 100 m to almost everything we wanted to see A glamorous place to stay and from the restaurant a view of the passing parade in the Galleria Great fun Staff most helpful and obliging 
490383,TownHouse Galleria, Restaurant next door has no concern for their potential guest by disposing of their bottles in the bottle bank after midnight every night , Beds were super comfy 
490384,TownHouse Galleria, We had to move rooms as there was a hole in the ceiling and we got bitten by mosquitos The hotel moved us to a better room though Very expensive breakfast for basics would avoid , Location staff galleria view
490385,TownHouse Galleria, The suite was really bad there is no air condition and very noisy place the rooms are really small the staff were ok and the rates were bad compare to really small suites,No Positive
490386,TownHouse Galleria,No Negative, The staff are exceptional and their service perfectly matches the sublime setting of this hotel The decor is truly stylish and very comfortably luxurious The large space of the rooms is most unusual in Italy The food and beverage offering and service is outstanding and we will definitely return 
490387,TownHouse Galleria, WiFi speed wasn t that good but for a free Wi Fi that is fine , Amazing Hotel Nice location 8 10 The staff us quite nice 8 10 Amazing Breakfast 10 10 David the concierge is so helpful 10 10 The SpA is so refreshing and with 50 60 Discount has a fair price 9 10 Value for Money 10 10 Over all 9 10
490388,TownHouse Galleria,No Negative, Location was superb right in the heart of the shopping district and restaurants The staff was very friendly and helpful Thank you Tiziana for your help 
490389,TownHouse Galleria, Looks and feel like a great hotel but really it is not so good Room was small a lot of noise hotel is under construction lobby was small , BEST LOCATION 
490390,TownHouse Galleria, Its a long list from having to take several list to get to my room walk across several floors etc The room was court yard facing and all night the sound of bottles being thrown in to Bins kept me awake The phone in the room did not work so ordering anything like the iron or the ironing board or complaining about the such things as the shower being broken the electric plug broken plus the remote control of the TV was a major trip to reception and back Even then they forgot to bring the iron and the ironing board In the evening after a long day I attended the bar for a quiet coffee to be disturbed by the Chefs shouting and joking profanities at each other in the morning after having paid for breakfast upfront the waiters serving me managed to get the cold bread to me straight away forgot about the Tea got my order of fried eggs sunny side up totally wrong etc etc too tiered to complain I checked out of the hotel to be told that I owed 16 Euros for the Eggs which I refused to pay On the way out I entered the lift with a member of staff who knowing I was going down a floor to the exit kindly pressed the top floors and took me for a nice ride up and down the hotel he was embarrassed after realising what he had done Over all stay abysmal staff at Reception excellent the rest Massive training required attention to detail and so forth Not worth the money ps this is a short report of my one night stay, location Concierge and front desk staff
490391,TownHouse Galleria, Charged 5 euro for small jug of milk for coffee as it is not supplied in the room, Fantastic Chic hotel in amazing location room overlooking the Galleria very attentive staff
490392,TownHouse Galleria, The breakfast was awful a few insipid rolls and croissants and indifferent coffee Really surprising given a seven star hotel , the beds were fantastic things were clean the staff were solicitous I had to change rooms because of building noise and I was generously treated to an executive room overlooking the Galleria
490393,TownHouse Galleria, Getting to your room might be tricky with all the corridors floors and lifts, Location is excellent staff are extremely helpful and accommodate any request Special thanks to the manager Amani who is really nice and she finds way to make your stay a memorable experience
490394,TownHouse Galleria, the room was too small for the bed size the wardrobe opened against the bed the oversized drapes dangerous hanging on the floor around the base of the steps as was the bed linen i tripped a couple of times so had to wrap the drapes up onto the steps not a good look it was a single size room over filled and totally overdecorated Having to leave and re enter via an ally with cars parked was not my idea of of a fine hotel No bed side lights for reading one ceiling light on one side none on the other You need a more experienced Decorator Less is More , The staff were more than helpfull they were trying to make up i am sure for the Hotels shortcomings the rabbit warren type passage ways to the rooms was rediculas I wish you luck with it in the future The name is misleading in the current economic climate tell it how it is 
490395,TownHouse Galleria, Elevator got stuck once and looked a bit out of shape , Very nice Staff did their best to make us feel at home They took also the time to find us a nice place for dinner with a vegetarian option Super location at a few steps from La Scala
490396,TownHouse Galleria, I asked for a non smoking room with a bath and the room they have was reeking with cigarette smoke and they did not have a better alternatively This is evidently a smoking room as all my clothes smell on my return home Decent restaurants are few and far between in this area you need to hunt and service is appalling They are quick to sell you stuff but if anything is wrong after they won t deal with you efficiently , Location fabulous and nice to have a balcony overlooking the mall Staff Friendly and nice and mostly helpful 
490397,TownHouse Galleria, lack of facilities heating uncontrollable so way too hot Only way to cool was opening windows making unbearably noisy , location is great but plenty of better alternatives within 300 mtrs radius Staff very helpful and friendly
490398,TownHouse Galleria, Noisy the sound from the galleria the doors slamming work in the hotel We had to call the reception 2 days in a raw to ask for the cleaning of the room which was still not done at noon Too expansive wouldn t rate it 5 stars, Well situated comfortable bed
490399,TownHouse Galleria, The rooms not like what you see on Booking com They are renovating the building and their is a lot of noise you couldn t sleep well You can hear every step and conversation out in the Isle The large bed was two single beds putting together which could hurt your back, The location of the hotel and the staff they are friendly and polite Spacious rooms
490400,TownHouse Galleria, We were much surprised of the conditions in the room were really poor The walls were really dirty with a lot of scratches on it There was a renovation going on and all the noise was in our room for a nightly price like this hotel it was very unpleasant I ve sent an email to the hotel before my arrival for reservations to restaurants with no any response and when I arrived and asked if they received my email no one answered so I had to repeat my request There was a coffee machine in our room but no capsules we asked for them but no one brought any For a price as highly as this hotel our stay was not really satisfying Won t stay here again , The one good thing besides the view of the hotel is the helpful and positive staff 
490401,TownHouse Galleria, Room facility Noise because of poor insolation Poor privacy in the room no signes for people occupying the room Old sanitary of the building, Location Security
490402,TownHouse Galleria, the hotel and the rooms feel cramped and this maybe because of the layout of the building Also it would be benefit from lit candles , The location is superb the staff were happy friendly accommodating and very welcoming The hotel is clean the d cor is lovely and the food is great 
490403,TownHouse Galleria, They should inform us about the major work going on , The hotel was good location is best However they have major work to up grade the hotel So there is a lot of work also the entrance of the hotel is too small if you have a car it will so hard 
490404,TownHouse Galleria, The roof of our bathroom leaked and dripped all night I reported this in the morning as soon as we got up It was only when we checked out that they said we could have a free breakfast which was too late they refused to give us a discount for the wet through bathroom floor and dripping all night The manageress could not be found anywhere The staircase which we took rather than the very hot glass lift was filthy and looked as though it hadn t been hovered for days I eventually received an email saying they would give us an upgrade if we used them again Not good enough for a supposedly 5 hotel , Fabulous location Appreciated the free access to the Leonardo Da Vinci exhibition and the coffee on arrival
490405,TownHouse Galleria, No Entrance to the Hotel no reception no experience nothing nothing , Location but there are many hotels in the same area this hotel should not be recommended to any one of your elite clients
