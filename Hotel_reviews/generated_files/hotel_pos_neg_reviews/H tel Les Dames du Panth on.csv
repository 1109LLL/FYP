81473,H tel Les Dames du Panth on,No Negative, This gorgeous little hotel is situated right next to the Pantheon but feels like a quiet respite from the busy streets of Paris From the moment you step in the door you can tell that much care has been taken in decorating and furnishing this hotel There are so many lovely touches throughout the common areas and the guest rooms From the beamed ceilings to the rotary phones and other decor our rooms were beautiful and charming The bathrooms are very modern super clean and comfortable The bed was wonderful And we appreciated the air conditioning Breakfast served in the stone walled cellar was delightful Truly the best scrambled eggs I have ever had The hotel backs up to a quiet neighborhood with a number of restaurants cafes and patisseries that we really enjoyed Last but not least the staff at reception and throughout the hotel were so gracious and friendly We look forward to returning to the Hotel Les Dames du Pantheon 
81474,H tel Les Dames du Panth on, I got room 1 which is literally by the bar on the ground floor and with room window on the street So obviously noisy and a bit odd Avoid , Splendid location 
81475,H tel Les Dames du Panth on, I think it would be a good idea to have breakfast as part of the accommodation with a couple tables and chairs outside the hotel just because it is such a perfect location , The location was amazing The staff were welcoming had no difficulty with English and the staff went above and beyond to make sure we had everything and anything we needed 
81476,H tel Les Dames du Panth on, Small rooms as usual in Paris , Awesomely located you can see the Pantheon form your window Rooms not that big but incredible decoration will repeat if we have the chance 
81477,H tel Les Dames du Panth on, The hotel was rather expensive and breakfast was not included in the price They said afterwards that the breakfast costs 18 Euros per person There was an extra charge for the city tax Although it claimed to be 4 star it did not have facilities like sauna or gym The safety box was very small and you cannot put your laptop in it ,No Positive
81478,H tel Les Dames du Panth on, I didn t try breakfast so can t comment , Great location very easy to get to from airport Lots of little restaurants nearby Pantheon just opposite Lovely 
81479,H tel Les Dames du Panth on, I think there must be a kettle in the room so a guest can make himself a cup of tea or coffee I was very surprised that we didn t have it considering the fact that this is four star hotel , The staff was very friendly and helpful The room is beautiful and clean the location is perfect 
81480,H tel Les Dames du Panth on, Our cab ride to the airport left us at the wrong terminal at considerable inconvenience , Small comfortable hotel near the Pantheon but not near most Left Bank sites
81481,H tel Les Dames du Panth on, Room was very small and view onto a back courtyard and seemed expensive for what it was , Great location near the Pantheon and close to Luxembourg fast RER tube line to and from Gare du Nord Great breakfast 
81482,H tel Les Dames du Panth on, Considering the price the room and toilet was small the wifi is slow and definitely the breakfast needs improving , Good location and staff are friendly and helpful they even let us leave our luggage for a few days
81483,H tel Les Dames du Panth on, I found my room was very poorly distributed in terms of space It becomes very uncomfortable A door impossible to open and which closes automatically behind you divides the bedroom from the entrance and bathroom toilet area You have to cope with that door several times a day Bathroom and toilet are very oppressive Breakfast is 18 and certainly not worth it Apart from these two points I d say this is a nice hotel , This hotel couldn t be better placed The Panth on is so close you get the feeling you can touch it Charming views 
81484,H tel Les Dames du Panth on, Staff was less helpful than I have encountered in other Parisian hotels We didn t ask for help though and tend to keep to ourselves so it may be different if you approach them more Even leaving at 5 AM there was no offer to help us with airport transportation The bar set up is weird Not sure how you d even get a drink but it didn t matter because so many things were nearby The pillows were beyond flat this is probably my only real complaint and one night the street was extremely noisy con of a popular area , Location to RER notre dame and cafes The view was great of the Pantheon Luxe decor in a great way All the wall paper was fabric and really made the space romantic and unique The hotel was very clean and you can tell they take care of the space Room size was adequate it is Europe Also they really maximized space with a different layout Good wi fi Overall this was a solid hotel choice with nice amenities and location It definitely has more of a boutique feel than other hotels we ve stayed 
81485,H tel Les Dames du Panth on,No Negative, The location of the property was excellent just a short walk from Luxembourg train station with direct links to the airport and walking distance to the major attractions

81488,H tel Les Dames du Panth on, What wasn t tonice was the fact that the bed wasn t made in the same lovely way as on our arrival , The styling of the hotel and especially our room is very tasteful 
81489,H tel Les Dames du Panth on, Price is very high for what you get in this hotel You can get similar facilities and even similar room size which was not exceptional in much cheaper hotels in the area , The location was great especially since I had a room with a view over the pantheon Room size what decent 
81490,H tel Les Dames du Panth on, the wifi was not the best connection, fresh squeezed orange juice Croissants and bread both excellent AND you offer eggs Your coffee was also very good
81491,H tel Les Dames du Panth on,No Negative, We loved loved loved this hotel Last night of our three week road trip Having driven Madrid Granada Valencia and Barcelona This was our favourite city hotel As we booked on the day we received a fantastic discount so it was exceptional value for money The staff were really helpful in suggesting where to visit even when we decided to go out at midnight for pancakes
