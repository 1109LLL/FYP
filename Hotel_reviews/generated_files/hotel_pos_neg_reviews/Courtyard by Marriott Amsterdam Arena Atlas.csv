346059,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Nothing, The bed was very comfortable the room in general was excellent Nice clean bathroom basic toiletries available Nice staff too I can t complain 
346060,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Room sold as 3 person room but a supplementary bed had to be installed after we arrived Breakfast is really expensive at 21 euros Quality of breakfast was OK but not worth 21 euros , Were there for the U2 concert Location is excellent 5 minutes walking distance to the Arena 
346061,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Check in said from 15 00 We arrived at 15 30 to be told room would be at least 1 hour Got a room after over an hours wait which was a twin when we had booked a double Eventually we got a double room after having to complain at reception Very poor as we wanted to get ready quick and go out to a concert at the Arena , Great location for Arena 
346062,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, We found that the bar area the light fixtures had spider webs hanging from them and full of dust We were disappointed one evening as we came down for dinner and we were told that we could only eat in the bar area and a very limited tapa menu Like 5 items When we asked why we were told that they just had a bus full of people and that they were not serving any other guests in the hotel dinning room My husband and myself were upset as we are guests in this establishment The hotel should have plan to have food servings for there other guests in the dinning room or perhaps letting guests know in the morning that there would be no dining available and we could have made other plans to eat downtown in Amsterdam This is very disappointing that it happen courtyard Marriott , The staff were amazing and very helpful with any questions we had Hotel is close to metro bus and train So very easy to come from airport to hotel The room were clean and quiet and bed was very comfortable The food in the dinning room was very good and service was great 
346063,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, All the rest quite a disaster pillow with stains in the room No minibar for a Euro 336 rate per night that came as a surprise No room service No possibility to purchase any food in the late evening rather inconvenient for somebody staying there to attend a concert at the Arena , Location perfect to attend events at the Amsterdam Arena 
346064,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, It was totally overpriced We paid the price for a 5 star hotel and didn t get much for that I guess it was because we booked one of the last two rooms available and because there was a concert at the same time It also seemed that it hadn t been cleaned properly A lot of hair that was not mine was still lying around in the bathroom , Location for what we needed go to a concert at Amsterdam Arena was perfect It is 10 mins walking distance to there You could also take a subway from there to get into town The rooms are nice some amenities are available coffee for the morning hair dryer and ironing board 
346065,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, no parking ask for money change split 50 Euro to small amount to pay for parking fee reception said no ask me to check with restaurant also no ask for later check out said no,No Positive
346066,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Got a bit lost coming out of Bijlmer Arena Station There can be better signage orientation , The location was great and the rooms were of decent size I applaud their cleanliness and their friendly service 
346067,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, They were not really set up for the team evening meal which was very slow , Extremely attentive and helpful staff Relaxed and friendly atmosphere in the bar and restaurant Good quality food Easy to get to from the airport Bar server Robin was excellent 
346068,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, i wish it will be possible to really check in earlier , was my second time staying there and room was very comfortable and really enjoyed me stay will definately come back 
346069,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Nothing at all , The location It was in a quiet area away from all the fuzz of the center however sooo close to the metro that takes you to the center in 10 min and to the Centraal station in 13 min Loved the staff who were so friendly the rooms were better than expected and the bathroom so clean Breakfast was delicious also loved it all 
346070,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, I will need to be very picky to find anything that i didn t like everything was great , Very fast service at the front desk Check in took literally a minute as well as the check out Very important for me when i do a weekend trip Every minute matters 
346071,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Typical chain hotel professional but not much homely character, Visiting for concert at Amsterdam Arena very convenient for that especially short walk back at the end but meant escalated prices for this stay If just visiting the city then would go for more central hotel 
346072,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Kindly give size bed was made up with two singles and had a slight slope from the middle to the edge of the bed The edges of the mattress was very soft so lying or sitting on the edge of the bed was a little difficult ,No Positive
346073,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, taking money from account as a hold now overdrawn still hasnt gone back in left with no money breakfast was too expensive 21 euro for small buffet bit of bacon toast fruit,No Positive

346075,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, We were surprised to see bed n breakfast like service in such a big hotel brand and costly too There was no room service Even we need to go and buy water bottle also from Reception area At least a vending machine would have given the feel of descent bed n breakfast hotel but they were shamelessly selling the water bottles also from Reception Breakfast was also too simple Not worth spending so much money for just a brand Similarly Clean bed n breakfast would be available at fraction of cost ,No Positive
346076,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, The location is really far from city center For my needs it was fine but if you wish to visit the heart of Amsterdam I would suggest a different hotel , The hotel was nice and clean The staff was superior I stay at a lot of hotels and this staff treated everyone like a VIP 
346077,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Expensive restaurant undisclosed 100 fee refundable needed at check in This is not stated anywhere on any part of the booking process or confirmation , Comfortable beds lovely showers bathroom facilities very friendly staff

346079,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Nothing that we noticed We thoroughly enjoyed our stay , Great location for Ajax and Zippodome Stadiums we were at the latter for a concert Hotel was modern and of a great design especially the Nordic restaurant We dined at the restaurant and thought it was fantastic including the wine selection The room we had was spacious clean and the bathroom was great We thought it was great value for money The staff were all friendly 
346080,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Breakfast not included in the room rate only one and pricey restaurant on site so limited dining options , Proximity to communication hub in just few minutes of walk you can reach bus metro rail station which allow relatively quick and direct link to heart of AMS metro and Schiphol airport bus Ahhh for fitness nerds Cross fit centre is just behind the corner 
346081,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, There is no pedestrian way from pedesterian way of the street to the hotel We use the same way as car But this is very minor, Close to train station Modern room Clean Nice staff Will recommend to everyone
346082,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, The staff was almost rude The lady at the check in looked like she did not even believe we had reservations there and was very snobbish Usually in other hotels they provide you with public transportation info even city maps and ask if you want to know about the attractions Nothing like that here even got a sigh when asked how I could get to a specific place ,No Positive
346083,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas,No Negative, Next to the station easy access to Central and airport 15mins by train Not as busy and touristy as the central areas seems like a business district Nice and clean rooms
346084,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, For us nothing could have been better , This hotel was perfect for a weekend stay in Amsterdam lovely room very comfortable bed spotlessly clean great bar and very helpful staff 
346085,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, the hotel is not located in the centre of city but it is really convenient to take the metro and train to any places you want to go Hotel does not have any ATM machines I need to go to train station if I need to use cash , room is large and clean staffs are really nice and warm 
346086,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, The Hotel is at a nice location near to train station Rooms are neat and clean Staff is good and helpful The hotel has to provide some amenities specially for kids in the room so they will feel good for the entire vacation Tea bags and coffee should be provided on daily basis ,No Positive

346088,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Breakfast in the hotel is a little expensive , Location is very close to amsterdam metro which is safe affordable and clean really easy to get to all city attractions 
346089,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Bathroom amenities prefer if toothbrush and shaver provided , Quiet area less than 5 minutes walk to Arena Station Not so hard to find food near Arena station 
346090,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Biggest discomfort was the extremely dry air in the room Breakfast was ok but for that price not stunning Weak water power in the shower I could understand this to save water but the amount spilled when flushing the toilet was a bit contradictory to this philosophy , We liked the fact although it was located way outside the center it was pretty easy to go downtown with the metro that close and that frequent Friendly service at the reception breakfast It was nice to have tea possibilities in the room Pretty good wifi 
346091,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, The location to the city centre is quite far 20 mins on the train further than I d appreciated which is my own fault for not researching better This hotel is really intended for visitors to the Arena rather than the city itself Mostly a problem for getting there at night either from the airport we landed late or from the city after a night out we ended up taking taxis 2 3 times over the long weekend which adds up as a hidden cost EUR 20 50 per ride with and without Uber , Extremely comfy bed quiet and clean rooms hotel is a 2 3 min walk to the nearest train station with direct link to the centre Breakfast dinner in the restaurant were great 
346092,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, If you are going to charge to eat breakfast at the restaurant in the hotel you should at least provide a decent discount for the hotel guests We only ate dinner at the oa one time It wasn t bad but not worth the price It would have been nice to have the option to eat breakfast for a decent price for two people and or a family Or even a complementary coffee per adult would have been nice The parking was overpriced also , Convenient location clean room comfortable bed 
346093,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Nothing to complain about , The location of the hotel is more than excellent Close to train and metro station 13 minutes train ride to the Schiphol airport Several metro stations away from the city centre Very close to Amsterdam Arena and Ziggo Dome 
346094,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, There was no room service The drain in our room stunk so we had to be moved which was annoying but they moved us without any questions The view from the windows is uninspiring , The beds were confortable and the staff were nice Good transport links close by 
346095,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas,No Negative, It was all very nice and perfectly located for our needs which was a visit to the arena The food was really fantastic good options nice friendly staff an the breakfast was perfect 
346096,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Officious staff who lacked warmth Hotel is as described in the business district this much is true but this does not prepare you for how isolated it feels from the rest of civilisation It is not somewhere I would recommend staying unless for work purposes , Convenient to train station
346097,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas,No Negative, Close to the metro station There is direct metro line from railway station There are food stores in 5 10 minutes of walk from the hotel Fridge and kettle in the room clean and big shower 
346098,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Having to ask for more coffee creamers and hot chocolate sachets These should be fully stocked every morning by housekeeping , The coffee machine at breakfast had a good choice of coffees to choose from 
346099,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Obviously staying in the centre of Amsterdam would of been perfect Although because the trains were so frequent it wasn t actually a problem at all considering it only took 12 15 mins on the train anyway , The decor of the hotel was amazing so clean and immaculate and a spacious room Such good value for money 
346100,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Breakfast 20 is too expensive given that the varieties were limited for breakfast option , By far the best hotel I lived throughout my Europe trip Staff are FANTASTIC and helpful friendly manner and make you felt home room was spacious and clean bed was comfortable 
346101,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, There should be more english movie channels it was all about news and some other languages for entertainment , i was there for the match and the location was perfect just beside the Stadium and the Arena Station

346103,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas,No Negative, The breakfast was wonderful and so were the staff they were very friendly and engaging with my 2 yr old son They even had a little play area in outside the restaurant for the kids to play with The rooms were very clean and comfortable It was close the the train station about a 5 min walk There is a small convenience store by the station if you need snacks It was a bit outside of town but for the price it was perfect 
346104,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, You need to pay at check 50 deposit per night And there is no information about in the whole reservation Plus the get from it city tax so you get back around 44 at checking out , Very close to metro station clean rooms 
346105,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Breakfast are quite expensive Never told us about the tax city rate until we checked out , Beds were so comfortable Location was great Staff were really friendly 
346106,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, reception team was so slowly and they charged me extra money by wrong and spent 30 min to getting things back as it should be i think the guy was under training or new because once the supervisor come every thing was ok except the time we spent, clean quite bed was comfortable nice bathroom location was so close from the metro train bus station just a very close walking distance
346107,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, 1 Entrence of the hotel not clean Ashtrays were full when i checked in still full when i went for a walk after 2 hours and still not clean in the evening when i came back to the hotel Same in the p m when i checked out at midday NOT CLEAN WHY The same applied to the silver baskets on the table Shame that that is not cleaned all the time 2 Entrence of the hotel with the swinging doors was also not clean I know it is autumn and leaves are blowing all the time but it does not take a lot of effort to clean this 3 I have purchased from the drinks and quick food products near the bar in the evening and was only asked if i want to charge it to the hotel room bill I declined and said i want to pay in cash I was never asked if i want a receipt for the good i purchased Strange , Quick check in and check out Good 
346108,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, understaff in the restaurant during busy lunch time only saw one man did everything by himself from greeting the customers and tried to clean the table upon arrival the receptionist named Olaf had held a sum of money around 600 euro upon checked out I was served by a different staff she charged me the damage of around 450 euro and I was stupid enough not making sure they have released the money they ve held upon check in I have stayed in many hotels I never had this type of problem The last time I checked my bank account on 4 November 2016 the hotel still hold my money of 549 76 Olaf gave us rubbish room number 205 that is situated right next door to the 24 hour gym so everytime someone using the facilities and slam the door it made my mum jumped and such a pity because we liked the room , clean room friendly staff

346110,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Our bedroom hasn t been done during our stay Kind of disappointed for the price , Good hotel nice bedroom and perfect location if you need to go to Amsterdam Arena for the AMF for example but not really good if you want to be close to the center The lady at the check in was really nice 
346111,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, tout, It say s parking once I arrived they didn t have any They didn t want to negociate anything about the price because the next carpark cost us 20 eur per day So plus 60eur We requested one double bed and not 2 single ones The only word that the lady at the recrption could say was I know i know unfortunately there is nothing we can do Soooory Belgrade Mariott hotel is the reason why I went to the one in Amsterdam but this one is really poor and a danger for the reputation of other hotels in that chain 
346112,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, 50 euro per night was blocked in our credit card which was a little bit surprising Water pressure in the shower was low , We have arived 3 hours before check in time and hotel s staff was friendly and welcome Big advantage ironing facilities in the room Easy access to Ziggo Dome and train station it will take 20 minutes to get by train to the central station 
346113,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, The overall quality of services and accomondations do not correspond with the price In addition there is a gap between what how things are being advertised on booking com and the reality To name a few disappointments frontdesk receiption is not a 4 stars standard some facilities inside the bathroom are broken insufficient tolietary stuff in the bathroom smaller size of the room than being advertised on the website higher charge of the breakfast in reality than being advertised on the website etc , The interior deco is fairly modern and spacious building 
346114,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Its 15 minutes by train from central station So not at city centre or near key attractions but is very near to metro station , We got to stay in a premium hotel at fairly raesonable price Hence the comfort and cleanliness were excellent

346133,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, its not that i didnt like it just think you should be informed at booking that either a credit card is required or 50 euros cash for my 1 night stay for incidentals it was no problem to us but could be for some one on a tight budget, faultless check in was quick and smooth room was big and spotlessly clean i would stay again
346134,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, Generally speaking expensive hotel for its facilities, Beds were very good about 15 minutes away from the city center with metro but in good location with good access to metro and train well decorated and clean room

346144,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, there were no bathrobes and sleepers as usually in Marriott the breakfast was poor the shower was quite cold for me max 38 degrees with no possibility to adjust I think it is the worst Marriott I ve stayed so far , the hotel is close to the metro station the room was ok there was tee and coffee making facilities
346145,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, The location is a little outside of Amsterdam central but it is close to businesses as well as direct train access to the city as well as other cities Perfect for business travellers , The friendly staff allowed an early check in which allowed me to take my business calls from te room The facilities as well as comfort were all up to scratch and I had a very enjoyable stay there 
346146,Courtyard by Marriott Amsterdam Arena Atlas, No full room service available As a lone traveler if you want to eat in the room you need to go to the restaurant order your food wait and then carry it up to your room on a tray which proved tricky when trying to negotiate the lift and open and close doors on your way back , Location was perfect for my needs The staff are very professional friendly and helpful The rooms and facilities are very modern clean and well equipped
