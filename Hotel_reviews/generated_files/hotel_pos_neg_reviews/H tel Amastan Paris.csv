157644,H tel Amastan Paris, The wifi does time out and you have to re register a lot Would be better if you can take the key out with you instead of handing it back to reception every time you go out , The staff are exceptionally great Even when I asked them a question about transport Amsterdam to Paris they went out of their way to find out the correct information Room was really big and luxurious Bathroom was beautiful and bed was comfortable If I ever come to Amsterdam again this place will be home

157646,H tel Amastan Paris, I wish I stayed longer , What a wonderful hotel The owner and staff were incredibly welcoming and made our stay such a pleasure I m told they try to host a special event at the bar each week While we visited there was a whiskey tasting session each night for that week we learned a lot about whiskey and made some friends along the way it was such a memorable experience one we ll never forget The rooms themselves are cleverly designed and made excellent use of space while keeping a sense of minimalism Highly recommended
