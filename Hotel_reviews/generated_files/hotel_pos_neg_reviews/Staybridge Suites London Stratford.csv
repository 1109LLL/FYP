31758,Staybridge Suites London Stratford, The buffet breakfast was fine but the hot food wasn t always replaced quick enough so you were stood with a plate waiting for more hash browns or bacon to come out Just a minor moan though , Having the facility of the kitchenette was great Spacious room and bathroom Toileteries were also very good as decent sizes Such a good location for Hammers new home 
31759,Staybridge Suites London Stratford, nothing really, The rooms and the bed were very comfortable with good views of surrounding area Right in the middle of the Westfield center but rooms were quiet Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice staff were very pleasant and helpful I would certainly stay again

31766,Staybridge Suites London Stratford, They would not give us a refund when we wanted to cancel so we stayed anyway It was very far away from the Airport we traveled on the subway that was not good for families or anyone with luggage as there were not elevators available at the transfer station and was hard to find because it was in a mall The remote for the tv would not work The pillows felt like foam chunks the bed was hard , The shower was great Rain shower and plenty of room The breakfast was okay The location although initially hard to find was nice to walk out on the mall The breakfast was good The view was great of the city

31780,Staybridge Suites London Stratford, There is no sheltered lobby for taxi to drop off guest and luggage It was raining when we left and we were all wet from having to walk about 60m to the main road to meet our airport transfer van There is also an uncovered gap between hotel lobby and the mall same problem of getting wet running across to the mall , The location is the best feature so convenient The kitchenette comes in handy although I hardly used it as they provided a lovely hot breakfast daily great selection at breakfast and free coffee tea all day

31784,Staybridge Suites London Stratford, The TV channels are some times not clear making it uninteresting to watch , Nice view helpful and friendly staff Breakfast was always great and varied Location makes it easier to shop

31787,Staybridge Suites London Stratford, We were in a disabled room which was OK but I didn t like not having anywhere to put my toiletries when I was in the shower and had to balance them on the chair , It couldn t have been closer to the venue 
31788,Staybridge Suites London Stratford, The view will be so much better once Stratford stops being a building site , The Bed was really comfortable and room extremely quiet Breakfast was superb and loved the roof terrace which has great views over London and the Olympic park Incredibly convenient 5min walk from the Olympic pool and above the Stratford shopping centre great for shopping 
31789,Staybridge Suites London Stratford, While the included breakfast was OK I have had more choice at places like Hilton or Premier Inn Also a slightly haphazard layout , Room extremely spacious and comfortable The kitchenette was well equipped and just right for preparing light meals Bathroom facilities were also very good with an excellent shower with no water pressure issues that sometimes happens in big hotels Bedroom area very comfortable as well
31790,Staybridge Suites London Stratford, I think new buildings have gone up between the Staybridge and the stadiums since the website was last updated so whilst you can technically see them parts of them the view isn t as clear as hoped imagined Paying a bit more for a deluxe to see the stadiums was therefore slightly disappointing , Relaxed atmosphere Staff polite Comfy room Quiet at night Very close to stadiums DLR and shopping centre 
31791,Staybridge Suites London Stratford, Chaotic check in process Husband arrived before me and was not allowed access to room as booking was in my name although he had the payment card I had to show my face at reception to validate the booking Some guests got Welcome packs but we did not Not sure why Also awful selection of food available once breakfast is over We returned from O2 after midnight to find every choice required the microwave No sandwiches etc Just microwave pizza and panini , Lovely suite Well equipped Comfortable and quiet yet with all the buzz of Westfield below Cheap parking for London Would recommend Efficient air conditioning made the apartment very comfortable on a very hot weekend We will definitely use again Had to ask for a room with a view rather than look at the air conditioning units for the retail park but once moved we could see for miles 
31792,Staybridge Suites London Stratford, The breakfast buffet needs improvement The hot food isn t hot Breakfast at the Holiday Inn last November was superb Staybridge could learn from their sister hotel , Three social evenings 
31793,Staybridge Suites London Stratford, There was not anything to complain about really The only thing was slightly annoying was the fact the fire alarm went off at 12pm so of course not many people was happy but it can t be helped these things happen sadly It was nice they apologised straight away with a letter at the door when we walked out the door first thing in the morning I would of liked to see a more selection of hot foods as there was a lot of dry hot foods instead of mixed But other than that I can t fault it , First of all my friend and I arrived to check in however we came earlier than 3pm The staff were amazingly friendly and was able to help us with the check in and went out of their way to supply a room that was ready for us to go to I loved the rooms they were very clean and had a lovely view of London Also the breakfast in the morning had a variety of every food possible so spoilt for choice 
31794,Staybridge Suites London Stratford, Mattress very hard for my taste I couldn t work the Nespresso machine The temperature dial on the shower is lethal as its impossible to see how hot the water is There was a fire evacuation when I was there well handled by staff except for security issues on our return to our rooms which I raised with the Manager , Staff were great View and location great Breakfast more than adequate 
31795,Staybridge Suites London Stratford, The toiletries were sadly of rather low quality thus opted to buy my own and liquid soap would have been preferable and more hygienic than solid soap Would have been great to have some cooking oil and a complementary bottle of water in the room upon arrival , Check in and overall reception upon arrival was superb From Sal ground floor concierge to Giulia a lovely receptionist who is an absolute star extremely friendly yet very professional and nothing was too much trouble She was so patient attentive and caring What a great example of excellent customer service Giulia set the bar very high indeed All the staff were in fact very accommodating such as Stephan and it made my stay so much more enjoyable I m also grateful for the advice given by a French male receptionist don t recall his name upon check out who suggested that I d take a fast train directly to St Pancras Int l rather than hauling my heavy suitcase around the tube I hopped on the Southeastern train that took me directly to St Pancras in 6 minutes Studio itself was comfortable clean and most importantly quiet Fantastic shower and water pressure I also really appreciated having an onsite gym and laundry room All in all felt like home Very happy so will most definitely return Many thanks to the whole establishment
