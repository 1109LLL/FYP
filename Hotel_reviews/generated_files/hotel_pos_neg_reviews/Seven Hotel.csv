99327,Seven Hotel, The paint work on skirting boards was peeling off a little and room was a little on the small side other than that it was great , Rooms were very stylish bed was so comfortable and the shower was incredible I d go again just to have a shower Breakfast had a good variety in a lovely boutique room and staff were very helpful and nice 
99328,Seven Hotel, The bathroom was with a see through glass So If you are not staying with a boyfriend girlfriend is just too embarrassing I had to ask my friend to go out while taking shower , Interior 
99329,Seven Hotel, Breakfast was not worth 21 Euros room downstairs low choice bad coffee stuff showed up after 20 minutes Rude and unfriendly manager She did not take my problems with the room serious Really not what you expect from a 4 star hotel , Nice star decoration in the room that was the only positive thing

99331,Seven Hotel, No complaints, Super comfy bed Small room nut you could slide luggage under bed Eould definitely stay here again Definitely get a navigo public trans pass if you stay here You can ride bus tram metro all over the city from this hotel Great neighborhood shopping area close by 
99332,Seven Hotel, The lighting is a bit odd wish the room had the option of better lighting , Staff were extremeley helpful and nice Hotel is clean and room although a bit strange was very comfortable 
99333,Seven Hotel, It was noisy inside the room at night I could hear water running through pipes all the time The design makes it look a bit less clean that what it may be there is no enough lighting in the room I understand it s part of the design but you should have the option to have full light whenever needed , Location is not bad price is good staff are helpful
