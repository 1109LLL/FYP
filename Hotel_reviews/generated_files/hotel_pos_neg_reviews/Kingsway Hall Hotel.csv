229592,Kingsway Hall Hotel, No complaints, Love the area as so close to theatres and shopping staff very helpful have stayed 5 times and will not hesitate to book again next time i am in London Felt very safe for ladies travelling on their own Wonderful small spa area which was a bonus 
229593,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Didn t like hair dryer but perhaps I could have asked for a better one from reception, Comfort of the room Didn t eat in the hotel so can t comment 
229594,Kingsway Hall Hotel, I did not consider at 180 for one night without breakfast that this room was good value for money Small en suite Small T V Only 2 English Tea bags for two people not everyone drinks herbal tea Found it insulting to be asked if I would like to upgrade and pay even more for a bigger room because they know that the room I have booked is small and nothing special , Bed was comfortable room was reasonably quiet Good location for the Theatre but there are other Hotels in the area which I will look at next time 
229595,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Rather poor breakfast not very clean bathroom we were on the 2nd floor and could see only a high wall from our window badly isolated, Nice people working there very well located
229596,Kingsway Hall Hotel, We were on first floor so close to the street and noise from the bars across the road we re very loud The room and corridors are slightly dated but overall great for the money paid , It was clean good location and the staff were very friendly 
229597,Kingsway Hall Hotel, If your at the front of the hotel just be warned there is a bar opposite that s open til quite late and noisy then first thing in the morning we were woken by the rubbish being collected , Lovely hotel friendly staff and great room Great place to stay central to most attractions and the west end Tube station just a short walk away 
229598,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Room door very heavy had to push hard to open it Room key card rubbish mine stopped working by the second day the other took several attempts to open the door each time Hated the hotel facilities advertising strip running across the TV screen during every programme ruined watching tv for me The furniture in the bar area tired and worn not as good a visit this time around Very sparse teabags supplied in room even when more requested , Queen size bed 2 pillows each Concierge very helpful great for getting taxis Staff pleasant and helpful Good power shower thick large towels 
229599,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Hair dryer in room wasn t that great it could have been better and more powerful, The bed was comfy and the bathroom was clean I loved the molton brown products too 
229600,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Worst bed I ve ever tried to sleep in both too short and ridiculously hard Also dreadful location either side of two busy night clubs so all you hear all night is music and shouting Room was very dated Would not recommend , Useful handheld device for sightseeing 
229601,Kingsway Hall Hotel, My daughter booked an afternoon tea as a birthday treat for me The staff were cold with a poor attitude very unattentive which made us feel unwanted and under valued , Superb location and facilities
229602,Kingsway Hall Hotel, There was no fan in the bathroom so the mirror steamed up very quickly the bed was quite firm There was a a good choice of breakfast but the cooked side of it was not very appetising , The size of the room was very good the staff were very helpful polite 
229603,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Hot water supply not readily available had to wait a while and thought breakfast was too pricey 33 for a couple so we ate in a local sandwich bar with a simalor fry up for less then half Also having to leave a 50 deposit which I am told on checkout should be back in my account in a few days Why was this never had to do this in other hotels we have stayed in and you could tell we were both retirees ,No Positive

229605,Kingsway Hall Hotel, When booked additional nights charged we were told bedstead was included but it was not Extension at very high rates We stayed 12 nights, Staff room concierge
229606,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The price of breakfast which is NOT just a Kingsway Hall problem is excessive It is lucky that with local knowledge you can obtain an excellent breakfast at other establishments Carluccio s in the Covent Garden area The draconian measures used to control use of the mini bar again NOT just a Kingsway Hall problem whereby a charge is made for just MOVING a product is intimidating and also the prices are exceedingly excessive this is also the case in the bar where a double spirit and a bottle of Cider really should NOT cost over 19 , Excellent sized bed and very comfortable room with good facilities 
229607,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The breakfast wasn t very good The sausages weren t nice and the orange juice was watery , The staff were really welcoming and friendly The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable 
229608,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The hairdryer and lack of bathrobes Niggly I know but a better hairdryer and a dressing gown would be nice , A very quiet spacious room Molton Brown toiletries A real bonus in Central London Conveneient for Covent Garden and its restaurants and bars especially conveneient for the Opera House Oh and a great doorman helpful and friendly 
229609,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Dated bathroom poor shower narrow bath and annoying shower curtain, Very convenient for transport theatres and restaurants Staff lovely comfortable but small room
229610,Kingsway Hall Hotel, So expensive for what it was The room was very basic the TV was small and very poor not many freebies in the room just an expensive mini bar Certainly not worth 243 a night ,No Positive
229611,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Nothing, I stay at this hotel every time I go into London as service is good infact I haven t got a bad word to say about anything everything is just as it should be 
229612,Kingsway Hall Hotel, It was across the road from a gentleman s club so some rooms can hear the noise say they leave at 5 am , The staff were very welcoming and helpful Starbucks across the road with early opening The location was great and very close to theatres if you want to catch a show 
229613,Kingsway Hall Hotel,No Negative, Staff were very polite and helpful Hotel overall was first class absolutely spotless and very well presented Breakfast brilliant and restaurant staff friendly Would definitely go back
229614,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The bathroom was disappointing Much too small For the price of the hotel it should have been bigger We asked for an upgrade to a bigger bathroom we were ok to pay for it but were told they were all the same size Did not believe them , The bed was pretty good Location close to Covent Garden which is why we chose it 
229615,Kingsway Hall Hotel, I have jusrt said the evening dinner, breakfast was really good plenty of everything and really hot couldn t find fault The evening meal was a disappointment not an expansive menu and don t think it were value for money but service was good x
229616,Kingsway Hall Hotel, There was nothing we didn t like, The hotel was pleasing to the eye inside and out very pretty and clean the staff was very friendly and welcoming when we entered our room we were very pleased it was very clean and comfortable the hotel was very close to all amenities and we can not wait to stay there again
229617,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Only slight downside was the free wifi was really slow which may have been due to our room location Staff tried to help by giving us an option to change rooms to one with a better signal so all in all great staff , Only stayed one night but we were pleased with the facilities and location A bit expensive but typical of London prices The concierge Iggy was really helpful and knowledgeable as you d expect from a concierge but he went out of his way to be helpful with recommendations and was always courteous and calm even when we witnessed an impatient lady demanding attention 
229618,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Charged an extra 100 pounds for a 6pm checkout Bed was short 180 cm TV channels very limited no international news channels not sports channels Breakfast offerings if one does not like the traditional English ones beans sausage etc were limited, Excellent location Helpful and professional staff Room was comfortable overall Nice toiletries Molton brown 
229619,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Breakfast not include at the high cost of hotel If move item in the fridge even if only to see what it is charged for it 50 deposit taken at registration and only returned to account after several days , Locality for British Museum Royal Opera House and Covent Garden area Very quiet hotel 
229620,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Breakfast expensive and description misleading 39 for 2 English breakfasts unacceptable addition of mandatory service charge an insult based on the total lack of service How can a service charge be justified for a self service breakfast Day 2 went to Costa better breakfast and I was treated as a customet rather than a commodity,No Positive
229621,Kingsway Hall Hotel, ON the last day there was no hot water for a shower The air con wasn t working and we couldn t open the windows because the pub across from the hotel was very noisy from people outside, the bed was lovely plenty of storage huge room 
229622,Kingsway Hall Hotel, N A, The room was fabulous the bed was so comfortable and I have not slept past 7am in a long time I didn t wake until 9 20 amazing nights sleep real plus as I suffer from MS 
229623,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The sauna was out of service with no notice of when it would be working again We d booked the hotel for that facility so that was disappointing especially for the price , The staff were lovely and the room was good 15 min stroll to Covent Garden and Theatreland 
229624,Kingsway Hall Hotel, A bad smell in the foyer during our stay, This hotel was in a great position and the staff were friendly and helpful The rooms were clean and comfortable 
229625,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Sorry just the breakfast could have been better quality and presentation , Sorry but the breakfast wasn t that marvelous although the staff and service was excellent it was just the quality of the food not that impressive However the overall stay for business within the hotel was really good and I would definitely use this hotel again for business and vacation Location excellent 
229626,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Staff were all foreign and did not communicate well Don t bother with the restaurant Overpriced Not much variety Service charge for everything , The room was very quiet and Comfortable The location is the best Walking distance to all 
229627,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The one time we eat in the bar area staff seemed to be overworked therefore service not up to usual standard , location excellent for the museums etc we wished to visit all within walking distance t
229628,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The breakfast spread is disappointing and I have staying there before my previous experience was better They have reduced the variety and available foods products, Excellent areas fantastic locations with friendly staff nice comfortable rooms 
229629,Kingsway Hall Hotel,No Negative, Staff were excellent at both breakfast and afternoon tea Great location it s easy to get to on the tube and close to everything including the theatre food bars shopping and the parks given a small tube journey
229630,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Bathroom dated Hair dryer prehistoric Bath small shower curtains are so over Maybe a shower screen would have been better Asked for extra milk in room Didn t get it Breakfasts prices confusing , Liked location the George pub over the road and locality to attractions Friendly staff on reception 
229631,Kingsway Hall Hotel, We didn t know we needed the key card to activate the lights Felt kinda silly when we called the front desk , The location was good not far from the Holborn station off the Piccadilly line The room was an ok size clean and comfy It was also quiet we were on a side street
229632,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Old furniture and bathroom No shower hose uncomfortable for women The room doors slam very noisy The morning cleaning staff slamming all the doors Impossible to sleep after 8 Charge of 12 for bottle of still water from the room Unexpected deposit of 50 , The people and the staff very friendly Room service fast 
229633,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Found staff on reception fairly indifferent and not really welcoming Rooms well appointed but noisy next to lift and window didn t open with no outlook, Hotel in good area with quick access to Covent Garden
229634,Kingsway Hall Hotel,No Negative, Excellent place to stay to look around London Conveniently located in good neighbor Very good facility to enjoy your stay I will stay in this hotel again when I have a chance to revisit London 
229635,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Friends had a room near the front of the hotel and we re kept awake by noise from neighbouring bars , Great location close to Covent Garden and theatres Staff were very pleasant and helpful The rooms were clean and comfortable 
229636,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The bed and pillows were super hard and no soft pillow options Room was big but TV in room was tiny at about 24 inches and so when you sit on the bed its very small Probably one of teh smallest TV s in a hotel I have seen in 10 years I know we were not there for the TV but for 250 per night one expects better Strong smell of sewage in lobby during the evening Cooked Breakfast said 9 on the menu and then when we came to pay they tried to charge us for the cooked and continental which is an all you can eat option at 16 fortunately they saw that their menu was poorly worded and did agree to just charge us for the 9 breakfast , Location
229637,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The final price was not exactly as published in booking com due to additional 2 service fee plus 3 unnecessary conversion from pounds to dollars , The location 
229638,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Not enough tea and coffee in the room but not a deal breaker as all else good, Location very near to covent garden very clean and comfortable Staff helpful and efficient Beds good and plenty of hot water 
229639,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Breakfast appears to be a reasonable hotel rate but is actually 21 85 when the VAT and service charge are added However it is an option and you can always choose to go elsewhere as we did As a petite individual it is frustrating that in our overbath shower the shower head was fixed high on the wall A minor niggle I suppose but a flexible shower arrangement is always a bonus However they do provide those very sexy shower caps to keep your hair dry Maybe the better rooms have flexible shower arrangements , The location of this hotel is excellent for a London stay Quick access to Covent Garden attractions and amenities Holborn underground is just around the corner opening up wherever you want to go in the rest of the capital The staff are very friendly and helpful We arrived early and were given our room well ahead of book in time Ours was a standard room and was very clean and comfortable It was quiet and there was plenty of hot water On our last day after checking out they kept our bags until we were ready to head back to the airport All in all a very good hotel and we have stayed in a few others in the same price bracket We plan to use it again next year 
229640,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The bed was quite hard Lucky I was totally exhausted so I slept anyway The pillows were good though , Well placed venue close to Covent Garden which made it great for eating out and also for theatre visits 
229641,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Breakfast on the first day was not satisfactory as the hotel is really set up for breakfast buffet only I ordered a la carte and it was a disaster The hotel staff were very responsive to this situation and I was given a free breakfast the next morning , Overall hotel staff were very attentive At check in The lady at reception had a difficult to understand accent 
229642,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The layout of the cooked breakfast could have been better It was layed out so that you got your items from the heated trays for bacon etc then had to wait for the egg s to be cooked while your other items were getting cold Not pleased that on top of the price of breakfast was a 15 surcharge Also 15 for drinks at the Bar I expect to pay a little more in an hotel but not also the surcharge Because of that we only drank there once We went to a pub after that Another thing was while having breakfast on the first day a mouse ran across the dining room , Breakfast was good unfortunately the egg chef on the second day was a bit slow 
229643,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Nothing all good, Although advised that breakfast was an overall price reception didn t state that you could just go in and buy breakfast off menu which was reasonably priced 
229644,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The curtain didn t close properly and the cleaning service came in at 9am when we were due to check out at 11am , Perfect location just a couple of minutes walk from Holborn tube station 
229645,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The room was either really hot or cool We weren t in the room that much so it wasn t a great issue to us , Great location Helpful friendly staff Clean room 
229646,Kingsway Hall Hotel,No Negative, Could not fault a thing The staff went above and beyond to help with anything The room was spotless the only thing was the bed was a little hard for my liking but the size of it definitely made up for that We were upgraded to an executive room as it was my partners birthday and we had cakes in the room also 
229647,Kingsway Hall Hotel, We were staying in here for our honeymoon We had emailed ahead to tell the hotel this The icy receptionist acknowledged that it was our honeymoon at check in and asked if we d like to pay for an upgrade We upgraded our room The upgrade wasn t worth the money The hotel didn t acknowledge our honeymoon in any way we just thought this was a bit cheap after the price we d paid , The bed was comfortable The room was spotless The location was excellent 
229648,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Bar was expensive and no atmosphere Needs some music on in there to break the silence Stingy room supplies very poor and no towelling gowns like other hotels so never used spa etc as couldn t go down with nothing to cover you I had mentioned by boyfriend s 40th birthday during our stay and all we got was a tiny bottle sparkling water very tight indeed after spending a lot to stay there There was a strange smell about the hotel but nothing terrible Smoking had to stand in alleyway there should have been somewhere not so grubby and where you can sit outside and have drink at the same time Couldn t book in at the confirmed time as I had called beforehand had to wait few hours Don t know why I bothered to call English not very good on reception I found it difficult to understand them , Nice decor and furniture Friendly staff
229649,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Unfortunately our room was on the 3rd floor at the front of the hotel and on Saturday night the noise in the street below was like trying to sleep at a boxing match There is a nightclub attached to the hotel next door a pub across the road and pubs at each end of the street It finally quieted down around 3 30am I advised the front of house manager Tarek Hashish that some triple glazing would beneficial to these rooms apparently this is what is like most Saturday nights and he refunded our upgrade cost which we appreciated , Lovely hotel great location for Covent Garden and the West End We upgraded our room to a superior twin very spacious and comfortable Staff were very friendly and helpful 
229650,Kingsway Hall Hotel, there is a lot of foreign staff which sometimes it is difficult to get a common understanding when you ask questions or for information, very comfortable and clean room stay at this hotel quite a lot as it is central for what we want to do in London staff very friendly and helpful
229651,Kingsway Hall Hotel, I was disappointed that check in was advertised at 2pm but one of our rooms was not available until nearly 4pm We had a taxi booked for 4 45pm so this didn t give us much time to get ready, Great staff very helpful especially the doorman who went out of his way to look after us Rooms were lovely and the bed was very comfortable Breakfast was delicious and again service was great friendly
229652,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Bed was a bit hard for liking as were the pillows However had these changed the second night Young lady in the bar one night was not really attentive we left She was too busy chatting to three customers to bother , Breakfast was very good Dining staff excellent Pleasant bedroom Clean bathroom that was refreshed regularly Good toiletries Tea and coffee making facilities 
229653,Kingsway Hall Hotel, I was provided with room with view on the street very noisy room you can hear everything from the street I asked receptionist to change my room he did it but higher floor also noisy I asked him again to change the room he refused because no rooms anymore At the same time booking com offered plenty options in the hotel I don t believe that no room it s just personal attitude of stuff I told him if he didn t change my room I will make bad rating for hotel and he told me I can go on I did it with pleasure Highly not recommend this hotel very impolite stuff very noisy room very old furniture terrible smell in room Hope hotel saved a lot of money for my 2 days accommodation to provide uncomfortable room All best , Nothing
229654,Kingsway Hall Hotel, When looking round for hotels most of them at this price had breakfast included so it was abit disappointing that it didn t apply to this hotel , His hotel was brilliant for location we walked to Covent Garden oxford street for some shopping and walked to the theatre destrict to see a show we never once had to take a taxi 
229655,Kingsway Hall Hotel,No Negative, Great location for theatres walking distance same for shops restaurants and underground Bed very comfy lovely big bathroom with molton and brown toiletries Used spa facilities only whirlpool working steam room wasnt working unfortunately
229656,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The breakfast experience wasn t great Had to wait over 5 minutes for half of the full English breakfast No consistency when people were shown to their tables Tea coffee no offer of toast no explanation of the choices on offer Rooms and dining area look like they good do with bringing into the 21st century overdue for a make over I felt ,No Positive
229657,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The pillows could have been better , The staff were excellent So helpful and friendly The room was a very good size in a perfect location Easy to stop the car and drop off the luggage 
229658,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The beds are rather hard and would take my own hairdryer next time as the one supplied in the bathroom is difficult to style with , Ideally situated for our event we were attending Hotel is also quiet at night 
229659,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Had to order eggs for your breakfast which was a palaver They then brought them to your table and then you could get your full English to go with it On checkout we were not given a bill just told the amount to pay which was more than we had been quoted On querying the amount we were told we had been charged a service charge for the breakfast service and another for the accommodation This was almost 18 00 more than expected and we weren t even told about this charge We were advised it was discretionary so could remove it but made to feel bad when we said we didn t want to pay it , The location is very convenient and within walking distance of many attractions bars and restaurants and so was the theatre where Motown the musical was on which we were going to see The bedroom was very nice clean and comfortable Bed was comfy but pillows were too hard for me Plenty of wardrobe space Modern clean bathroom Breakfast food tasty and plentiful Staff were helpful 
229660,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The air conditioning was very poor One grill at the top of the wall set to the highest setting and on cold made no noticeable difference even leaving it on all day when we went out I would hesitate to use this hotel in the summer which is disappointing as we will be going back to London in August Pillows were quite flat could have been fluffier Didn t use the mini bar as the prices were extortionate Kit kat lovers beware 2 40 for a two finger kit kat , The location was excellent short distance to everything and the staff friendly Our key failed on the second day and was fixed in under 5 mins by the maintenance chap We were on the 5th floor front but there was little noise from the street even though there was a pub opposite In fact watching the people at night was quite entertaining 
229661,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Restaurant despite having 3 waiting staff to serve 3 tables the restaurant was nearly empty they did make a few errors, The spacious clean and very quiet room the friendly and helpful front of house staff 
229662,Kingsway Hall Hotel,No Negative, The hotel location was fantastic Within easy walk of Covent Garden and trips to the London Eye and London Dungeons 2 minutes walk from tube station Staff were very friendly and helpful 
229663,Kingsway Hall Hotel, rooms now look a little date TV system small screen poor picture and terrible control system Noise I think from air conditioning units on adjacent roof, location

229668,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Nothing, We requested an early check in as we were attending an event at 2 00pm We arrived at 11 15am and our room was ready The porter opened the door of our taxi and took our cases into the hotel The receptionist was very helpful and friendly First class service 
229669,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Breakfast far too expensive for what we had and the staff were not at all helpful Probably the worst hotel I ve stayed in for breakfast service and cost Ordered a coffe and a chocolate from the bar arrived in small cups and cost nearly 8 plus service charge Stayed in room 224 226 the noise from the street kept us up most of the night Couldn t fault the location for the theatre nor the cleanliness but far too expensive ,No Positive
229670,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The bedrooms are tired The bathrooms also need updating They are not to the standard of a four star hotel in 2017 , As a business trip the hotel is conveniently situated 200m from Holborn station which is quickly reached from Kings Cross 
229671,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Very noisy rooms The noise partially comes from outside but mostly from the poor HVAC system I managed to change my room but neither the second one was much more silent ,No Positive

229674,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The bed was extremely uncomfortable My parents stayed at a well known reasonable chain and had an amazing nights sleep whereas our bed was really hard and gave me a back back which lasted for 3 days Breakfast wasn t included in the price whereas my parents hotel price did include breakfast and there hotel was less than half the price Disappointing I tried to speak to the front desk but they said no one else had ever complained and it was too late to do anything I ve stayed in a lot of lovely hotels and clearly the only reason they can charge the price they do is the location but my parents hotel wasn t far away and like I said above less than half the price In future I won t be a snob and snub the well known chains ,No Positive
229675,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The bed was a little hard for me although our friends who also stayed found their bed comfortable probably personal taste , All of the staff went the extramile from Breakfast assisting with I phone problem and printing nothing was too much trouble Location is very good and nice seating areas 
229676,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The girls on the desk spoke poor English and had an attitude and seemed very unhappy at work Also for what I paid I feel breakfast should have been included The cost was different from the quote, Lovely clean Hotel
229677,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Surprised no body lotion in toiletries in a deluxe room Also pillow was too firm wish I d brought my own Shame as otherwise the bed was comfy , Great location Bar staff lovely Lots of storage in room enough drawers wardrobe space and hangers Second visit would recommend 
229678,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Bed was too small and too soft bathroom was tiny and the hairdryer on the wall was useless , the location of the property and cleanliness of the room and common areas 
229679,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Didn t like the fact that we found items listed on our bill from the mini bar which we didn t have , Location We had an Executive room and it was very comfortable Lovely bed 
229680,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Room location in hotel couldnt leave window open at night as air conditioning unit just outside noisy and a health hazard No marmalade available until one lovely waiter searched and searched and found some Christmas carols and songs still playing on 6th January annoying, Location of hotel and room itself was fine Comfortable bed 
229681,Kingsway Hall Hotel,No Negative, We ordered the breakfast room service The food arrived fresh hot and with a smile All of the staff were lovely couldn t do enough for us As we left the hotel for some sightseeing I requested extra coffee in the room and it was there by the time we got back Fantastically helpful and cheerful staff

229683,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Temperature control a real problem From freezing early evening to 26 27c in the middle of the night with the control dial doing nothing Insisted on moving for the 3rd night, Very good scrambled eggs and sausages at breakfast 
229684,Kingsway Hall Hotel, I didn t like the fact that due to an all night party right outside my bedroom window I did not actually sleep at all whilst staying at this hotel Partygoers were smoking right outside my bedroom window until 4am see picture After advising of this at checkout I was told this would be escalated after not hearing anything for a week I emailed the manager and got an offer of a free upgrade which I found insulting seeing as though I actually missed a full nights sleep and had a business meeting the next morning I expected at least the offer of a free nights stay to give the hotel another chance to redeem themselves given I travel for business a lot I emailed them back a week ago and have heard nothing since I have given the hotel plenty of opportunity to respond before writing this review I do not usually complain however I feel strongly about my experience at this hotel and felt I should warn others that a good nights sleep is not guaranteed , The staff were very professional and friendly the location was excellent Shame I did not sleep a wink 
229685,Kingsway Hall Hotel, When we got to the hotel we were asked to provide an extra 50 deposit which we didn t know about The bed and pillows were not that comfy on leaving we were told that we had to pay an extra 87 because they didn t see that the room had been paid already so there was a bit of a disagreement , The location was good
229686,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Quoted price when booking 360 for 2 nights Actually charged 367 20 best available room rate Didn t notice until later the price was different and not sure why but it will make me wary of using the site in future , Convenient location

229688,Kingsway Hall Hotel, My husband and I were approached by a gentleman who claimed to have had his money taken he asked us for money This happened in the hotel where we sat in a quiet place I felt uncomfortable I didn t want to refuse him so I gave him 10 Although this has no reflection of the hotel I did feel vulnerable, Very clean and comfortable Fabulous location

229692,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The bed was a tiny bit stiff but that is only a slight grumble Everything was pretty much perfect , We wanted to treat ourselves to a lovely weekend away before Christmas not to mention we had tickets to go and see Harry Potter the Cursed Child at the Palace theatre which was our main reason for staying over It was such a great weekend in a great hotel The staff were super friendly and helpful Location is fantastic only a few minutes walk from all the main areas and loads of lovely cafe s and pubs down the road I would recommend the Irish pub for breakfast 
229693,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Staff attitude upset my wife Lack of food left without a meal it being late rubbery and awful replacement meal offer but no cutlery so that went cold Inflexibility of staff and no manager prepared to see me until 45 mins after complaining Nothing sorted until morning when they still insisted I pay for the room despite ruining what was to be a great night I will never stay here again, The music and the company of friends

229697,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Shower was in a bath and a big step out and downwards would be challenging for anybody not 100 mobile The random 4 service charge added to the bill I just stayed in the room I didn t have any service , Comfortable bed good space and clean with nice molton brown toiletries
229698,Kingsway Hall Hotel, It gives the impression of being grander and a bit more special than the reality The restaurant looked very unappealing and since breakfast was not included in the rate we went elsewhere Reception staff were a bit cold and not especially welcoming I wasn t asked whether I agreed to add a 2 service charge but it was just added to my bill As a matter of principle I complained and got it back as I wasn t aware I had experienced any service Altogether rather disappointing and the only possible justification for the price is the location , It was clean and the rooms were comfortable enough The concierges were very friendly and helpful
229699,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Noise from the road which went on most of the night making it difficult to sleep One of the rooms was freezing heating didn t work Bathroom tiny Only 1 English breakfast tea bag in room which is crazy for a hotel in the UK We had 3 rooms and it was the same in each room Just annoying when you have to ask room service to bring them in the morning Bar area only has limited comfy seating Not enough for the size of the hotel , Location and staff
229700,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Having to go home after our short stay, This hotel is a real jewel close to Covent Garden and the Theatres the concierge was great as well he directed us to a fabulous place to dine we felt so spoilt for the weekend Hotel very luxurious

229704,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The lady on reception was very rude when we had a problem and made out it was our fault not happy with her attitude , The room was very nice the location is absolute spot on 
229705,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The water pressure wasn t great so the shower wasn t as effective as I would have liked The bar area was lacking atmosphere it didn t feel particularly welcoming , The location was superb very close to the New London Theatre and Chinatown The staff were professional helpful and friendly The executive room was clean comfortable and well equipped

229707,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The price of the room meant I expected bottled water to be complimentary There was no double cream for Brandy coffee We sat in the bar whilst all of the chairs were removed around us The hotel pre authorized my card at the point of booking and again when I arrived so I when I checked out I had paid twice Whilst the hotel said one payment had been released It actually had not The receptionist was patronising and failed to explain why I was charged at the point of booking and again at check in Totally unacceptable, Room was very well equiped with everything Bar staff were very friendly 
229708,Kingsway Hall Hotel, We had originally thought we would have breakfast in the hotel on the day we were leaving but changed our mind We were there for 10am and there were x 8 people waiting in front of us for a table We noticed that there were many tables empty but they had not been cleared away We went to get the cooked breakfast but there was very little left and most needed refilling We decided to eat elsewhere It felt like the hotel was short of staff It was a very disappointing experience, The warm welcome
229709,Kingsway Hall Hotel,No Negative, We arrived late at night due to delays on the railway and were upgraded to a very fine suite at no extra cost Although several reviews commented on street noise we on the 6th floor did not notice any rather we found it blissfully quiet Staff were attentive without being officious and everything was spotlessly clean The courtesy umbrella proved very useful thank you when my wife had her own but I had none The location suited us down to the ground short walk to British Museum and Covent Garden easy transport to the South Bank Unusually for the UK the plumbing worked with proper hot water coming from the proper shower and all drains working properly We could have stayed longer and will come again 
229710,Kingsway Hall Hotel, We were completely ignored at breakfast Kept having to get up and ask staff for anything we needed Even had to find someone to take our order Unfortunately we had a room at the front so there was quite a lot of noise from people leaving the nightclub next door in the early hours , The staff in the lobby and bar area were very friendly and helpful Room was very clean Comfy bed The location was ideal

229713,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Nothing , We stayed in this hotel for my birthday celebrations and found the hotel friendly and comfortable The rooms were large and felt homely I would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to stay again 
229714,Kingsway Hall Hotel, I did not like the location of our room although it was very nice the view from the window which was impossible for us to open was of a large cement pad It gave me claustrophobia The manager argued me out of a change was not pleased The lobby and very empty restaurant are not user friendly but the world is at your fingertips just outside the door so all was ok , This is a full service hotel the concierge service was wonderful And the location cannot be any better 
229715,Kingsway Hall Hotel, the AC was not working in my room i told reception about it and they told me they had it sorted when i returned but alas it still didn t work luckily they changed my room but that was late at night and not very convenient , the location and the rate was good value at the time i booked 
229716,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The de luxe room wasn t special Tired decor poor aircon heating Only one packet of shortbread between 2 No bathrobes slippers Very poor selection of tea coffee Without checking that I had prepaid the room the receptionist debited my card with the first night s accommodation charge , Large comfy bed
229717,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Having booked this hotel in March 2016 but had to change date before this change the booking had been paid in full At the time What we were not best happy with On checking out we were given a bill to cover the change in euro in the difference from paying in March in full to sept in using booking When they already had been paid fully in advance I have been to London a few time lately an no other place did this Is a very poor way to make more money with the lame excuse of the change in Euro as they had our card info they could still of took the payment , Location good

229720,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Mlni bar I moved two fruit juice bottles to get to see what flavours the bottles were behind and found bill immediately charged The television billing information can be very worrying I had a varying item added every day of around 200 and when I questioned the charge at reception told not to worry and charge removed The charge appears the next day , Good location Room and room housekeeping excellent

229724,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Didn t like the idea of one nights holding fee as had already prepaid for the room have not come across this at other hotels This did take a little bit of sorting out but the manager was very helpful in dealing with this query There is also a 50 holding fee for any use of the mini bar in the room All monies reimbursed the next day very efficient notice of these holding fees on website wouldn t go amiss overall would book again , Perfect for theatre very comfortable beds reasonably spacious rooms very clean Didn t use restaurant but menu selection looked good and reasonably priced for London
229725,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The breakfast is expensive and not very good Please watch out they add a 2 discretionary service charge to all bills They will eventually remove this rip off charge but only after a struggle and Booking com dont help , The room was unusally large for a London Hotel

229745,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The only negative was that on arrival booking com had some how managed to book two rooms When I explained the situation and after speaking to someone from the company the manager was very helpful and on this occasion waived the cancellation charge I may have to reconsider not booking with the company again as an additional charge in the future would be a concern, Didn t have breakfast at the hotel however Resturant was spotless and tables were all set out well Staff at hotel very helpful friendly and professional Room spotless and excellent value Would stay again
229746,Kingsway Hall Hotel, So many things that will not let me tried again the worst hotel experience i ever had 1 Staff way always angry except the check in time 2 Sleeping at night is a dream Noise from the street and also from the doors that 24 ours open and closes i don t know by whom 3 Staff enters my room twice while i keep the Do not disturb sign on the door it means it s not safe to keep you things while you are leaving the hotel 4 One of the Tax Free forms have been stolen from my room i can t decide who because they did t respect the privacy 5 Noisy sound appears continuously in the bathroom looks like an electrical sound 6 One of the Duty Managers of the hotel is liar i forget her name but i don t recommend to trust the duty managers of this hotel 7 I was staying in room 218 and during the check out everything was fine and i ve paid all my expences once i arrived to the Airport i noticed that 200 GBP been deducted from my Visa for no reason i contacted the hotel and asked for the Manager to inquire about this amount but no body answer or call me 8 Bad smell in the lobby elevators and corridors Finally i didn t recommend at all to waste your money and time in Kingsway Hall hotel , The only thing i liked is the location of the hotel
229747,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The bar and restaurant do not stock a New Zealand sauvignon blanc and asked for a 20 corkage fee if we were to bring along a wine that suited our taste Hence we didnt eat in the restaurant So cant comment on food , American doorman was best I have experienced very welcoming and friendly 
229748,Kingsway Hall Hotel, They used to always have a porter on duty to help with luggage etc no one to help us this time, We have stayed here several times before and can be sure of the quality of the rooms unfortunately I think they have priced themselves out for future trips to London 
229749,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The reception staff should be made aware of functions that are being held in the hotel We were there for a theatre production called the Wedding Reception and when we asked what time did it start and where was it being held and the gentleman on reception had no idea what we were talking about This is a function you hold regularly in your hotel and it took the concierge to come over and provide me with the information , Location was very good for amenities Room was very comfortable even though outlook was poor 
229750,Kingsway Hall Hotel, bathroom taps were not functioning properly to have a hot bath you would need to run the hot water tap for approx 1 hour in my estimation If you are thinking of booking this hotel on a weekend BEWARE Ask if they have any hen parties wedding parties stag do s We stayed for two nights and the music didn t stop until 3 a m i have never been so glad to leave an hotel in all my life , The staff were always very friendly and helpful

229752,Kingsway Hall Hotel, I dropped my wife and the bags in to reception hoping they would be taken to our room while I parked the car 25 minutes later she was still waiting in reception which meant we had a bit of a rush for dinner Had a deluxe room at 270 per night and was a little disappointed with the room given the photos available on the site Bathroom was tiny and had an old fashioned bash and plastic shower curtain TV in the bedroom was far too small for the size of room Only had 2 teabags so would have had to call down for more Picking on small things here but for 270 I expected better Came back from a show to have a drink in the bar to find it s probably one of the smallest bars in London Could do with a refresh , Location is great pre theatre dinner was good value though the restaurant could have more atmosphere

229756,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Breakfast was good but had to ask for items to be refilled , The location of the hotel was near to the underground Covent Garden and theatres The staff were very helpful and friendly 
229757,Kingsway Hall Hotel, This place suffers from noise badly Two nightclubs with 50 meters of the hotel entrance I you have a room that faces the main street you are unlikely to get to sleep before 3 30 Avoid this place if you want a quiet night , Excellent Staff
229758,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The restaurant was so bad ordered olives with our drinks which were forgotten starters arrived and my partners was a pork shoulder when he d ordered a baked mushroom they took it away and left me with mine we waited 10 15mins for a patheticly small mushroom to be placed in front of him with no apology at all Main course we both ordered chicken which was so dry it was hard to swallow We actually gave up on it and left we eat in Sway next door which was fantastic The bed was two singles put together which had an uncomfortable lump in the middle and the pillows were like hard sand bags , Great location to go out for a walk around Covent Garden the hotel was nice and clean Molton Brown toiletries made me happy

229761,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The constant party noise of drunks across the street at the George whooping til well past 3 in the morning both nights Friday and Saturday If I book again it will be at the uppermost room I can get being on the second floor was noise pollution to the max swear words could be heard amongst the unbelievably loud roar of the party people in the streets , Staff very lovely to me
229762,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Although quite pricey for one night you do have to remember it is central London and compares well with similar hotels in the area , The location for our weekend trip to the theatre was excellent Within easy walking distance to Covent Garden and surrounding area Rooms clean quiet and comfy Breakfast hot and plenty of choice We would stay here again

229767,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The room backed on to a courtyard that seemed to have fans or air conditioning ducts that were constantly going and were very noisy , I booked a surprise visit to London for my husband s birthday I couldn t have picked a better location and a better hotel Very comfortable hotel and very attentive staff Unexpectedly we were upgraded to a deluxe room The room we had was extremely comfortable and had everything you could need for a city break and was central to what I had planned

229772,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The prices are London prices but it doesn t excuse them to be fair Would make me think it over before staying again but to be fair the same applies elsewhere , Loved the location I also got an upgrade It seems to be a normal room so not sure what the upgrade was Sadly didn t get chance to try the food but did have coffee which was served by a great waitress on the day we checked out who was very helpful and happy

229779,Kingsway Hall Hotel, See above , The location Room was comfortable Breakfast could have been included even a continental style breakfast Really disliked the blocking of my cc just in case I used the mini bar As an adult I know if I am going to use it or not So I will pay for it if I do As it is monitored then the staff hotel will know if I have used it 
229780,Kingsway Hall Hotel, We had to ask for coffee refill at breakfast then the waitress refilled one cup and not the other which was annoying, Comfortable room Nice gym and spa

229789,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Our room was at the front of the hotel and so we didnt get much sleep due to people shouting screaming singing tooting car horns loading lorrys and vans right through the night maybe new triple glazing would help, Location was ideal for our visit and the room was nice 2 armchairs is a nice touch
229790,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Only enough tea bags and milk for one cup each per day although in fairness they were happy to bring more up when requested although still rationed to sufficient for one cup of tea each I don t think its unreasonable when staying for two nights to have sufficient provision to have tea on arrival and a cup in the morning Small point but seemed a bit mean Get breakfast outside at Bill s or Paul s Much better value , The bedroom was spacious and well kept It was extremely quiet which given its central London location was impressive Moulton Brown toiletries were a nice touch

229793,Kingsway Hall Hotel, It is Central London but still a bit expensive We were charged for taking drinks to the room , The location is outstanding Nice and quiet but close to Holborn station and Covent Garden We had an Executive Double room which was very nice The bed was comfortable and the bath had instant and quickly filled hot water All the staff we spoke to were very friendly and helpful 
229794,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Quite pricey but location compensates as most places are walkable The view from the room wasn t great looked out over a roof room 408 The TV was very small as well Nothing dreadfully bad about the hotel would use again, The location is really good and easy to get to most places from The staff are friendly and always greet you well We upgraded to a larger room which had a larger bed
229795,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Staff was rude very unprofessional was placed on 6th floor by a generator dripping tap and toilet didn t flush and heard people next door and upstairs having a shower and going to the toilet worse place ever tried to tell the staff however they just wasn t interested Book a deluxe room too and got 2 singles bed pushed together was defiantly not worth 157 14 a night,No Positive
229796,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Despite the mention of a car park availability in the advert the hotel uses a NCP car park at 42 a night So if you add it to the room bill your paying 240 a night for essentially a basic hotel , Location and friendly staff 
229797,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Did not like the extra service charge for the room at the end of the stay even though we did not use any extra service or facilities , The location of the hotel was brilliant The staff were very polite and helpful

229801,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Beds and pillows were very hard even though we upgraded and room was very small for 400 for 2 nights I expected more Also breakfast on the first morning was shocking the eggs were under cooked and we got our drinks and toast after about 40 minutes wait after we d eaten our breakfast however when we complained the next morning our breakfast and service was perfect , Beautiful hotel easy to find Near to everything you need
229802,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Our room was not cleaned so we had to request it to be done Drinks in the bar were very expensive , The location was great Nice bar to return for drinks at night 
229803,Kingsway Hall Hotel, the room is just old looking the bed was really squeaky and we were told we couldn t change rooms I m not sure that I would stay in the standard double again probably a higher end one, the staff were okay the entrance was easy to find and the interior was incredibly beautiful 
229804,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Rooms amenities toilet design were old Room service food was not that special Gym was very small No complimentary water everyday just got it once in the first day , Staff were very friendly Location is superb Room size is bigger than other hotels of it s class 
229805,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Being charged a service charge for breakfast when it was a help yourself buffet style breakfast and were only served tea and toast as these we were not able to help ourselves to these Very expensive breakfast as well, Helpful staff and tea and coffee making facilities
229806,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The room was freezing and affected our sleep Worst nights sleep ive had in a hotel The air conditioning only blew out cold air even though we adjusted it according to the instructions in the hotel book , Staff service breakfast location 
229807,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Room was at the front and was very noisy in the night The staff in the restaurant were not very nice too us they looked down there noses at us it spoilt our night , the reception staff were very friendly and helpful the location was brilliant five minutes to Covent Garden Room was lovely spotless 
229808,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Nothing , Location perfect as I had a breakfast meeting in the City a few stops down the Central line When this property is available at this week s price it is excellent value Rooms are well appointed and comfortable and it s handy for Covent Garden and West End too 
229809,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The hotel staff are belligerent to the reality of their actions We had 4 rooms for business were charged twice with no apology until we complained and if you are hoping to sleep make sure you ask for a back of building room as the constant fights at 3am outside that are complimented by the rude staff members motor bike which is alarmed with a pedestrian warning beep every 90 seconds will surely ruin your impression of London Real shame as perfect location clean hotel just let down by ignorance and inability to provide a service, Location is great for business or leisure 
229810,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The beds and pillows need to be renewed as really quite hard There was noise in my bedroom from 9am as they are refurbishing a room on my floor as a business woman who works in my room sometimes this was not very good at all , Staff are very good location is excellent Public spaces are good Rooms very clean

229813,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Pillows were rock hard the room was either freezing cold or superheated and the location is on a very noisy street The room sizes are small versus their competitors , Not much
229814,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Prices were ridiculous 2 drinks 27 I would have presumed bedding would have been changed every day but we was there 2 nights and not once changed plus the light in our room flickered like we was in a night club and the constant slamming of doors from 6 45am every morning was very annoying and inconsiderate , Location was ok 
229815,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Thought we would have had the breakfast cost included in the overall price of the package , Bedroom was comfortable and a reasonable size Lobby area had a nice vibe and helpful porter 
229816,Kingsway Hall Hotel, Breakfast was cold and had been sitting out too long not asked if I wanted more coffee not asked what type of eggs I required just no service in the restaurant even though there were 4 staff and I was the only person in the restaurant Bathroom was dirty dated and dowdy The noise out on the street was prevail ant at night as the windows in this building lack any decibel reduction , The staff at check in were friendly the staff otherwise were rude and not industrious
229817,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The mattresses on the beds too thin and didn t offer a comfortable sleep We had to change rooms after the first night because of the very poor hot water supply and pressure in room 101 We changed to room 711 where the hot water was instant but pressure extremely poor We did tell the young lady about this and coincidentally another gentleman leaving brought the same complaint re water pressure , We loved the location 5 minutes walk to the centre of Covent Garden The decor in the lobby and rooms excellent and tastefull and very much to our liking Staff excellent 
229818,Kingsway Hall Hotel, I was over charged by 50 by use of pre authorised payments and only realised this the following day so frustrating having to call and try to explain how I need a refund hopefully will be refunded in next few days but and unnecessary error I believe , Location comfort and clean 
229819,Kingsway Hall Hotel, An individual hairdryer would have been helpful otherwise the bathroom gets clogged up Also fixed hairdryers are awkward to use Our room had a dreadful view Who gets to have a good view at a hotel , The room was quite a good size but there was a lot of space taken up with large wardrobes etc If these were reduced there would be even more room to move around The bed was very comfortable and the room was warm The staff we spoke to were very friendly and helpful 
229820,Kingsway Hall Hotel, There was nothing not to like about this hotel , Lovely hotel friendly helpful staff very nice comfortable room great food Would defiantly go back 
229821,Kingsway Hall Hotel, The room was rather small for the cost of the stay The bathroom was tired looking and the hot and cold water flow to the basin was poor and unacceptable in a 4 hotel , All staff were very friendly and quick to help when required Public areas were comfortable and well appointed 
229822,Kingsway Hall Hotel, At check in we have been offered a first floor room which was very cold with heating problems Then we were offered another room fifth floor and everything was perfect , Nice polite efficient personnel Welcoming atmosphere Spotless clean comfortable well kept room and surrounding areas Best location
