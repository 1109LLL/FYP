472433,UNA Hotel Cusani, I did not appreciate the fact that my room was not ready I had an early check in but I am sure there were a lot of rooms that are ready and could have been assigned to me There were a couple of people who checked in the same time I did and were given their rooms No issue of early check in I was extremely tired I have been to busier hotels and had early check in with no problems ,No Positive
472434,UNA Hotel Cusani, Not sure the air conditioning controls had any impact but the room was comfortably cool on a very hot day , Very comfortable and well located hotel at the end of a lengthy trip Short ride from Milano Centrale and also train to Malpensa close to the Fortezza Staff was very helpful Breakfast was abundant and varied Upgrade to a junior suite gave us more room for the inevitable repacking at the end of a trip They also had umbrellas for us to use when an unexpected rain shower came up All in all great service 
472435,UNA Hotel Cusani, There was no warning that the cord in the shower cubicle was for emergency , The location of the hotel was excellent for us to be able to access sightseeing and tours with hotel staff helpful with advice Very comfortable bed and well appointed room provided a good nights rest and even though hotel is in a busy area our room was very quiet Loved the access to so many restaurants and public transport 
472436,UNA Hotel Cusani, The room doors did not shut well and the door knob is too close to the door jamb I bruised my fingers closing the door because my fingers didn t fit in the space between the door knob and door jamb that s how small that space is , Amany the receptionist that greeted us when we checked in was AMAZING Kudos for her EXCEPTIONAL service her services was above and beyond and recommendations for local supermarkets attractions and dining my kids thought Ama s dining recommendation was the best dining throughout our Italy trip Breakfast was very good the orange juice that was presented when you first walked in was freshly squeezed oranges THUMBS UP Rooms and beds were comfortable 
472437,UNA Hotel Cusani, Outside noise from traffic and trams Our room faced the main street Also there was only one powerpoint that worked in our room , We got upgraded to a suite which was very spacious The location was excellent one minute walk to Cairoli Castello metro and eight minute walk to Brera There are a lot of restaurants and shops within walking distance The area around the hotel is lovely and felt safe The staff were friendly and very helpful 
472438,UNA Hotel Cusani, Limited breakfast bed mattress was horrible very hard, Everything was amazing staff location and facility Central location near to all areas 10 min walking to domo 
472439,UNA Hotel Cusani, Nothing to dislike, The hotel is very well position for all the plans we had for visiting Milan The staff are so helpful and go out of their way to accommodate your requests We had a trip out very early in the morning before breakfast was being served They made a breakfast up for us to collect at 6 30 in the morning from reception 
472440,UNA Hotel Cusani, The hotel overcharged us by quietly changing the room rates we had booked via Booking com We knew about the additional city tax of course but they had entered the wrong rates on the system Unfortunately we only noticed after the payment had gone through at which point the receptionist who admitted the mistake told us that refunds could only be processed centrally but someone would be in touch the next day I have since then emailed the hotel twice to request a refund but have not even received a reply They also tried to charge us for the minibar which was included in the room rate we did spot that one in time so I do wonder whether accidental overcharging might in fact be the norm here I find this a completely unacceptable level of customer service from a 4 hotel and will never book with this chain again , The location is excellent a short stroll from the Duomo and from the restaurants in Brera The trains to and from Malpensa depart from Cadorna station which is just five minutes away on foot and there is a metro station right outside the hotel The room was clean and spacious if rather lacking in ambiance and came with complimentary soft drinks The breakfast buffet had plenty of choice 
472441,UNA Hotel Cusani, Elevators are tiny and not air conditioned During my visit in late June there are five mosquitoes in the room It seems the cleaning ladies left the windows open while cleaning and they all got in during the cleaning time They had a feast during my stay The hotel was quick to address this pretty fast , I had a very quiet room with unlimited access to Wifi and inclusive minibar which was replenished every day This was so convenient because I did not have to stop by a grocery store to pick up water and other refreshments The breakfast was so convenient and had a variety of options but they used instant coffee for my Americano The staff was very professional and friendly The location is very convenient the hotel is about 12 minutes of walking from Duomo and about 15 minutes from the Last Supper There is also an M1 metro station literally in front of the hotel 
472442,UNA Hotel Cusani, Wi fi in our attic floor room was non existent Manager tried to appear surprised Worked well in common space near lift and worked well in lobby , Location fantastic 10 minutes stroll to Duomo 5 minutes to anywhere else Room on the top floor clean quiet very comfortable Helpful staff taxi strike comfortable lobby area 
472443,UNA Hotel Cusani, Breakfast with few fruit options , Nice room spacious and clean Terrific staff fluent in english concerned about your pleasure Great room upgrade Grazie mille 
472444,UNA Hotel Cusani, It may have been a booking com issue but was told there was no reservation when I checked in This was quickly resolved when I gave them the reference number but being told you have no room is not exactly a pleasant experience especially after a long flight The rest of the stay was excellent , conveniently located
472445,UNA Hotel Cusani, Our Aircon was faulty shower water pressure really low sewer smell in bathroom after using taps Internet too slow and think that offering at breakfast could be changed every few days same for 5 days totally hectic ,No Positive
472446,UNA Hotel Cusani, The bed was really hard I don t mind a firm mattress but this was almost like sleeping on a board Everything else about the hotel was great though , Location location location The hotel was close to shopping excellent dining historical sights and public transportation I was worried that communicating with the staff would be be challenging but they speak excellent English 
472447,UNA Hotel Cusani, This is not related to the UNA hotel dont eat at the restaurants on Dante street near the hotel especially at night they are overpriced and the food is average Avoid the Dante Caf big talker waiter but very overpriced , Excellent location it is really the best in Milan The upgrade to and executive room was a nice service even the superior double room was nice Very good breakfast with many choices 
472448,UNA Hotel Cusani, See in what I did like section, At first they couldn t locate my reservation made through booking com and offered me an executive room at their sister hotel Once I insisted that my reservation was valid and I was tired to go to another hotel they somehow found a room for me After the more experienced receptionist explained that they just merged their booking system with another one and that is why they couldn t find my booking In any case the hotel is great the room is spacious and the location is perfect 
472449,UNA Hotel Cusani, Bed could have been a little more comfortable just a little hard for our liking , The hotel was excellent our room was very pleasant and quiet The bed linen and towels were top quality and the service was very good Breakfast was excellent and we had a very nice meal in the restaurant one night The location is excellent very close to the centre of Milan

472457,UNA Hotel Cusani, The Buffet breakfast was the same everyday no change in what is provided and it became boring The mattress of the bed was not comfortable and was sunken on both sides and higher in the middle The shower knob was very hard and every time I needed to shower I had to call someone from maintenance The room service delivery cost Euro 10 regardless of what is ordered and is not clearly indicated in the menu not in red or bold and this is not communicated either by Room Service The unlimited use of mini bar was basically 1 can of beer 2 cans of coke and a couple of bottles of water and sparkling water which were replenished on daily basis if consumed , The location of the hotel is very good and the room was spacious enough 
472458,UNA Hotel Cusani, The room is nothing like the newly renovated photo shown in booking com it s very old Would not book this hotel if I know it s this old There is a frequent machine noise in the room which we suspected is the elevator motor It s very annoying , Location is very good

472501,UNA Hotel Cusani, The bathroom was too small The bidet was facing the toilet with very little space in between , Good location by the Milan Cordona train station and 100 feet from the Red Line Subway Good breakfast buffet 
472502,UNA Hotel Cusani, There could have been a wider choice at breakfast and more electrical sockets in the bedroom but did not detract from the overall positives of this hotel, the junior suite did not disappoint it was very modern and very clean Position of hotel is superb for all the main attractions The staff were all so friendly and helpful

472507,UNA Hotel Cusani, In the near future carpets have to be changed , Friendly stuff perfect parking place excellent location good restaurant I would recommend this hotel to every one who wants to spend few days in Milan You can reach from the hotel all the most important points of interest by walking leisurely not more then 5 to 15 minutes
