137817,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, Breakfast was very poor I read some reviews saying it was good but most things ware bought at the supermarket and of very low quality There was no fresh fruit or juice sausages and cold cuts were terrible very few options compared to most continental breakfasts The lady working at the breakfast was not paying any attention to the buffet or to customers so we found ourselves without glasses or cups and had to ask as well for more food to be taken to the buffet She sounded even a little bit frustrated by that I think waiters should watch the room more closely and ensure everything is always available to customers and customers are happy about the service , The bed is very comfortable rooms in general are small but very nice and have all that you may need The people at the front desk have been very kind and helpful 
137818,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, No negative points, The staff were extraordinarily friendly smiley and helpful really outstanding In addition the bedding was extraordinarily comfortable and the bedsheets were really soft so much so that they are worth commenting on A real highlight Everything else was just fine the room a little small but nothing out of the ordinary 
137819,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, The breakfast facilities were poor no clean tables to sit at dirty plates with half eaten food left on tables and the breakfast choices were left empty No clean plates available Breakfast staff very unhelpful, The hotel is close to bus and metro lines
137820,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, Rooms not ready on check in Rooms not what we booked Hotel blamed everything from hot weather to tired housekeeping staff Rooms when we got them were lovely Our con was superb , Recently refurbished Hugh standard of comfort 
137821,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe,No Negative, Quiet location but close to the metro and lots of very good restaurants and cafes The hotel itself was very good and a great place to relax after a day exploring Paris 
137822,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, The downstairs room basement was under construction but they were completely flexible nevertheless , Great staff Incredibly accommodating Tremendously helpful and flexible 
137823,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, Construction during our stay in the lobby meant no lobby and make shift breakfast area We had breakfast one time when I received the final bill it showed that I was billed for breakfast for my daughter and I everyday I was told it w has to be manually put in who saw us eating every morning Two of those mornings we were in London although we kept our room I insisted that my bill be adjusted and it was Breakfast should be free not worth 15 00, Staff are very nice and professional room room was always clean
137824,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, The hotel was under renovation and we werent imformed this while booking but it didnt cause too much noise , The staff were extremely helpful and the rooms were lovely even if they were a bit small 
137825,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, Breakfast was painful and really of poor quality There are only few tables available in a very tiny reception area room for all customers the staff allocated to the breakfast is extremely slow and have no common sense The quality of the products are very low and the staff is warming up the scrumbled eggs coming from a package behind the bar in a microwave Nothing is fresh everything comes from a package 4 stars hotel With all the brasseries around Champs Elisee area it s better to go out if you really want to enjoy your breakfast , The room and the bathroom are quite nice
137826,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, very small elevator but climbing the stairs instead is not a problem, nice cozy small hotel very helpful staff near from the public transportation Metro and RER the offer a drop by transport to CDG airport for 18 Euro
137827,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, False advertising which said the room was soundproof That s why I decided to pay extra to stay here It was a complete lie The walls were paper thin A woman next door was drunk and ranted and yelled at her boyfriend for hours Then she started throwing things I complained to the concierge a couple of times Finally he came up and tapped gently on the disruptive woman s door She didn t answer and he left without talking to her Fortunately she quieted down around 1 a m probably because the alcohol put her to sleep The concierge still should ve talked to her to discourage such behavior in the future The next morning a different concierge double charged me for the room Instead of simply adding breakfast to my bill he also added the cost of my room and insisted this new total would replace the old total I was skeptical I said the bank had no way of knowing how many nights I stayed He acted condescending in the stereotypical Parisian way as if I was an idiot who didn t understand the nuances of banking Well I was charged for two nights and it took multiple calls to the hotel and my bank to straighten it out Incompetence and rudeness is a combination that s hard to forgive , The concierge when I first arrived was nice She s the only reason I didn t give the staff a total frown rating 
137828,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, fact that hotel was undergoing redecoration and we were not told prior to our visit although it did nt spoil our stay and these upgrades have to be done sometime , Bathroom was high quality and huge bed very comfy 
137829,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe,No Negative, The staff were really friendly and the location was great There were lots of local bars and resturants It didn t feel like you were in the middle of a tourist trap The nearest landmark was about a 18 min walk away down some lovely streets Or a 9 min run Perfect hotel Perfect weekend 
137830,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe,No Negative, Really good location Only 10 mins in the Uber taxi which were really cheap Hotel had building work on going but this did not affect us Breakfast was continental My only negative is that we booked a superior room hoping it was going to be a good size but unfortunately it was a bit small and the beds were very small more like children size Staff were very friendly and there service was excellent Thank you for having us 
137831,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, My particular room was a bit small but perfectly adequate , Nice character building in 17th district 20 min walk to Arc de Triomphe Everything you need in the immediate vicinity Staff all very friendly and helpful with good English Good breakfast 
137832,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, The air conditioning failed on one night however there was no issue in changing rooms If anything i know its Paris and rooms are small by nature but it did feel a bit cramped , The staff were always helpful and friendly and the hotel was in a good location next to the train and metro lines with some nice cafes and a park nearby
137833,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, The room smelled very smoky despite the hotel being a non smoking The shower hose had to be held because the piece holding it was loose , Access to tourist sites and metro was very convenient

137838,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, The elevator was too small and clunky The rooms were not sound proof so had to listen to some sweet love making in the middle of the night , The staff was friendly and helpful The location was convenient however it is a good walk from central Paris 
137839,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, Tiny and slow lift but that is the nature of the building Just think it is fair to mantion it in a review, Finally a wifi that works in a Paris hotel

137842,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, My only complaint is that our coffee mugs weren t changed for the duration of our 4 night stay I don t mind reusing for a few different cups of tea but a new mug every day would have been nice Bathroom was a little small also but well appointed and clean , A small hotel in a lovely residential area slightly away from the main sights but a few minutes walk from a convenient metro Helpful friendly staff and a comfortable cosy room with a view of Sacre Coeur Some nice cafes to eat breakfast or have coffee nearby

137844,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, The hotel appears to be attached to a residential building and the walls are very thin On the last night of our stay was a raging house party that didn t stop until 4am We could hear everything and didn t get a wink of sleep Was so loud the pictures were moving off the wall due to the loudness of the party , Staff was very helpful and the location was four minute walk away from an RER and Metro line also the area was safe and lots of places to eat within five minute walk 
137845,Best Western Plus de Neuville Arc de Triomphe, My only small negative point is that i felt the cleaners came round too early We stayed for 4 nights one morning we fancied a lie in cleaners came round at 1030 so it meant for that day we did not get our room cleaned , Staff where exceptionally good Couldnt do enough to help Location was brilliant for Metro stations and acces to Champs D elysee Lots of decent restauants nearby although some where pricy
