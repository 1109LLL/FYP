434967,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Every extra costs like late check out or a room with a view towards the Sagrada I ve found that the room is cold an that a c is so strong even in low settings , The location is just awesome Literally 100m to Sagrada Familia Also nearby is a metro station Sagrada Familia L2 purple line that takes you wherevere you need Ah and most of all the terrace with it s beautiful view worth every penny Room service is relatively cheep 
434968,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Very low water pressure in the shower for a four star hotel Soundproofing can be improved we were on the 6th floor and still could hear the road traffic at night , Comfortable room Great breakfast with a view of the La Sagrada Familia The rooftop is a nice place to hang out Conveniently located 3 mins walk away from the La Sagrada Familia and metro station with restaurants and supermarkets nearby Nice neighborhood Friendly staff 
434969,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, you could not buy alcohol after 11 30pm so the rooftop terrace bar with such fantastic night time views was wasted would have been lovely to sit up there late with a glass of wine ridiculous for a city centre hotel in July , nice rooms beautiful rooftop terrace bar lovely helpful staff 
434970,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Restaurants and bars with a view of Sagrada familia you can expect to pay more , Hotel was so central to restaurants bars local attractions metro plus Sagrada familia
434971,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Maybe an airport ride offered when the taxis are on strike Maybe a shuttle service when this happens It happened to me The subway is very easy to use clean and cheap A print out of the metro to the airport the fares and how to buy the tickets although the receptionist was very kind and explaned to me gave me a map I was still very nervous about taking the subway I bought one extra ticket that I did not need but overall it was very easy to go to the airport indeed there is no need for a permanent shuttle For 4 50 the airport is almost at your doorstep from this hotel , My room had a view of Sagrada Familia The toiletries were top notch The staff was very friendly and helpful There was fresh cold water at the reception umbrellas when it rained There is a reasonably priced breakfast buffet and a bar with tapas drinksxand coffee I forgot to try the top roof terrace bit there is one with a wonderful view of Sagrada 
434972,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The rooftop bar was closed the day we wanted to have a drink But the view looked amazing , Great location for Sagrada Familia but you can see that from the picture of the rooftop bar 
434973,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Coffee available in room would have been nice , Bed was comfortable provided extra pillow when requested great location and close to Metro and shops Great coffee in Colombian Cafe next door 
434974,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, Great front desk service especially the young lady from Morocco extremely pleasant and helpful wonderful view from our room excellent buffet breakfast very nice terrace with a stunning view good location high end hotel for a good value 
434975,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, We were very disappointed The rooms were very basic not clean and rundown didn t match with the pictures on your side we had to ask for a toilet brush It was far overpriced Roof terrace was a mess with broken umbrellas The bed was to hard also,No Positive
434976,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Lack of coffee making facility in room , Very good choice at breakfast Good scrambled eggs Staff were excellent very positive helpful friendly and welcoming Spacious bathroom and good room cleaning service Roof top terrace very good never over crowded and views across Santagrada Familia excellent 
434977,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The hotel could not accommodate our late check out request even when we offered to pay extra I have to stress though this is non consequential and the overall experience at this hotel was amazing , The customer service was absolutely excellent the staff at the front desk were beyond exceptional I would recommend the hotel to all my friends and family 
434978,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Only minor gripe was that air con in two of our three rooms wasn t working and it was HOT, Great location staff exceptionally helpful and friendly breakfast was great and roof terrace gave amazing views of the city
434979,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The drinks bar on the roof terrace could be open in the afternoon , The location one block from the Sagrada Seville Cathedral and overlooking it Roof terrace has amazing view day and night wonderful Staff are attentive but not intrusive and very helpful 
434980,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, No issues at all , Loved the courtesy of the staff at the front desk and in the bar restaurant Enjoyed the contemporary design of the hotel After an exhausting day ordered food in the restaurant at hotel was pleasantly surprised by the delicious tuna salad With extra olives onions Really top class View of Gaudi cathedral really amazing from our 6th floor room 
434981,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, bedroom could be bigger and more comfortable , Excelent breakfast including champagne saladas etc Location is amazing just few steps to Sagrada Familia and the hop on hop off bus 
434982,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, one observation only one member os staff on the Bar very pleasant even at very busy times most of the time and they where also covering room service and roof top drinks more staff where definitely needed on this area , We had a fantastic few days here the staff you could not fault well done all rooms clean and well presented food lovely Hotel in a fantastic location
434983,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The room we booked was not available when we arrived so we were disappointed to be placed in a fairly dark room with no window for natural light It was also very noisy from around 7am that morning Luckily the staff moved us the next day albeit to a tiny room much smaller than the first with not much room for 2 people to live for 4 nights So not too happy that our intended room was unavailable Our shower also leaked which lead to a virtually flooded bathroom every morning not ideal We ate in the hotel restauraunt one evening as we were too tired to venture out and this was a huge mistske the service was slow and the food was cold and not cooked properly but there are plenty of nice restaurants in the vicinity to enjoy , Staff were really lovely and keen to help with anything The rooms were generally clean and comfortable Perfect location The rooftop bar was a particular highlight with gorgeous panoramic views over Barcelona great for relaxing after a long day walking exploring the city most attractions were accessible on foot from here which was a major bonus 
434984,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Staff in bars and dining room were extremely slow in service hot food came cold took 25 minutes to deliver cold poached egg Staff in dining room didn t smile and were rude and abrupt Asked for rooms to be close together We were put on five different floors What is point in making special requests 1 person behind desk din t seem to care and didn t smile However had another who was excellent , roof top terrace
434985,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The staff at the lobby bar were overwhelmed at times and some dishes coffee went cold before being delivered to you and they don t have microwave there they must travel back forth between floors what is a problem when there s just one staff and 7 customers But what is even more INEXCUSABLE is that they lock up the doors to the rooftop terrace and only open them at 10am So if you have an early check out and would like to see the view forget it We asked the reception guy to open the doors and he said he is alone at the desk and can t do it well obviously they are understaffed overworked Meanwhile the Rooftop Terrace with view not only on Sagrada Familia but whole Barcelona is THE REASON to choose this remote hotel location To what good if it only opens after 10am , Jon at the reception was very kind and very helpful and explained everything with much patience and even explained us about the city locations and drew on a map what is where to see so he left a great impression as did the view from the room that we paid extra for that view of course Exactly as expected Sagrada Familia from your bed 6th floor room The interior design was very pretty as advertised Had dinner at the Rooftop Terrace and it was extremely delicious Breakfast buffet was very delicious and generous A pity it isn t served at the Roof Terrace but at some random dining area downstairs Took it to the room The night before asked if it is possible to take breaks to the Rooftop Terrace and was told yes Upon arriving with a huge tray to the cumbersome door of the said rooftop it was locked 8am What a bad surprise in a hotel that otherwise was almost perfect 
434986,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, We stayed at this property with our adult children The roof deck is amazing We spent as much time as possible in there and enjoyed delicious food and drinks The neighborhood is very safe with lots of restaurants We walked everywhere and took a cab on the way back I will definitely go back to eat more patatas bravas 
434987,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Wifi could be a bit spotty, Amazing location and views to Sagrada Familia Great staff and breakfast was lovely too Make sure to order the hot breakfast from staff they ll cook it up for you fresh Very clean rooms were modern Rooftop was nice to relax in front of Gaudi s masterpiece
434988,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, We only stayed one night I would have loved to have stayed longer , The place is absolutely gorgeous The staff are lovely We had a problem with air conditioning and they sent someone immediately They gave us a new room just as nice as our original 
434989,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, We love this hotel and always stay here on business trips every year Ideal location modern clean and friendly staff The rooftop terrace is ideal for relaxing after the end of long days 
434990,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, No tea or coffee making facilities in the room, The location was perfect and lots of restaurants and cafes to choose from The roof top bar was an excellent addition to this clean and modern hotel 
434991,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Mattress was a bit hard but typical for Europe , Very friendly and helpful staff Early check in was no problem Very effective air conditioning fabulous view of Sagrada Familia Suite was spacious and great value for money 
434992,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Bar and room service both closed at 11pm No tea and coffee facilities in the room Room suffered with traffic noise despite double glazing and being on the 7th floor , Staff were very friendly an helpful Place was clean and tidy Good facilities and plenty of choice at breakfast Great views of Sagrada Familia from the terrace 
434993,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, N A, This hotel is in the best location It is round the corner from the Metro station The view from the roof top terrace is amazing the rooms had everything you needed 
434994,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The breakfast could be a little bit more diverse as there were not too many options from to choose like bread yogurt meat cheese The hotel has a limited option for dining There are things in the room were you can see easily that time past by and a little refurbishment would be needed , The property is very close to Sagrada Familia easy to access from the aeroport by public transportation and has supermarkets restaurants in the proximity The room was very clean quiet and with all the facilities needed Personal was very nice and helpful The terrace on the top floor of the hotel is nice to spend the evening with friends or family drinking or eating something 
434995,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Disappointed with rooftop bar not open No other complaint , Breakfast was included in price It was delicious and plenty to eat x drink Location perfect overlooking Sagrada familia Rooftop amazing especially at night All staff kind and friendly Reception staff very helpful 
434996,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Only drawback too much noise from the street , Everything Everyone in the front desk was wonderful especially Daniel Also managers Juan Stefie fabulous The breakfast stafff were outstanding 
434997,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, It felt understaffed at food and drink facilities the bar the rooftop and breakfast areas A few more servers would make a huge difference , Loved the location and the view from the room and the rooftop It was fun to stay at a modern hotel for a change as we had also enjoyed many historic hotels on the trip 
434998,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, There was no tea or coffee making facilities in the room This would have been nice but didn t detract from the experience , The location of the hotel is excellent for visiting the sagrada familia church It s right outside the building and many rooms look on to the site itself amazing views 
434999,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Room 106 at the back should be let with a warning of noise only got to sleep at 0410 when the young trouble makers exited a local club at 2300 and were outside screaming and shouting until hours later , Great breakfast
435000,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, 1 not providing an iron and its board in the room in a 4 stars hotel 2 not provinding good facilities for boiling water in the breakfast 3 not providing hot drinks facilities in the room , The teaarace was wonderful and the bar staff very friendly 
435001,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Bed was a little firm for my tastes , Staff were fantastic Location 1 block away from Sagrada Familiar was great Nice local area with several bars and restaurants 
435002,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, One rather very minor point It would have been great if there were slippers available , Staff is great The location is great Rooms are fine and regularly cleaned
435003,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Room was too hot and there was no coffe making facilities in the room Paid a premium to view the cathedral which wasn t really worth the extra money as it was partially covered by other buildings and partially covered by scaffolding and tarpaulin , The room was basic but comfortable 
435004,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Place is a bit pricy and a bit far from the night out places, Room is clean and modern Its 5 mins away from Sagrada Familia and you ll have a nice view of it from the roof top Staff are very nice and easy to talk to 
435005,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, We had an amazing stay here for the Easter weekend The views from our room and from the roof terrace of the Sagrada Familia were incredible The staff were super friendly and helpful We also had breakfast here on our last day and the range that was available was great and completely worth the price 
435006,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, Wonderful hotel friendly staff great location The roof top terrace which had views of Sagrada Famillia was just a beautiful place to relax at anytime of the day or night The buffet breakfast offered plenty of variety The additional option to order hot food from the kitchen for no extra cost was an added bonus The location of the hotel is super just a minute from Sagrada Famillia hop on hop off bus and the metro Gaudi s Avenue is less than 5 mins walk away There are plenty of good quality resutrants within a short distance of the hotel offering a range of different cusines too The hotel staff were very good at recommending good places to eat within a short distance of the hotel 
435007,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, Staff were very young extremely helpful and keen to make our stay as good as possible The view is astounding that terrace is certainly special Breakfasts were good and good value A good location 
435008,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Room at front were noisy from the traffic noise, Staff were the best of anywhere I have ever stayed Roof top terrace fantastic for a sundowner Spotlessly clean
435009,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, Excellent location with spacious and convenient room with remarkable views towards the Sagrada Familia Very helpful and service minded staff during the whole stay especially Gon alo at Reception devoting time to advise and personally order for us a very good and reasonably priced taxi service for the airport that could accommodate a baby trolley 
435010,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Very noisy cleaning started at 7h45 Impossible to close the window then it was really cold in the room Very expensive compared to other hotels same category very slow wifi , Location is great breakfast ok
435011,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The room did not satisfy us because of it was an economic room they gave us a room which we couldn t see the outside The window was only openning to the closed hall of the hotel We couldn t see the sun For a short stay that could be ok But when you want to sleep and open that window for some air the voices of people talking and laughing at the lobby disturbs a lot Maybe we could ask to change our room however that was a 3 nights stay so we tolerated it , The location was very good and so close to metro station sagrada familia and a great sea food restaurant The personnel at the reception was very kind and helpful The hotel was new and clean You have everything you need at the bathroom We didn t take the breakfast at the hotel 
435012,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Our room had no external view but that was not too disappointing we spent most of our time in the city , Great location modern well appointed hotel with friendly helpful staff 
435013,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, The staff were so helpful and accommodating We requested 4 twin rooms and this was all organised with a smile and no hassle we ordered cava to have on rooftop to enjoy the beautiful view Will definitely stayou next time I am back in Barca
435014,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The windows let in too much noise not good in a city centre and could have done with tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms , Only used the bar area not the restaurant but friendly staff and good coffee and cocktails a nice area to spend time at the end of the evening or first thing in the morning rooms comfy with good bathrooms and shower areas 
435015,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, slightly out of the way of La rambles which could be a good point if you want it less busy , fantastic hotel easy access to metro and bus links Staff are very helpful 
435016,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, We did not see a downside and will book this hotel again , Very attentive staff at breakfast and at the reception desk So close to all local facilities Perfect location for the Segrada de Familia 
435017,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The WIFI wasn t great although the connection was fine the speed of it was terrible Even though my Booking com receipt said fully paid they still had to charge me the full amount when I left This was a surprise , The service at the front desk was phenomenal we had some questions about train metro and they did an awesome job 
435018,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Possibly a room to the back of the hotel or higher Above street noise, I loved the contemporary design in general Traffic noise in my room a little high fabulous staff the limited amount of food I had was excellent 
435019,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, A very relaxed atmosphere and the staff were all very friendly and helpful Loved the chill out cushion area by the bar Hotel very conveniently located by the metro and the Sagrada Familia 
435020,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The hotel charged us 20 over what we were quoted by Booking com The hotel was close to the Sagrada Familia but was a little far from other attractions , The hotel is lovely with big comfortable rooms Roof terrace had fantastic views of the Sagrada Familia We also found some reasonable restaurants nearby 
435021,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, I thought the hotel felt a little scruffy in parts but my partner didn t agree so make what you will of that , Staff were very helpful and friendly The hotel is close to the Sagrada Familia Metro stop so I d recommend getting the Hola BCN travel card if you are planning on sightseeing It also covers airport travel and we used it every day Good value for money and it will help you cover much more of the city if you are only there for a few days like we were The hotel is also a great location for seeing the Sagrada Familia I d suggest booking your tickets online beforehand and trying to get there first thing We visited the church early on a Monday morning although it was in February and the crowds were more manageable It was getting much busier when we were leaving in the early afternoon 
435022,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The only thing that was not very satisfying was the construction outside It was a bit disturbing at night , My stay here was lovely The receptionist was so sweet that he gave us a room with the view of Sagrada Familia The location was wonderful 3 minutes away from Sagrada Familia and the subway station of line 5 The room was very clean and has plenty of space 
435023,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, No real restaurant This was also not clear for me when I booked the room My first room was very hot and was not able to cool it down the 2nd room was facing the street with good temperature but room was noisy , Location very close to Sagrada La Familia
435024,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Bed was terribly hard Too close together twin , Service When I told them my first night was like sleeping on the floor the bed was so so hard No effort to put a mattress topper onto the bed
435025,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The room was initially too hot but the consierge gave us a fan which cooled the room quite quickly , As my wife has mobility problems the larger walk in shower was a bonus All the hotel staff were courteous helpful and made our stay as pleasant as possible The twin bedded room was large enough to easily accommodate a mobility scooter 
435026,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, The staff were very helpful and went out of their way to ensure that my husbands surprise 40th birthday trip went to plan Very happy with the service 
435027,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Nothing, The receptions are so nice and professional They can help you reserve the ticket of church give you advice to visit the city give you the route of anywhere you want to go Such a nice experience to stay here I hope I can come back 
435028,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Only a little issue we hadn t had kettle in our room however they provided straight away a big jug of hot water at the bar for our request and apologised for the inconvenience , The Hotel is in a perfect location easy to get there by the local public transport from the Airport All the staff members were friendly and happy to help immediately if we had any question or issue Very tidy clean modern hotel beautiful view from the rooftop Thank you very much Ayre Hotel Rosellon we really enjoyed our stay in your hotel 
435029,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Our room was on quite a busy road and it s was quite noisy so ask for a room not on the road side, The room was cleaned every day to a good standard nice big comfy bed and lovely big bathroom very tasteful decoration excellent staff that were happy healthy and welcoming 
435030,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, WiFi is very slow and you need a special permission to get another gadget connected , Rooms and beds are very comfortable the view to Sagrada Familia proximity to metro the layout of the restaurant and friendly staff 
435031,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The frontdesk officer if Im not mistaken his named is Carlos He needs more training due to his unapproachable attitude and lack of customer service We came from night shift duty straight to Barcelona and stuck like forever in waiting area for check in and nobody cares The worst choice of booking I made amongst the holidays I booked in before I was enticed with the very catchy advertisement like 50 off but ended up paying more and cant do anything because we ll be charge if we made cancellation We felf being robbed indirectly for the price we paid for , Location was great and very accessible to different means of transportation I dont have any issues with cleanliness We enjoyed the buffet breakfast to be specific hot meals 
435032,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, The staff was amazing After traveling around Europe all day and arriving in my hotel around midnight it was wonderful to be greeted by such a warm and welcoming staff The view from my room was phenomenal Thank you 
435033,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The air con should still be adjustable in winter, The breakfast was excellent and the staff were very helpful The aircon in the room we were staying in wouldn t adjust below 20 degrees I asked if we could be moved room and this was done without any hesitation We were moved to an even room with a terrace 
435034,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Nothing, The location of the hotel is the best because it was just behind Sagrada Familia The buffet breafast was so good a healthy breafast The bed room was so clean and comfortable 
435035,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Just a little bit too far out from major attractions which meant you had to always start by getting on the metro or adding more distance to your walk, Friendly attentive staff Good size room with large bed Excellent breakfast including a glass of Carva Could not be any closer to Sagrada Familia and even closer to the metro to get you down town 
435036,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, The biggest and most comfy bed ever Super helpful and friendly staff Perfect location for SF Lots of bars and restaurant close by 3 mins from Metro Great roof terrace must be lovely in summer 
435037,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, We were in Room 413 On check in we were asked if we wanted to upgrade the room at cost as our room faced the street and was noisy sure enough it was very noisy with a lull at 3am till 5am It wouldn t have so bad but the window was 30 years old and did not shut properly The whole front window facade needs replacing I could have complained but did not as the rest of the hotel and staff were wonderful , Spotlessly clean with superb staff and a high class breakfast buffet Good location for Gaudi although somewhat remote from the action 
435038,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, Amazing localisation You get room service and the staff is always trying to help whenever they can There are a lot of restaurants close by as well as the metro 
435039,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Small parts of the hotel were a bit worn off made a bit of a cheapish impression But not as much as it would have had a bad influence on our stay One of the small things I would have liked would have been a bit more focus on sustainability lots of waste from the breakfast menu and so on , The view over to the Sagrada is just amazing both from the rooms and the rooftop terrace Very convenient for public transport nice breakfast and staff lovely amenities in the bathroom Lovely restaurants and shop in the area around the hotel Overall a very good choice 
435040,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Noise from the restaurant travelled to the room so early breakfast time was noisy That said good accommodation , This hotel is modern functional and in a good location for the Segrada Familia and access to the metro Was good value but then prices are variable depending on demand time of year Staff very good 
435041,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Their towel warmer didn t work for November trip and the hotel didn t have a solution for us to dry our laundry Parking lot is really for small to compact cars This is due to the support columns , Proximity to key places and the metro Balcony terrace Room with a view of the Sagrada Nite caps at the bar BCN Airport was a straight shot down the road a few miles 
435042,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Had to wait 20 mins bar As there were no staff Room was tiny glad I was solo Breakfast wasn t great mainly sweet food Some of the staff were great others seemed Confused , Location was amazing Great views nice and clean 
435043,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, The staff were outstandingly friendly helpful and knowledgeable The room was excellent We had a view over Sagradia Familie which was also a couple of minutes walk On our request the staff recommended places for dinner The first one was so good that we returned there each night for dinner 
435044,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, View from roof top bar terrace of the hotel over looking Sagrada Familia was spectacular Hotel staff could not do enough booking tickets for attractions for us and offering advice Location is a little walk away from the main tourist areas of the port beach but a very simple and quick ride on the metro solved that Meaning the whole of the city was easily accessible 
435045,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The first room we were given room 208 was right next to an atrium and extremely noisy We arrived late so we didn t realise this until we were woken before 7am with what sounded like hundreds of people in our room Once we complained we were given a room on the 8th floor which was perfect There is no way anyone should be put in room 208 it is disgraceful that the hotel would expect someone to pay for this room Only being there for two night half the trip was ruined I don t think we should have been charged for the first night, The second room we were given The staff changed our room as soon as we complained no questions asked so it must happen quite a lot 
435046,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, No coffee in the room , Great location near the Sagrada Familia and the Metro Many good restaurants nearby Felt very safe Great breakfast as well 
435047,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, the temperature inside the room was warm and there was no way I could adjust the ac to a lower temperature I called but nobody came to fix it I ended up opening the window to make the room a little bit cooler ,No Positive
435048,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Room was smaller than expected and the decor was also getting a bit worn in places which I thought could have been better given the price but overall very minor issues in what was a very good location , Very good location with views of the Sagrdia Familia and an upgrade on arrival so we also had a balcony for no extra charge Restaurant recommendations from reception staff were very good and the breakfast in the hotel was brilliant 
435049,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Nothing we loved it all , I have just left a glowing report on trip adviser too We paid the extra for a top floor room with the view of Sagrada Familia gorgeous The room was lovely and one of the best bathrooms we have seen in an hotel in a while Good lighting plenty of surfaces hooks on the door a good hair dryer too Very clean and spacious bedroom The roof top bar and restaurant was a joy for a late night night cap Great staff quite a young team with excellent customer service 
435050,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, What could be better than a view of the Sagrada Familia from your room This is a nice hotel within walking distance of great restaurants and some tourist attractions The rooms are a nice size and the staff is helpful 
435051,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Would have liked tea coffee facilities in the room as the bar downstairs stopped serving any drinks at 11 pm and it would have been nice to have a coffee when returning in the evening , Room was modern and bed was extremely comfortable Excellent housekeeping standards View of Sagrada sealed the deal Breakfast menu was extensive with self service bar and cooked to order selection Last but by no means least the staff were both friendly and helpful in particular Carlos on the reception desk Excellent location for visiting all the tourist attractions with metro stations less than 2 minutes walk from the hotel Would definitely stay here again 
435052,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Our room was not ready at check in and the room had some issues The Windows need replacing or to be re sealed as we heard every outside noise The a c fan was not enough to drown out the noise Bathroom door seemed as if someone tried to break it hinges were all off kilter This was a return trip to the hotel for us First time was wonderful not sure what has happened , The location is great Front desk staff friendly and helpful The public areas of the hotel are very nice The rooftop allows for fabulous views of the city 
435053,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Nothing, Cleanliness room furnishings view and staff were exceptional Highly recommended for a great hotel next to Sagrada Familia Staff in particular are terrific they go out of their way to please Very professional and helpful 
435054,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Nothing comes to mind, Bed was really comfy and a large queen size All the staff were extremely helpful we particular liked the 2 guys in the bar they were friendly and efficient
435055,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Roof top not open with service bar closed quite early no water in fridge on 3rd night, Helpful staff good parking nice idea of sofa loungers and access to laptop and printer good power shower
435056,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, All was great, Staff were lovely and the location is quiet but close to everywhere It was also near some great restaurants Rooms are cool and have lots of space 
435057,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Service at breakfast two out of four mornings no cups when asked the staff replied didn t have any Roof top terrace waste of time 1 night closed one night no barman had to buy drinks downstairs and carry them up eight floors One night barman covering room service and we had to ring reception to be served approx 20 minutes each time last night cycling function till after 22 00 The amount we paid did not reflect in the facilities service and overall standard of hotel expected a lot more , Food good
435058,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, That the terrace was closed at times due to functions This was a everyday during our trip, Staff were really friendly and helpful location is fantastic and view from the terrace was excellent Would defo recommend
435059,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The room is not very clean especially the floor under the bed many dust , The location is super 5 min walk to sagrada familia and the subway station u can enjoy the super church view from the roof bar breakfast are tasty the staff very nice and helpful 
435060,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Nothing, Very pleasant 3 night stay here Very clean comfortable quiet and brilliant staff Breakfast also good My favourite thing about the hotel was the roof top bar Amazing 
435061,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Room giving on the street was too noisy Terrace bar failed the caipirinha and margarita test The cafetaria on the ground floor did not deliver mediocre gazpacho and ham sandwich etc We did not try other dishes but on the day we tried this was not of the level expected from a 4 star hotel , The very welcoming and helpful staff at the reception Nice room with large bathroom a safe good lighting etc 
435062,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Temperature of the room You can t get it lower than 20 degrees but I feel the room is warmer than that , The staff are really very friendly and helpful I d like to give special mention to a couple of Desk agents David and Albert They were able to check me in early and check me out late 
435063,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, No proper control of the AC didnt like commimg back to a hot room whilst the rest of the hotel was cool, Good selection for breakfast tapas was good lovley terrace magic view secure parking
435064,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The air conditioning which was one of my criteria for booking was capped at min of 20 degrees and also turned off at night This made it not great to sleep and horrible when coming in from a day out The desk staff were unhelpful and acted like they didn t care , Terrace view was awesome the breakfast great value for money and the rooms well decorated

435080,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, We chose location as visiting Sagrada familia But that meant we were a bit out of the way Too busy on the rooftop bar for just 1 poor barman to cope with in the evening , Roof top bar had amazing views Loved view of Sagrada familia from our bedroom 
435081,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, It was difficult finding this location using GPS A street map may be needed for exact location , The terrace view of Sagrada Familia is absolutely breathtaking The hotel bar has delicious drinks with very heavy pours I highly recommend anyone visiting Barcelona to stay at this hotel

435085,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, I m sorry to say this but I really didn t enjoy my night sleep Too much noise from rooms next door I requested to change my room which they did and still noisy the constructions begin at 7 am you can hear everything even tho they placed me on the 7th floor The rooms are not sound proof but advertised as sound proof Best time to stay in this hotel is after 2026 when the construction finishes , Walking distance to Sagrada Familia 
435086,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, The location is great just a few meters from the Sagrada familia and the Metro Station a little park and playground just in front of the hotel The staff is very friendly and helpful The elegant room is equipped with very comfortable beds 
435087,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, The bed was very firm which was perfect after many hours of walking the 7 nights we spent there The location was great because it is near Familia Sagrada The hotel was clean and everything functioned well It was very quiet which was important to us The breakfast was great and the concierge and breakfast staff were very kind and responsive We asked for tickets to be printed for a reservation for dinner to be made and for a cab to be called Every request was met with a smile and action We really enjoyed the tranquil and kind atmosphere of this hotel We would stay again 
435088,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Check in staff did not mention the upstairs viewing deck only found out about it as we were checking OUT Not to be missed , Excellent location friendly staff clean and modern room

435090,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Pool was too small Looks like a hot tub size but water too cold to be a hot tub In summer would be nice to have had a pool , Front desk staff were friendly snd attentive Close to metro and familia sagrada 
435091,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Would have preferred fresh bath towels if the used ones we had hung up to dry in specific places were going to be folded and rearranged by cleaners We did not know whose towel was which the next day Small personal hygienic detail for staff to consider perhaps Loved everything else Thank you, Awesome friendly front desk staff and barmen barlady waiter waitress etc They set the tone for a wonderful brief two day two night stay 5 star rooftop view for chilling at the end of another intense exploring Barcelona day Will definitely highly recommend this hotel to fellow travelers Thank you
435092,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, The money paid was worth it alone purely for the view The view was stunning and the bar staff that ran the bar was very friendly I stayed for one day over Sant Joan and was worried about the noise but I encountered no such problem the friendly staff also help get me to locations where I could enjoy the evening the most Besides all this the hotel was literally immaculate 
435093,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Unfortunately the bar on the roof terrace is only open during certain hours , The hotel is in a great location just around the block from the Sagrada Familia We received a warm welcome from reception each time we entered the hotel The view from the rooftop bar was fantastic a great place to sit and enjoy a drink and the sun sets over Barcelona 
435094,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, No particular complaints about the stuff Eveyone is polite and all that but somwhow I didn t feel that I was welcome Never seen them smiling Overpriced , Licated right next to la Sagrada Familia Good hotel but nothing special except location 
435095,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Price was expensive over 200 Euro for Saturday night stay , My room was faced north which is opposit to Sagradafamilia But it was 8th floor has balcony it was very good and very close to the steps to go top of this building The view from the top of this building was so nice great to see Sagradafamilia 
435096,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Jacuzzi was never open Buffet breakfast was delicious but very confusing on how to pay for it Breakfast staff never asked for our egg orders and we had to chase people down to get them, Buffet was excellent and worth the price Location was unbeatable Staff was very helpful Amenities were extremely useful especially laundry service for when you are in the middle of a long tour of Europe 
435097,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Breakfast service seemed a little unorganised , The reception staff were a credit to the hotel chain and an excellent representation of the hotel itself Tasteful comfortable rooms The roof terrace was a peaceful haven beautifully furnished and offering spectacular views of the Sagrada Familia In an area away from the hustle and bustle of the centre of Barcelona but within very close proximity of the Metro and bus stops Safe underground parking a bonus 
435098,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, View on Sagrada from room not worth it As good from roof terrace and breakfast table Food for breakfast was good All other food to be avoided Bocadillo de Jamon Iberico was harder than Jamon Serrano bad quality Evening room service was lukewarm and fries not good at all, Great view on Sagrada Familia Good value for money breakfast Interestin location though not very central this was expected though 
435099,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Nothing special, A very nice hotel renovated and well decorated The room on the 5th floor had a view directly to Sagrada Fam lia and a Terrace on the last floor was fantastic 
435100,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, MINOR stuff Maid disregarded our Do Not Disturb sign each day to clean and was a bit overzealous with disposing of small items Breakfast buffet each day but one was cleared promptly without ANY mention that a clean sweep was coming and one day we seemed to be served by a guy who failed the drug screens at his last gig absent and forgetful No washcloths provided as per standard European hotel practice , Incredibly friendly and helpful staff were always there to lend a hand Upgraded to a view of the Sagrada Familia on arrival albeit in a smaller room We took it and weren t disappointed Rooftop terrace lounge has basilica views so good that it attract visitors from outside Friendly interesting ones Clean 
435101,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, What s not to like a guest Frenchman who was rude at breakfast but not the hotels fault, The room the breakfast and the helpfulness of the staff oh and a fabulous view of Sagrada Familia from the roof terrace 
435102,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, Great location near the cathedral 2min away from tourist buses subway restaurants and parks Best location in the city if you like small shops and don t like the crowd It s close to everything by public transportation very safe and pretty area 
435103,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, They have a beautiful lounge bar on the roof that has an awesome view of the basilica But the wait staff of one up there is TERRIBLE The jewel of this hotel is that terrace and it is set up with1 guy that is way over his head That s the way it was during our stay We complained to the front desk about it Incompetent We know there were others that had this issue as well terrible , Very nice hotel Affordable for the weekend but a little more than we wanted to pay Very close to La Segrada Familia Great view lounge on top of the roof that looks right at the La Segrada Familia Comfortable bed and room very clean Vibrant and modern The front desk staff was great very helpful 
435104,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Bed was slightly harder than my taste but this is very minor compared to how wonderful this hotel is , Staff extremely helpful expecially David They had full size umbrellas at the door which was wonderful since we had 4 rainy days Breakfast was amazing great selection and very fresh Location wonderful subway one block away and what can you say with Sagrada Familia right outside your window Rooms very quiet eventhough hotel is busy Highly recommend this hotel 
435105,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Location was a bit far from central sights requiring taxi bus metro or long walk Construction noise was disturbing Room did not offer temperature control , Location was excellent for visiting Sagrada Familia
435106,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Not impressed with the breakfast I had poached eggs with bacon and the plate was full of fat and water Coffee was cold , The staff were very helpful and the barman was good fun

435109,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, The hotel surpassed our expectations it was beautiful clean comfortable accessible staff were very helpful and friendly It made our stay in Barcelona that much better 
435110,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The street view room was dark and the bed was uncomfortable for us too firm I wouldn t say that this hotel is 3 5 4 stars as they claim but the location makes up for at least 5 of a star Think Holiday Inn or Quality Inn in terms of luxury , The terrace on the 8th floor was really nice I wish the bar had been open the two times we were up there over the weekend but alas no such luck Maybe in the summer high season The proximity to the Familia Sagrada is as good as they say it is if you do a 9 15 tour you can leave the hotel at 9 05 and you will be perfectly on time The room was an ok size for two people and the bathroom and shower were a good size too with moderate amenities 
435111,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, Fantastic location friendly and helpful staff delicious breakfast and very clean room When I checked in the front staff upgraded my room with a view so at night and in the early morning I could enjoy Sagrada Familia from my room window Worth statying even for a very short business trip 
435112,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Room needs some repairs and not happy with inside room window had only thin blind covering full window anyone wishing to look in could see us in bed this was a handicap room not comfortable with exposure, Location great near sites and ability to purchase tour bus ticket with discount a plus staff very knowledgeable of area and friendly I would book them again Great view from terrace
435113,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The fact that the room did not have an outside window do there was no natural light , The staff were excellent in every aspect and the room was very good 
435114,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The bed was large but very uncomfortable The mattress was very hard and we were restless every night The pillows were just as hard and thin as the bed The shower was okay it was weird how the glass was very small which caused us to make a mess on the floor with water The shower pressure was not string at all but it was hot , Room was clean but no complimentary water which would have been nice Very small room but it was clean Breakfast was good and hot meal options were provided I thought breakfast was a value Good location and close to the Metro About a 15 20 walk to the city center so use the metro to save steps 
435115,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The roomed not very big and sound insulation is not very good , Location is good 2 min walking to the subway station breakfast also not bad hotel looks very modern inside u can rent motorbike from hotel 
435116,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Breakfast was quite expensive at 13 euros Some rooms have the sound of traffic but we still loved it , Location was fantastic with view of Sagrada Familia and very close to an underground station with easy links to other attractions The room was modern and comfortable The staff were great

435119,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Check your hotel bill carefully I had the small breakfast every day and that was missed but I was charged for the buffet breakfast I reviewed my bill the day before I left and brought this to their attention and it was corrected no problem Also my room was booked and paid in advance through Booking com however the hotel duplicated the full room charge after I departed over 660 Euros even though on checkout I had confirmed with the front desk that the room had been paid in full in advance The duplicate charge was posted to my credit card after I arrived home so I contacted Booking com and the issue was corrected took a couple of days Hint make sure you stay on top of the exchange rate because the refund is often less than the charge so it takes extra effort to get full credit , Clean quiet and great location My room 702 had an awesome view of the Sagrada Familia and there s also a lovely rooftop lounge area with an even better view The Sagrada metro stop is just around the corner and a block away so it was convenient cheap and easy to access other parts of Barcelona Hint download the free Barcelona Metro App The buffet breakfast has lots of variety and hot dishes included are made to order If you re not a big breakfast eater there s also an option to have a small breakfast for about one third of the buffet price Details are on a card in your hotel room so make sure you read it Staff were great and spoke English well At check in I asked about getting a manicure and the gentleman at reception advised me of two places nearby and even though I don t speak Spanish the shop down the street did a great job I also have to mention that Nerea a young dynamic lady who works in the lounge makes the best Sangria 
435120,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Bed not of very high standards I did not manage to put the heating on Quite expansive when I was there but it is true that it was a very high occupancy week, View o the Sagrada Famillia Bathroom small but with a nice shower Really good value for money breakfast real orange juice good pastry eggs cooked on demand 
435121,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The view on Sacrada Familia is not as good as it is shown on the photos on the website We booked a room with view on Sacrada Familia and got a room in the 4th floor from where we just have seen the towers because of the buildings between the hotel and Sacrada Familia ,No Positive
435122,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, No coffee facilities and decor a little tired but probably being extra fussy as work in the industry , Friendly staff comfy bed great view of Sagrada Familia and great breakfast 
435123,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, No water boiler at the room Noisy even though I paid extra to get a room away from street You can t control the air condition temperature at the room You can t turn off the light next to the window, Extremely helpful staff Nice location with many restaurants around When they call a taxi it takes 30 secs to arrive Nice view of Sagrada
435124,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Ordered pizza on arrival Tasted like a frozen one heated up which was a disappointing first impression Didn t eat dinner in hotel for duration of stay Also woke up with suspected bed bug bites on the last morning all over arm Hot breakfast could have been more varied , Service from staff was excellent Very polite and helpful Size of rooms was great and beds were comfortable The view of the cathedral was amazing 
435125,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Don t know, A smart modern hotel ideal for a short break because of its location Weather not warm enough yet 1st March to have breakfast on upstairs terrace overlooking Sagrada Familia but hope to return when it is Bed a little firm but would you believe it they replaced all the rooms with new materessess on the 2nd day of our stay They also observed a birthday card in our room and gave us a bottle of wine and put up a banner wishing my husband Happy Birthday
435126,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, there were no tea coffee making facilities in the room no soft seat Would have to pay 13 euros for a breakfast so really rather expensive for a bed only Especially as not yet into summer season , The room was nicely situated with a view and a short walk to the terrace And quiet with enough space for us Location was useful for Sagrada Familia the metro and eating out 
435127,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The window in our room didn t close properly so it was rather cold in there when we came back in the evening the airconditioning couldn t run while we re out , The breakfast was awesome the location perfect and the staff very nice and friendly 
435128,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Facilities to make hot drinks in rooms, There were some problems with lights and shower these were fixed within 20 minutes i did not even have to ask for them to be fixed They waited for me to be in the room before they would enter to fix light and washer on shower
435129,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The room was hot and very noisy the front desk said that they would have the AC on but it never was , The location is the best thing about this hotel The room was very hot and noisy
435130,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, For the handicapped the metro was very hard to use There was a lot of climbing Not the hotels fault but something to keep in mind when choosing a location , The room had everything one could want and the staff were helpful in giving directions 
435131,Ayre Hotel Rosell n,No Negative, Staff very helpful Had use of free internet plus pc and printer to print of tour tickets Excellent breakfast buffet with bacon sausages and eggs included 
435132,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, The taxi driver was trying to rip us off We booked the cab with a hotel Taxi driver was talking very loudly during our drive back to the airport at one point he started making notes when still driving with one hand on wheel When we got to the airport although the meter said 36 he added 19 on the top of it which we said we are not going to pay He could not speak any English so this wasn t useful at all My advice for others is to book a private cab over the Internet , Amazing stuff always very helpful Location itself is great as metro is a few meters away only room quite big and a bathroom has a nice big shower The view from terrace is amazing Highly recommend it 
435133,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, It would ve been useful if the reservation hotel manager knew about shuttle bus schedule We were waiting for the bus only to find out that it only picks up people on Sundays during low season However they did manage to call a taxi for us to take to the train station , The baguette was surprisingly good coffee not so much The room assigned to us was huge and overlooking part of the mountain The bed was comfortable room is clean The water pressure was very good Would ve been nice if they provided free bottles of water 
435134,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Room HOT, Everything about this hotel is perfect we had a stunning view of Sagrada Familia which is well worth paying extra for Our room was too hot and you couldn t control the air conditioning but the receptionist went out of his way to supply a fan at 4am which rescued our nights sleep When our flight was cancelled due to air strike I booked another night online rang reception and they agreed instantly to let us stay in our same room Staff are the most welcoming friendly and helpful I ve met in any hotel Will be nack

435195,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, Only complaint would be that the roof terrace wasn t staffed constantly and when I tried to call reception I had no response , Location was fantastic views of La Sagrada Famillia and less than a 5 minute walk to the metro station Rooms were simply decorated and the wardrobe had a large number of coat hangers which made a nice change Staff were very friendly and helpful

435199,Ayre Hotel Rosell n, I wouldn t book this hotel for a view of the Sagrada Famously it is shrouded in scaffolding and netting and the view was pretty appalling to be honest Book this hotel for its proximity to not view of the Sagrada The view was a bit of a let down but not the fault of the hotel Obviously the view will improve with the work on the building in about 100 years time , Location was as good as they come right behind the Sagrada Familia There was an issue with the window which wouldn t close and therefore the noise outside of a barking dog They moved us to another room no problem Room was compact a bit of style over comfort but absolutely fine Breakfast had a good choice cereals and coffee and a cooked option we were offered the cooked option on morning 1 but not morning 2 we were rushing for the airport and didn t have time to chase this by the time we realised we weren t going to be asked by breakfast staff for our cooked choice
