107032,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Bit cleaner in the bedroom but bathroom was spotless Bed seemed twins pushed together, Comfortable room with good clean bathroom Central location near Moorgate 
107033,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Chose online to arrive at hotel at 11 AM Room was unavailable until 2 PM and weren t notified until we were at reception Food and drink was expensive , Staff were very friendly Room was fantastic and roof top bar was a great experience 
107034,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Loved everything apart from room was at the bottom of restaurant bar stairs so noisy on the first night but no noise on other nights stayed for 3 nights staff apologised and a free breakfast was given, Absolutely gorgeous hotel luxurious in every way amazing bargain felt so expensive great touch of bottle of red wine cake and fruit free sent to the room and bottle of prosecco and cake for our friends too glass of prosecco on arrival and apples to take as and when you liked Extremely friendly staff couldn t do enough the bed was amazing so big and comfy lovely hotel 
107035,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The pool was a little small but otherwise great The touch pad in the room was sometimes a little temperamental also especially the air con function which was frustrating as the room was very hot when we arrived No windows either so this was too warm for us Luckily it was a beautiful night so had drinks on the rooftop bar which was great , Amazingly comfy bed and the whole stay was just perfect Staff were very friendly and helpful and made to feel at home straight away 
107036,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The light on the control pannel did not turn off at night and was extremely light and kept us up most of the night Our button for room service did not work having us go down at 11pm to order food , decor was lovely Beds were comfortable 
107037,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The breakfast was a total disappointment They do not do hot food just a buffet style breakfast that consisted of a few slices of dry bread cereal some miserable pieces of cheese and smoked salmon Was such a let down as the hotel is so great and has so much to offer , The hotel was lovely amazing bedroom and great view from the rooftop terrace I especially liked the welcome glass of prosecco on arrival 
107038,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, Stayed here for the weekend with my mum and would highly recommend it Overall this is a beautiful hotel it s well located with good transport links and great shopping and food options nearby and the staff are friendly and helpful at all times In particular Decio at reception when we were checking in and the concierge Daniel during our stay There was a small issue with our room but it didn t negatively impact our stay at all as it was dealt with efficiently by the staff with almost no inconvenience to us The lighting in the rooms is the standout feature and creates a beautiful and relaxing ambiance 
107039,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, We could not use the nice roof terrace because we were in company of children , Relative new hotel with every comfort good location and parking facilities next door Not far from Underground station 
107040,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Drinks on the roof terrace are pricey but you re paying for the view, The staff were so friendly especially the lady on reception She gave us prosecco The rooms were great very modern with large tv with sky The spa was lovely and the view from the roof terrace was amazing
107041,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Few things need improvement The bar prices were expensive as was the usual mini bar mini extortion racket When will hotels grasp the concept of reasonable mini bar rates I took my own drink for the room The rooftop bar although nice the wait times for a drink were way too long It was a young trendy atmosphere on the terrace All nice people I just felt at 50 a little out of place We ordered room service later at night and it just didn t turn up This wasn t a problem as we fell asleep waiting but should be addressed in a hotel in this price range , The bed was extremely comfortable and the ac worked well Bathroom was really nice The rooftop bar had a great view and all staff were very attentive On arrival we were upgraded and a second drink preseco was offered The food in the restaurant and our waiter a guy from Morocco were excellent 
107042,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The location and the staff The front desk staff at check in was on the phone when we arrived at it We waited patiently and she was obviously annoyed at the phone call and transferred her bad mood to us After we have checked into the room we phoned the front desk to inquire a room with a tub in the bathroom The same lady at check in said she would call back but never did So we went down with our belongings and asked again for a bathroom with tub She got furious and said the hotel was fully booked Wow nowadays 5 star hotels seem to have preference for employees with bad English and bad mood , The cleanliness of the room 
107043,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The t v was unnecessarily complicated and when we asked for someone to come up and show us how it worked no one came We did not eat breakfast at the hotel very expensive but we did get coffee in the morning It was good but overpriced 2 coffees were around 10 00 Canadian The hotel has a gym but it is very small with very little floor space to move Once you have 6 people in there it s packed While we were there the AC was not working so only the machines were available the first day and although it was completely open the next day the AC had still not been repaired We only lasted about 20 minutes before we got too hot The staff was friendly but not particularly helpful For example we asked the concierge to look into getting Wimbledon tickets for us He said he would call us the next morning and he never did We also asked the housekeeping staff for a lighter blanket for the bed and got no response , The bed was comfortable and the AC worked well The lighting was very high tech You could control all the lights from the bed which was nice The shower was very good with a nice big shower head and good water pressure The bathroom was spacious and clean The location was central and there was easy access to transportation 
107044,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, I did not like staying at your hotel I was woken up at 7 45 by the sound of drilling I ordered porridge and black coffee Which took over an hour to arrive and was cold 
107045,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Breakfast food was very overpriced for quality eggs benedict was weatherspoons standard and you only got a single muffin egg really poor Spa is not really that great lighting is far too bright and not relaxing at all Doesn t feel very private either could be much better , Rooms are great staff are great roof top bar is great discount price made it worth the stay and was so close to my office 
107046,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Disappointed to obviously have room allocation changed in front of me at check in Have stayed here 3 times recently and previously had great experiences On the card I was allocated room 516 left my signature and then receptionist disappeared and can back with keys to a basement room Very poor explanation added to a stay,No Positive
107047,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, I went to the Montcalm Royal London House with my brother for the weekend and I was totally pleased with the stay We were welcomed with a glass of Prosecco and the woman at the reception was very friendly and helpful The room was just perfect The bed is huge and comfortable the bathroom is spacious the shower is amazing and even the TV is larger than at every other hotel I ve ever been to The whole hotel is very new and modern but it still made me feel very cozy The spa is fantastic there is a pool a Whirlpool a sauna and a steam bath and I think you can have various massages and treatments Another highlight of the hotel is the rooftop bar Aviary You have an amazing view over London and the cocktails taste fantastic The location of the hotel is very good but you have to know that some stores are closed at the weekend because it s in the financial district but it s not a big problem because it s also very close to Shoreditch a vivid neighbourhood with plenty of restaurants stores clubs and pubs 
107048,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, We were in one of the more expensive rooms the Montcalm Club We were disappointed to find this was on the first floor with no view and quite noisy in the mornings In all other hotels in this price range we have stayed in the Club rooms would be much better located The staff in the restaurant also seemed poorly trained which was disappointing given the prices Two of our table of four asked for drinks and the waiter walked off without asking if anyone else wanted one The restaurant was quite empty when we were there yet we were served by about 7 different people during the meal which felt quite amateurish , Very comfortable bed big bathroom good location lovely rooftop bar 
107049,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, Welcome complimentary drinks super friendly professional staff deep pile carpets Nespresso coffee machine in room super king size super comfortable bed great view from the rooftop terrace over modern London Overall a comfortable relaxed atmosphere 
107050,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The card is not smart we tried severals times and asked the staff manager to help us she was in sooooo bad attitude what she said was show me how you open the door like you are STUPID What amazing happened is that this room 107 actually had been arranged to some other guests and she was still focusing on she opening the door with pride SHE OPENED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OTHER GUESTS ROOM and then we explained to her at that time she was still so impatient and finally she realised her mistakes and gave us room109 This is the worst experience we have in Booking JUST HER TERRIBLE OTHER STAFFS ARE GOOD Btw our bike was stolen in front of the hotel in 10 meters far soooooooo bad feeling DISAPPOINT Good luck with you guys ,No Positive
107051,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The only discordant feature of our stay was our experience at The Aviary The kitchen was very slow We waited for our dinner for 45 minutes and the cheerful but somewhat inexperienced staff didn t offer us bread or anything to eat while we waited Our dinners were good when they finally arrived but the wait was considerably longer than it should have been , The Montcalm Royal London House is a lovely upscale property with a welcoming and efficient staff Our room was larger than many London hotel rooms beautifully appointed and very comfortable and quiet I loved access to the Club facilities and the continental breakfast provided there The whole place has a young vib mostly for better The staff is extremely helpful welcoming and courteous The facilities are of high quality and design The pool in the spa is small but beautiful We throughly enjoyed our stay We also found the area gave great access to all of the central London locations and sights we were interested in seeing 
107052,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, View from the room was awful Lack of information at times let it down somewhat , Excellent location near to Moorgate tube station Very modern and clean Loved the lighting and electronic control pads in rooms for lighting Views from the top floor were fantastic 
107053,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Only thing I can complain about is I booked this hotel so my partner and I could enjoy drinks on our nights stay on the rooftop but unfortunately we weren t allowed up due to a private party going on that we weee not made aware of, Location good Got upgraded as it was my birthday and in my room was left a lovely mini cake bottle of red wine and fruit platter Loved the Hermes products shower was amazing bed large and very comfortable free bottled water coffee machine and smart phone to use while you stay Couldn t fault the staff very helpful I can not wait to return here 
107054,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The room smelt really bad every night The staff told us we were upgraded but the room was tiny Can t imagine what the size of the room would be normally ,No Positive
107055,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, n a, The members of staff I interacted with throughout my stay were the best very friendly cheerful and helpful The quality style and cleanliness of the hotel was second to none As a lone business woman visiting the city I felt very safe and secure staying here I will definitely book this hotel again on my next trip to London 
107056,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, We were directed to the buffet breakfast on the Sunday as the roof restaurant we had been to the days before was closed There was literally no food just a row of empty plates when I asked the manager if anything could be done to help she was rude and patronising See my pic for the buffet breakfast , The concierge
107057,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Need more information re hotel restaurants timings, The bed bedding was sooo comfortable The breakfast was amazing All the staff were lovely
107058,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The carpet wasn t very clean and there was a long dark hair in our fridge Staff on door of roof top bar not as friendly as rest of hotel , The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely 
107059,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Nothing , Staff very pleasant couldn t do enough for you Lovely touches bottle of wine fruit and chocolates on arrival Lovely rooms clean comfy and modern all that you need 
107060,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, This is a new hotel and it is very modern We were very impressed with the facilities including Sky TV in the room safe and minibar The bathroom was very clean and had a great shower including underfloor heating The room was operated by a very modern touch screen interface Great bar downstairs serving snacks and drinks with a couple of table games not sure what they were though There is also a restaurant at the top level with roof top bar which is impressive There is parking in a NCP right outside which is discounted by the hotel For a hotel of this standard I thought it was remarkably good value Breakfast was downstairs and good although fruit wasn t offered in this buffet although I think if asked for it would be supplied Can t fault it 
107061,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, Beautiful room amazing shower and very nice toiletries The smart tv and Nespresso machine in the room were a bonus Great roof top bar with amazing views Short walk to Liverpool street Moorgate or Old Street tube stations 
107062,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Having to pay extra for cooked breakfast if you were staying in the Montcalm Club Double room Also the towels in the bathroom had brown stains on The panel for the lights kept breaking Service for dinner was slow , Rooftop bar
107063,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, There was literally nothing that I didn t like, The service was world class everyone has been trained to provide top notch comfort and service I honestly love coming back to this place If you can request for a junior suite it is worth the money 
107064,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, There was nothing I didn t like, This is the 3rd visit this year so obviously I find it a wonderful experience Staff are friendly and eager to help Room comfortable and clean Room controls easy to use big sky TV mini bar which I didn t use but able to keep a sandwich cool Spa facility was lovely now have the beauty room but didn t use it this time In fact I can t think of anything that I didn t like and I will certainly return in the future 
107065,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, My room was on the 9th floor one floor below the restaurant bar The noise from above was audible but worse after they shut It sounded as though they were moving furniture around for about 2 hours afterwards to such an extent my bed was actually shaking, Room was very clean with good facilities 
107066,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, There were no available appointments in the spa even though I called a week before and was told I wouldn t need to pre book book before arrival for treatments the following day Was a little disappointing but the staff were apologetic and helpful in finding an alternative local spa , Beds were very comfortable the bathroom toiletries were Hermes and of a very high quality Everything was perfect 
107067,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, We chose not to include breakfast as it seemed quite expensive , The staff were amazing welcoming courteous and nothing was too much trouble The bed was so comfortable and the upgraded room cocktails and gifts an added bonus to our special weekend Highly recommend this hotel 
107068,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Maybe more information about the facilities at check in would have been useful But I checked in very late , Everything was very comfortable and just right One can see that a lot of thought was put into that 
107069,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, I felt the level of service from the staff all areas including reception bar restaurant was not to a standard of a 5 star hotel Check in was awful Said i hadn t paid when i had and i was made to wait 30 mins before allowing me upstairs when they had found my payment No apology made Restaurant staff breakfast in the Aviary were awful I had to get up and go and get someone from near the kitchen as all the staff had deserted so they could take my order and they forgot my tea twice so i had breakfast with no drink No apologies made Bar closed at midnight Weren t allowed another drink even though we were staying in the hotel , Location was great and the hotel was very beautiful view from the roof bar is amazing 
107070,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, I would have voted higher but the concierge was at times very rude and condescending which was disappointing when everything else was so good, Great style great rooms nice receptionists great roof top bar good location
107071,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, It was a little pricey but apart from that nothing , The bed was amazing And the hotel was very stylish I also loved that when checking in you got a free glass of presseco 
107072,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Worst bed ever Far too soft for anyone Back ache every morning Duvet was very heavy down and too thick for summer freezing if I took it off but no sheet so cooking if I left it on Room poorly designed for 2 people No drawers to store anything TV directly above desk made it impossible for my husband to work whilst I had the TV on Crazy system for lighting Give me a switch any time over this electronic panel , Location was good for our purposes Close to tube Nice park across the street Staff good helpful 
107073,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Nothing really, Staff were brilliant very friendly smiley but also very professional We felt very welcome when we checked in and also were given a glass of something refreshing and fizzy as we checked in a great start to our weekend Rooftop bar is fantastic and a real destination bar however it is a little expensive We were without our children but noted that there were families there and the downstairs bars were very family friendly we thought that you could go in there with the children play some games and have a few drinks better than the usual of being confined in the room with them in the evening 
107074,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Hotel guests should have priority access or guest list access to the rooftop bar The queue was huge as expected as its lovely up there but as we had dinner plans there wasn t time to pop up for a quick drink before heading out as the wait was over 30 minutes , They put us in a disabled room to begin with which isn t required which was not what we had paid for A quick phone call to reception and I was moved to the right room Good response however I should have been put in the right room to begin with We had the Club Deluxe the room was nice a little dark but otherwise fine Nice touch when booking club is the club lounge access which offers continental breakfast free drinks good spirits on offer as well and canap s 
107075,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Poor service receiving luggage to the room Waited ages only to find out luggage had gone to a different room then had to personally chase it , Excellent rooms Bed really comfortable Great location for exploring London 
107076,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Pillows terrible too soft rooftop bar too busy not much choice of room service food alcohol prices room service extortionate, Room and air con good shower excellent nice lunch at the bar barmaid excellent

107078,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, We were kindly upgraded to a Montcalm Club Double which allowed us access to the executive lounge with free drinks and canapes from seven to eleven pm and a free continental breakfast which was lovely This room also has a view of Finsbury Square to the front of the hotel which is pretty The rooms have great facilities lovely furniture including one of the comfiest beds we have stayed in Everything was in order and as you would expect The Aviary bar restaurant is a must Very cool with stunning views and buzzing vibe We will definitely book here again Thank you Montcalm for a fantastic stay 
107079,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Firstly I got allocated a basement room where its all dark and I had to complain for my room to be changed to the 6th floor The management staff at the roof top restaurant are very rude to guests and are inconsiderate ,No Positive
107080,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, No view from the room at all which was very disappointing very disappointed to be honest I wanted to book something special for my wife s 40th birthday so chose this hotel based on reviews won t be doing that again And the staff service at breakfast was woeful not acceptable in any way shape or form they did not seem to care I have had better service and certainly better views I could have booked a Holiday inn or premiere inn for half the price and got better service and maybe a view , Room was very clean and tidy
107081,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Beds and pillows were poor quality for such a new hotel Missing items from the mini bar on arrival including coffee TV volume is set so low you can t hear it Bar on the roof had alot of missing cushions so limited seating Only 1 patio heater working and no seating inside , Staff r helpful and polite Good location
107082,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The bus stop in front of the hotel entrance was a bit off putting and that the walk to the underground on heels was a little uncomfortable , A glass of fizz offered at reception while waiting to check in 
107083,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Nothing, Loved the very friendly staff who looked after us so well the room was so clean and modern The breakfast was fab and just everything about the hotel was luxurious and will definitely be back 
107084,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Not being able to stay for longer, The hotel is absolutely amazing Couldn t fault it Exceeded expectations and have already booked to come back in two weeks time

107086,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, No negative points Only we stayed there for the 10th birthday of our daughter which we mentioned upon arriving They told us she could expect a surprise but nothing happened But no big deal We had a terrific time , Very luxurious hotel nice atmosphere very beautiful interiors little art deco Just perfect Oh wait very good beds as well 
107087,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Room service food was barely warm Had to ring operator housekeeping concierge several times before I received an answer, Really comfortable bed and pillows Nice big shower don t need a bath Food really good on the 10th floor A very pleasant stay overall
107088,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, I didn t like how the hotel get his payment To day I was informed by bank that the hotel is holding almost 2 nights charge this amount will be return after 2 weeks as the bank informed even though I paid in full while checking out Isn t better since they hold this as pre authorization to deduct this amount once the gust arrived and once the gust is leaving he will pay for the remaining night ,No Positive
107089,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, Great location great value staff did everything possible to ensure we had a great stay in the hotel was even surprised with a complimentary bottle of red wine and cake both of which were really tasty waiting for us in our room when we arrived back from a night at the theatre Amazing facilities and the view from the rooftop bar at night is beautiful Have stayed numerous times now and will definitely stay again 10 10
107090,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, Excellent communication with the hotel It was my partners birthday I let the hotel know this They arranged a birthday cake card a bottle of bubbly to be in the room for our arrival Very nice touch 
107091,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Nothing , Perfect location amazing view from the rooftop terrace Attentive conscientious staff and the most amazing concierge Mr Adrian We will return 
107092,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, None, The reception staff were fantastic made to feel very welcome and comfortable after s long drive from the south coast Excellent service from offering to take our luggage to the room down to having the entrance door opened every time for us with a greeting 
107093,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Unfortunately the sheets were quite hard and starchy not as expected for a 5 star Also the staff in the Aviary might need a bit more training we have a restaurant booking for lunch which was actually a surprise I had an email confirming my reservation and they could not find it even though the restaurant was empty they continued to look for the reservation and looked at my phone a no of times keeping us waiting about 5 minutes rather then just show us to another table It was slightly unprofessional especially as we were there in London as a surprise to our friends who were due to arrive any second Finally we got a table and explained it was surprise please show our friends to our table needles to say they did not manage to do that and we had to walk up to our friends Other things like pouring tap water on top of our sparkling water But luckily the manager noticed this and replaced the bottle and simply saying goodbye to diners as we left the restaurant we passed about 7 staff including the lady at the front of house and no one said anything It might be just teething as I believe its a new restaurant Food location etc were all great , The interior design of the hotel is great very stylish You know you are in a 5 star hotel 
107094,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, We returned back at 15 15 and our room had not been cleaned they came at around 15 45 however that was not convenient they suggest they come when we were out in the evening which they did however only did half a job We have stayed at lots of 4 and 5 star hotel here and in the USA this is a good 4 star The staff were of 5 star standard other than the cleaning organiser, Good roof top bar however at 10 for a pint of larger it was too expensive even for London
107095,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, I was given a room for disabled people and the sink was very low which gave me a back pain every time I needed to use it also there was no curtain doors separating the shower from the rest of the bathroom which made a huge mess every time I took a shower Also there was one day that the room was not cleaned organized so I had to call them to come and do it after I came back from a long working day , Breakfast was really good Bed was comfortable Staff was very nice Excellent location from the training venue I complained about the things I did not like at the check out and they offered the food I have had during the stay for free 
107096,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Hotel setting not quite in line with its qualities Maybe Islington Council could be persuaded to improve the garden facilities on Finsbury Square Internal view from bedroom was also not very inviting , Excellent Guest Experience Team particularly Sinitta who went above and beyond when my husband was taken ill prior to our stay offering support and advice should the need to rearrange our booking been necessary Every member of the staff that we came into contact with were without a doubt skilled in their various roles and made us feel very welcome A very nice gesture on our arrival cake and drinks to celebrate our wedding anniversary Loved Aviary a great rooftop terrace Burdock was very relaxing for a drink and a lighter meal and the Spa facilities were fabulous A 5 minute walk from Moorgate and 10 minutes from Liverpool Street 
107097,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Rooftop restaurant and bar is a highlight but if you like calm in the evening on a Friday you won t get it as it is VERY popular with non residents If you want a bath rather than a shower check when you book Not problems for us just an observation for others , Fantastic top quality service and finish as you expect from Montcalm Rooftop restaurant and bar is a highlight but very popular with non residents 
107098,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Nothing we disliked this hotel exceeded our expectations in every way , Reception staff were extremely helpful and friendly Couldn t do enough for us The room was immaculate clean and very modern Great views from the roof top bar 
107099,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, THE AREA AROUND THE HOTEL CLOSES DOWN AT WEEKENDS SONNOT A LOT OF PLKACES OPEN ITS IN FINACIAL DISTRICT, FACILITYS GOOD GYM SAUNA ECT ROOFTOP BAR GREAT VIEWSIT IS EXPENSIVE PRICE WISE FOR SPIRIRS ECT
107100,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Downstairs bar was lovely but a little pricey for dinner for what we ate , Luxury bedrooms and bathroom with LCD light switches Lovely staff Gorgeous rooftop bar with amazing views 
107101,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, Staff were genuine friendly and welcoming The room was stylish with a fantastic view and a few extra little birthday touches were really appreciated I felt so comfortable and didn t want to leave We will definitely be back
107102,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The bed was a bit squishy and felt like it was on an angle But that s just nit picking really the room was very nice and we slept well regardless , Welcomed with a glass of prosecco Room was standard but well appointed and had a great shower And a view of Finsbury Square We were there for a birthday and the staff put out a bottle of wine and a lovely card which was a very nice touch

107107,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The property Itself was flawless , Rooms were large and comfort The hermes inside the bathrooms were a really nice touch and the touch pad commands for lights air con heating and under floor heating was fabulous 
107108,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Their continental breakfast needs an upgrade very little choice and mediocre quality for a 5 Design is very modern but quite sterile and too dark , Amazing bed spacious and bright room clean and comfortable Great rooftop bar with good cocktails 
107109,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, You should not put guests in a room which has a folddown bed and try and explain that it s an upgrade because it s on the 9th floor The beds and these rooms are not consistent with the quality of offering that a hotel of this standing should be upholding An almost sleepless night Terrible, Location
107110,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, There were several technical glitches and although they were taken care of by the hotel staff super quickly it was somewhat annoying to have to come from the office late in the evening and find out something went wrong The lights and air conditioning were controlled by a digital panel which failed a couple of times Another night the safe would not open Another night the desk light had to be replaced And several times the keycard did not work Overall I was satisfied with my stay here but not sure I would return , The room was comfortable and the staff and service was really great The shower was amazing It was big and spacious the water pressure was awesome and the large shower head was great The location was good too Walking distance from many atractions 
107111,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Bathroom wasn t cleaned to standard Towels where replaced but floors where left as is and not wiped clean Had no hot water for shower my first evening there , Very comfortable bed

107113,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Unfortunetly we found a few blonde hair in the bed but other than that everything was perfect, The hotel is absolutely beaitiful There are staff to help you with your luggage on arrival Staff are so polite helpful the rooms are beautiful aswell great room size big bed the bathroom is lovely clean also I liked the control panel that indicated wether we wanted the room cleaning or not to be disturbed and then that will show outside the door The location is really good too a few minutes walk from some shops and food places 
107114,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Bar service on the terrace could have been better Breakfast was maybe a little overpriced , Spacious rooms good view from the roof Good value for money in a good location Free bottle of prosecco on arrival which made the stay that little bit more special 
107115,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The mattress was quite soft Enjoyed the Nespresso machine but small cups and only four pods provided each day prior to contacting reception , Very spacious room huge bed great hotel facilities both Burdock and The Aviary bars are beautiful in room kitchenette was handy

107209,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The tech in the room did not always seem to work the lights wouldn t come on all the time and things which were said to be involved were not We were told it would be made special for valentines and that would be complimentary but there was nothing For the price I feel this was a shame , The room is clean and comfortable It is a comfortable bed The shower is nice though not very powerful 
107210,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, Location close to the tube station The room was spacious and the bed was amazing I particularly liked the tablet that allowed us to control the heating and lights The hotel offers a smartphone with internet access for use during the stay The staff was kind and helpful I will definitely stay here again 
107211,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Parking opposite was very expensive but not the fault of the hotel, Everything it was our wedding weekend and the hotel could not have done more for us Outstanding
107212,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, I arranged for the hotel to put in Balloons Confetti and a cake into our room as it was my partner s birthday but they forgot to do this , Room was a lovely size and very comfortable Great ensuite too Went to the Modern Pantry restaurant very close to hotel for breakfast absolutely delicious 
107213,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, very good hotel nice people and service good breakfast helpful in everything and for everything nice location in the finance part of london close to few metro station 
107214,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Breakfast in bed took over 2 hours to arrive and it took multiple calls to room service to get it Breakfast was overpriced and underwhelming , Very clean Receptionist were helpful Restaurant staff need more training 
107215,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Only one bath robe in our room Pubic hairs on the bed White stain on the pillow Room service took over 25 minutes so had to phone and re ask where it was Charging 5 for the tray is rediculus as if we didn t pay enough as it is Chair was wet on roof top bar boyfriend felt it then told staff it was wet they made sure they felt it before drying it As if we would lie about this Had the burger for dinner from the roof top bar they said it would be well done it was more like cremated , Very friendly staff Lovely roof top bar 
107216,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, I can t fault this hotel at all but it will be nice when their Elemis consultants and services are running as they are not in place the moment but only a minor detail , The hotel was very modern with high tec facilities but it was the staff that made my visit incredible Nothing was too much for them They had put gifts in my room for my special event which involved a great amount of thought and research on their part The spa was gorgeous lovely pool and Jacuzzi I can t recommend this hotel highly enough in fact I have booked to go again I wouldn t use any other hotel now when I visit London

107218,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, I was charged some sort of deposit after I arrived and paid the full balance for our stay This deposit resulted in twice the amount of money our booking cost in total being taken from my bank account and taking three working days to be replaced This was a large inconvenience to me being a student who travels a lot I was left without this money heading to the Netherlands less than 48 hours later I am aware some hotels do take this precautionary measure however I was never made aware that this money would be taken upon arrival and when I asked about it as I was checking out I felt as though the issue was belittled and brushed off without it being fully explained to me This may not be an issue to others but for me it is something which would hold me back from returning despite everything else being superb , The Handy smartphone you re given to use for the duration of your stay which allows you to have 3G on the go as well as being able to use it as a phone while staying in London to make any necessary calls without roaming charges was definitely a great addition which really helped us to get around As well as this the spa facilities are excellent 
107219,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, We were on a short break in London so only stayed here for two nights but will hopefully come back for longer next time We couldn t fault the accommodation as it was spotlessly clean and comfortable The staff also were very friendly and helpful

107221,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, If you booked through their website you are able to choose the pillow type and room scent but they didn t reply to my request sent via Booking Aside from that the pillows were not the most comfortable I also expected more from the interior design Not that there s anything wrong with it but it s not as stylish or elegant as I had expected , The location was good especially for anyone flying in via Stansted airport or anyone travelling via Liverpool Street The bed was very comfy I especially loved that they provided a cellphone with unlimited data local calls and etc As to the hotel it is very new so that might be why but I found the staff though friendly and helpful to be quite inexperienced and slightly awkward at times 
107222,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Aviary bar service a little slow but could be explained as it was a busy Friday evening, Fab location excellent staff and loved the hotel just a pity we didn t have time to try the new spa facilities 
107223,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, We were on the 9th floor and our first night we were woken at 1 45 am by banging on the roof sounded like tables and chairs being moved around Roof was a little too warm even with air conditioning on but having said both of this we would definitely stay again , Roof top bar was lovely
107224,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Strange that mobile canteen on main road obscures hotel frontage Not in keeping with character of that which Finsbury Square should aspire to , Exceptional level Of staff welcome
107225,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Housekeeping knocked twice before check out time and woke me up twice, Everything the Service the rooftop bar I was upgraded to a junior suite the price everything

107229,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Internet does not require a key Less safe than most and very slow The wall unit iPad to control temp lights and etc had a lot of issues Rebooted frequently , Breakfast was very good Bed was very comfy 
107230,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Staff inconsistence with courtesy From extremely professional courteous staff to others who walk past you in a corridor and simply do not even look your way Rooms are not sound proof NOTE that the reception area becomes a bar in the evening with rowdy drunk office workers whom you will need to weave your wee through should you wish to leave the hotel , Good location comfortable bed and great bathrooms Rooms have USB plugs which is great 
107231,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, We wanted a double bed and got two pushed together which was quite poor and noticed too late to ask for a room change, The room was great ambience and decor was very nice 
107232,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Nothing , I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough The staff could not be more helpful and the rooftop bar provided stunning views of the city Upon entering my room I was greeted with an array of cakes fresh fruit prosecco and a card wishing me a happy birthday The location was great and the rooms were beautifully decorated The perfect choice to celebrate my 21st birthday a big thank you to the staff of Montcalm Royal London House for helping to make it so special 
107233,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, That my room bin was empty from previous guest Also took too long for my breakfast to come not much hot veggies options, The head receptionist was very accommodating and did her best to help us have a great stay
107234,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The hotel is undergoing some sort of construction which I understand but meant that we always had to walk around to the front of the building The elevators for some reason operate independently which means that you have to press both buttons in order to call both elevators in case one is going somewhere or is stalled which is very inefficient The door locks did not work when we checked in and so we had to have someone come to the room to repair them My room service order was appallingly cold Eating a burger that cold so cold that I spent half my time eating prodding it to detect any warmth is very disconcerting and made me ask management if anyone is even on staff to cook late at night To their credit they removed the room service charge and offered us complimentary breakfast for the rest of our stay a more than fair offer Finally while I appreciated the hotel s attempt at using technology in new and innovative ways I must say that the missed the mark a bit First the interface on the tablet that controls the room is appalling I would never put something that ugly anywhere much less a luxury hotel Second technology should make things simpler and not more difficult Simple things like changing the temperature of the room became a confusing mess as the interface is poorly laid out and the panel is slow and poorly responsive , I liked that the staff worked hard to make sure that our stay was good and to rectify the hiccups with our room and room service order The breakfast which was comped as restitution for the room service mishap was pretty good but the lack of selection meant that I got weary of the full english after a couple days I also liked that the hotel is trying to use technology in new and interesting ways even if the end result didn t quite hit the mark I connected my tablet to the TV and was able to listen to music nicely The bathroom was beautiful and the shower was great Lastly the location of this hotel as plusses and minuses On the plus side it is located a short walk to a couple of Underground stations and from the Shoreditch area On the other hand in the immediate vicinity of the hotel there is not much in the name of fun Still we enjoyed walking to Shoreditch on one evening and to the Tower of London during one of our tourist adventures 
107235,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The location is 10 minutes walk from the nearest metro Still takes about 15 20 minutes to get to the centre of London if you like shopping , the rooms were clean and modern Breakfast was great with fresh croissants bread eggs and everything you can wish for

107237,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The room was really cold during the day the tablet for controlling the room temperature kept crashing and didn t seem to acknowledge when we switched the heating on The underfloor heating in the bathroom didn t work either and the shower was lukewarm rather than hot We found a pill on the bathroom floor but the room was clean and tidy otherwise The wardrobes were a bit fiddly as they didn t have handles , Friendly staff great location and a very comfortable bed Would definitely stay again if a couple of issues were fixed

107249,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The location on Finsbury Square is ever so slightly just a little bit out of the way for me of course it depends on the reason for your trip if you re looking for somewhere to stay in the City then this would be perfect , Great room modern touch lighting brand new bathroom all newly refurbished a real pleasure to stay here We took advantage of the rooftop bar which was still warmly heated on a chilly December evening by outdoor heaters with blankets provided in all seating areas had delicious cocktails nibbles overlooking a foggy beautifully atmospheric City skyline We didn t eat in the restaurant also up on the roof as we were meeting friends elsewhere but it looked great staff seemed super friendly There s also a great Spa on the lower ground floor which we didn t have time to sample but again really great facilities I d love to stay here again perhaps for a little longer next time Great hotel we really enjoyed our stay

107257,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, 1 At check in I was told that breakfast is not included and only actual breakfasts consumed will be charged However after I left I was charged GBP125 for 5 breakfasts that I never had 2 The Duty Manager Savia De Jesus Rodrigues never responded to my emails with complaint about the GBP 125 charge 3 weeks thereafter the matter is still not settled 3 On an early check in I was promised an SMS to inform me when the room is ready The SMS never arrived 4 The soundproofing of the rooms is deficient A couple in a neighbouring room were enjoying themselves on Friday night and that was clearly heard I felt embarrassed to listen Involuntarily to all these sounds couples deserve some privacy in a 5 hotel , The place is conveniently situated at walking distance to most major offices in the City Sophisticated lightening The service offered is ok similar to other London hotels

107263,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Booked three rooms One room had fruit flies all over the room but we were quickly upgraded to a Junior Suite for free The wall tablet in the rooms although a good concept needs to be updated You can tell a cheap tablet has been used to control the room because it lags and crashes often Invest into a good tablet according to the hotel s standards The same goes for the Handy Phone No interconnecting rooms throughout the hotel But all rooms within very close proximity Housekeeping staff can be lazy sometimes Sometimes they would not vacuum the room or clean the shower properly or even leave enough soap shower gel body wash , Great rooms spacious clean very modern New technology embedded into each room with tablets controlling the AC lightning floor heating call signs etc Handy phone included which has unlimited data and free calls within the UK and ten other countries The phone has a dedicated section where you can purchase tickets for activities around London at a discounted price Great amenities in the rooms that you expect to find in a 5 star hotel Location is great nearby park train station 2 min to Starbucks other coffee shops marks and spencer etc Safe area and quiet area Staff is impeccable Always caring and looking to make your stay as comfortable as possible A personal mention for Yulia Guest Experience Manager who took care of our issues kindly

107269,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, As I said on the like side the staff responded very well to the issues as we brought them to their attention The room was a good size but not comfortable it felt that the room was designed more for show than for comfort e g the single sitting chair we were a couple was uncomfortable the lighting was dark trying too hard to create a atmosphere and the bed was too high as well as being higher on one side than the other I assume 2 twins made up together The staff did sort out the lopsided bed Maintenance had to fix the aircon which was not working Problems with the electronic pad used to control room sometimes it did not work Other issues too with the room which I wont mention for brevity s sake Woken up at 06 00 AM on Saturday and Sunday morning due to very noisy collection of empties from the Christmas Office parties held in temporary marquees on Finsbury Square Not the hotel s fault but wouldn t recommend staying there over Xmas Office Party time , We had a number of issues with the room but the staff were incredibly helpful and quick to resolve them Cannot fault the staff at all The staff were the best part of the experience and were exceptional They made up for the issues by comping breakfast which was very kind of them

107288,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, A bit far from tourist attractions as it s in City district I would stay again for business but maybe not as a private traveller , A good option for business people I was also upgraded to a more expensive room with breakfast kudos to the receptionist Some good restaurants are also nearby

107291,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, There wasn t anything I didn t like A couple of teething issue with the hotel being new including no remote for the TV in the room which was rectified within seconds and a spontaneously boiling kettle in the middle of the night The only reason the facilities aren t full marks is because I wasn t fortunate enough to to try them all I will rectify this upon my return , The welcome from the staff was great Surprisingly remembered my name and face from a visit to a previous hotel from the group I was early and they accommodated me with a glass of bubbly and quickly got me checked in an hour before I was due to a room that felt like an upgrade The room was spacious and the bed was outrageously comfortable Could have spent a week in it Wonderful waterfall shower was enough to tempt me out of bed and wake me up and the views from the rooftop bar for a night cap were excellent the sort you would have to pay good money for near by The location is also extremely convenient for visiting many great sights shopping areas and restaurants bars We were also lucky to get a great deal two nights for the price of one in a hotel of similar standard in a similar location 
107292,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Breakfast hall dining area was very small it didn t accommodate the volume of people Apart from that I couldn t fault it , Staff Service Location

107294,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Hotel location wrong room description room facilities never worked poor excuses to justify failures and false advertisement , Room size good bathroom TV size and porters 
107295,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Unfortunately my stay was ruined a bit by the fact that I left a bottle of expensive aftershave in the room at 9 when I checked out rang at 11 and they stated they could not find it I told them exactly where I left it so can only assume someone got an early xmas present , Hotel room was very impressive all facilities were top class and staff were extremely friendly and helpful
107296,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Wait for the room wasnt communicated well and we had no robes in our room but we asked and everything was dealt with in a timely manner, Confusion at check in and a wait for the room didnt take away from a gorgeous room and the best bed I have ever stayed in Sons 21st birthday was a delight thanks to everyone that looked after us
107297,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Food ridiculously expensive entertainment system is circa 20th century room keys unreliable staff unable to do the basics like print an invoice , Location is great 
107298,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Got allocated a disabled room and not informed When reserving room asked for an earlier checkin which they were unaware of On arrival asked again and I was told they would ring me never received a phone call and returned at 1pm to find room was available immediately Room was freezing and it took all evening for the heating system to get the room to an acceptable temperature Had a surprise visit from a member of staff around 8am in the morning check out is at 12 Have amazing tech in the room with no instructions on how to use so spent time working it out No prices for the mini bar and low stock on coffe making facilities and number of towels All in all a rubbish experience which is a real shame as the hotel has all the potential to be great , Bar area excellent with attentive staff
107299,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, We were woken up multiple times by hotel staff builders as the property is not yet finished Which is terrible when I had to be at a meeting early morning the reception staff apologised and I was told they investigated it but there were no issues Badly handled , The hotel was very clean and very comfortable beds Nice decor 
107300,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Wifi did not always connect No toilet brush unless you request it Staff s English varies from almost zero to great And heating is operated from room to room which means you arrive to 5 Celsius when you get back to your room whenever When we complained they inserted an extra card and turned on the heating and that was great but this is probably a problem for the entire hotel and should be solved on that level in the future , Nice room very quiet Staff tried to be very kind despite lack of language skills 
107301,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The room was small although average for London and was not really special Just a good room However for a 5 hotel you expect something special , The hotel is new and therefore very clean The staff is friendly You get a smartphone with a map and free 4g internet which is really nice for foreigners without a UK phone plan

107305,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Requested twin beds but basic twin room too small with no space between beds Asked to change rooms and staff helpful but it spoilt first day as I got quite stressed The decor is very dark and masculine Black wood everywhere feels very 90s Only one comfy chair in room even in the more spacious upgrade You need a degree in electronics to work out how to switch the lights air con heating etc on and off Space age but impractical Towel hooks were placed too high for 6 footers and in second room although there was a towel rail it was positioned over the loo roll holder The TV wasn t working properly and they did not supply any body wash in the second room It had only been open a week or so and obviously there will be snagging but I had to clean surfaces in first room Spa needs additions like benches lockers and hooks Spa well appointed The staff were aware of all the niggles and I have been offered an upgrade if I stay again The staff did work very hard to rectify things , Location helpful staff and quietness The Second room was an upgrade and very spacious It had a bath The Aviary Restaurant on the top floor was first rate and good value compared with location

107321,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The bearkfast at the lounge was good The only thing was that we came one morning at 9 am and a lot of things were empty We asked to refilled but they just took the empty plate and never came back we did find what to eat but it shouldt be like that at a 5 hotel The aircondition in the room is hard to manage Had to call them a lot about it , The staff are very frindly I had a mistake on the confirmation from booking since i invited with breakfast and it wasnt writen The hotel imidiatly gave it anyway even before booking called them Also I forgot 2 dimond rings at the toilet by mistake called them from the city and they send someone to check called me back to say they found them and they waited for me in the room They helped in any way they could They also made us takeaway breakfast and coffee to go since we left at 5 15 am The hotel is clean and new and very comfterble Room size was grate The tube is 5 mint walk You can get anywhere easy and quickly grate valu for the money 
107322,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The fire alarm went off at about 3 am however this was due to another person smoking in their room and no fault of the hotels , You couldn t fault the room was superbly clean and the bed was extremely comfortable The staff were always on hand to help 
107323,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Rooms not ready for check in fire alarm going off too much room tech not working and so overly complicated noisy aircon units dark room with no view apart from into someone s office next door and overpriced bar, Good shower room and great beds
107324,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, One small detail was the shower was nit hot enough for my girlfriends liking It was warm but wouldn t get to where you could call it hot , The entire hotel is spotless staff are super friendly and the rooms are very generous with space Beds are fantastic size and extremely comfortable and the lighting options in the rooms are great Nightlights Mood lighting ect

107326,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, Upon arrival the staff at reception made causal conversation and asked for the purpose of the visit After learning it was for my boyfriend s birthday we were given a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite and then sent a bottle of prosecco and a tray of chocolate truffles to the room It was a great start to a memorable birthday weekend 
107327,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, nothing negative to say, Staff are brilliant rooms are amazing An upgrade was provided as room wasn t ready The bed is so comfy with a TV that covers half the room Cant say one thing negative about this hotel Pool area wasnt built but you can use a sister hotel facility free of charge with a free taxi courtesy of the hotel 
107328,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, More Nespresso pods Seriously though it was an excellent room , Lovely big comfy bed Facilities in room excellent Free Wi Fi Sky TV A C Nespresso machine mood lighting 
107329,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The roof top bar and spa was not open finished as stated on the website witch had I known probably would not have booked still teething problems air con underfloor heating didn t work in room , New hotel the finish to a good standard lots of gadgets fantastic location and service was good 
107330,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Nothing It was great , Genuinely one of the best hotels I have stayed at for a long time Staff were so friendly and would go out of their way to ensure that you as the guest had everything you needed for your stay It was such a lovely atmosphere would highly recommend to anyone can t wait to come back 
107331,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The heating didn t seem to work properly in the room however was quite warm anyway so didn t need to report Also no toilet brush , The decor cleanliness can tell it s a new hotel room space and all the little finishing touches 
107332,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Facilites are very modern but needs improvement in all the smart electronics , I ve stayed here for quite a number of nights staff are friendly rooms are clean Thank you Thomas from the concierge and ladies in the front desk for helping out throughout my stay 
107333,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Advertised with having spa and pool however on arrival were advised this was still being completed Access was offered to a sister hotel which they offered to provide transport to but bit gutted it wasn t available in the hotel as stated , Staff were accommodating given the room we were initially given was noisy from building works being done On arrival was given a glass of bubbly and help with bags to the room Very hospitable 
107334,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Sadly the pool and terrace bar weren t open yet but we were given access to the pool and spa of one of their sister hotels the free transfer there and back was a bonus too , We had a mini staycation for our 10 year anniversary and we were delighted to be given a free room upgrade as well as some yummy goodies and a lovely card The room was positively palatial and the bed was enormous The latter much appreciated after a long week at work just down the road The staff were extremely helpful and couldn t have been more apologetic about the areas not yet open Thank you for a lovely stay 
107335,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Disappointed the Roof Bar Spa not open informed both due to launch the following week Bad smell of drainage in entrance foyer but probably just due to the ongoing building work Very modern fab colours but lacking warmth a bit sterile and clinical in atmosphere Perhaps more fresh flowers around and offers in the Bardocks Bar to get it an inviting vibe so more popular and busy , Super friendly staff in a contemporary Hotel Very comfortable bed soft duvet pillows Great location for Shoreditch venues 
107336,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Nothing Everything was amazing, The whole hotel experience was amazing the service the rooms to the food everything was 10 10 The bed is so comfortable and the shower is exquisite 
107337,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Didn t like the fact I had to go home after my stay , The hotel were so thoughtful spelling happy birthday in rose petals for my girlfriend Greeted with bubbly when we checked in Daniel D helped alot when we returned a little bit drunk and couldn t get into our room The shower was amazing also The way the TV works with bluetooth and smart tv were handy also but the location being so close to the nightlife of Shoreditch and the business centre of the city makes it a great pick for both leisure and business 
107338,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, The rooms were beautiful and the bed was extremely comfortable Only stayed for one night for work but would happily return Location was great for what we needed Cost of the room was a bargain 
107339,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, air conditions was not good at all lounge was very simple nothing fancy , the room was good especially the mood lights restaurant was okey 
107340,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, No complaints , Mood lighting Shower cleanliness Attentive pleasant staff Chocolates and fresh fruit on arrival Complimentary bottle of wine as room wasn t quite ready on arrival 
107341,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Needed a little bit of an introduction to where the Executive Lounge was and how it worked when we booked in rather then having to work it out for ourselves , A new hotel so not all the facilities are open yet but it has great promise Comfy beds lovely bathroom great for a weekend in London Very considerate cake and prosecco waiting for us as we were celebrating a 50th birthday Would definitely go back 
107342,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, They brought round complimentary fruit and newspapers during different times of the day There was also a small problem with a light but it was immediately resolved by helpful happy staff 
107343,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Had a little trouble with the room card not working but staff soon fixed the problem , Staff were very welcoming and accommodating They decorated the room for my friends birthday was beautiful Extremely clean tidy and an excellent atmosphere 
107344,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, I loved the bed but my partner found that he was rolling off the edge of the bed I d like a dimmed light option in the bathroom , The massive TV is awesome with sky and smart features The bathroom is smart with a deluxe shower Hi tech lighting is cool particularly the mood and night lighting The scent boxes are also a nice touch as are the elemis toiletries And delightful corridors 
107345,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Disappointed the rooftop bar was not yet open as hotel brand new Booking com should have advised this as the reason I booked Staff did offer to shuttle us to sister hotel for dinner with a view however , Beautiful hotel very welcoming staff excellent location
107346,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, The staff were helpful and polite without being overbearing The room was spacious clean and very comfortable The location is excellent and blissfully quiet Would highly recommend 
107347,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Didn t find the pillows very comfortable and noise from in room ioniser was off putting , 1 night stay and apart from a drink in the bar only used the room Very nice room comfortable bed massive TV with Sky Nespresso machine big tick and really good shower 
107348,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Some hi tech did not work i e Warm bath pavement Elevator made of four blocks of marble Staff without badge name, Just opened clean hi tech comfortable size room and bathroom Air freshner Usb plugs
107349,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Booking com stated that the hotel was nearer Oxford Street which we wished to be close to however it was very far out costing a decent amount in a taxi and a far distance on the train this was a let down however this was not the hotels fault it was the description from booking com website The only other thing was the dim lighting for applying make up , EVERYTHING Service was outstanding staff couldn t have done more to help you Sylvia I think that was her name at recieption was particularly helpful very welcoming aided us throughout our stay even when bumping into us asking how our stay was going she gave us great tips and made sure we knew everything about the facilities Hotel itself is stunning and we were greeted with a lovely birthday cake and drinks for the celebration of my husbands birthday Fantastic experience
107350,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Nothing However I didn t like that I didn t do enough research we felt quite underdressed when we arrived, The staff were friendly and helpful always greeting you and asking how your day has been so far Doors are opened for you as you enter and leave the hotel You are treated like a VIP The bed was so so comfy and your room is constantly filled with lavender fragrance Furthermore the room service food was perfect 
107351,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, A few issues with the heating in the room It s a new hotel so still has a few teething problems They sorted it out though very quickly , Loved prosecco on arrival when checking in Staff couldn t be more helpful A few issues with the heating but they were able to sort this out promptly Would stay here again great location 
107352,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Everything was great nothing was Disliked, My partner Had an amazing experience here the stuff are friendly and just incredible especially Claudia I will be visiting again very soon especially when you ve added in the spa Exciting beautiful rooms great size great facilities just amazing
107353,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, The staff were excellent especially the house manager Daisy The location was ideal close to Liverpool Street Station and an ideal base for sightseeing as it is only a short walk to the Thames and London Bridge Tower of London and other fabulous sights
107354,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, This is a new hotel and is the worst place we have stayed Hotel is actually quite good but our experience wasn t The advertised roof top bar is not open Neither was the gym We could use the gym in a nearby hotel but we were given wrong directions We needed the IT guy to come to our room to unlock the parent lock on the TV to watch a 12plus movie at 5 in the afternoon Breakfast order wasn t placed so we waited 35 minutes for eggs Touch pad for lights wasn t working properly Whoever delivered the paper in the morning thought it was a good idea to ring the doorbell to wake us Will probably be a very good place once staff know what they are doing and the misleading advertising with the roof bar and gym is fixed ,No Positive
107355,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, There were no sockets to plug hairdryer in near enough to a mirror to style hair while drying Also touch button light switches were fun but I know partially sighted relatives of mine would find them hard to operate maybe just a thing to consider in future refurbishments But all very space agy and I m sure most people would find them cool , The decor was attractive and felt luxurious and the staff pleasant and eager to help 
107356,Montcalm Royal London House City of London,No Negative, Lovely stay at the hotel it was our anniversary and we stayed in a family room with another couple The hotel left a card champagne and rose petals on the bed It was very sweet and gave us a wonderful experience Our bed was super comfy and our friends that stayed in the other room on the pull out couch said it was pretty comfortable Would definitely stay again 
107357,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, No real criticisms other that the teething probs of a new hotel Concierge waas lovely but had no idea where he waas or how to get anywhere Am sure it will come , Staff ecouldn t do enough to help Whole place is lovely and would have given the facilities a higher count but they were not all yet open Great bar and cafe area good sized rooms 
107358,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The electronic light control panel in the bedroom is far too bright Expensive breakfast but plenty of cafes in the immediate area , Very nice furnishings and decor Bright and new Great location 
107359,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Literally only downside is it stated about a rooftop terrace and spa facilities but as it had only been open a week they werent ready so if thats what you want to go there for i would double check they are open, Me and my daughter went for 2 nights and straight on arrival after looking a bit flustered we were both treated with pudding and ice cream and they couldnt have done any more to make everyone feel welcome They treated my daughter whos 7 like their own Think its a place that will keep getting better and better over time as it had only been open a week when we went
107360,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The hotel is new so the spa facilities weren t open and neither the restaurant or roof top bar which was one of the attractions that led us to stay there We unfortunately had a power cut on our floor irresponsible people in another room which reset the air conditioning unit so that didn t work for the rest of our stay However when we told staff they immediately took us to the manager who gave us our bar bill for free , Really comfortable beds The bar area is good and staff were very pleasant and couldn t do enough for us 
107361,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Reception staff could definitely been more friendly and welcoming, Great soft beds wonderful shower great decor in rooms Nice touch with balloons and cup cakes for special celebration
107362,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The pool was not in use We like a swim before breakfast and before dinner Didn t fancy being wet in a cab back to hotel The heated floor didn t work A better view would have been nice Sky control and phones and fruit put in room after arrival , The room was great nice clean and comfy xx Paper each day appreciated 
107363,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, My booking from booking com hadn t come through so sorting my room took a while and involved a room change and I was expecting the spa fitness area to be available but they re still being built However both of those appear to be booking com issues , The staff were always extremely friendly and helpful and the hotel itself was lovely 
107364,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, The dust in the rooms kept sneezing and I never have allergies burnt rubber smell the scent machine in each room that kept breaking lack of sleep due to the electric wall panel the constant construction causing horrible noise when I moved rooms the upgraded room had worse views and the wall panel was right by my bed making the brightness unbearable the wall panel not working thus the engineer had to keep coming up to unlock the code so I could manage the temperature of the room oh and the gym and rooftop weren t available The whole thing was a bit disappointing If it wasn t for the kind staff I probably would ve had a fit and asked for a refund I know this hotel will be great though once complete in November Bar area is very nice , The staff is incredibly helpful and very kind They went out of their way to answer questions and do their best given the circumstances The hotel is less than a month old However it is false advertisement to offer pictures of facilities that do not yet exist I paid for grand views etc I also wanted sleep 
107365,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Staff have been over trained tried too hard to make a conversation when time could have been better spent explaining the room features etc Buffet breakfast for 25 is not good value at all, Nice room bed and shower
107366,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, We went away for my partners birthday and we were very disappointed to discover that the spa facilities and the roof top bar were not in use even though it was advertised on the website which is why we chose this hotel There was also a fire alarm that went off at 3am disturbing our sleep aswell as a power cut while we were in the room Considering the hotel was brand new the room was very dusty on the dressing table and TV Overall we were very disappointed with this hotel with the money that we spent to go here ,No Positive
107367,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Pool not open Gym not open Terrace bar not open Bed uncomfortable duvet too hot Room controls erratic e g lighting, New hotel all clean and shiny
107368,Montcalm Royal London House City of London, Unfortunately there is no quiet classy restaurant , Great bed super TV and WiFi
