297159,Room Mate Anna,No Negative, The staff was extra helpfull They almost assisted us in every aspect They proposed the best restaurants and made all reservations Guided us on places to visit
297160,Room Mate Anna, The twin bed are next to each other which makes living with a friend a little uncomfortable , The room was well equipped and the bathroom has a large shower that is great The interior design is really special and the hotels location was great for using public transport and close to Gaudi buildings and shops The staff is really helpful about all things Barcelona gave great ideas for restaurants transport and places to visit The wifi is fast and reliable 
297161,Room Mate Anna,No Negative, Absolutely breathtaking Everything in the hotel is beautiful and unique The rooms are very comfortable and the attention to detail is great The location is great with the metro and bus stations nearby 
297162,Room Mate Anna, The only thing the hotel could have benefited from was a bathroom on the pool floor , Where to start we had the most wonderful weekend staying at Room Mate Anna First of all the hotel is lovely the rooms are spacious and they have thought of every possible detail to make your stay really comfortable Our room could be completely blacked out so we had the most restful undisturbed sleep The staff are probably the best I have ever experienced they went absolutely above and beyond to make our stay wonderful from beginning to end The addition of a WhatsApp number to message reception is a great for when you re out and about Will 100 be booking here time and again 
297163,Room Mate Anna,No Negative, The crazy chic design from the Deluxe room The view over Casa Batll from the balconee The staff super friendly available and reactive Overall everything 
297164,Room Mate Anna, Staff were friendly but they were junior level and there was an unexperienced trainee who was unable to help and almost put me in a taxi to airport trouble due to her mismanagemnt of my request thankfully her supervisor sorted out the issue I think staff should be more senior with more experience and training to be able to support on travellers needs and inquiries , Loved the modern comfi design the personalised service attention to details the fresh spirit the hotel gives for travellers the room bed was so comfi the interior is outstanding toiletaries and amenities room view was gorgeous looby music was so refreshing 
297165,Room Mate Anna, The rooms was small there are structural problems as the walls are very thin and the sound from other rooms comes all the time , The location was amazing the staff members are the best in the business 
297166,Room Mate Anna, Rooms are tiny and really nothing to shout about Indicated it was our 4th anniversary so would have been great if something a bit special was done for us That would have been above and beyond , Excellent location Within walking distance from a number of prime spots and the metro 
297167,Room Mate Anna, No music chanels on tv But its not a big deal , Hotels location is perfect Tarrace on the roof is really nice place to chill and get some sun Breakfast served till 12 is also something special Emma was amazing 
297168,Room Mate Anna, I don t find particularly smart having a tap in the bedroom and the breakfast room without windows located in the 1 basement , Perfect location two steps from Passeig de Gr cia Cortes Catalanes and Rambles Modern design and decoration Quiet hotel rooms give to an interior patio so you don t have the very important noices from the very busy roads around 
297169,Room Mate Anna, the hotel is very rigid with chekin and checkout we had arrived at 8am and the usually chekin was between 1 and 2pm and the hotel was not flexible in offering a room to rest and the lobby is simply a short corridor with 4 chairs so no where to rest we were expecting a more lenient treatment for checkin considering we have 2 kids they accepted we stay by the pool till the room was ready at 1 30pm pool is tiny round one and we couldn t stay long for a long relaxing morning at checkout we wanted to extend for couple of hours we didn t even mind moving to one small room to freshen up before our late flight the only option the hotel had for us is to pay an extra hourly rate we thought this is very unfriendly especially with family of 2 kids the breakfast time was flexible tthough till midday but we didn t like the quality at all the rooms are not clean at all and we used the coffee mugs and glasses for juice the room cleaners simply kept them unwashed for the entire 5 days of our visit the reception staff and the breakfast room staff where nice and tried accommodating to our request but we felt they had no flexibility with their management I would rate it a 3star except the nice interiors which deserves 4star , the location was great
297170,Room Mate Anna, It misses a gym Breakfast quality could be better, Everything very stylish hotel small but cool pool with a nice service very comfy bed great shower and the best hair dryer 
297171,Room Mate Anna,No Negative, Excellent location super friendly staff rooftop splash pool comfortable bed good choices at breakfast I have stayed in a dozen or so hotels in Barcelona and this was the best I ve experienced 
297172,Room Mate Anna, Nothing If you really want to pick fault then it is on a busy street but the rooms are sufficiently soundproofed for this not to be an issue and although the showers are powerful it s a fine art to get the temperature exactly right However I would never let these things put me off booking the price you pay for the service you receive is amazing if you stay anywhere else in Barcelona you can be sure you will have far worse problems than these , The multi lingual staff were simply amazing at this hotel and this is certainly not typical of other hotels at Barcelona They were beyond friendly and determined to do anything and everything to make our stay memorable from organising a surprise breakfast in bed for my husband s birthday to fetching gluten free treats for me when I was unwell they really couldn t have made us anymore welcome The hotel itself is very quirky in design and is boutique meaning the rooms are smaller than you may be used to but this is typical of Barcelona and they are certainly big enough to use as a base for exploring the wonders of this fabulous city Air con and wifi were excellent and free breakfast was a good continental offering with freshly baked treats bought round as you ate Free Lavazza hot drinks machine too as well as free water dispensers with a daily flavoured water option too The plunge pool on the roof is a treat and although the sun lounge area and bar are still under construction they currently have a full time waited fetching drinks so nothing to complain about there either The hotel is pretty central to all the attractions for Barcelona and right next to the main designer shopping street I love this hotel and it s staff and would not consider staying anywhere else next time we visit Thank you 
297173,Room Mate Anna, Nothing it was all good , Really great hotel Rooms were comfortable very clean and well designed Air conditioning was very effective and we heard no street noise The staff were all excellent friendly knowledgeable and very helpful Breakfast was good quality and plenty of choice Wouldn t hesitate to recommend it and will certainly book with this chain of hotels again 
297174,Room Mate Anna, Slightly more space would have been welcome in the bedroom However everything was beautifully appointed even down to a most impressive hairdryer , Room Mate Anna is a small boutique hotel with the most amazing staff We were always greeted warmly at reception and everyone was always very helpful The breakfast choice was both delicious and extensive and we were even provided with delicious gluten free options Its location is excellent just a stone s throw from the metro railway which runs directly to and from the airport The hotel is beautifully decorated and furnished as well as being very quiet inside with excellent soundproofing The air conditioning and free wifi were both first class the bathroom luxurious We weren t in a particularly large room but the lack of space was compensated by very comfortable beds and ample wardrobe space Warmly recommended 
297175,Room Mate Anna, It was all good, Outstanding value for money The staff were really friendly and very helpful The room was very quiet and very clean Very spacious room
297176,Room Mate Anna, The room had very little natural light , rooms were very well equipped air conditioning superb bathroom facilities excellent Very quiet despite being in the centre of Barcelona Roof pool lovely Staff were very friendly giving maps and also restaurant reservations Breakfast plentiful and good choice 
297177,Room Mate Anna, Only negative some drawer space needed in room, Staff were fantastic Great varied breakfast Excellent location Small but lovely plunge pool on roof top Loved the d cor which was oriental in design This Hotel has everything you need EverythingSome
297178,Room Mate Anna, We were fortunate to be able to change our room to one with a view but they charged us extra money to do , Our lovely room with a balcony facing the street and a Gaudi historical house Very nice staff always helpful with questions Fabulous breakfast 
297179,Room Mate Anna, Found the breakfast could do with something hot to eat I love having my scrambled egg hot my hubby would have like a hot breakfast and coffee was no where near the lovely coffee that we were buying in the coffee houses We, Facilities in the bedroom were great The staff were excellent in helping us find our way around places of interest and eateries made our stay so much more relaxed 
297180,Room Mate Anna, It would be great to be able to order some light snacks around the pool area though they do provide a selection of nut like snacks when you order drinks , The hotel was absolutely beautiful even down to the smell when you walked in All of the staff were beyond helpful always making personal recommendations and arranging any discounts for activities where they could The facilities were great The roof top pool was lovely and never overcrowded The whole stay felt very luxurious and we couldn t have asked for a better place to be In fact we spent more time at the hotel than planned because we loved it so much 
297181,Room Mate Anna, The pool wasn t open , Beautiful room comfortable bed terrific shower very convenient location excellent variety of quality breakfast selections Staff was more than helpful with info about Barcelona restaurants directions internet stuff Loved that rather than a Bible in the drawer there was a UN Declaration of Human Rights booklet This is a progressive and modern hotel 
297182,Room Mate Anna, none, Perfect location just few minutes walk to Passage de Gracier hotel decoration is modern staff are so helpful and freindly especially Amma and Sergi that took very good care of us when we were there Breakfast also very nice 
297183,Room Mate Anna,No Negative, if i thought the location was perfect just at the exit of the passeig de gracia station that have a train from to the airport the moment we got in to the hotel starting from the interior design the reception staff and of course the amazing room Breakfast was splendid very nice high quality food selection Don t miss the pool on the roof top defiantly recommending it for couples 
297184,Room Mate Anna, There were a lot of pillows on the bed but no place to put them off The stuff was put them back every day , Very good location The interior design nice the breakfast is fine 
297185,Room Mate Anna, Nothing really but if we have to pick something it is the fact that the hotel does not have a bar or lounge to have a quick drink On the other hand there are bar s all around the hotel , We had a wonderful stay in this hotel The room was very quiet and relaxed bed and bathroom were very good and daily cleaning was perfect Breakfast was very nice and location is great and in walking distance of most Barcelona tourist attractions Last but not least hotel staff was very friendly and willing to help 
297186,Room Mate Anna, We would have loved to use the pool for an early morning dip or after touring all day but the hours were very limiting I believe the pool opened at 11 and closed at 6 PM , Front desk staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful Best shower in the world 
297187,Room Mate Anna, From end to end of their great service and big smiles , The reception lady Ms Ivana is so much professional and kind enough to offer her assistant to all of our enquirers about the charming city of Barcelona 
297188,Room Mate Anna, The room not being ready when it should have been Pool closing at 6 30 It was so relaxing and warm could have stayed there for a few more hours The sun lounges were a little difficult to get on and off on the terrace , The room was not ready at the right time but we soon forgot this as we were given complimentary drinks on the terrace The staff were some of the best I have experienced in any hotel and rexommended brilliant bars and restaurants The roof top terrace and small pool made our stay very special and the bar man was very attentive brilliant We had a junior suite and it was fantastic from mini bar to toiletries we did not want for anything and if we had I get the feeling a member of staff would have been happy to bring it for us Hotel Room we will be back
297189,Room Mate Anna, Maybe make the water free in the mini bar Throw us a bone , Having to be out all night partying sorta for work Enjoying a lie in every day in this beautiful room I got the most out of that lovely bed And bond villian decor 
297190,Room Mate Anna, The rooftop pool was closed only open in summer and this wasn t indicated anywhere , Apples and water readily accessible at the front desk at any time of day The decoration of the rooms and hotel in general The easy access to everything on foot from the historic center to the Sagrada Familia 
297191,Room Mate Anna, Roof top pool and bar were closed, Great location right in the centre 10 minutes walk from la rambles and all of the main attractions within walking distance 
297192,Room Mate Anna, I do wish they would ve had a DRESSER to unpack into There were only 2 small shallow drawers in bedside tables The closet was very small with only a few hangers not enough for 2 people As well some throw rugs would be nice to dampen the sound of people walking a floor above and would be warm to the feet I was disappointed to learn when we arrived that the permit for the roof top deck pool bar had not been received as I booked here wanting that area to be available and it was not open We booked the JR Suite and would have liked a coffee table and chair in the sitting couch area just a couch there made it less useful for a gathering or to do work there On a few occasions there was noise of doors shutting over and over again in the hallway and noise from the floor above as well that woke us up , Unique and modern boutique hotel right off the Passeig de Gracia and within walking distance to most all sites and areas that we wanted to see The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful making dinner reservations etc Ambiance was fun and decor was not usual Air conditioning for a US visitor was fantastic got very cold and stayed that way Visit Cocovail beer pub across the street we loved it And Telefuric restraurant for more modern Tapas a few blocks walk from there RMAnnas breakfast everyday was wonderful with little specialties daily excellent coffee gluten free options when requested and lots of fruit protein and bakery choices to offer served until noon we enjoyed this option and it was well worth the cost of included breakfast Beds were comfortable shower water was HOT and had great pressure as well they included a wall mounted makeup mirror a nice touch 
297193,Room Mate Anna,No Negative, location is very good breakfasts every day the same scrambling eggs prepared before hot small sausages bacon 3 kinds of cold meat 2 kinds of cheese small tomatoes radish cucumber good coffee and good orange juice Everything ok but it is not standard 4 hotel Cleaning service was poor but supervisor after contact very good Very small room but very good quality especially hairdryer Drinking water only first day If you are rich man welcome 
297194,Room Mate Anna, There was nothing about the hotel that we did not like Busy road outside but no traffic noise in hotel The hot food at breakfast could have done with being hotter for our liking Slightly disappointed the rooftop pool would not open until summer Also think there should be a hot plate container for hot foods likes eggs bacon etc Otherwise no complaints whatsoever , Most comfortable hotel bed we have ever slept in Not too soft not too hard Our room on the top floor at the back of the hotel had an interesting view of the properties and gardens inside the block The room was beautifully decorated with a lot of thought to style and the sound proofing glazing was first class My wife is a light sleeper but heard no noise inside the hotel except occasional doors shutting Busy traffic at front so declined a balcony room The Staff were friendly and efficient and made us feel welcome from the start Always greeted us first thing and on returning to hotel after sightseeing Felt they were really interested in what we had been doing They can book your tickets for what ever you wish to see saves a lot of time queuing and they did not add any fee So many hotel reception staff at other hotels in Spain are cold and indifferent These in Catalonia are credit to the owner manager Nothing too much trouble just ask Fantastic surprise to see Happy Anniversary written on the bathroom mirror and a lovely note from Team Anna Made our day Excellent breakfast with large choice for all tastes Staff there were also superb changing items quickly so everything was fresh Hotel is very close to the Metro Renfe train station and La Rambla and Gaudi s La Pedura and Casa Batllo Bonus having a sun terrace on the roof to relax on after a hard day enjoying yourself We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone 
297195,Room Mate Anna,No Negative, Very nice boutique hotel The small room was well appointed Great shower Excellent bed Decent desk area I was in the back of the hotel Nice and quiet but the window looked out to a courtyard and daylight came in through a sun roof No big deal for me but if you need a real window ask for a room in the front 
297196,Room Mate Anna, Swimming pool wasn t working No bar No 24 hour room service Standard room a little small for the price paid, Amazing staff The most comfortable beds Great design
297197,Room Mate Anna,No Negative, The staff were so friendly and helpful We got upgraded to a beautiful room that was soundproof with great black out curtains The waterfall shower was cool as well And of course the location was the best a minute walk from the train and metro only ten minutes away from the airport bus stop and right next to the nicest roof top bars and restaurants 
297198,Room Mate Anna, Nothing to complain about , Perfect lication almost in front of Casa Batll Hop on hop off bus around the corner Very comfortable room and bathroom Good breakfast Very very helpful front desk even made reservations for us 
297199,Room Mate Anna, Checkin was not friendly I arrived around 13 30 and was chatting to receptionists about queuing for more than 3 hours at the airport they said the available room is on ground floor and when she showed me the room it was for disabled I told her I want a regular room and then she was not so friendly and said it was the only available rooms if I needed one straight away else I have to wait 30 40 min for my room where I can take a walk outside said it as my only option I don t get it when people checkout at 12 00 they could send someone from housekeeping to make the room fast that is if really none was available I was pretty sure there were available rooms Moreover they could have offered me to sit and have a glass of water or coffee until my room is ready I went out and came back 40 min later when It was obvious for them that I cannot make myself walk after trip and queuing I stayed in same chain in Emma bcn and in New York and they were amazing was surprised with this check in , Location breakfast
297200,Room Mate Anna, They dont serve olives in the breakfast, Location is perfect v close to Casa Batllo La Pedrera and busy shopping street Staff are v friendly and cooperative
297201,Room Mate Anna, The breakfast selection could have been a little better Perhaps pancakes French toast etc and more variation from day to day we stayed 6 nights and practically had the same thing every day , The location the design of the room we had the junior suite and the warmth n friendliness of the front desk staff 
297202,Room Mate Anna, Small room Washstand not in the bathroom but in the main room Very strange I have never seen anything like this in my life , Great location nice and helpful staff 
297203,Room Mate Anna, For me The pillows were thick and solid so it was neck ache of nothing but my partner was ok with them The swimming pool was only open in the summer season and then only approx 11am 6pm, The breakfasts were excellent and then decor interesting There were dairy alternatives for difficult diets and the waitress said I could have asked them for my specific needs i e almond or coconut milk and they would have got it specially so I suggest future guests might like to know this 
297204,Room Mate Anna,No Negative, It s situated across the road from Gaudi s Casa Battlo and next to the Metro which is linked to the train station to the Airport very handy meaning there s unlimited access to the rest of the city The staff at Room Mate Anna were fabulous No problem was too small and every single person greeted or smiled at us as we passed them The room was clean and well presented Cannot fault it 
297205,Room Mate Anna, The room was really small the smallest room I ever stayed in I couldn t imagine two people sharing this room And for the price it should be a little bigger , The design was unique for sure I liked the little gifts in the room like jelly beans etc staff were friendly

297259,Room Mate Anna,No Negative, Central location and very close to good restaurants and tourist attractions Staff well very good and helpful they also helped book local attractions so we avoided ques We had a room that had a small balcony that looked out on Gaudi s house
297260,Room Mate Anna, Smallest room i ever found in hotels over the world On internet photo looked much much bigger I didnt had room to turn around , Staff was friendly room was nicely designed
297261,Room Mate Anna, The hotel does not provide a 24 7 room service or housekeeping which I kinda did expect from a hotel like this , The staff was amazing and super helpful They spoke English and provided all the information about the city with great enthusiasm The rooms are nicely designed and bathrooms are well equipped Location is also great and very close to all the touristy places and metro stations

297264,Room Mate Anna, the entrance to the hotel was a bit dark but the warm reception people were great the outside of the hotel didn t look like a hotel we could have missed it so i think the external presentation should be improved, position of hotel it was modern and a bit quirky which we loved lovely room great shower plenty of hanging space plug sockets 
297265,Room Mate Anna, if you like spacious bedrooms this hotel isn t for you The bathroom didn t have a fan or any type of ventilation that was my only complaint, The location of the hotel was perfect Subway right out side the door right off of Passeig de Gracia and 10 minute walking distance to great restaurants Highly recommend staying here if you are going for leisure
297266,Room Mate Anna, Standard rooms very small Pillows too bouncey Rooftop area unatended with soggy beanbag type loungers, Excellent overhead shower Comfortable bed Friendly staff
297267,Room Mate Anna, Roof terrace opening times a bit restrictive No bar area , Great location very central and within a mile or less of the majority of sights Right outside the train station from the airport which was really very convenient It was super comfy and very clean Shower was amazing Pool area on roof a lovely little escape but would have liked it to open a little earlier in the day WiFi for use outwith hotel could be advertised informed of better I only asked at reception as had read reviews from other guests Breakfast was lovely and had the ability to suit early and late risers Staff were very friendly cheery and helpful I d go back 
297268,Room Mate Anna, Our room was a little dark as it was facing the interior of the block and not the street we were advised about this at check in and offered an upgrade to a street facing suite for 25 per night which we did not take Little room to put your stuff if you want to unpack but would not matter to us as we stayed just 2 nights May be an issue for longer stays, Unbeatable location walking distance to all mayor landmarks and steps from Paseo de Gracia full of top shops and good restaurants Friendly and responsive staff Room was very nice with a modern decoration Comfortable bed and big shower Did not try the beakfrast Would definitely recommend it and stay here again Excelent value for money 
297269,Room Mate Anna, Petty but no bathroom night light Everything else suited what we were after, Excellent chic decor Staff were extra helpful and couldn t do enough to help and advise with tickets and what to do and see
297270,Room Mate Anna, I do like EVERYTHING , Top location Kindness staff Rooftop with terrance and pool Welcomming staff Hype room Five stars breakfast with a lot of options 
297271,Room Mate Anna, Rooms overlooking the atrium are too dark and have no lights at all Room 103 We asked in our reservation higher flors probably were occupied I didn t see other rooms but I guess we got the worst one when I see comments Air conditioning is difficult to adjust the room was impossible to cool down below 24 degrees when you turn down it is on 27 in few minutes Something bad smell from the drain , The location is excellent The staff at the front desk was very polite and nice All the facility in the room and the bathroom shaving set toothbrush 
297272,Room Mate Anna, sometimes bad smell from the drain in bathroom, Love the location it is just perfect and loved the streetview with Casa Batllo from the delux room The room was exactly same lovely as in the picture 
297273,Room Mate Anna,No Negative, The hotel went a step ahead and gave me a wifi anywhere device across Barcelona at no cost They were always helpful and available for any query Strongly reccomend 
297274,Room Mate Anna, Only one little thing was absolutely nowhere to put wet towel and swimsuit after the beach You have to put some small thing at the balcony , One of the best and most beautiful hotels I ve ever stayed Beautiful design great pool small but sooooo cute and cozy totally new clean design Staff very helpful and nice 10 from 10 for this hotel next time we r In Barcelona we r staying in Room Mate Anna 
297275,Room Mate Anna, They didn t tell us that in Barcelona we would be staying at a traditional Chinese style decoration hotel Red lacquer screens in bedroom and even big Tree of Life sculpture over bed Dark breakfast room had heavy black lacquer screens cloud design wallpaper on ceiling and bamboo design wallpaper on walls Bit much in Spain , Good location Clean room Good bed 
297276,Room Mate Anna, Room is to small very cold floors and no sleepers aircondition impossible to fix on right temperature elevator to slow was no normal windows very noisy no room service and etc is it really 4 stars ,No Positive
297277,Room Mate Anna, I couldn t fault the hotel and it s service, Excellent location very friendly staff willing to answer questions regardless however many times asked
297278,Room Mate Anna, I wish they had a loyalty program so we could accumulate points we will definitely want to stay in other Room Mates around the world , The front desk comprising Emma Eva Vincente Ivana and Fernando were a great help Always cheerful happy friendly and ready with sound advice They were terribly sweet and left us a bottle of Cava and box of chocolates to help us celebrate a special day The folks in the breakfast area Benny and Alex were wonderful What is there not to like about this place to begin with it is the location and the easy access to the metro and RENFE train The trip from and to the airport to and from Hotel Room Mate Anna on the train cost us 1 Euro each way and we got off bang across the street from the hotel The hotel is groovy clean neat and new The bed was absolutely the best soooooo comfortable The rain shower in the bathroom thunders down your body and washes away your aches and pains The soaps shampoos and exfoliating scrubs are in plentiful supply and are quite aromatic They even have a supply of fresh toothbrushes and shaving blades We gave Room Mate Anna a 9 5 out of 10 The breakfast was very good but then it is the same every day I would suggest not taking the breakfast package because there are wonderful breakfast areas a stones throw away we preferred the chocolate factory beside the Gaudi Battlo building which Oh BTW is across the street from the hotel 
297279,Room Mate Anna, Nothing, Excellent location Close to everything The staff was very helpful Remember to buy the tickets Casa Battlo Sangadra Familia in the hotel to avoid the long long queue

297282,Room Mate Anna, The room double room relatively small specially if compared to Barcelona standard no balcony no natural lighting very depressing even the entrance of the lobby is almost nonexistent I never felt in a 4 star hotel and I find the place really overrated , Friendly staff and comfy bed

297287,Room Mate Anna, The rooms are quite small but well arranged The one thing I didn t particularly like is that the floors are not carpeted in the room Obviously the bathroom should be hard floored but having bedrooms carpeted gives a cosier feel Otherwise all great , The hotel is excellently located It is brand new so everything is clean and functional Quiet Good amount of toiletries Excellent value for money
