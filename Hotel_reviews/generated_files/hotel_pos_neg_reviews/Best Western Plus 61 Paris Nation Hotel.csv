225419,Best Western Plus 61 Paris Nation Hotel, No complaints, I love this hotel We have no complaints Staff was impeccable and willing to help in every possible way The location of the hotel was awesome close to the metro station line 1 and connects everywhere The location I must warn is in a residential area no night life at all For me with a 4 year old it was perfect and relaxing Hotel was clean clean clean Bathroom was clean plenty of towels double room for 4 and it was awesome The rooms look exactly as pictured The hotel lobby looked exactly as pictured Best western 61 Paris nation Did not misrepresent at all Im so please Warning elevator very very small Hotel hallways also small I had a double room so I had the perfect amount of space to accommodate 4 people 
225420,Best Western Plus 61 Paris Nation Hotel,No Negative, The hotel has easy transportation links to the inner city of Paris just 20 minutes away from the main attractions on the metro perfect if you want to see the sights but don t want to stay in the busy centre The rooms were comfortable and clean with friendly staff to answer any questions the staff speak multiple languages to accomdate all guests 
225421,Best Western Plus 61 Paris Nation Hotel, Rooms were tight to maneuver around Small spaces Elevator made for 2 people or 1 person and 1 suitcase But hey they had an elevator Also street was not easy to find no street sign so we walked right by the street , Breakfast was very good Loved the coffee Beds were comforortable Air conditioning worked like a dream Loved the showers too

225424,Best Western Plus 61 Paris Nation Hotel, The elevator only fit two people so if you can t walk up stairs perhaps not for you And I was traveling on business and my secretary booked the room so I didn t have the credit card to show them when I checked in and this caused an issue , It is hot in the summer and this hotel has great air conditioning The breakfast was superb The very sweet lady who managed it served up a delicious breakfast If you turn right and walk down the Rue de la Voute you will walk 5 minutes to an excellent cafe for dinner And on the Rue de Rendez Vous you will find an excellent green grocer perfect cheese shop and a lively atmosphere Bel Air is a great neighborhood Excellent connections to the yellow and green line Completely surpassed my expectations 
225425,Best Western Plus 61 Paris Nation Hotel, The room was a bit cramped and the temperature was set too high, Friendly and helpful staff and a good location for the metro The breakfast was very good and varied
225426,Best Western Plus 61 Paris Nation Hotel, Small corridors Tiny lift All hotel Hard to locate, The rooms are small and the corridor and lift very narrow Infact the hotel is very very small Unlike the pictures which give an illusion of grandeur The hotel is also not easy to locate Near to metro which is a plus Very modern and friendly staff We had a good stay just the size of hotel that was a little setback but great value for our money in Paris I might return I recommend it if you want a good clean place to retire to each night 
225427,Best Western Plus 61 Paris Nation Hotel, Elevator was a little scary Never been in that small Our last breakfast we were there 3 nights was a little dissapointing as we were maybe spoiled the first time Most food was gone But as said overall experience was very nice , Many complained about the size of the rooms So we were prepared for very little space However we had the family room s So we actually had double the space others had on our floor Both rooms had their own TV shower was nice and clean View was not great but we were gone most of the time anyway Metro line 1 was just 100mtr away from the hotel 
225428,Best Western Plus 61 Paris Nation Hotel, The train was easy and fast good value too , The smell of the city as there was urin on the streets and it smelled Not very clean the city of Paris

225430,Best Western Plus 61 Paris Nation Hotel, We paid the city tax on our first day but on the last day somehow they had a new calculation and aggressively stressed us because of a 1 14 balance , This Hotel offered great value for the money we paid The rooms are small but quiet and clean and the receptionists helped us out with every matter according metro connections or disneyland information 
225431,Best Western Plus 61 Paris Nation Hotel, No problems at all, Everything was good an good service and very helpful and would recommend to a friend because good value for money an near transport an easy to travel
225432,Best Western Plus 61 Paris Nation Hotel, 1 Very noisy We expected to see soundproof room but we heard every sound in the next rooms and corridor like it was said near us Police sirens are each 5 10 mins Room s door is made of plywood It s hard to sleep in such room 2 Very tight It s absolutely uncomfortable for 2 people Very tiny room narrow corridor small elevator 3 Shower s door was broken when we arrived 4 Not enough toiletries 5 Wi fi is for web and mail only Other ports blocked VoIP VPN online radio etc weren t working 6 I hardly agree that this is a four star hotel, Fridge decoration of hotel and room Metro station is near
