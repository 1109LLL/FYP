482405,Novotel Milano Linate Aeroporto, Too cold can not control temperature They are using plastic cups instead glass , Good quality room and shuttle bus Very nice and kind staffs Good location to use airport 
482406,Novotel Milano Linate Aeroporto, The hairdryer didn t work but I only found out when I needed to use it on the morning of departure , The hotel is very close to Linate airport and the journey to from the airport only took about 10 minutes although it should be noted that there was no traffic at the times I was travelling The shuttle service is free but you need to phone the hotel when you have collected your bags at the airport to let them know you are waiting Note that the shuttle is not a 24 hour service the times are given on booking com s website The room was clean and comfortable and quite spacious with tea coffee making facilities I would recommend this hotel to travellers who need to make an overnight stop near Linate airport but not for those who plan to stay in Milan to see the city s sights as it s a bit too far from the centre for that 
482407,Novotel Milano Linate Aeroporto, To visit Milan centre takes a while There is a tram but it doesn t run late At night going back to the hotel after diner or clubbing you will have to take a taxi Taxi s are relatively expensive , The breakfast was exstensive Friendly personel 
482408,Novotel Milano Linate Aeroporto, Well cannot think of anything , For my next day early flight this hotel made my life easy Very nice at all levels spend some sunshine time in the nice park next to the pool Very calm with a little bar and sunbeds around Reception area with bar and next to it a nice restaurant overlooking the pool and park Very comfortable beds and efficient rooms with all up to date equipment for biz activities 
482409,Novotel Milano Linate Aeroporto, The restaurant was very expensive but to be expected in a high quality hotel like this I suppose, The Novotel was so clean and well organised had everything we needed and more would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing comfortable stay near milan
482410,Novotel Milano Linate Aeroporto, The place is almost out of the city From Novotel to the dom for example 40 minutes by tram or 30 euro cab ride Not very clean , The staff is very nice and helpful good breakfast 
482411,Novotel Milano Linate Aeroporto, Nothing, It is a super modern hotel Very clean beautiful bedroom very comfortable bed and with the biggest TV I ve ever had on my hotel room Wifi is also strong until the room I arrive almost at 11pm but I still manage to get free shuttle from Linate the staffs very helpful and fast response when I asked about this service through mail So it s very convenient I wish I could stay longer and have a better weather to enjoy the swimming pool Oh they have a nice breakfast too plenty of choices

482417,Novotel Milano Linate Aeroporto, There is nothing I didn t like , The room was beautiful I was on the top floor and it was wonderful The bed was so comfortable that I had the best sleep ever The staff were so friendly and helpful The hotel has a lovely welcoming atmosphere and the breakfast was AMAZING I will definitely be back again THANK YOU 
482418,Novotel Milano Linate Aeroporto, The hotel lobby and dining room was too cold in temperature during my entire visit I also didn t like that the dining room moved to an auxiliary room on some nights due to convention groups being at the hotel This made me feel less valued than other guests You should have more than 1 person assisting in the check in process This made a poor impression on me There was no apology for the delay and the check in person said nothing about the amenities of the hotel I had to ask questions and she seemed impatient Finally my luggage had been lost by the airline I informed the hotel reception that the airline found my bag and would deliver it to the hotel Since all of my clothes were in the list luggage I implored the hotel representative to contact me when it arrived as I was desperate to change my clothes I was told the hotel would follow through I kept checking throughout the day and night and the hotel said they didn t have my bag I checked with the airline and they indicated that the bag had been delivered to the hotel some time ago I went to the reception to inquire again and at first they said it hadn t arrived I asked if they could check again and they found it None of the fine hotels I have visited throughout the world would treat guests in this manner I am very disappointed with Novotel , The proximity of the hotel to Linate Airport the process of ordering a taxi the housekeepers and dining room staff were very welcoming 
482419,Novotel Milano Linate Aeroporto, The staff at check in was efficient but not friendly very brash The eggs at breakfast were very runny too runny And the room carpet did not look or feel clean , The bed was very comfortable Breakfast included in the room cost and started early enough to have before my departure flight

482424,Novotel Milano Linate Aeroporto, The food at breakfast was very limited in respect to what we would have expected uk travellers But tasty none the less maybe could do with some more hot food options and more fruit , The location was perfect for the event that we were attending concert at fabrique 5 minute walk and the free airport shuttle bus was excellent very tidy and comfy rooms and couldn t fault the helpfulness of the staff 
482425,Novotel Milano Linate Aeroporto, Room was not very clean Huge stain on the carpet Hallway smelled moldy Extremely rude restaurant staff member I had just walked off stage the night before in Rome and ran for the train in the morning So no dinner and no breakfast When I arrived at the hotel at 3 pm the restaurant had been closed for 30 minutes All the bar could offer was sandwiches and I was dying for some sort of a hearty pasta meal The front desk staff arranged for me to have a little bit of lasagna and bread I sat in the restaurant and the man who worked at the restaurant seemed pissed that I was there and was extremely rude I thanked him profusely It s not like he had to stay past his shift The front desk took pity on a starving opera singer and he was rude I was willing to eat ANYTHING he had in the kitchen , Amazing front desk staff 
482426,Novotel Milano Linate Aeroporto, Could have had actual tea cups for the coffee making facilities rather than plastic ones so we could have another cup Also really basic could use some art on the walls , Very basic but nice for a quick stay if you need to get to other transport quickly but wouldnt stay here if just for a holiday Breakfast was extra but had most options I ve seen at a breakfast buffet so worth it
