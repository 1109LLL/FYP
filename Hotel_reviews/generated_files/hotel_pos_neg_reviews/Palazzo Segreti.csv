487120,Palazzo Segreti, Almost impossible to find Drove around and actually past it for at least half an hour The tiniest of signs is by the front door No parking available Had to drive to a parking garage about half mile away and walk back Got lost again Next morning we did not receive our wake up call and missed our tour to see The Last Supper our main reason for staying in Milan The receptionist was able to get us a ticket the next day so we were able to see it then but that delayed our departure and limited what we could do that day , It is located near what you want to see as a tourist Receptionist was helpful in correcting problem with missed wake up call 
487121,Palazzo Segreti, Didn t sleep either night as the sound proofing was atrocious Woken by returning guests at 2am and woken again at 5am by a car alarm and the daily street cleaner Complained to management who seemed to think pointing out how great the design is excuses the lack of functionality of the room As for the design interesting but not enough lighting TV not working and breakfast basic and dull No compensation offered despite horrific high price , Location excellent but still not worth the money 
487122,Palazzo Segreti, Having booked a suite with breakfast included having to restrict oneself to 1 beverage included orange juice defined as an extra my 11 year old daughter doesn t drink coffee mini Bar poorly stocked 2 TV screens both of which useless with Italian channels only luckily we were able to watch Netflix on our iPad shower gel body lotion not nice towels all had a horrible smell to them from storage , The perfect location Freshly made beds every day 
487123,Palazzo Segreti,No Negative, I appreciate that the hotel is in a quiet alley with hardly no traffic It is also situated absolutely perfect close to shopping and all the other interesting things in the very city centre of Milano Really beautiful design of the hotel Good breakfast and nice staff 
487124,Palazzo Segreti, Parking was a bit far away and the hotel itself was a bit hard to find at first but no major issues , Great location Staff was super helpful friendly and all around fantastic Design and overall comfort was great Breakfast was great Unbelievable value for the money 3 5 min walk to Milan Cathedral and 5 10 min walk to get to less touristy design oriented neighborhood shops etc Would definitely stay here again 
487125,Palazzo Segreti, Lift is too small for luggage bags Concierge is not available at all times Rooms are not sound proof Configuration of bathroom is not practical , It s location
487126,Palazzo Segreti,No Negative, Great and beautiful small design hotel friendly and helpful staf perfect location Sober breakfast though fresh organic and sufficient The perfect stay 
487127,Palazzo Segreti, Suggestions Place drawers in the rooms Put two small bottles of complimentary water in the room Place a bath towel hook near the shower Buy a better quality iron and ironing board, The physical style of the hotel Good contimental breakfast Great location
487128,Palazzo Segreti, A little pricy for a hotel that wasn t full , Beds are very comfortable and minimalist ambience makea it a visual delight with a very dark interior Wonderful location right beside via Dante and Castello Sforzesco 
487129,Palazzo Segreti, Air conditioning was ineffective Having to pay for extra coffee at breakfast Room smelled musty but was very clean, Just a short walk to the major attractions of Milan The lift was fun Super friendly staff Nice simple breakfast
487130,Palazzo Segreti, Some constuction work going on nearby woke us early on one morning , Great location friendly staff simple breakfasts were perfect Bed awesome and shower too 
487131,Palazzo Segreti, Breakfast was bio and fresh but no eggs cheese was not great 1 choice only and cakes were dried Breakfast wa ok but not great , Well Located nice design staff nice and helping Bed was great 
487132,Palazzo Segreti, Minor glitches only one towel for a king bed room Shower was dimly lighted and the shower head was obstructed and spitting water in random directions , Truly enjoyable check in experience great minimal design quiet room and very comfortable bed 
487133,Palazzo Segreti, , Modern design Minimalist Very good rooms Good bed Great location Right in the centre of the centre Can walk anywhere in central milan Excellent breakfast in very nice modern environment
487134,Palazzo Segreti, As it is an old building you can hear noise of people walking across the corridors, Amazing Design and very friendly staff I loved the atmosphere of the hotel and would definitly come back 
487135,Palazzo Segreti, I think the rate of the room is to high for the standard I got cold water shower twice during my stay , I like the location and the internal architecture style of the hotel 
487136,Palazzo Segreti,No Negative, a modern minimalistic oasis with the centre of Milan at your doorstep My room was spacious simple in design no unnecessary clutter with window that opened to let in fresh air the bustling sounds of the city Bathroom a good size Staff were helpful engaging Breakfast typically boutique but more than adequate Overall a thoroughly enjoyable experience 
487137,Palazzo Segreti, The room needs a full length mirror The bathroom needs more hooks or other ways to hang towels Also the room was dark because of the location in the back that s fine but then it needs brighter lighting , Location perfect great breakfast comfortable bed and elegant modern furnishings The staff are unfailingly friendly helpful and polite 
487138,Palazzo Segreti,No Negative, All staff are really helpful This hotel is located in nice area close to palace Duomo and fashion district Room is a bit small but well equipped and decorated 
487139,Palazzo Segreti, The body lotion The rest is perfect, Palazzo Segreti is right in the heart of Milan close to the Duomo the Scala and shopping areas It is elegantly decorated and furnished extremely comfortable and the staff are very helpful
487140,Palazzo Segreti, The room 26 was a bit dark the ceiling in the bathroom has been repaired but not repainted and more importantly you can hear EVERYTHING from the small road below even conversations between people chatting below your windows For 420 Euros I expect a lot more, excellent location and extremely nice staff
487141,Palazzo Segreti,No Negative, Step out of the hotel take a few steps towards Via Dante and you re immediately engulged by Milano s tourist crowd It s a great location especially if you re here to visit the Expo Milano 2015 Cairoli station is just a three minute walk away from the hotel and you re at the Expo in about 25 minutes for 2 50 You can find everything you need around the hotel And if you re the kind that likes to shop there s plenty to keep you occupied The hotel values form over function so if you re traveling for business and need a desk or table to place your laptop to work from well chances are you might not get that At least not in the single room I booked a quiet room and even though I didn t hear any of the hustle and bustle from the hallway and stairs the room i got faced two small side streets and that was fairly busy so make sure you close the windows for some peace and quiet Breakfast at the hotel is a basic affair true to its general theme You can get bread cheese croissants and meat but you ll have to order the eggs seperately if you want them Staff were friendly and very helpful You even get six free international phone calls from your room if you think you need the service This was very useful to me as roaming on my phone took two days to get activated so i definitely made use of this service You can t dial local Italian phone numbers though Go figure I would definitely stay here again 
487142,Palazzo Segreti, Nothing we didn t like but a tip for other travellers with a car the one way systems make it difficult to approach Nearest car park is other side of the Piazza del Duomo at Autosilo di Diaz You won t need your car anyway for exploring , The welcome as soon as we arrived on a hot afternoon we were given a cool drink of water Thereafter the staff went out of their way to be helpful The breakfast quality and choice was very good The room was very modern and comfortable The wifi connectivity was excellent in all parts of the hotel It is within 10 min walk of the Duomo
