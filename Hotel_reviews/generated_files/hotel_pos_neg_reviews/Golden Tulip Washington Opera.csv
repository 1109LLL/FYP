205567,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, Bathroom was not clean We found nails on sink Also water was accumulating in sink and bath tub it was impossible to have a shower the shower handle spreads water everywhere which makes the whole bath room sink in water We had two rooms and both rooms had the same problem ,No Positive
205568,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, The rooms are in desperate need of a refresh The beds are horrible The bathroom is more updated and functional You have to hunt for a plug and the carpets need to be replaced , Great location if you know the city and helpful staff Just a few blocks from Rue de Rivoli at the Louvre and the Metro Easy walk to Chatelet les Halles and Pompidou
205569,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, The rooms are very very dated Our room was very old the furniture looked dingy and it had an odd odour Unfortunately the bathroom was not very clean there was hair on the ceiling and weird orange dots Nightstands were very dusty , Location amazing 5 min walking distance from the Louvre tons of shops and restaurants nearby Super friendly staff
205570,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, the only thing that was a bit annoying was the wifi it was very slow and the signal kept getting lost, the location was perfect a 3 min walk to the Louvre restaurants and mini markets are all around the Metro station is also a 3 min walk the hotel cozy feel to it and the front desk reception was very hospitable 
205571,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, Beware if you have dust allergies Lots of curtains carpets bedding etc, Excellent location great value for money Beautiful area with lots of cosy breakfast places and restaurants 
205572,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, There is no parking on site Public parking in Paris is expensive Wifi is not very good , The location was good Just a short walk to the Louvre and Notre Dame The rooms were decorated nicely and the beds comfortable 
205573,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, Air con in room was set for heat only this could not be changed for individual rooms so when the ambient temperature in the room was high even with the air con off the only way to cool the room was open the windows which made it quite noisy Although the room had a mini bar there were no facilities in the room to make a hot drink and none in the hotel that were available to use during the day not very good for a 4 star rated hotel , Hotel location was excellent and staff were very friendly and helpful
205574,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, That you still owe me money You took the money off my account and I paid with another now I m missing 3100 kr off my account and it s taking TOO long to get back on , Was a very beautiful room
205575,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, Bathroom is small room size was small for a triple but this is not a reflection on the hotel but big city living , Staff were very friendly location was amazing Hotel was small and elegant 
205576,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, I booked a triple room but third bed was a temporary bed and not so comfortable Shower over bath could be better, Excellent staff and the interior decor was beautiful

205579,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, The huge amount of tax per night as it worked out almost double the cost of the booking of the rooms a cost of over 1 700 euros more , The star were very helpful and the rooms clean and tidy
205580,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, The double beds are rather small and the hotel is due for a renovation however everything was cleaned very well , Staff was very friendly location was great 
205581,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, Tea coffee making set in the room would be nice Wifi was awfully slow and reminded me of the old dial up modem times, Great location in walking distance from the Louvre Attentive staff at the reception Clean rooms
205582,Golden Tulip Washington Opera,No Negative, the staff at the reception were very friendly and helpful the location was close to many touristic and commercial areas Musee du Louvre Rue de Rivoli Opera etc 
205583,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, The hotel does not look great from the outside but is very nice inside I was a little dissapointed by the breakfast selection for teh price but it is France , A brilliant central location making it easy to walk to all the main attractions Staff were very friendly and helpful on arrival and departure including arranging taxis etc I was hot and tired on arrival so lay on my bed to rest and enjoyed the live orchestra music coming from the theatre opposite 
205584,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, Breakfast room is a bit dark but nicely decorated With three beds there is not a lot of room to spare, They accommodated 3 single beds in a room Beds were really comfy Bathroom was good sized Location is great for hop on hop off tours Location is great from dining out or in grocery stores around Staff was great
205585,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, Although it is well located to Palais Royale the street is not very well lit at night and not highly trafficked so would not recommend walking solo even though the neighborhood is excellent overall , The staff was SO nice The concierge called me a taxi and since it was very early and a woman traveling solo insisted I not go to the ATM and communicated with the cab driver I would need to stop or pay by card The rooms are small but so cozy and it is is very clean 
205586,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, The room was in unfit state to rent AC not working tolet seat was insecure No contact number card to call reception WI FI did not work until staff re set system No price for mini bar No complimentary water Winter wooly blanket on bed instead of duvet poor value for money decoration state below other hotels I forgot my family calendar and will see if hotel hold it for me , Friendly staff at reception and very helpful

205591,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, Breakfast could be more varied but this is typical for Paris, Extremely nice and friendly staff at reception Great location walking distance to Louvre Opera and shopping area 
205592,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, The hotel describes itself as having parking this is misleading as the parking was in a public carpark a good 10 minutes walk away and at a substantial price Room service was not available we were told this was exceptionellement which can happen but annoying when you have arrived tired and hungry and with young children so not wanting to go out They could do better at breakfast than serve Babybel given all the amazing cheeses France has to offer Shower curtain barrier leaked badly which meant the bathroom floor was flooded instantly, The room was nicely decorated Staff were friendly 
205593,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, Not even a bottle of water in the room for such a price at a 4 star hotel Let alone coffee tea or anything at all Walls made of paper You ll here all the neighbours staff shouting in the corridors everything , Location Cleanness 
205594,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, Hot water was off at some point during the night Bath tub might be too high for old people , Very good location The staff is fantastic especially Kais hope I spelt that correctly We had maps and directions to nice places There s a laundromat conveniently located across the street Really nice eating places around Le Tambour food was delicious which was walking distance from the hotel There s a post office in the area The lighting in the room is dim so I guess it may sit well with some more than others There s two subways which are both walking distance 5mins 
205595,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, Triple Room is a bit cramp for 3 people No tea and coffee making facilities No bottled water supplied, Location Energy saving lights and sensors installed at the corridor Super easy at check in Friendly and courteous staff 
205596,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, The lack of tea coffee making facilities in the rooms is common in French hotels although absolutely normal elsewhere It s a real nuisance to have to go out or go through the fuss and expense of room service for a hot drink in one s room , The location was perfect for me My room was large for a hotel in the centre of Paris and comfortable 
205597,Golden Tulip Washington Opera, Internet connection very slow without the opportunity for paid upgrade to a faster service Shower setup a bit dated , The location staff and quality of the rooms were all very good
