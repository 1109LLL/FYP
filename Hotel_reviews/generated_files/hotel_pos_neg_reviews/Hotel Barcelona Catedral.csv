293560,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Tv could have more international channels with English speaking programmes not just bbc news and CNN, This hotel has a perfect central location the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and the room was very clean and of superb quality with a really comfy bed 
293561,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The air con didn t seem to work that great and some nights could get quite stuffy But as a whole was impressed and happy with the hotel , The hotel was at a good standard and for me what makes it is the location and how close you are to all of the sites The cathedral is on your doorstep and a lovely Vietnamese restaurant around the corner 
293562,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The shower we had difficulty operating the shower and were unable to get any hot water however after informing reception this was rectified by the second day , The breakfast choices were good and the staff efficient
293563,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Building work ongoing so noisy at times and restaurant not available other than breakfast Bar was frequently unattended so getting snacks drinks sometimes took a little more effort than expected Facilities were OK but it s the location you re really paying for Free wifi is a plus but the signal was typically poor unless in the hotel lobby , Fantastic location right by the cathedral and in the heart of the Gothic quarter Friendly and helpful staff Nice clean room 
293564,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, Very rich breakfast the hotel was spotless a real pleasure great location and a highly intuitive staff always available to answer questions and supply information in a quiet manner totally went the extra mile thanks guys for the birthday wishes in the room 
293565,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The staff seemed overwhelmed and it was hard to get their attention for help Also the hotel was under construction and the construction was very loud during the day Plus the hotel was overrun by college students young adults who seemed to be going to the beach You could hear loud music at night and the general vibe of the hotel was very loud and chaotic Also it is very close to the Barcelona Cathedral so there are crowds and a lot of noise in the area If you are looking for a relaxing quiet environment I don t think this is the hotel for you , The room was clean and relatively spacious and the right price so those are definite plusses 
293566,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, I normally book 5 hotels because of the service they provide I however booked this hotel based on the reviews it had received on booking com which were super positive I must say I do not think paying 300 per night breakfast for a room at this hotel is money worth while So the reviews did not live up to my expectations You pay for the location everything else is just ok Breakfast was really average It was also very time consuming to organize a taxi pick up at the airport The hotel never reverted to my initial request and I had to reach out again to them and the email I got was in bad English and very unclear as to how transportation is arranged I had to call them to sort it out The hotel collaborates with VIP taxi company which is very slow in responding and clearly has no urgency to respond to client requests I ended up spending too much time on something that normally gets dealt with in an emsil I am used to better service and will next time choose a hotel that provides that , Great location The best part of the hotel 
293567,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Taxi drivers getting lost trying to find the hotel Soulless reception and exterior Unfriendly unhelpful staff it appeared understaffed Collecting and returning towel for rooftop pool to reception Would seem much more logical to have them available at the pool The towels looked a bit past their best too , Location Rooftop pool
293568,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, lower price, i like the location because its near the cathedral and the room was clean and the staff were very helpful i had a nice stay in this hotel and i would recommend it to my friends
293569,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Booked a double room only one breakfast was included argued about thus but had to pay fir second breakfast then had to leave mist if it because we had to get the taxi to the airport , Would have preferred a buffet breakfast instead of having to order it we were in a hurry to get to the airport to catch a plane 
293570,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, They had a happy half hour but seemed a bit tight and not really relaxing Better to not have it or extend it to an hour to tempt people to stay, Pleasant good size room
293571,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The fact that there are on going heavy works at the ground floor restaurant during peak season couped with the fact that we were not informed in advance was a let down The above is a sign that the hotel shareholders should perhaps look into the operation management and marketing dept and check their motivation levels Both depts show lack of interest and enthusiasm as in my opinion they should have 1 planned and executed these works during winter time 2 offer a discount to their guests or a free dinner at a restaurant or some additional perks as a compensation On the other hand the reception desk seem to be working struggling on their own without any help from management In our 4 days there I never once saw any manager walking the job there , The fact that the reception staff did their best to ease us and were very sympathetic to our discovery of on going heavy works made our shock a it better It was obvious that it was NOT their fault To their credit they put us in rooms where we could not hear a single thump or any hammering so we soon forgot about our initial horror Once we were sorted everything run smoothly and we had a great and unforgettable time Generally all the reception staff were super cool and very customer oriented The management of the hotel should give them a bonus Especially the guy who had his aunt visiting and who warned us about the flight cancellations to Madrid He should be promoted 
293572,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, Comfortable room Friendly and very helpful staff Excellent breakfasts Wonderful swimming pool on the roof Excellent to relax in after the hot hustle and bustle in the city 
293573,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Service of snacks in the lobby could be better had to go on the hunt for staff However they were very prompt with pool orders and were good in the bar Other than that no issues at all , Staff were very friendly and helpful Modern and very clean Lots of room for travel cot which they provided with surprise Teddy Bear gift for baby and buggy Shower Excellent WiFi the best I ve experienced in a hotel very fast Location couldn t be better Air Con was good Large flatscreen TV Pool on roof was small but did the job not too busy 
293574,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The air conditioner didn t seem to be cooling properly in the room , Great location for sightseeing shopping and restaurants Super nice front desk staff Complimentary happy hour Good size rooms toiletries 
293575,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, Lovely complimentary wine and cheese tasting of an evening Good shower and modern bathroom Nice little roof top pool not large but perfect for a splash 
293576,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, What we absolutely didn t appreciate and felt as a complete lack of professionalism and respect being promised a taxi within 5 10 that never showed up never even being told that taxis couldn t at that particular time reach the hotel which resulted in having to run almost 1 km chase a taxi with luggages and one of us being unfit to do so because of back problems WHAT WE TOUGHT THE HOTEL SHOULD JUST DROP a proposal for wine and cheese tasting that results in almost only one sip of a not so dry white wine and barely a cm of cheese per person , The location mostly and breakfast were quiet good we were happily surprised by this because of the winetasting s unexisting quality the day before I would have said personnel too if it weren t for the unpleasant ending of our stay 
293577,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, We had really good breakfasts with very friendly staff The pool on the roof was a real bonus a great spot to unwind after a busy day sightseeing The location of the hotel was very convenient for seeing the sights of Barcelona One more bonus was the fantastic mosaic The Kiss virtually outside the font door you must see this if you visit Barcelona
293578,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Lacked places to store clothing and other travel items No drawers which may be good as things cannot be left behind Well designed but nowhere to set a second suitcase Limited hangers Shower was great but needed easy instructions to operate Asked for a bathmat as tub was slick as in new Once acquainted with European electricity savers liked the use of room card to turn on and off all electricity A little tricky at first , Best location to sites Sunday 10am free tour of historic Barcelona was the best tour ever He told where we would be going announced the historic dates so nothing was confusing The tour moved without rushing and stopping was in shade Wish could have this guide for all tours 
293579,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The room was very hot when we arrived and took a few hours to get down to temperature The shower didn t have a shelf to put your toiletries on There was a taxi strike starting at 06 00 which meant that we had to leave at 05 30 to get to the train station when our train left at 09 30 not the hotels fault and they did put up notices in the lifts to say that the strike was happening , Great location for exploring the Gothic district lots of winding lanes to go down The room was very comfortable loved the swing round television The staff were very friendly and helpful and spoke perfect English Will stay there again when we go back to Barcelona 
293580,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The hotel doesn t have much food options inside, Fabulous location right across the cathedral plenty of action the minute you step out of the hotel Within easy reach of most spots la ramblas cathedral the beach and many more 
293581,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, We received a random charge after check out for 4 euros No explanation None of us used anything out of their bowl of snacks We had 3 rooms to accommodate all of us so our bill was large to begin with so I feel the 4 Euros was a bit ridiculous Its not like I would make an international call for 4 euros so , It is in a nice location Walkable to many sights close to a taxi stand The Barcelona Cathedral is right there The rooms were clean and a pretty good size The AC worked well We never had the breakfast because there is an excellent coffee shop next door highly recommended We would stay again 
293582,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, service from some staff members could have been better it felt like you were being troublesome if you asked for anything Info at the hotel said the bar stayed open till 12pm on Saturday but it closed at 11pm but nobody came to tell us and we were sitting in the bar , brilliant location right in the center for metro tourist buses shops restaurants etc We were at the side of the cathedral square and there was something happening there all the time musicians street performers markets 
293583,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Ni A, Locations is fabulous right in the Gotbic Quarter and only a few blocks from La Rambla and Placa de La Catalunya The offer free walking tours and a early be and cheese tasting very evening 
293584,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Nothing comes to mind , Quiet neighbourhood despite central location Spacious comfortable room with large luxurious bathroom Great breakfasts Also very helpful staff especially at reception desk 
293585,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The breakfast is too expensive The door to our room didnt shut properly You had to force it , The location is perfect The bed is very comfortable and staff are friendly
293586,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, A very small niggle we only had one drawer in the bedroom my friend lived out of her suitcase this did not detract from the holiday or the hotel , We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Barcelona Catedral the staff were lovely and friendly they were so helpful to 2 older ladies We had a wonderful 5 days in Barcelona 
293587,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Would have appreciated an iron and ironing board in the room and also some body lotion with the complimentary toiletries , Exceptionally comfortable beds modern decor Room nice and clean The breakfast selection was very good although I personally preferred the bacon and sausages to be cooked more 
293588,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The hotel printed out my card details EVERYTHING Even my CVV number Then they put it in an unlocked drawer with other people s card info When I questioned them I was met with ridicule since they have been doing this for a long time Well just bc you have been doing this for a long time it does not mean that it is the right way to do it They violated privacy policies On the last day we asked them to destroy the paper that had my card details Someone could buy sg really nice on the internet with all those card info Btw I ve notified my bank too , Great location Clean room Comfortable design not too stuffed with ridiculous items 
293589,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The hotel printed out my card details EVERYTHING Even my CVV number Then they put it in an unlocked drawer with other people s card info When I questioned them I was met with ridicule since they have been doing this for a long time Well just bc you have been doing this for a long time it does not mean that it is the right way to do it They violated privacy policies On the last day we asked them to destroy the paper that had my card details Someone could buy sg really nice on the internet with all those card info Btw I ve notified my bank too , Great location Clean room Comfortable design not too stuffed with ridiculous items 
293590,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, There was a serious water leak through the ceiling in the reception area on our second afternoon which had come from a bedroom This went on for several hours But the hotel staff gave us no information about whether the other bedrooms were safe or whether any water was travelling elsewhere above No information was displayed which could have said do not worry etc No sign of a manager just the usual very good reception staff , The breakfast was excellent Plenty of choice good fresh bread and pastries and a choice of cooked dishes too 
293591,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Air conditioner didn t get very cold and the window didn t open , Great location literally around the corner for Cathedral Upscale modern style hotel 
293592,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Air conditioning was a tad weak No other complaints , Nice reception helpful staff comfortable bed very good breakfast Nice menu and buffet choices This hotel is wonderfully situated in the old town the heart of the tourist center Easy walk to the barrio gothico and the Rambla Lots of restaurants close by 
293593,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Nothing really to fault If there had been a bar next to the rooftop pool that would have been superb but it s not an issue , Hotel location is excellent right in the middle of the old town everything seems close by Staff don t fuss around you you can just get on with your own thing Excellent breakfast included as part of costs
293594,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The Gym needs more equipment A little bit of investment is needed, A wonderful hotel Want to go back but it seems to be full booked all the time Great staff great location clean and airy It really is a lovely place to stay
293595,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Breakfast is offered but it is expensive as they charge 18 50 euros per person , Great location right behind the cathedral and one or two blocks to Las Ramlas 
293596,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Due to the location and it being a very touristy area we had heard that pickpocketing was very common in that area We didn t experience this ourselves however , We had such a great experience here The staff was so welcoming and accommodating to us My husband and I were traveling with our nine month old and they were really wonderful in accomedating the baby One day they even surprised us with a teddy bear and personalized note for her Another thing we appreciated was the staff keeping us informed on the current happenings of the city There was a taxi strike the day we were leaving and they told us about it the day before so we could be properly prepared When we got to the airport shuttle line which was very long due to the no taxis there were many people who didn t know about the strike and missed their flights We were very happy that they provided us with this information 
293597,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Nothing negative to say about this hotel and location , The hotel is very clean and modern with a fantastic rooftop terrace and pool The location is perfect you can walk to everything Plenty of restaurants shops and bars very near and the cathedral is incredible 
293598,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Everything was perfect Couldn t fault this place , The location was fantastic I hadn t realised how central we were going to be The front desk staff were so friendly and efficient Loved the small hotel personal experience 
293599,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The closet doesn t have shelf, Pleasant and quite hotel Great location a few minutes from everywhere Easy to reach from airport by bus Fine room The staff were kind and talk English The hotel and the rooms are exactly as in the pictures 
293600,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, I liked the location of the hotel and the friendly staff The Spanish omelette with tomato bread was so delicious There was tons of shopping and restaurants in this area In addition to shopping and food there where many entertainers and musicians preforming around the cathedral and in the streets There was never a dull or boring moment in this neighbourhood 
293601,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Asked for extra pillows and towels when the reservation was make but never received them Asked the cleaning staff and they hardly spoke english and seemed rude , Centrally located Great breakfast 
293602,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, We liked everything , The bed and bedding were very nice The staff were over and above helpful to us when we forgot to pack something The found a replacement for us The location is excellent and within steps to the historic sights Our visit was brief on our way to France but we would eagerly stay there again 
293603,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Rooms were pretty small but comfortable and clean , The location was amazing Walking out the door to see the Barcelona Cathedral was overwhelmingly beautiful 
293604,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Everything was easy I was happy as a tea drinker with the hot water kettle but my niece who is a coffee drinker only had instant coffee or as we called it water coffee , The helpfulness and friendliness of the staff made our stay memorable The hotel is modern and extremely clean There was a kettle to boil hot water As a tea drinker I was extremely happy with the kettle this was my favorite Most hotels only provide coffee and the machine is usually tainted by coffee residue Yeah for the kettle 
293605,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, Excellent location in the Gotic quarter we were able to walk everywhere Easy to get to the Metro or tour bus stops Nice restaurants nearby Liked the small boutique feel of the hotel and the staff was very helpful we would definitely stay here again 
293606,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, I have NO complaints , Fantastic location right next to the Cathedral and Gothic Quarter so it was easy to walk to Playa Catalunya metro stations La Ramblas Barcelona harbor Gaudi s Casa Batllo La Pedrera The night time free walking tour of the Gothic Quarter was excellent Very spacious room and closet extremely comfortable bed nice assortment of snacks and mini bar as well as toiletries The staff was extremely friendly and helpful Since I was alone and didn t speak Spanish they were very helpful in telling me how to get to the places I was going The pool deck was small but nice Very good tapas restaurants within a block or two of hotel Great little cafe for coffee and pastries right next to hotel too I stayed 2 nights 3 days and really enjoyed the hotel and loved Barcelona 
293607,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, loved the bed so big and comfy great location easy from the airport bus stop short walk the chocolate box next door is fantastic also the vietnamise the other side was great food 
293608,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, There was a serious water leak in the area outside the lifts and reception on our day 2 Water was pouring through the ceiling from the first floor through the light fittings This went on for several hours but was cleaned and a temporary repair made The area was out of use for quite a time There was no information given to guests at all about whether the hotel was safe or whether part of it would be closed because of water damage There seemed to be no manager on duty to either give messages to guests or to talk to them to reassure that all was well We expect 4 to have visible managers at times like this , Breakfast was excellent though expensive 
293609,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Room lighting could be stronger , Staff were all helpful and smiling There was a problem one afternoon with a pipe leak in the lobby which caused the hot water to be off to get fixed When it was resolved staff knocked on every room to let us know That s over the top service And it is tucked away from the noise 
293610,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Rooms felt a little small No drawers Not enough staff at breakfast at busy times Really wanted to love this hotel but didn t but can t quite put my finger on why Would I stay there again Probably , Excellent location Comfy beds Great shower
293611,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The shower did not work properly i could not switch it on the middle mode And i wanted to upgrade to have a friend stay with me i had a twin room but i was not allowed The explanation its our policy made me grumpy The breakfast is overpriced , The bed was good although i did not get what i ordered The room was beautifull very well equipped i got a bike for free and although i did not use pool or gym its good to know i could 
293612,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Unfortunately the air conditioning never really worked except to blow out warm air it worked well throughout the rest of the building We mentioned it several times to the front desk and they assured us it would be taken care of and that it was fixed but despite being set to maximum cool it never cooled off the room leaving to our not getting a good nights sleep When I asked to be moved to another room due to my husbands emphesema I was told the hotel was completely booked This was during the annual May Day holiday but our lack of a healthy sleep made our stay uncomfortable , The room was immaculate and the bed was very comfortable The bathroom was mosern with all the conveniences you would expect from a 4 star rated hotel The location is outstanding just off Cathedral Square 
293613,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, We had the best time of our city trip so no dislikes , The service the staff was providing patiently friendly and professional Allthough the taxi strike was unexpected the staff helped us out by providing altenatives to travel back to the airport 
293614,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, I was under the impression breakfast was included Also l thought it was misleading about the amount of payment to you The first payment said the amount including v a t total Then further on another page it added tax The consequences were my holiday was more expensive than I thought Though I enjoyed it turned out more expensive and l had less spending money I think you should have made the overall price more clear , The bed was comfortable The room very nice Staff very helpful 
293615,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, The beds were very comfortable the breakfast was excellent and everybody that worked there were so nice and helpful The best thing was the location right by the cathedral and in car free zone I would recommend it highly and will stay there again in a heartbeat 
293616,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Staff were not informative needed to ask for information as it was not freely given On arrival had to ask about our rooms and where they were not told about the gym and lovely roof top area also no one to greet us at breakfast and show us where to sit , Location and the hotel tour guide was excellent
293617,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, Great location good value for money in the heart of Barcelona Quiet clean comfortable room Staff terrific After long flight provided us with room ahead of usual check in Stayed here previously Highly recommended 
293618,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The price of the hotel is quite expensive The room size is great though This has been the dearest accommodation in all of our stays in Europe , the location of the hotel was excellent right on the heart of the gothic quarter and markets Everything is within walking distance Laneways exit the market square in different directions leading to new adventures 
293619,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Nothing really Everything was great , Friendly staff Excellent breakfast Quiet surroundings yet very centrally situated Lovely pool with sundeck on the roof This was our third visit to this hotel We will be back for sure More than excellent value for money Highly recommendable 
293620,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Room temperature was too hot even with lowest setting Needed better air con Swimming pool was freezing cold and barely usable But overall an excellent hotel , Location was excellent Staff were accessible friendly supportive and knowledgeable Hotel was moden clean well equipped Restuarant used for breakfasts which provided a good range of food all good quality Interconnecting room were spacious and with the private lobby created a quiet and secure environment for the family Have already recommended the hotel to others 
293621,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Breakfasts should have available earlier than 7 30 when it was very crowded More staff at breakfast would have been better , Excellent location good breakfasts immaculate room 
293622,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Everything was perfect We didn t have breakfast at the hotel too expensive but it s a very nice cafe just next door, Location is perfect The rooms are big Staff is very friendly The pool area is nice Our teen daughters got a free upgrade to the suite on the 5th floor They were very happy 
293623,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Our room was pleasant but was rather cold and the air conditioning did not seem to make any difference , Excellent situation Breakfast was adequate Everything was clean Pleasant rooftop pool and seating 
293624,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Incentives to visit particular facilities would have been nice Not anything large but perhaps 5 10 off as promos to visit , Particularly liked the staff co operation They did go out of their way to satisfy our requests 
293625,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Free water in the room would have been nice , Very friendly staff who were always happy to helpwith any queries we had Would definitely stay there again Room was always clean and relaxing And an amazing ice cream ship next door called The Chocolate Box 
293626,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Pool way too cold Would be much nicer with a little heating unbearable Reception very confused with the fact we paid prior to stay which mean they tried to charge us twice and I had to produce bank statements to prove I paid even though I had confirmation of payment from Booking com , Pool area was absolutely brilliant but pool way too cold for April even though 22 degrees Rooms were lovely and a really generous size Location right next to cathedral but a little difficult to find and ended up walking around for ages potentially need signs to help guests 
293627,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, Staff were all really lovely and so helpful The reservation staff provided restaurant information and booked restaurant in advance for our party The reception staff were friendly welcoming and professional Rooms were very quiet and clean beds were comfortable and lovely to see coffee making facilities in a city hotel 
293628,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, Such a unique boutique hotel in Barcelona Room and bed was so comfortable and extremely clean The location was truly amazing in the heart of it all but away from the craziness of Las Ramblas Highly recommend this hotel 
293629,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Streetlight flooded the room at night because there are no blackout curtains The bath water is a preset temperature which is too cool to stay in the bath longer than five minutes , Friendly staff Clean well appointed rooms Great views 
293630,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, While the breakfast buffet menu was delicious the coffee was not sometimes arriving lukewarm at the table , Fantastic location near the Cathedral Nicely furnished rooms with very comfortable beds clean and modern bathrooms Metro was quick and cheap to get around although usually crowded So many sights to see would love to come again 
293631,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Nothing, Comfy beds asked for quiet room as travelling with young daughter so was at back of hotel Therefore no view but as the hotel was in such a great location that didn t matter Breakfast pastry basket etc lovely but didn t need the cooked element so perhaps a different rate for continental would be useful Would definitely stay again
293632,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, We really enjoyed our stay in this excellent hotel in a great location The bed was very comfortable which made for a relaxing stay Should also note that the staff were very nice 
293633,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Nothing, It s in the heart of the city and is the Perfect location for exploring the back alleys of Barcelona Perfect for aerobus Great restaurants nearby A straight line through the back alleys leads to Milk the best breakfast place we ve ever found It s the sort of hotel you will just sleep in and go elsewhere for everything else which is why you are in Barcelona anyway
293634,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, the room size was smaller than I expected from pictures shown on website I took airport shuttle and got off at the last stop which is nearby the hotel But to get to the hotel from the stop you may need to walk narrow and dark street I recommend you to take taxi if you are arriving at night and staying this hotel for first time , Friendly staff 
293635,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The room was very warm when we first checked in , The staff was extremely helpful and friendly including the front desk and the servers during breakfast The room we stayed in was very clean modern and spacious 
293636,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, No restaurant in the evening I would have liked a bit more comfort in the public areas, Brilliant location for a city break holiday right in the centre of the old city Clean comfortable rooms friendly staff good breakfast Plenty of restaurants near by 
293637,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, We didn t eat breakfast at the hotel as it was cheaper to go to a local caf , the location is excellent and the staff were extremely helpful is easy to take a bus from nearby catalunya square to almost anywhere in the city and its cheap 2 15 euros each 
293638,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Could have been more breakfast or menu options , The room was spotless and modern The bathroom was spacious modern like new The bed was super comfortable with new linens etc Front desk staff were available 24 7 professional courteous extremely friendly and helpful Made you feel welcome Very fair pricing for quality of hotel
293639,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The rooms were extremely warm as the hotel could not turn on the AC until the winter season is officially over and that s when the central heating system will be switched to AC So we had to resort to the windows cracked open at night which meant we had to listen to the street noises until 3am But the worst part was the incompetence of the Receptionists specifically Manuel who were not prepared at all to help with check out on the day of the marathon We happened to notice a discrete sign at the front desk and in the elevator that they put up the day before saying that all roads will be closed Very helpful when it came to us a family of 3 one being an elderly person of 70 and a child of 9 and four suitcases Finally after arguing with them all afternoon at 8 00pm the restaurant manager offered to help us with the suitcases the next day so we could walk for a half hour around the marathon streets to get to our airport transportation We had been at the hotel for a whole week and they did not think once to tell us to prepare for this day even though they knew that my 70 year old mother is with us an email I sent to them before checking in and that we were checking out on marathon day a yearly event which they have a whole year to plan for Disappointing ending to a delightful vacation , The breakfast was very generous The waitresses and restaurant manager extremely nice The location is perfect and everything you need is within walking distance Beds are confortable and clean Wifi available everywhere in hotel 
293640,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Our stay was great but had a little issue with the temperature of the room We stayed on the hotel in early March with the high temps around 65 F 17 C but when we initially walked into our room it was about 85 F 29 C We turned off the heat but we still had to keep our window open the entire 3 day stay so it was a little noisy at night The hotel is in a busy area with lots of noise in the street sidewalk but not sure if it would have been noisy with the window shut , Very nice fairly inexpensive hotel in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona Great location to tour Barcelona as long as you don t mind walking a few blocks to get to the Metro or to see the many sites that we consider to be within walking distance There are many restaurants and stores within walking distance The hotel is just a few steps from the Barcelona Cathedral and a few blocks from Las Ramblas The room was not big but not too small with a nice size bathroom Staff was pleasant and very helpful We requested an early check in and we were pleasantly surprised when we were able to get into our room before 11 00 am 
293641,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Room was good but could have been sound proofed more as you could hear the neighbours Toilet tank moved and banged against the wall every time toilet used I have never stayed in a hotel where only 1 teabag 1 coffee sachet left for each guest and 1 milk which contained a teaspoon of milk which is why I need at least 3 per cup One day we were left without any The air con only blew out warm air on the lowest setting so it was left off as I found the room warm I would not be able to use this hotel in the summer as I would bake A few alterations could make your stay much more enjoyable and it s all achievable Brother was pick pocketed on our first night but luckily ran him down and got his wallet back Amazing as he has bad knees must have been the adrenaline This happened directly outside hotel when getting in to a taxi Unfortunately Hotel not that interested when notified that this happened on their door step which was a bit disappointing Beware they are everywhere and you can actually spot a lot of them , Location superb staff were very nice and helpful rooms had minor issues but not enough to stop me going back Free wifi Fabulous chocolate box next door for coffee and croissant fresh orange smoothies baguettes cakes ice creams etc and very reasonably priced Pay to see the Cathedral as you see a lot more than on the free visit Amazing city wonderful places to visit Use the Hotels free guided tour if you can as the gentleman works in the Hotel and is very knowledgeable Well worth a tip Pool upstairs looks good and must be lovely in the summer to swim and sit out sip vino and look across city A glass of wine in the hotel is very reasonable 
293642,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, Thank you During the whole stay we understood how lucky happy we were choosing exactly this hotel Location and room were perfect A special thank to the people in reception to Mr Georgy especially who were so caring attentive and helpful 11 points 
293643,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Did not like the smell in the lobby Carpeting and rug in lobby needs to be replaced Need more help at the bar , Bed was comfortable Room was clean The guy on the desk Tuesday morning March 7 went the extra mile to help me with boarding passes So very nice Location was great 
293644,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, Location was so good close to every place that you would like to see in downtown 10 minute walking to the beaches 5 minute to La Rambla and shopping areas The room was convenient Minibar prices was fine Eco friendly hotel Chocolate Box next to hotel has great croissants dont buy breakfast from the hotel 
293645,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, the dirtiest hotel in the world in the room dust was on everything layer one centimeter in the bathroom is dirty glass and mirrors hairs squeamish to be there I only had to sleep during the day after the plane and again in the evening to fly if I had to stay I would have changed hotel , location
293646,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Breakfast is pricey at that room price would be nice if it were included , Room size and layout was fantastic as was view Very clean comfortable sleek modern room 
293647,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Slippers cost extra charge Room at the rate of 195 night didn t even included breakfast Minibar items in the refrigerator were not clean , Good location the bed was great 
293648,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, We had a small issue with our room being way too hot and we found it difficult to manoeuvre the window to get some fresh air into the room It was eventually addressed and it was pretty noisy with the window open but it s the price you pay for being in the middle of a vibrant city I had some other minor issues but all were discussed and addressed to my satisfaction , The location of this hotel is brilliant In the heart of the Gothic Quarter opposite the Barcelona Cathedral makes this a great option to explore this amazing city Our room was comfortable and reasonably spacious and included nice toiletries We requested twin beds I was travelling with my adult daughter this wasn t a problem and they were very comfortable The breakfast was really good lots of choice and the most delicious pastries and doughnuts 
293649,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The safe in my room was tricky I had to have help which was provided immediately It worked for 2 days but then the safe lost the code I did the reset procedure and It seemed to be locked but opened when I turned the knob the opposite direction I could not depend on it so I just carried everything with me the last 2 days Also the taxi could not drive to the hotel in the busy afternoon when I arrived so I had to find it on my own after a long flight But on leaving at 3AM the taxi arrived at the door about 2 minutes after the call from the desk I had not yet signed my receipt , Great location around the corner from the big cathedral My room was small and modern adequate for all I needed Always cleaned well Breakfast was ample but with a rather high standard price you order from a menu huge basket of rolls with coffee and fruit bowl on each table I like a good breakfast so I ate there all mornings Many restaurants in the immediate area so lots of choice Something was going on in the plaza in front of the cathedral everyday street performances musicians road rally car show so plenty to watch and do immediately near the hotel Easy walk to the starting point for tours I took Many shops to look at in immediate area 
293650,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, I wanted to watch the Australian Open tennis but could not because of the limited cable channels But that s usually the way it is in Spanish hotels , You control the HVAC It was a cold winter and the heating worked just fine Comfortable quiet room Well appointed bathroom nice hot water Also great location 
293651,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Traffic is restricted on the street in front of the hotel and not all taxi drivers understand they are allowed to pull up in front of the hotel Also while there were quite a few lights in the room it was still very difficult to see lots of shadows Finally there s very little counter room in the bathroom , The staff is very helpful and the location is excellent 
293652,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, We had two separate beds instead of one big one which wasn t that practical Sometimes we had a bit of a strange smell in the room , The location was absolutely perfect Really close to the old town as well as the beach The hotel is located in a small street so we didn t have any traffic noise The staff was very friendly and took in account our room preferences Nice little roof terrace with pool and pleasant gym Spacious bathroom great to have a bathtub Good coffee and tea facilities in the room which are refilled every day We enjoyed our stay and would come back 
293653,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, No air conditioning in our room and it got a little warm for us in February We had a rollaway bed brought in for our daughter which made the room very tight to get around but it was fine because we were only there at night to sleep , Location was great to walk to the beach Las Ramblas and all kinds of restaurants Close to shopping and would recommend packing an empty piece of luggage to take advantage of the great clothing and shoe stores everywhere 
293654,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, We had a wonderful stay in Barcelona The hotel was located very close to almost everything restaurants shopping transportation etc and yet away from the crowd Barcelona Catedral where mass is celebrated daily and almost every hour is also just a few minutes walk away The hotel staff were also very courteous and accommodating

293660,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Myself any my husband felt sorry for the waiter at breakfast every morning He was rushed off his feet looking after a number of guests alone There was a manger there but did not help once at taking an order for the duration of our breakfast Room was comfortable but noisy Lots of shouting in the corridor The guy at reception on check out did not even ask how was our stay Just printed bill and said goodbye No interaction whatsoever Paying over 500 in January for a couple of nights is expensive and a little more customer service would have been nice , Locoation was good bed was comfortable everywhere was clean 
293661,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The shelves in the closet were moldy and occasionally one of the windows did not close properly Nora Jones was on repeat on the terrace The old Barcelona smell got in from time to time , The room was beautiful and very well organized The location was astounding walking distance to everywhere and if not the next metro station was just around the corner and a line of taxis across the square The staff was very helpful and spoke fluent English One of the best Wi Fi s I have ever used in a hotel Good heating would have been good to have cooling as well though 
293662,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Sound insulation between room and bathroom not good and could also hear some noise from adjacent room Couldn t get the air con to blow out anything other than hot air although it wasn t particularly hot during our stay so opening the window was fine , Stayed in a double room on the 3rd floor Staff very friendly and helpful Allowed us to check in approx 4 hours early Bed was huge super king and comfortable Room clean and a good size Didn t go on free walking tour offered by hotel had other plans but great additional feature which would definitely look to do if staying again Hotel in great location near sights restaurants and only 5 7 minutes walk from metro station and Placa de Catalunya where the aerobus to El Prat airport stops WIFI was free and worked well 
293663,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Absolutely nothing , The bed was massive and comfortable Hotel located near all restaurants bars shops etc but the hotel was very peacefull and quiet so the best of both worlds Staff at hotel were excellent helpfull and very friendly would recomend to anyone 
293664,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, I wish I could have stayed for longer , My twin sister and I stayed for a birthday treat We were greeted with champagne and a hearty Happy Birthday The room was clean and well equipped with warm comfortable beds and plenty of choice for breakfast A fantastic location for a weekend of sight seeing on foot The hotel even provided a free walking tour of the local area which was both interesting and informative 
293665,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Restaurant has very little atmosphere Main Course was fine , The Hotel s location The Hotel in general and the staff were friendly and helpful We would definitely book again thank you 
293666,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, Very comfortable great location and good value We were traveling as a family and had rooms with a connecting door that made it easy to keep in touch while still giving us space 
293667,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Nothing , This hotel is in an excellent location in the Gothic quarter next door to a gelato spot and across from the Cathedral and a very cool architecture design store Excellent breakfasts included good value for money overall 
293668,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, I don t have any complaints Maybe that there wasn t many English channels on the tv but that didn t really matter cause we didn t watch much tv Or that most cabs won t drop off at hotel they ask if they can drop you off in front of the cathedral but that didn t really matter to us but it s only a 2 min walk No biggie , The hotel is located in a perfect location and the neighborhood felt safe It s about a 15 min walk to Plaza Catalunya where the A1 Aero Bus drops off and picks up if you re flt is at the International Terminal When we left the hotel to the airport at 5 30am it was still dark but felt safe walking to the Plaza cause the street was well lit and many locals were walking to work The hotel staff were very friendly and a room was ready when we checked in at 9am so we were allowed to check in early Hotel felt secure and it s in front of the Barcelona Cathedral in the Gothic District The room was clean too There s also a few restaurants that are open late around the hotel and about a 2 blocks away we found a little market that was open late if you need water late at night It s so centrally located that it s easy to go sight seeing and come back to the hotel and rest very quick and then go back out If you need a cab it s best to get them at the main street Ave Laietana next to the cathedral Many cabs don t like to drive into the neighborhood alleys or narrow cobblestone streets to get to the hotel Perfect Location and hospitality If you re going to the Park G ell from the mainstreet Ave Laietana the cab ride was 12 15 the 8 to Sagrada Familia Basilica 50 to the airport from hotel keep in mind that the rate also depends on traffic conditions We enjoyed our stay here 
293669,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Don t think anything could have been better Bed was super Bathroom was very well fitted and had lots of quality toiletries , The breakfast was amazing Choice was exceptional and varied Food was excellent 
293670,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The breakfast could be improved in terms of variety and quality of the products , Everything was very good friendly staff excellent location very cosy room great cleanliness nice pool on the rooftop 
293671,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Unfortunately our room was directly below the gym on the 4th floor so anyone running on the treadmill sounded like they were about to fall through the ceiling , Fantastic location lovely comfortable rooms and helpful staff
293672,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The A C was off and therefore the air in the room was stale dry and too warm The management told us the A C would be off during the winter months so we would have to open the window if we wanted fresh air The problem with that is the noisy neighborhood partying through the night also during weekdays mixed with the loud garbage collectors and traffic noise making it impossible to sleep with the window open , Nice to be in the Gothic quarter except when trying to sleep with the window open the partying goes on through the night and the garbage collectors working during the night are not very quiet We liked the lounge area in the lobby and the room decor was fine The bed was ok but nothing extraordinary 
293673,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Nothing, Location is excellent only 5min walk from placa Catalunya and easy access to all points Staff friendly Room spacious clean bed very comfortable Bathroom clean Didnt take breakfast so cant tell anything lots of cafes around where you can have breakfast or lunch I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone Thank you
293674,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The rooms need drawers to put clothes in It had good wardrobes mirrors and lights but nowhere to put your bits bobs And bedside cabinet is really low so awkward My wife s side of the bed had no cabinet but a piece of tree trunk trendy I m sure but not really functional Won t put me off though as we have already booked it again for next Christmas with Booking com, Location Breakfasts were really good and included in the rate Staff friendly and helpful Room was very quiet considering where it is The free guided tour was very informative and interesting 
293675,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, As soon as you leave the hotel you are at the centre of Placa Nova which is always very well lit and right across from the cathedral of Barcelona The beach is of walking distance and there are plenty of restaurants in the area Also plenty of metros in the vicinity which make it even easier to get around I don t believe I have any negatives about this hotel 
293676,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, sometimes a little noisy being central the city can be lively at night Less expensive breakfasts or meals in the hotel however plenty of choice in the area, great central location next the Cathedral and Christmas market square in the Gothic quarter and wonderful shops Very helpful and friendly staff Free bike hire for exploring the city Hot chocolate and churros from the little cafe next door
293677,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, everything about the hotel was wonderful The staff were so helpful The breakfast was amazing we ve never seen anything like it before so well presented and what a selection Ideally situated for sightseeing Would highly recommend 4 very satisfied travellers

293679,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Nothing, The location was perfect you can walk to a good deal of sites from there and there are subway stops nearby The room was spacious and clean and well appointed The bathroom was really nice The staff was all very friendly and helpful 
293680,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, 1 WiFi signal Was almost non existent in our room 412 I asked the guy at the reception to check it out but it didn t help From past visits to this hotel I can say it does work in other rooms I guess it depends on the room and its distance from the router but still I would expect to get full coverage when it says WiFi is available in all areas 2 Breakfast price is expensive , My 3rd visit to this hotel I guess it says it all but still 1 The best location 2 Friendly staff 3 Great rooms and relatively large we took the superior room though 4 Good value for your money 
293681,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Hotel was great but some issues with a couple of fellow guests on our floor who let their kids run riot in the corridor and we re smoking in their room which we smelt as soon as we opened our bedroom door, Location brilliant for the Xmas build up right next to the Christmas market Some great bars in the immediate area 
293682,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The view from the room is of the building opposite but that can t be helped as the hotel doesn t directly overlook the square I would definitely stay here again though , Perfect central location The hotel is opposite a large tourist information centre there is a lovely caf next door then the square which has the Christmas markets the Gaudi museum the cathedral and lots of very good restaurants La Ramblas is a minutes walk away The harbour and beach about 15 minutes walk The hotel room was a good size the bed is huge and comfortable There is a mini bar tea and coffee making facilities and safe The bathroom was modern with a floor length mirror door 
293683,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, The location was absolutely fantastic Within walking distance of Las Ramblas and the cathedral it s literally a stones throw away The hotel itself was also lovely Huge bed very comfortable and very good facilities overall We arrived at 10 40am and expected to have to wait til at least lunch time to check in but they checked us straight into our room so we could freshen up and get out to explore the city 
293684,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, On Arrival after a long trip we made a cup of tea When phoning for the wifi code we requested more tea bags we had just used our 2 allocated to the room A gentleman arrived from reception with 4 in his hand and advised that these would incur an additional charge and be added to the bill I told him that after paying 340 for the hotel room for 3 days you are going to charge me for a tea bag Needless to say out of principle I told him to forget it I would purchase some in a small mini market After 20 mins he returned and advised we could keep the tea but if we ask for more we would be charged Though it was the only negative as the hotel is perfectly located and comfortable it started the visit in this hotel on a bad footing , Location is incredible without doubt one of the most central locations to stay in Very comfortable bed Very nice hotel 
293685,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The breakfast service was a little disorganized Feels like they need some training as they were not equipped to handle the morning rush , Location is fantastic and the reception staff were super 
293686,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, One of the light bulbs were out in the bathroom and the hairdryer overheated when only used for a short time , The location of the hotel was fantastic with easy access to shopping and resturants The room was comfortable and stylish 
293687,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The bar closed at 2300 and on returning to hotel at 2240 the person on the bar refused to make a cocktail offering only beer or gin as an alternative , The rooms were a good size and clean the staff were friendly 
293688,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The lack of tea coffee and sugar was very disappointing There was NO choice of teas no decaffeinated option and only two small cartoons of milk each day We requested extra milk etc but this was not dealt with well We have travelled extensively and have never experienced this A small thing but this was the only issue that spoiled an otherwise enjoyable stay , Excellent large bed and very comfortable 
293689,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, Sadly didn t use any of the hotel facility s but they looked good it was the location we liked the best Be aware that just around the corner is the Catalonia Cathedral caught us out obviously a common mistake judging by the receptionists attitude to us when we tried to book in 
293690,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The room could do with more places for clothes You can t get everything on 6 coat hangers , Had the best sleep ever the beds were so comfortable The hotel was brilliantly central and the complimentary tour of the Gothic Quarter is a must do 
293691,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Room needs to be dusted Everyday I can c dust on the phone cups r still stained from coffee amienties r not replaced Everyday upon checked in my desk r filled with dust including the coffee cups n kettle, The mattress spring needs to be replaced A hard bed will be recommended for back problem 
293692,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, clean and modern room plush towels soft and comfortable bed with a dream induced softness of the pillows centrally located at barcelona cathedral during my stay it was the annual market of all market event were all restaurants wines cheeses and others converge for the weekend a must experience safe gothic quarter location
293693,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, no do not disturb signs in room to put on door handle , The receptionist Jordi was the most helpful member staff ive ever met at any hotel he went out of his way to make sure me and my girlfriend had a wonderful time in Barcelona The rooms were big and comfy and also the location was perfect We will definitely stay at this hotel again 
293694,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Room overlooked rear of buildings quite noisy late at night when people are in the outside drinks area , Comfy room pleasant environment in a perfect location
293695,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Nothing as far as we were concerned , Very helpful courteous efficient Staff Fabulous location Quiet room with good shower Would recommend this Hotel to anyone visiting this great city 
293696,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, We asked for a nice room as we told them in advance that we were getting engaged and while I couldn t fault the room it s self we were hoping for a room as shown on the website with the cathedral view but instead we were just looking out on a residential building A time flaw in an otherwise perfect stay , Excellent stay at this hotel Amazing location in the heart of the city centre 
293697,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, A little hard for a taxi to get here was a mix up on departure and had to go to the main street to get a taxi but two ladies we didn t knowwho couldn t walk that far may have had trouble we left there in front of the hotel , Location and breakfast fabulous Nice staff clean and well appointed rooms 
293698,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The WiFi connection was iffy sometimes good sometimes not But we found it to be that way throughout the city It did seem to be best in the lobby , The location in the lovely and historic Barri Gotic was wonderful It was very convenient and an easy walk to markets restaurants local transportation La Rambla and other sites There were lots of activities near the gorgeous Cathedral like street markets antique shows performers and musicians When we needed a rest the Hotel was serene comfortable and QUIET so we slept well Breakfast was amazing with so many choices and excellent coffee The staff were all very helpful kind and professional they couldn t have been nicer We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again YES 
293699,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, The breakfast although expensive 18 5 euros each was lovely Lots to choose from and eggs bacon etc cooked to order Staff were friendly Rooms were spacious cleaned daily sheets and towels changed too Bathroom was huge and shower gel shampoo conditioner replenished daily There s also a hairdryer in the bathroom The hotel is in a central position just around the corner from the cathedral We were able to walk to the port placa catalyna la ramblas etc in about 10 minutes There were loads of police everywhere we walked which made us feel safer but we made sure our belongings etc were kept nearby in case of pickpockets etc We went on the Wednesday evening walking tour and the guide was amusing and knowledgable We found lots of authentic tapas bars and lots of squares to sit and have a glass of cava The best part of the trip was a Segway tour which we arranged ourselves and the instructor David was superb We had such a laugh Would definitely come back to Barcelona and stay in this hotel again 
293700,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Loved everything , Breakfast was amazing in relation to quality and choice Staff were fantastic nothing too much trouble The free tour was really fun and informative Roof pool was stunning I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again and can only highly recommend the location staff and facilities Book it 
293701,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, For me there wasn t anything to dislike I was in my elimant staying here , Location for me was the best The room was modern and very comfortable The bed was the best I have ever slept in I would go back to Barcelona just so I could stay at the hotel again 
293702,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The rooftop pool was closed for the season which really is not the hotel s fault , Bed was very comfortable Slept very well I liked the location being next to Barcelona Cathedral and walking distance to Plaza Catalunya the Rambla shopping and dining places Liked the complimentary tour of the Gothic area 
293703,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, If only the outdoor rooftop swimming pool could have been heated for late October evening swimming, All the services were very good no complaints at all
293704,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, Hotel very quiet up a side street yet very central to main areas Rooms spotless and beds great size and very comfortable Staff very friendly and helpful with directions and helped recommend restaurants in the area Too cold for rooftop pool but a bonus to have in summer 
293705,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The lighting in the room is really terrible The room had a large window 2 of them but it was not enough light There should be more light available on the desk and also at the bedside one side really had only a small light , The room comforts were fine
293706,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, Location excellent for walking to see various sites of interest Breakfast delicious Wednesday night complimentary walking tour very interesting A lot of activity in the nearby plaza Modern hotel with large rooms and bathrooms Will stay here again 
293707,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Taxi maneuvers could be a little difficult because of the location along with road closures and other city events The desk will call a cab however on a day when cabs were not so plentiful we waited over 20 minutes for the cab to come with no luck The desk staff suggested to go out to a nearby street where there was a cab stand We re well traveled and live in cities were you hail cabs so we did that and had cab in just a minute or two on a very busy day There was another couple that couldn t walk that far so that wouldn t have been good for them , The location was perfect the breakfast and staff there were excellent the front desk staff was also excellent helpful and friendly I would recommend a refurbishment of the white couch in the lobby and a better straightening of the pillows and furniture there It would be so much nicer if more attention was paid to that and when you arrived the lobby was in perfect shape as a first impression And please put a soap dish in the bathroom Otherwise everything else was great We stayed one night at the start of a cruise and three nights after and each stay was great Would absolutely stay here again 
293708,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Bathroom not as clean as I d expect for a 4 star hotel Only enough milk for one person to have one coffee Only one coffee sachet per person , Very comfortable huge bed Brilliant location 
293709,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Just a few minor things the room was a little expensive but you pay for the location The bed was a little uncomfortable if you sat back against the pillows the mattress slid down the pillows were a bit soft and not supportive just my preference though There was no extractor fan in the bathroom so it got very steamed up , Great location Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable Room was very clean 
293710,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The restaurant here is closed on weekends but there are dozens of restaurants within a 10 minute walk so it wasn t an issue for us , This place was a surprise we expected it to be good and it was actually great There is no view here as there is at the Colon Hotel literally around the corner and which costs over 50 EU per night more and at which we also stayed at the end of our trip BUT the reception was warm and welcoming and friendly They even provided us with a certificate for a free celebratory cocktail as our trip was celebrating an occasion The bed was very comfortable firm and the room had all the amenities one needs including working air conditioning The best part of this hotel is the free one hour walking tour of the Gothic Quarter provided by Olga an academic at the University Sundays and Wednesdays are her tours She knew so much about this history of the gothic quarter and had a wonderful and fascinating narrative prepared during the walking tour It was a highlight of our week and a half in this wonderful city I never got to the rooftop pool terrace so I can t comment on it There is a Thai restaurant across the street which we did not go to but the interior d cor looked beautiful but just a couple houses back from the Thai restaurant was a wonderful extremely casual tapas place There were many Spaniards there It wasn t elegant but the food was great and the rioja was fabulous and only 2 EU per glass This place felt authentic We went for a quick supper late at night two times but it isn t necessarily the place for an elegant meal 
293711,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Shower didn t work properly didn t get fixed Staff did not advise of the facilities available to us I E Swimming pool not sure that Catedral is best value for money, Great location loved the night guided tour Room was quiet and clean Not flashy but comfortable 
293712,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Facilities in room were fine but really more like an adequate 3 star than a posh 4 star i e expensive for what it is but then Barcelona accomodation generally is expensive and location could not have been better , Excellent breakfast and lovely staff Location is amazing a couple of minutes walk from cathedral Nice rooftop pool
293713,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Hard floors in room are uncomfortable in bare feet and next to bed I dropped my water glass at night which broke into many pieces Street outside window a bit noisy but it s a trade off with that great central location , Great location Staff very friendly breakfast delicious and diverse and enjoyed nighttime guided tour of old city 
293714,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Prefer not to have to step into bath for shower but it was fine , We loved the location and the complimentary tour of the Gothic Quarter We loved the room which was well designed and quiet and the breakfast was really special 
293715,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Prices in the hotel bar were more expensive than the mini bar , Excellent location clean room comfy bed chilled in the sun by the pool prices from the minibar were not much different to local bars
293716,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The internet went down while I was there for the best part of a day not the hotel s fault but it affected the hotel s payment system too so checking out was a bit of a pain Not sure whether this is regular occurrence or not Ignore any taxi driver that tells you he has to drop you off on the main street and that you will have to lug your own suitcase for five minutes across the pedestrian area in front of the cathedral The hotel is on a side street but it is accessible by car I think my driver was just feeling lazy that day The pigeons enjoying the pool were a bit off putting Plus it was too cold to swim in already in early September All rooms are non smoking but there was a large and obvious cigarette burn on the comfy chair in my room This is all minor stuff and not necessarily within the hotel s control however I think it s a fabulous hotel , Superb location best I have had in Barcelona by far Step out of the hotel and so many of the famous sights are right on your doorstep Rooms are modern comfortable and tasteful Terrific bathrooms Great roof terrace and the pool is very cool Lovely young staff and a fabulous breakfast although initially confusing partial buffet and partial a la carte I believe the hotel has bicycles for guest use too I would definitely come back Oh and the gelato place nice door is lovely too 
293717,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, Stepping outside front doors and you were overwhelmed by the beautiful square and cathedral Location was excellen small shops abound A walk tour organised by hotel was a definite plus 
293718,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Toiletries were not replaced regularly especially the tiny soap bar Coffee tea as well we re not refreshed daily, Bed was very comfortable appreciated the down pillows 
293719,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Breakfast and evening meals very expensive and as a result restaurant empty other than at lunch time which affected the atmosphere of hotel It would have been nice to have dined there , Very comfortable bed quiet Clean Lovely roof top pool to relax in after walking around the city Fantastic central location
293720,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The area outside the hotel seems to be a popular gathering point for socializing and partying If you are a light sleeper ask for a quiet room , The location is a big asset since it s within easy walking distance of the wonderful cathedral and the quaint shops and outstanding restaurants in the old city It is not close to the beach but had a pleasant rooftop pool with lounge chairs and an exercise room The staff spoke good English and went out of their way to be helpful Getting taxis was easy The room we stayed in had the shower in a bathtub This is an issue for some people with leg issues Stepping in can be tricky Ask if this is an issue they might have rooms with handicapped access The full breakfast is rather pricey at 18 euros per person but it s huge and the quality is very good The menu included cooked selections which were excellent If you are a big breakfast eater it s a great option We would definitely stay there again 
293721,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, We liked the Staff they were helpful and pleasant the breakfast was fantastic The location was great walking distance to Las Ramblas We enjoyed our stay and will come back 
293722,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Breakfast should start at 7 00 AM and I prefer a buffet rather than ordering off the menu We would have liked to had breakfast at the hotel on the day of departure but we had to leave by 8 00 and the 7 30 start didn t allow time since we had to order the food , Front desk staff very helpful Spacious rooms 
293723,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Breakfast didn t start until 7 30 Later some mornings Not ideal for a business traveler needing to get across town for early meetings Yes they do occur in Spain , I have stayed in many hotels and for a hotel in its class this one was hard to beat Great location Modern and spotless Comfortable bed A window that opens Large bathroom with everything you need Great free Wifi iPOD docking station in the room Lots of power points for charging electronics 
293724,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, location of the hotel was perfect for our short stay the staff were very helpful and courteous accommodation was clean and comfortable we would use this hotel again if we return to Barcelona
293725,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Poor information in rooms on how things work tv channels restaurant hours and similar, First rate hotel and superbly well placed Room well equipped and very quiet considering the location 
293726,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, Perfect location very friendly staff and great breakfast Worth staying longer for From the hotel it takes a few minutes only to have a great choice of cafes tapas bars and restaurants And the same to shop until you drop 
293727,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Staff wasn t overly helpful They should be more helpful In giving suggestions for food shopping sights etc Seemed inconvenienced Actually was recommended A place took a cab and place didn t open until midnight and it was only 10pm Poor information that cost 40 euros for nothing, Rooms were not ready even post check in time Actually think it was after 4 30 Bathroom had no counter space but was different in other rooms
293728,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Some taxi drivers don t know how to get into the immediate area the Hotel is located in and we were dropped off in the Square and had to walk 50metres to the Hotel This was not the Hotel s fault I must add , The room was very quiet the beds extremely comfortable and the bathroom was cleaned to a high standard and the location excellent and convenient to the Gothic Quarter The team of Pedro and Jordi were super friendly and looked after us very well during our stay They were happy to assist us with all our needs and went out of their way We celebrated our 25th Wedding Anniversary at the Hotel and this was acknowledged with a room Upgrade and a Welcome champagne drinks voucher at their bar As the hotel was fully booked on our check in Pedro did his best to get us into a room at 12pm instead of the standard check in time of 2pm after a long overnight flight from Singapore I highly recommend this Hotel to anyone after great value decent accommodation in a central location to the Gothic Quarter Barcelonetta and Las Ramblas in a quiet location providing a great night s rest 
293729,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Disappointed with housekeeping We stayed 3 nights and after the first consumables not replaced shampoo coffee etc which was very disappointing , Fabulous breakfast 
293730,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The tub was very slippery The gym lacked equipment and the equipment that was there wasn t working properly , The location was excellent The rooms were a decent size The bed was comfy The bathroom was great The front desk staff were very accommodating and helpful

293774,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, In a hotel of that category the shower shampoo stuff was abysmal The shampoo smelled like the cheapest stuff in a 60s barber shop there was NO repeat no if anyone could not believe that moisturiser in a city where the weather and the amount of crowds demand a shower about three times a day , Great location very comfi bed in the middle of the bustle of Barcelona and still relatively quiet

293827,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, My only disappointment was the fact that our hot water wasn t working probably and it took 4 full days to fix We had to show someone from the staff what we meant There was plenty of hot water going into the bath but only cold water would flow from the rain shower it was very weird They only offered us breakfast as compensation twice We had to keep complaining We found this a bit poor Otherwise the staff were helpful and knowledge , Fantastic position Comfortable bed 
293828,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, Staff was so very helpful and accommodating Rooms were very comfortable bathrooms excellent Would love to stay again It IS modern but SO very comfortable It is very close to the cathedral in the old city Two blocks about to La Rambla I enjoyed the location great for tourists Restaurants I recommend are The Four Cats traditional Catalon food and La Luna awesome tapas but the little restaurant around the corner and in front of the cathedral Ostruch I believe was also good We were there only for lunch

293838,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Wish they had restocked the little bottle of red wine in our room Other then that it was perfect , I picked this hotel for the location and price It was perfect and exactly as pictured which I love It has a small area to sit and have a drink before going out It s in busy part of town but is on small side street so it is quiet Great shops and restaurants all around and right around the corner from the beautiful Barcelona Catedral thus the name of the hotel Rooms were pretty clean and a nice size Staff was nice and helpful Had a cute outdoor area but was too cold to sit when we were there Has a little restaurant but we didn t eat there no reason but were just always out and about 
293839,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The hotel locks the main door sometime after midnight one night during our stay we returned late and it took a while for the door to be opened to let us in View from the room was pretty poor but it didn t spoil our stay The air conditioner didn t cool the air just recirculated it Breakfast was pricey at 18 per head so ate out and got good value at local caf s , Room was clean and comfortable with good facilities coffee and tea making included We didn t hear our neighbours or noise from outside until we opened the window for cool air at night Free Wifi but it drop out occasionally Staff were friendly and polite

293841,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The close up view of the balconies of the apartments at the rear of the hotel detracted from the overall experience , Staff were extremely helpful and friendly 
293842,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Nothing, Breakfast is still too expensive as it is in most european hotels A less expensive alternative should be offerd for those of us who just need a coffee juice and toast or a croissand to start the day
293843,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Not enough space provided for clothing Noise from room above caused by chairs etc being moved around on the wooden floors early morning Restaurant closed at 5pm , The hotel is in a very good location almost opposite the Cathedral the square in front is a good place to people watch Bathrooms very good and plenty of hot water Safe for leaving personal possessions No noise from outside 
293844,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, A minor point was the heating The room was rather hot The open window though was the solution , The rooms were very nice as the staff We arrived rather late but still a warm welcome Although the hotel is in the centre It is a rather quiet area at night and no noise during night time
293845,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Maintenance staff does not speak English so you have to connect thru the reception which leads to some misunderstandings and delays but all ends well with much good will , The room is well equipped and the bed very comfortable We enjoyed the tea coffee set as well as the mini bar Bathroom is spacey but has no window Breakfast great Staff couldn t be more helpful You can walk by foot to all major attractions also from the airport bus in Catalunya square Swimming pool on the roof is a good size and is a great treat for the summer The hotel offers a free very interesting tour of the historic neighborhood on Wednesdays and Sundays 
293846,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, I am so let down by this hotel as having made a simple booking mistake booking 3 rooms instead of 2 they coldly unkindlly and with dreadful attitude made me pay for the 3 even though the night before they had told me they would simply cancel the third room I had booked this night as a surprise for my son it was the first time he was without his twin brother we were alone and I wanted to spoil him They did not need the room the hotel was not full so it was plain greed Never again will I return , Nothing 
293847,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Room was too hot at night as the air conditioning was not available which was disappointing It was not possible to sleep with the window open as it was too noisy outside , Great location very clean modern hotel 
293848,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, staying there longer , The staff were quite brilliant and the location is great Everybody was so very friendly and went out of their way to make our stay special 
293849,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The hotel was a little noisy at times during the night due to bin collections and street cleaning but this would affect any hotel in the city centre , Superb location right next to the Gothic Cathedral meaning everything from museums to restaurants was in easy walking distance Very comfortable room helpful staff and a free guided walk on the Wednesday evening which was excellent and informative 
293850,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Our shower was broken but they offered to give us another room, Wonderful breakfast Roof terrace with pool Garden terrace by the restaurant Incredibly good location 
293851,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Nothing, Absolutely excellent location near the cathedral The free Sunday morning walk around the old town was really great Our room and bathroom were large and excellently equipped

293853,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The maid was a bit tight with leaving milk for tea we had to ring down to reception everyday we were there , Location there was also a concert gong on all day and night right outside but once inside you couldn t hear no noise 
293854,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, No hand soap to wash your hands nowhere to put your gels under the shower nothing to clean the toilets no real privacy in the toilets as the sliding door remains a bit opened I feel the designer of the place forgot to stay there once , Brand new good design great location
293855,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Room minimally furnished w Akea furnishings and mediocre mattress Requested change room otherwise view of neighbor s laundry and very dark Got 5th floor next to pool terrace which was Big improvement Restaurant hours limited , Location
293856,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, Lovely hotel close to cathedral and Rambles Easy to get bus to beach and sight seeing buses Friendly staff modern rooms super king size bed Pretty roof top pool and gym sadly not warm enough to use in January I would highly recommend this hotel Didn t have breakfast thought it a little expensive but lots of cafes nearby 
293857,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Their restaurants opening hours 4 Capellans it seems like a lovely restaurant and the hotel staff tell me the food is lovely but it only opens 12 5pm each day which is incredibly odd With only a handful of restaurants nearby it makes perfect sense that some people in the hotel would want to eat in the hotel restaurant of an evening When they close the restaurant at 5pm it seems incredibly short sighted by the hotel I think they re missing out on a lot of evening business , The location of the hotel is great just a short walk will get you into the streets and down to Las Ramblas and the Port The hotel is just a stones throw from Barcelona Cathedral 
293858,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Cleaners were noisy in the morning lack of slippers as floor was cold I could hear the Muzak in the room that was being played in the restaurant until about 11 pm , Location
293859,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, It wasn t a bad experience but we thought that the hotel s stinginess over milk tea coffee sachets was poor When I asked if we could have milk from the cafe we were charged 2 for a glassful , Brilliant location so convenient for EVERYTHING 
293860,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Rooms are very average In room service costs extra not the best thing for any hotel View from the room is that of some not so good looking apartments , Staff is helpful and good Location is alright
293861,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, It says pool avaible through all year but went there in the last day and was very dirty but the rest was fine , Excellent location good size bed and room good bathroom toiletres Excellent front of house staff

293863,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Restaurant is also very good with delicious food but has very strange working hours 12 17pm are exactly the time span when we don t need the hotel s restaurant cause we are strolling out in the city Anyway there are a lot of restaurants nearby to get some good food at any time Sound proofing is not good We heard everything from the hall much too well People from adjacent rooms could be heard too if they got louder than usual , Absolutely fabulous location in the gothic centre of the city but still accessible by taxi Close to the cathedral main shopping and dining streets but on a quiet back street Very helpful and friendly staff speaking English very well Modern clean and nice hotel with a good room service 
293864,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Breakfast was too expensive for us as we only wanted a coffee and croissant Parking is also very expensive at 34 per day although the car park does provide a secure location We were in room 319 which was just above a motorbike parking zone and therefore very noisy in the early morning It was the Christmas period and the restaurant was closed and the bar staff were often difficult to locate , Location near to cathedral and gothic center Clean and modern Very friendly staff members 
293865,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, lack of seats to pause a little at the Picasso museum for us oldies , sagrada famiglia audiotour was very helpful and the building is spectacular and breath taking same goes for the Picasso museum almost too much to take in in one day splendid guitar concert by a wonderful musician in church of maria del pi
293866,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The only thing I would have liked was if the room had 2 comfortable chairs to sit in The room was very large there was room for 2 chairs The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean , The location was great 3 blocks from La Ramblas close to the port Lots of shops and restaurants nearby

293868,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, The staff was efficient and nice but not very warm we couldn t really count on the Reception Manager s promise to arrange a little something in our room while we were celebrating an important family event , Excellent location Central and still quiet we didn t hear any church bells in the morning Clean cosy and simple Very good breakfast 
293869,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Nothing to dislike, Hotel was clean staff friendly and facilities excellent Situated in a central position with access to all sights Would thoroughly recommend 
293870,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Water pressure in our bath was terrible took ages to pour a bath They ran out of white wine and did not have any brandy However I most certainly go back again, The location was great and the staff very friendly and helpful
293871,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Refuse collected every night in the early hours of the morning A few late night revellers heading home but the road outside is very quiet and virtually traffic free Lots of scooters parked on it but never actually heard any of them leave , If you are staying in Barcelona for a holiday then this is a great hotel Set in the heart of the Gothic Quarter which is a fascinating area with lots of bars and restaurants nearby Las Ramblas is a few minutes walk away Christmas market in the square in front of the cathedral which is a minute away 
293872,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Lacks a bit of character if that s something you re looking for , Location new clean room big comfortable bed very amicable and helpful staff

293880,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Poor spanish construction no sound insulation so we were disturbed by drunk clients 3 4 time a night , Very nice location Clean room but rather small
293881,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, We requested quiet room on upper level far from elevators Only the last part of our request was met Noise from street garbage trucks and cleaners and surrounding bars restaurants meant disturbed nights Hotel could also invest in quieter doors , Location excellent for seeing historic center Friendly staff 
293882,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Would have liked a bigger gym pool small but it was in the centre of the city A bit of noise from the street below in the early hours we were on the third floor , Very central could walk to the coast airport drop off 400 500metres

293887,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Uneven housekeeping The full size bed is actually 2 twins pushed together with separate bedding The room has poor lighting so you can see anything inside the closet which is very dark , Great location Clean modern hotel 
293888,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, inability to boil a 4 minute egg lol very noisy neighbours on one night not hotels fault , Great location just off of Placita de la Seu Cathedral and 5 mins walk from Las Ramblas The beach at Barceloneta is a 15 min walk The bed was huge and one of the most comfortable I have slept in Rooms were a good size and breakfast was fabulous 
293889,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Taxi driver dropped us off at a semi circle and pointed to somewhere where to find the hotel so at first a bit hard to find Once found easy to get to , Convenient to everything walkable 
293890,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, I was moving to another room and left something in my former room staff threw out my things without moving them to the new room , Super clean tidy rooms in a fabulous location 
293891,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, I felt it was expensive for what it is which whilst very good does lack that edge The extractor in the bathroom didn t work the rainshower shower head was loose the oversized light in front of the mirror in the bathroom completely obscured me when I was drying my hair Pointless addition Too few coat hangers no drawer space Having forgotten all about the small bottle of water my wife and I shared on arrival I was dissappointed that having paid out 1500 for the room the hotel saw fit to make a claim on my credit card for 2 00 seems petty , Location facilities and friendliness of staff 
293892,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, On the whole a very good experience only criticism would be price of breakfast if taken However next door is an excellent little cafe very modern and just a couple of euro for coffee and croissant , Having stayed in Barcelona previously I can confirm that Barcelona Catedral s location is excellent for shopping and sightseeing 5 min walk to Catalunya square and 2 mins from the Ramblas

293897,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, I didn t like coming back to the room at 2pm and finding it still being cleaned I would have expected it to have been cleaned by then Also when we were then asked by the cleaner to give her 5 minutes to which we consented she then complained in Spanish on the phone to whoever she was speaking that she now only had 5 minutes to clean the room , Great location and loved the room 
293898,Hotel Barcelona Catedral,No Negative, Beautiful hotel in Gothic district a 5 minute walk from La Rambla Outdoor dining drinks area so relaxing Well appointed rooms across from Barcelona s amazing Cathedral 
293899,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, We were in a room next to lift It said on website sound proof rooms but we could not sleep all night people were going up and down in the lift and talking outside of the lift could be heard perfectly This is not a sound proof room we could even hear them walking sleepless night in a 268euro per night bed Sorry but for all this money I expect better or I would chose a 100 euro room somewhere else Don t you think you would expect the same if it was your money Please fix this or lower your prices because to be honest you are over rated as a hotel , Breakfast was great
293900,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Noisy hallway in the mornings due to cleaning ladies Hair on newly placed bath towels , The location hotel s modern decor and spaciousness of the room bathroom 
293901,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Breakfast is overpriced but let s face it it s more or less the same price in other hotels I checked in that area , Great location friendly staff excellent room 514 5th floor excellent WiFi not obvious great value for money compared to other Downtown Barcelona hotels of the same level
293902,Hotel Barcelona Catedral, Strange restaurant hours but again really not an issue kind of forces you to experience the city which is great, The hotel is absolutely beautiful and spotless I would say the only drawback is the restaurant keeps strange hours even for spain but there are literally hu dress of dining options within a stone s throw The area is amazing ancient but clean and safe The staff remembered it was the beginning of our honeymoon and provided a free glass of cava to us both Great bed great shower lots of closet space there was a large party of Germans going nuts all night but I don t think they will still be there when you go We would stay here 1000 more times and regret nothing And yes the Cathedral is RIGHT THERE gorgeous Clean modern and accomodating Salud Hotel Barcelona Catedral Nos Gusta mucho
