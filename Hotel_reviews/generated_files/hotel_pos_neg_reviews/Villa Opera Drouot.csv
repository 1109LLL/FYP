90220,Villa Opera Drouot, Was happy with everything except having to unlock the fridge every time you wanted something One way to stop drinking too much I suppose , The decor felt so Parisian Friendly staff especially our breakfast waiter Great location supermarkets close by and restaurants Easy access to the Metro 
90221,Villa Opera Drouot, The location is near a busy street and suffers a substantial amount of vehicular noise as well as noise from people on the street at night However we were so tired the noise was noticeable but did not keep us up at night , This was the most spacious room we had on our two week trip in France Hotel has great front desk people great tea oil toiletries and provided the only hair conditioner we had on the trip 
90222,Villa Opera Drouot, Employee at reception took my Visa card aside to print it there is a definite risk that he registered the secret code at the backside Abnormal to the least to FRAUD INTENT ,No Positive
90223,Villa Opera Drouot, Decoration is a bit over the top to our taste and slightly dated but if you like an opera theme you will probably enjoy it , Great location Loads of bars restaurants clubs around Close to the metro stations The bed was super comfy They provided a free smart phone for guest use which was a bonus although we didn t use it Reception staff were all very helpful and kind 
90224,Villa Opera Drouot, The air conditioning couldn t cope with the extreme heatwave in Paris It was 36C outside and about 28C in our room The room was so cluttered with furniture there wasn t enough space for the luggage There were aggressive noisy drunks living on the street right by the hotel door , Extremely friendly and very helpful staff Great shopping restaurants bars and theatres all around and close to the metro 
90225,Villa Opera Drouot, Nothing, Everything The large room The clean white bedding The comfy bed The friendly staff The centre location near cafes bars and all site seeing attractions wonderful shower A beautiful Parisian hotel I ve stayed in Paris around 23 times and this is my favourite hotel 13 mins walk to the Opera bus You are right in the center of everything you wish to see loved it
90226,Villa Opera Drouot, The hotel obviously needs renovation many small things that do not work Air conditioner was not working for the first 2 nights then was fixed turned on centrally the safe in the room got stack every time after being locked for few hours we had to call the hotel personnel every morning to open the safe with the master key Especially annoying was their suggestions that we forgot the code while the safe was blinking green and the handle just wouldn t turn On one of the days the towels were not replaced on another day the cleaning came well after 15 00 we returned from the city for an afternoon nap and the room was not yet cleaned All in all sloppy , Very convenient location good room size very friendly and helpful reception personnel 
90227,Villa Opera Drouot, no Airconditioning in the room a fan making noise all the night the worst experience in my life breakfast Place underground food no good Very noisy my room on the road didnt sleep the night and in the morning at 5 00 AM Franc prix store start bringing his product with all noisy fortcliff it is less than 2 Stars hotel , nothing
90228,Villa Opera Drouot, The homeless folk living outside our window no air con just a small pedastal fan on 35 degree days was not enough it was very hot and stuffy , Good location friendly staff nice breakfast clean linen and towels daily
90229,Villa Opera Drouot, The lighting in the room could have been better as it was rather dark no air conditioner, The outdoor terrace was great large bathroom with lots of toiletries comfortable beds choice of pillows The staff were extremely helpful even with the language barrier
90230,Villa Opera Drouot, Nothing, As soon as I arrived the staff were extremely accommodating and helpful I asked for a quiet room and was given 601 which is on the highest floor on the corner of the hotel and I slept very well it was lovely and peaceful The breakfast was delicious and the location was great just a short walk to the Palais Garnier plenty of bars and shops around as this is just off the main road Particularly good Boulangerie just around the corner opposite costa coffee the best croissants and baguette I ve ever had Perfect little stay in Paris would love to come again
90231,Villa Opera Drouot, The shower door in the first room was not able to close properly and water got everywhere and when we asked them to come and look at it so we could explain what the problem was nobody would come up to the room Somebody did try and come to fix it but they didn t The second room we were in the sheets were dirty with something that looked like dried crusty stuff This was very gross , We could see the Eiffel Tower off in the distance in our first room The front desk people did a good job in helping us navigate the Metro and different locations that we had to go to 
90232,Villa Opera Drouot,No Negative, The hotel is full of charm and is situated in a great area to explore Paris Only 12 mins walk from Gare Du Nord and on the doorstep of Montmartre and the metro lines 
90233,Villa Opera Drouot, The breakfast was not worth 15 You could get better pastries for less at a local cafe , GREAT LOCATION Just two blocks to Metro and a short walk to Palais Garnier the Opera where you find many elegant posh stores The bonus is the hotel is just around the corner from Chartier one of the most popular and inexpensive restaurants in Paris 
90234,Villa Opera Drouot, Room was a little too dark , Super friendly staff the double room was spacious and comfortable I stayed for seven nights and it was lovely Several restaurants around and close to the subway

90236,Villa Opera Drouot, The room decor was a bit outdated but it was comfy enough , Ines at the front desk was so incredibly helpful The location couldn t have been better 
90237,Villa Opera Drouot, The cleaning staff walked into our room while we were in bed even though our do not disturb sign was on the door, The front desk staff were very friendly
90238,Villa Opera Drouot, Slightly dated furnitures The lighting in the room was very dark The bed is ok but the beddings duvet can be upgraded to more comfortable ones , Very friendly staff helping you with everything great location next to metro station and as well as Opera bus to airport Decent wifi connection Clean and comfy toilet shower room 
90239,Villa Opera Drouot, Room was not big being just about able to accommodate the bed I stayed at the weekend in winter and a number of the surrounding restaurants and not all were open , Comfortable room The hotel in convenient for the metro giving access to the city Good value for money The staff were friendly although I did not have a lot of interaction 
90240,Villa Opera Drouot, The room is a bit too small for the price , I liked how helpful the staff were especially Madame Ines Excellent The room was warm and had a lovely view The bathroom was good 
90241,Villa Opera Drouot, I enjoyed every aspect of the stay , The breakfast was good with plenty of delicious pastries The room was comfortable and the bed was really spacious It was despite being in the heart of Paris very quiet and well served with an excellent supermarket just across the road and dozens of nearby restaurants It was well placed for Gare de Nord and the Eurostar service 
90242,Villa Opera Drouot, Elevator could be better, Excellent staff very clean hotel super location certainly will be our choice again for our next visit Thank you very much 
90243,Villa Opera Drouot, Room typically small for Paris Impossible to read in bed due to low romantic lighting Decor was like a stage set for French farce Some street noise Overpriced full breakfast 15eu and poor coffee Better deal at bakers by Folies Bergere 2eu but it took 5 attempts for the baker to understand espresso and du pain, HIghly professional staff and helpful Room spotlessly clean and had a very good size bathroom Bed was a smalll double big enough for one person and very comfy Hotel very secure with 24hr reception
90244,Villa Opera Drouot, Due to winter time the heating with an electric chimney was classy but also drying the air too much , Great interieur helpful und friendly staff and located in a very nice neighbourhood 
90245,Villa Opera Drouot, Paper coffee cups in rooms wires all over the floor shower that spurts all over the bathroom floor lights that did not work noise from downstairs bars,No Positive
90246,Villa Opera Drouot, This is a really old hotel rather than a proper modern hotel Make sure you look at the pictures of the rooms before booking It is definitely not a modern 4 star hotel , The personal were very polite 
90247,Villa Opera Drouot,No Negative, The staff here were excellent the room was clean and for Paris very spacious Lots of cafes and little shops nearby Real Paris charm bethroom was nearly as big as the room with a bath tub 
90248,Villa Opera Drouot, , At last a hotel that hasn t tried to look modern It wears its old world red velvet heritage with pride and so it should What a fun place to stay in a corner of Paris just brimming with lively bistros and bars 
90249,Villa Opera Drouot, The wi fi signal in our room was almost non existent A few water stains on some of the lovely wallpaper slightly marred the room s elegance but that s just not picking The hotel s pretty good , Quirky art nouveau ambience good location decent breakfast friendly staff comfortable bed not too noisy considering the hotel is in a busy area We d certainly stay there again 
90250,Villa Opera Drouot, The elevator is quite slow which for us was not a problem because we liked taking the stairs For people with mobility problems who have to take the elevator this could be an inconvenience , The beds were very comfortable the room was amazing The triple windows filtered out street noise and yet could be opened when we wanted to look out and get fresh air We loved both the location and the size of this hotel as well as the service from everyone who works at Villa Opera Drouot Their friendliness and willingness to help us in any way possible was outstanding 
90251,Villa Opera Drouot, Nothing, The hotel is perfectly located great neighborhood and close to two main metro stations The room was enormous and beautifully decorated All amenities needed for more than a comfortable stay The staff was so kind and helpful with info about the city I would have loved to stay there a few more days Recommended for picky guests 
90252,Villa Opera Drouot, The safe wouldnt work even acter we had it reset by a member of staff but the hotel felt safe so it wasnt too much of a bother , It was lovely having a balcony and there was a sofa in the room which was a nice touch It was a brilliant location for cafes and restaurants in the area and had great recommendations from the helpful staff 
90253,Villa Opera Drouot, The shower could have been better fixed or connected to the wall rather than just the hand piece connected to the taps , The style of the hotel was great A little bit of la Belle poque Breakfast was excellent 
90254,Villa Opera Drouot, When having a shower the floor was flooded The shower separator in the tub was too small and we used all towels after each shower to dry the floor Shower hose was broken worked but needs to be replaced The water stopper in the sink went too deep and the water didnt want to disappear but taking it out did the job What I did not like at all was the bed covers wool covers two above one bed sheet Reminds me of mountain cabins and not 4 hotel bedding The bed cover had different stains This was the first what flew in the corner of the room One thing I did not understand The reception told me I got an upgrade on the room Dont know what it was since it was exactly what I had booked The call at 12 o clock The time is over was a bit rude but hey you pay what you get We ware late for check out 10 min or so , The hotel room was very nice The location was easy to find and next to public transport stops The staff was overall very professional From beginning to end very nice Got indications for transportation and what to see and visit We left our luggage there at the end of our trip without issues and could use the bathroom The fridge in the room did not work it was replaced immediately Aircon in the room did not work but the room was booked with fan which was also there so ok We did not make use of breakfast possibility There are masses of restaurants shops cafes brasserie etc around High Value location For the general high rents in Paris the price was ok even though it was the biggest amount for one stay per night I have paid till now in general 
90255,Villa Opera Drouot, little bit small but i know it is centre of city, location good staff very good attitude and service very quick response i order a room at 7 00pm and when i arrive in 8 00pm the paper and documents all prepared and waiting for me to checking in 
90256,Villa Opera Drouot, Rooms very small and narrow no any view from windows you have no space in the room to stand , We stayed in roof double storey room Eiffel view was great from the top window 
90257,Villa Opera Drouot, My room was warm and the air conditioner was not enough for the french summer 30 C , The localization is really good because you can use 3 metro lines and the staff is very helpful 
90258,Villa Opera Drouot, Air conditioning did not work in room Also rooms and hotel are dated and tired While accommodations were generally clean signs of wear and age are evident in rooms bathrooms and hotel facilities tired bedspread broken bathroom tiles discolored wall stains old tv stand etc Also no coffee service in room , Central location nearby to several metro lines and sites Nice neighborhood with lots of local restaurant choices Rooms were a good size 
90259,Villa Opera Drouot, Taxi from hotel to Airport cost 70 Driver explaned that it is so expensive because of reservation Normal price 50 55 I think that good transportation from hotel acts on hotel reputation, The best receptionist in the world 
90260,Villa Opera Drouot, Had no dislikes , Staff were excellent Provided us with great directions on using the public transport Very close to Metro stops and bus stops Lots of good restaurants nearby 
90261,Villa Opera Drouot, We stayed in Room 403 and asked that the safe be opened for us as it was locked shut We asked this on Wednesday evening on arrival Thursday morning and Thursday evening and again on Friday but safe was never opened so we had to carry all documents jewellery and money with us at all times in a backpack , The Staff were at all times excellent and most helpful
