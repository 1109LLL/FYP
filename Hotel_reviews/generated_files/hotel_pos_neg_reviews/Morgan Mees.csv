133257,Morgan Mees, The duplex nature of the layout meant that I had to walk down a spiral staircase every time I wanted the toilet during the night , Great location Lovely balcony Friendly staff 
133258,Morgan Mees, The bed was so uncomfortable and so were the pillows I loved the hotel but would not stay again because of the bed, The vibe and decor The whole atmosphere 
133259,Morgan Mees, Loved everything, The property was gorgeous and the room was beautiful with a balcony overlooking the front of the hotel I was there for three nights and everyone from the hotel that I interacted with was so friendly and helping Looking forward to returning 
133260,Morgan Mees, Although the location is good the immediate surroundings aren t as trendy as the hotel It s also a bit of a walk to main attractions No lift so quite a mission to get suitcases up and down the stairs , Very trendy beautiful boutique hotel with comfortable rooms and a great bar and restaurant 
133261,Morgan Mees, We left some kids toys in our room and my brother in law left sun glasses on the table and they wasn t returned the cleaner must of loved us not good for business , It s was lovely place 
133262,Morgan Mees,No Negative, The staff were cheerful smiling helpful Nothing was too much trouble for them The room was bright spacious the evening meal was excellent 
133263,Morgan Mees, Not much, Fleur was exceptional She ran the front of house of the great restaurant and also worked at reception She couldn t do enough for us The breakfast and coffee were excellent
133264,Morgan Mees, Staff were unhelpful and miserable Service in restaurant was surly Check out no earlier than 8am is ridiculous Breakfast no earlier than 8am is also ridiculous, Room was nice
133265,Morgan Mees, Two levels room design is problematic on my mind Total room s square is large but you don t have enough place on both levels because space is split by stairs , We liked location and atmosphere of this place Not far from city center but not a noisy street Close enough to public transport bus and tram stops Their restaurant is recommended for visit we enjoyed a dinner we took there Staff was friendly and helpful 
133266,Morgan Mees,No Negative, Situated in a quieter part of Amsterdam but still walking distance from main square and all tourist areas Staff were very friendly and accommodating Food was really nice both dinner and breakfast 
133267,Morgan Mees, The hotel is on a busy cross road and there is a lively bar downstairs The noise from the road and the bar went on until very late A late check out of two hours is charged 45 Euros a bit steep , The staff was great friendly and very helpful Nice quirky room on spilt level with lovely bathroom and comfy bed This is not your average hotel but something different and with a lot of character 
133268,Morgan Mees, We liked everything but would put a suggestion to have tea coffee facility and also robes and sleepers in rooms , It is a very beautiful and chic hotel with a great interior cool bar and delicious restaurant The staff was very helpful and friendly The hotel is situated in a great location between the touristic parts of the city center and the real part of every day life of locals We highly recommend Morgan Mees as a perfect place to stay while in Amsterdam 
133269,Morgan Mees, Note we had a stay of a week Steep stairs if you have heavy luggage as no lifts but manageable Power points are not positioned well and are located near the balcony door and are hard to access as they are behind stairs and a heater There are no power points in the bathroom for electrical items A mirror on the wall near the clothes cupboard would help as you need to use the power points near the balcony There is a small desk area under the stairs but no lighting Changing one of the lights outside the bathroom to a movable light would help or a lamp which could be plugged in at the power points , Able to walk to the city area in 20 30 minutes Public Transport and laundry close by Nice restaurant on site for a a la carte meal and always had a hot shower and friendly staff Studio room on two levels was okay but again narrow stairs to be aware of 
133270,Morgan Mees, The room was called a suite however it was actually small having a slightly separate area with a small settee in it does not make a room a suite It also had no tea coffee facilities no fridge only two small towels each a small wardrobe with little storage for a longer stay amongst other things Basically for the price you would have expected more which makes it over priced Whilst it is a nice hotel I would not stay again at the current prices they charge , I nice boutique hotel in the Jordaan Easy access to most places via Trams and short walks Its quiet in spite of the bar and restaurant downstairs Speaking of which the restaurant was nice for both lunch and breakfast didn t eat in the evening Also a nice comfy bed 
133271,Morgan Mees, The bed was a bit too soft for my liking And you could tell it was two single beds pushed together the bit in between was very uncomfortable , Beautiful big room across two split levels Great big window that looked out onto the street and canal Awesome little bar downstairs 
133272,Morgan Mees,No Negative, Booked this for my parents My mum is not great on Dutch stairs so asked for a room on the lower floors and Myrthe at the reception was super friendly and accommodating She was pained to see my parents giving up the beautiful room she had prepared for them but ultimately just genuinely cared about their comfort and well being The hotel decor and quality overall is excellent 
133273,Morgan Mees, Nothing , Amazing place great location excellent restaurants and bar Lovely room with big any comfortable bad and a balcony with beautiful view of the canal and the city 
133274,Morgan Mees, A little bit far from the real central of the city The traveling inside the city was a bit difficult to understand , Very nice and helpful personal Restaurant modern and stylish service fast and kind Food delicious 
133275,Morgan Mees, The steps to our room were pretty steep , The restaurant and bar were very good The breakfast was also excellent shame it wasn t included Hired hotel bikes which was good Location worked well for us a little out of the centre but easy walking distance 
133276,Morgan Mees, The street in front of the hotel is a bit busy Light sleepers might want to bring earplugs, Good location next to the trendy Jordaan neighbourhood Most sights are within walking distance Our room had a nice view and even a small balcony Everything was clean and we liked the bathroom products The hotel is nicely decorated and the restaurant and bar are popular among both locals and guests Food is tasty and prices are fair Free wifi in the hotel was a plus Would stay again 
133277,Morgan Mees, As there isn t 24hr reception coffee facilities in the room would have been nice , The staff were friendly helpful and efficient The food was very tasty The hotel was clean and tidy They gave you a map which included various favourites
133278,Morgan Mees, Could have had more amenities like bathrobes and toiletries , Nice large bed and good furniture Relatively quiet room for being on a busy street Good bar Friendly staff 
133279,Morgan Mees, It places in 20 30 minutes walks from the center and from the main routes of city transport, Great hotel with nice interior and polite personal Everything complies photos and description A lot of restaurants night clubs coffeeshops supermarkets around
133280,Morgan Mees, Taking the case and bag up and down the stairs Pity there was no mechanical lift to take it up and down for you Didn t mind going up and down the stairs without bags and case , The ambience and all the staff were just excellent They couldn t do enough for you I liked the dominance of young staff 
133281,Morgan Mees, Wifi was a bit patchy so Netflix on their smart TV was stop start but hey we weren t in town to watch TV so a minor issue, Our second stay here as regular visitors to the city we like to get out of the centre and explore areas the natives hold dear Jordaan is a gem for this Big rooms great bed we had a terrace too A great stay 
133282,Morgan Mees, No elevator However the receptionist was kind to carry my bags up the stairs to my room Would stay there again , Friendly staff Very welcoming and helpful
133283,Morgan Mees, Maybe just a bit noisy from the street outside at the weekend but the beds and the rooms are so comfortable you don t really care , Comfy and stylish rooms cool hotel with very nice and friendly stuff A must for us in Amsterdam we will definitely come back 
133284,Morgan Mees, the rooms are a bit overdesigned so not always practical but they DO try very hard to think about everything powerful hairdrier with long cord iron and ironing board good number of hangers etc lightning is a bit weak on a gray and miserable winterday , It s a nice spot of Amsterdam walking distance to Dam Leidseplain Vondelpark museums and PC trams close by as well Nice restaurants close by 
133285,Morgan Mees, The noise Room overlooked busy roads next to traffic lights very little sleep avoid room 7 , The decor and ambience was contemporary The bar was cool and yet cosy
133286,Morgan Mees, the suite was very cold even with the heating all the way up it would have been nice to get a blanket for the sofa we had to keep transferring our duvet between the bed and sofa , the building and suite its self is beautiful and the staff were very nice breakfast was amazing 
133287,Morgan Mees, First visit room was a little small I had to prepare for work and there was no much space to put my books and laptop second visit they let me choose my room wonderful Slight noise in the bathroom, Very good bed very gentle staff nice room 
133288,Morgan Mees, As with most old hotels in Amsterdam the staircase is very steep but staff very kindly insisted on helping us with our luggage , A stylish hotel in a nice location very friendly and helpful staff and very busy night life too 
133289,Morgan Mees,No Negative, Perhaps the best room I ve ever stayed in Amsterdam The corner room no 6 is amazing high ceilings and windows on both sides and feels like your own charming home in a great location in Amsterdam Bed mattress and linen provided an excellent sleep Above all the vibe and feeling I got from my stay was the best and that s probably because the property doesn t feel like a hotel The bar and restaurant downstairs looked super nice too 
133290,Morgan Mees, Nothing major I forgot even to mention them at checkout I tried to close the curtain but it seemed stuck at one point might need to be looked at Also our room was in the front and there was a small bit of noise from the cars and bar guests Nothing major but if you were a very light sleeper I d probably ask for a room in the back , The hotel is in a great location not only in Amsterdam but also in the fact that it s right on top of a great bar and restaurant It was really nice to be able to sit in the bar with a coffee or a glass of wine We had breakfast in the restaurant one morning it was really nice but if you prefer to get out and about there are so many cafes nearby We went to Mook Pancakes one morning about a 6 minute walk in the direction of the Museum Quarter and it was delicious The staff were all so friendly I didn t see a single person without a smile on their face The room itself was very clean They have everything you would need I don t believe they mentioned having an iron safe and hairdryer in the room but they do Beds were really comfy too One thing that was new to us we didn t mind it but other people might The room is split over two levels bathroom and living area on the bottom and bed in the loft The ceiling of the back of the bathroom above the shower opens up to the next floor through a window behind the bed I really liked the little touches in the hotel too especially the door handle text 
133291,Morgan Mees, Wifi wasn t the greatest , Gorgeous hotel in a really good location Loved our stay here The rooms are located over the bar and restaurant Rooms very quiet and comfy Style of the room bathroom are lovely and modern Great balcony in our room We ate in the restaurant one night food was very good 
133292,Morgan Mees, There was never anyone on reception and I felt like I was disturbing bar staff eveytime we needed something The window didn t open and it got very hot in the room There was a noisy party opposite the hotel on the first night which kept me awake but it was nice and quiet on the second night , Very comfy bed and nice shower Breakfast was delicious and the bar was a really nice place to have a drink when we arrived 
133293,Morgan Mees,No Negative, Although they don t have an elevator the staff was very kind to help me carrying really big and heavy luggages to upstairs The room was really amazing beautifully decorated and you can see river through the window 
133294,Morgan Mees, No elevator and staircase was steep Luckily staff was very accommodating and carried our bags up and down without complaint We got tired of dodging bike riders in Amsterdam but the hotel has no control over that , The rooms are decorated in a modern minimalist style Very comfortable bed The air conditioning worked well which was much appreciated as Amsterdam was experiencing a heat wave during our mid September stay The location just west of the Jordaan district was comfortable One morning we had breakfast at the hotel Simple menu but a good range of options Another day we walked down the street and bought croissants at a neighbor bakery plus smoked fish from a shop next door Ate breakfast on the bench just outside the shop Morgan Mees is more of a bar and restaurant with about 10 rooms upstairs Didn t bother us as once we closed the door to our room it was quiet and we didn t hear any noise Double paned windows also kept out street noise 
133295,Morgan Mees, Not near a train bus or tram station so if traveling with luggage you will have to catch a taxi approx 42 from airport Also please note that there were steep stairs in the room which was fine with us but not great if mobility was an issue , From the moment we arrived all the staff we deal with were outstanding friendly nothing was too much trouble It was our first trip to Amsterdam and once across the bridge easy to walk to most things within 1 2 hour Has excellent restaurant if a bit pricey Would stay here again 
133296,Morgan Mees, Everything was fine Just be aware that there are narrow stairs including to a a really nice loft in our room , Good location staff are very friendly and helpful their restaurant is very good and popular with the locals room was very nice as long as you can climb stairs 
133297,Morgan Mees, The walls and ceilings were very thin I heard footsteps in the room above and woke up by a conversation in the hallway , Staff was extremely spontaneous and friendly The hotel has a great atmosphere and is designed very well The lobby bar and restaurant are great spots to relax and are often visited by non guests 
133298,Morgan Mees, Tissues and extra bits in bathroom and tea making facilities in room , Lovely room and comfy bed Great staff and amazing bar and restaurant had wonderful food 
133299,Morgan Mees, Not applicable , Location of the hotel and the rooms are quite good The staff is friendly and so kind strongly suggest young couples to stay there and spend a good time in the heart of Amsterdam Do not forget to try to have a dinner or breakfast in the restaurant located in the entrance of the hotel Thank you for everything 
133300,Morgan Mees, There was nothing to dislike , Great hotel worth the extra 10min walk to the centre very comfy bed great shower Bar has a great atmosphere and the Morgan and Mees breakfast was great will definitely recommend and will visit again 
133301,Morgan Mees, Very expensive for a marginal location No comfortable common sitting lobby Limited guest services During our visit to Amsterdam we happened to find far better properties in more desirable neighborhoods for much less money , The mattress was very comfortable 
133302,Morgan Mees, ett, The staff were wonderful They had booked us a room on the top floor but the narrow steep steps made this an impossible situation for our aged bones and my aged hip They immediately offered us a room on the first floor which was much better and took our luggage up to the room and then back down when it came time to leave The food was also first rate 
133303,Morgan Mees, Shame not to have breakfast included in the price The TV was by the bed rather than in the lounge which seemed weird , The bed was very comfy and bar was excellent Brunch was good Great location Lovely design 
133304,Morgan Mees,No Negative, Amazing drinks amazing food amazing staff beautiful young and friendly There was a mistake with the booking and they offered to upgrade to the suite at the same cost of our superior double originally booked Wonderful quirky rooms the most comfortable bed ever 
133305,Morgan Mees, The air condition didn t work so we got to switch rooms the third night air condition didn t work in second room either but since it wasn t in etage as the first room it didn t bother us , Breakfast bar and overall design is brilliant The bathroom products are lovely but best of all was the sheets in the bed I want those sheets The Wifi was also awesome
133306,Morgan Mees, Breakfast choice limited from the menu but was healthy Even the banana pancakes seemed healthy Everything was freshly cooked and tasty Perhaps I just wanted to slob out buffet style on holiday I can t really believe I am putting this down as it is such a great hotel, Staff very friendly and helpful and motivated Very good hotel with excellent staff Convenient location Very nice bar definitely would recommend 
133307,Morgan Mees, There were no telephones in the rooms which made for a more peaceful stay but was slightly inconvenient at times as you couldn t call another room or receive calls from outside The stairs can be a bit steep and there is no elevator so if you have a large or heavy suitcase it is more challenging The staff is always happy to help though , The staff were delightful and very accommodating The building is gorgeous and each room has it s unique features The restaurant downstairs is fantastic and there s a great patio as well Location very convenient to public transportation restaurants and for walking around the city Lots of attention to detail with regards to the soaps towels lots of hangers in the closet and waters always available And breakfast was wonderful I would without hesitation recommend this hotel to others 
133308,Morgan Mees, Door into bedroom 3 rattled each time anyone entered or exited the glass door at the top of the stairs , Decor stunning location excellent staff outstanding food interesting delicious well presented Loved the cinnamon biscuits with coffee 
133309,Morgan Mees, Initial impression was that it was a very small room but we stayed 3 nights and it was very functional Stairs and big bags might be a problem for older people , The location and staff were amazing Very cool bar and amazing restaurant downstairs Felt like a local rather than a tourist
133310,Morgan Mees, The room I was given was noisy as it faced the road on the first floor I asked to change it but no availability of other rooms The heating was not working but in all fairness the room was warm enough and I didn t request assistance on this , Rooms were nicely decorated a cool bar and restaurant
133311,Morgan Mees,No Negative, Lovely room with balcony and mezzanine level bed so comfortable Plus the cafe bistro bar downstairs is great for chilling out in morning or evening
133312,Morgan Mees, The stairs going to the top floors carrying luggage up all the way can be tough for older ppl n less energetic ppl Room s amenities can be better like a kettle n slippers for winter will be good 1 kettle a room won t cost much to the owner I didn t take the slippers from the previous hotel was a regret , Is my 2 day in Amsterdam n I choose to come to this hotel for 1 nite due to the good reviews in booking com The room is excellent n the toiletries is what I like the most many heaters in different corners n toilet to be adjusted by yourself Nice n good size room Nice garden for breakfast breakfast is heavy n good price if you need a lot of energy for the day 
133313,Morgan Mees, The room had a bit of an odd layout with an opening from the bathroom to the bedroom area , Location was excellent and the whole check in check out process was very simple and fast The decor was on point and the room was comfy despite the weird layout The restaurant is really good and the bar seems pretty cool even though we didn t try it 
133314,Morgan Mees, We ve requested late check out few days before our stay and got an answer that hotel can t provide it for us The lady on reception offered to us an option to leave our luggage in hotel but we d preferred to take it with us because though that it s not that secure , Bed was super comfortable view from the balcony was really impressive and also I would like to highlight that soundproof was just amazing bar downstairs was really busy when we walked in but we couldn t hear any noise at all when we were in our bedroom 
133315,Morgan Mees, The only way up to the rooms in the hotel was via stairs They were very pretty but it was a bit difficult moving the suitcases up and down to the rooms , I loved the room it was such a creative design The room and facilities were very clean and in good condition The bed and couch were very comfortable and the television had various choices of languages I loved the shower because it had 2 shower heads one on a portable line to make the shower more enjoyable 
133316,Morgan Mees,No Negative, The location is good near enough to the attractions but yet you get to leave the noise behind when you return to M M The staff are all very efficient 
133317,Morgan Mees, It took me some time to work out how to get hot water in the shower but saying that by the second night I had sorted that out and it was divine , I loved the dining room and had a lovely meal there Decor and atmosphere was amazing full of locals great service The bar as well Friendly staff at the bar warm Smiles and welcoming manner My room was very well designed and decorated with small colourful touches I liked the wooden floor and the high ceilings It s a small and intimate hotel and definitely the type I like staying in especially on business I would highly recommend for a short stay in Amsterdam I am definitely coming back 
133318,Morgan Mees, Our room was next to the road and slightly noisy it didnt bother us but might some light sleepers , Lovely staff excellent breakfast and restaurant area and food Pretty good location 30min walk to central station or 5 10min via trams which are easy to get and regular
133319,Morgan Mees,No Negative, Really nice rooms although not suitable for people with mobility problems steps even in the room Nice restaurant very good food and wine correct price
133320,Morgan Mees, Can t complain about anything at all, We only stayed here one night as I had booked somewhere else a while ago and my flight was cancelled But honestly wish I had found this hotel first The staff were amazing they went above and beyond We stayed in the room with a separate floor for the bedroom and a living area The views where great over the canal it was hard leaving the room it was so amazing They knew how bad our trip was to get to Amsterdam so got our room ready fast and held out luggage for us We ate in the hotel restaurant just because it seemed silly to go anywhere else as it was packed and the food smelt good Considering my boyfriends a chef and hard to please he couldn t stop telling me about how great the food and kitchen was wish I had booked all our nights in Amsterdam here it was a great location I will 100 will come back and stay I m not one to leave reviews but this was worth it just to let other people know that you should stay here
133321,Morgan Mees, Located a bit far from city center, Stylish room with lovely bathroom and unbelievably soft bed Friendly staff nice restaurant with handsome waiters 
133322,Morgan Mees,No Negative, We loved our stay at Morgan Mees The modern decor and overall relaxed atmosphere amidst its rustic setting made us feel right at home The entire staff was friendly and accommodating and we can t wait to come back 
133323,Morgan Mees,No Negative, Staff were very friendly great neighborhood location clean only 9 rooms so makes it special Restaurant is great with wonderful atmosphere as well as tasty food 12 50 breakfast the best and can be shared Kudos to staff Fleur and all her colleagues Would go back in a minute 
133324,Morgan Mees, A little far out from the main tourist areas but we loved the walk along the canals into the hustle and bustle this suited us just fine , From the warm friendly welcome to the high standard of the hotel and room Morgan Mees made our Amsterdam experience even more special Room 6 was quirky and opulent and we loved it 
133325,Morgan Mees, Top floor with heart peoblems not great without lift Also steep stairs No business rates available For someone visiting Amsterdam every other week for a few days perhaps a suggestion ,No Positive
133326,Morgan Mees,No Negative, Loved the style of this hotel and restaurant Ate at the restaurant a few times and the food was excellent The room was super narrow and layout of the room was a bit awkward with the bed upstairs Was charming at first then got annoying having to go up and down but that s a minor complaint It s a great place to have dinner even if you don t stay there 
133327,Morgan Mees, A little far 10 15 min walk from downtown Amsterd , We loved the room very modern and cozy The hotel has a bar and restaurant that is very coil and full of young people 
133328,Morgan Mees, Our room was a bit strange very thin entrance and the bed on a loft Quite pricey for not even being a hotel more a restaurant with some rooms , Nice location right on the edge of rhe Jordaan Comfy beds Clean and fresh 
133329,Morgan Mees, Noise from the street during day time the somehow unpleasant smell in the room The reception lady are not necessary that genuine No tea or coffee machine available both in room and at the lobby, Chic interior Cool looking restaurant
133330,Morgan Mees, We paid for a deluxe room based on the pictures shown on booking com Annoyingly the pictures shown with the delux room don t relate to that room so we ended up with a room much smaller than we thought we were getting For anyone that s interested the pictures shown are mostly of the suites the normal and delux rooms are much smaller with no stairs in them The service in the bar restaurant can be quite slow The staff are nice they just seem to leave you for quite a long time without seeing what you d like , The design of the hotel is really great and it has a good feel to it The shower was excellent and the bed comfortable The food is nice in the hotel and the location in Jordaan means that you re away from the really touristy side of the city Staff were friendly and gave us a map on arrival which was helpful 
133331,Morgan Mees, since there is a restaurant downstairs there is noise of the kitchen until 3 am makes sleeping hard , helpful staff we are really appreciated to staff for their kind help and support rooms are really modern and everything was brand new 
133332,Morgan Mees, I had a room on the corner and it was pretty noisy The bed was very soft good for some but not for others I guess , Very cool hotel Good location on the edge of the canal ring Great restaurant and sweet bar downstairs The bathroom was gorgeous 
133333,Morgan Mees, We were in a loft room which was very hot and the airconditioner was not working initially It looked like it worked but no motor going , The quality of the fittings bed etc was great It had a great restaurant An easy walk to the centre of Amsterdam 
133334,Morgan Mees, The stairs are not very comfortable for those climbing up to the room with a large suitcase The facility has a restaraunt on the ground floor and quite a popular one which can be rather noisy when crowded , The location is good staff was extremely friendly and the room was spacious and clean Breakfast was also quite nice 
133335,Morgan Mees, We did not realize it during our booking but there actually isn t a 24 hour person at the reception This normally is not a problem for us but one of the other guests got locked out of the hotel one night That guest knocked on our door at 2am telling us that he had been locked out and needed help It completely startled us Also there was not a peep hole on the door to see who was there , We loved the location It is right on the edge of the center so it is less tourist ey but you are just moments from the action The courtyard was lovely and we enjoyed the meals that we ate in the hotel The bathroom was very clean and we loved the soaps Our room a deluxe double was spacious enough and had a good closet We loved the simple and clean decor of the hotel We would definitely stay here again 
133336,Morgan Mees, not constant receiptionist absence of the lift a bit aside from the city centre about 13 euro aside from Central Station , restaurant serves very tasty food fast ready full of local people bartenders are nice and comunicative good atmospere
133337,Morgan Mees, Steep stairs up to our room , Friendly and helpful staff in a great location Restaurant has very good food at a reasonable price
