282265,NH Collection Barcelona Podium,No Negative, Very helful staff The ballboy Rod really went the extra mile to make the stay more positive ran in to the Hotel to get us a map while the taxi was waiting and giving us helpful tips A nice balloon in our room welcoming my wife who had birthday 
282266,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, Nothing all good , Excellent location very close to metro cycle hire shops supermarkets cafes and restaurants Also easy walking distance to most sights and the sea front Lovely terrace and pool on the roof rooms spacious and comfortable with everything you might need Not cheap but well worth what we paid Breakfast expensive but plenty of places nearby 
282267,NH Collection Barcelona Podium,No Negative, Excellent location pulled away from the busy hustle of barca central Beautiful amenities and staff All the recomendations we were given for restaurants and times to visit touristic sites were spot on Truly enjoyable stay Love this city love this hotel Would recommend 
282268,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, Pool tiles in need of cleaning , Bonus that there were 3 pillows and the bed was very comfy Rooftop pool needs cleaning but otherwise a nice area and great cocktails Hotel very clean and staff friendly Good location quiet and away form the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas but within easy walking distance Did not opt for breakfast as pricy at 24 euros each Overall great little stay for our Minimoon 
282269,NH Collection Barcelona Podium,No Negative, Perfect location in El Born that is like Gamla Stan in Sweden in atmosphere Plenty of Tapas restaurants around and a 30 min walk distance to the beach The hotel is very nice with a rooftop pool with a lovely view over El Born We didn t try the hotel breakfast there s plenty of cheaper and perhaps better as in authentic alternatives on your way to the beach Picnic is one of them with the chose of the serrano ham scramble eggs and american pancakes for 9 are a strong contender to any breakfast Nice AC at a stable 19 degrees celsius The hotel is strongly recommended 
282270,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, There was a weird smell in the room and floor, It is near the Born an area I love with plenty of restaurants and stores The room was super comfy and it had two bathrooms Service was great 
282271,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, The customer service personnel could be more customer focused Once in the hotel I had to make a change to my reservation There was no language in the contract that clarified charges to the customer for checking out before the reserved date Although I tried to debate the matter with the person at the desk I had to call Booking com to resolve the matter , The hotel is near the city center and transportation is very accessible 
282272,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, Lack of a big resturant Only small meals in the bar , Problem wth water through the shower room ceiling at night Staff attendfed the next day and upgraded the room They were very helpful and understanding and gave us additional benefits 
282273,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, Hotel was a little off the beaten track so took a little while to get our bearings as rather than take taxi or public transport we like to walk a lot Hotel roof top bar was very nice but views of the city not the best Guys who work in the roof top bar were very professional and I know they work long hours but a smile wouldn t go a miss every now and again If your travelling for business its a very good hotel Sightseeing not so much and I don t think that I would stay here again even though I can t really fault the facilities Just tucked away from the action a little too much for us , We didn t take breakfast at the hotel as I much prefer to wander around the local area looking for cafe type locations used by the locals of which there are many Reception staff were very helpful and efficient Hotel was also very clean and tidy and rooms well equipped however if you like English Breakfast tea as a first drink of the day I recommend you take some tea bags with you Nice roof top bar with swimming pool and good gym facility Hand for the Metro also All in all pretty good
282274,NH Collection Barcelona Podium,No Negative, A centrally located hotel in a quiet neighborhood The service was friendly professional and efficient The room and bathroom were very clean The breakfast was wonderful serving many different types of regional delicacies with elegance and flair We loved our stay 
282275,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, Though it wasn t a problem for us the room is a split level so there are stairs 4 steps I think from the hall bathroom area and closet sitting area down to the bedroom area This could be difficult at night if someone needed to get to the bathroom in the dark Also we would have chosen to make the room cooler than the air conditioning allowed It wasn t bad but the option to lower the temperature below 21 5 C about 70 F would have been more comfortable for us One problem one evening we came in to our room and it had a bad sewer smell We called the front dest and they had someone take care of whatever was going on by the following morning It didn t happen again , Attractive clean and nice size room and loved the distance of the bathroom from the bedroom it was quiet when someone else showered and got ready in the morning so the other person could stay asleep Great room darkening curtains lots of bed pillows were great to choose from large and modern bathroom was great The staff were all wonderfully polite very friendly and exceptionally helpful they went out of their way to assist us in helping to locate and deliver lost luggage from the airport The hotel location is great a short walk to the metro part of a great neighborhood and a good starting point to walk to other areas of the city Oh and great rooftop pool lounge bar area 
282276,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, Nothing everything perfect , The Hotel is very clean and comfortable The staff in the recepcion are extremely nice quick check in and check out The breakfast is super and the staff in the breakfast area are very nice Would highly recommend this hotel 
282277,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, See above Restaurant menu could have had a few more options, Once given proper directions the day after our arrival we were able to walk to main city centre and hop on hop off restaurants great proximity etc but first night in the dark we did not find anything close we were given poor directions and walked down numerous desolate streets Nice pool lovely healthy and full breakfast Large hotel room and bath Very clean 
282278,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, At check in the woman asked question after question home address phone number email even tho we booked on line Breakfast is very expensive I walked to Quatre Gats in the Gothic area with its beautiful mosaic tiles and menu designed by Picasso and had a lovely light breakfast for 5 euros Suggest putting a simpler coffee maker in the room , Cleanliness Shower amenities were great Staff was generally excellent Location was very good 
282279,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, There was a strike of taxi and I had to take a metro to take train from Barcelona Sants that too in the rain They told me me the way by metro which was ok however the Barcelona North train station is at the same distance as the metro Both metro and the train station are at the same place The train goes straight and the metro needs a change to get to the train station The staff should have done the research to tell people the best way to go I had already bought the metro ticket that does not work for entry into the train station We did reach the train station It was tricky with my limited Spanish but I did manage ,No Positive
282280,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, There was noise from the street There is a small restaurant across the street and the people from there were making lots of noise every evening We asked to changed the room but they haven t had any free The room sound isolation was very poor and you could hear people from other rooms flushing toilets and cars passing by on the street , Amazing breakfast Room service is also good missed Sangria Great personnel 
282281,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, Steps in rooms are not very good Bar in reception lacked atmosphere they need to add sofas etc to make it more relaxing, Great location great hotel and great staff

282285,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, No English breakfast tea provided in the room but phoned reception and they were there in an instant with some Couldnt work the coffee machine at first but reception staff came to room to show me straight away He was very pleasant and helpful , Loved the welcome slippers and robes Loved the mat and turned down bed with the chocolate on the bed when returnING home after a long day of walking Perfect balcony view too Fabulous shower and plenty of cute toiletries in the bathroom 
282286,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, Some staff on front desk were a little abrupt a minor annoyance in an otherwise very pleasant stay , Hotel very smart but with a nice relaxed feel Breakfast buffet was delicious Rooms spacious comfortable and very clean well stocked with towels and toiletries Location is quieter and more upmarket than nearer the busy centre well connected for metro to get around and plenty of reasonably priced good restaurants and snack bars within 10 mins walk Close to the Gaudi buildings Rooftop bar pool and gym were a great use of extra space Friendly efficient staff in restaurants especially Kenny and good room service menu Overall a great choice for a city break exploring wonderful Barcelona 
282287,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, Location actually isnt bad at all it was a 15 minute walk to the main shopping areas and restaurants Although there is a good restaurant in the lobby tapas bar across the street and lined with small groceries along the way Taxis waiting as you step out on the hotel , Eveeryday the rooms were crisp clean white linens were starched and wrinkle free Our upgraded room with a Balcony had complete amenities including my favorite coffee maker from Nespresso with 3 capsules 1decaf everyday Free bottled water for coffee 3 liquid creamers to match sugar packets 2 coffee 2 expresso cups heating Pot for tea Chocolates every time the beds were turned over Rooms were very spacious including mirrored closets safety deposit box aundry bag 2 free towel slippers extra thick cotton white bathrobes elegant size plastic bottles of fresh scented vitamin rich shower gels nourishing vitamin rich shampoo hair conditioner body milk soothing moisturiser to keep your skin young and moisturized all day a tube of soft mask for Silky hair a small jar of Hand Cream moisture protection a small bar of round soap for washing your hands A refreshing bar with 2 choices of juice 2 complementary sweets fruit gelee at the front desk Front desk staff were very knowledgeable friendly helpful map handy list goes on and on 
282288,NH Collection Barcelona Podium,No Negative, They gave us an upgrade to a suite kind of multilevel room There was a balcony overlooking the main road but no noise Excellent guest relations manager Hugo took our Barcelona experience to another level Housekeeping staff was amazing too On our request they cleaned our room at 9 pm I the night Which hotel gives that kind of service 
282289,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, The breakfast should be way more varied and take into account that people fly in from all over the world For example add boiled eggs sausages burgers and perhaps some noodles to the menu , Location was awesome Room was fantastic Staff responded promptly to requests 
282290,NH Collection Barcelona Podium,No Negative, Excellent service kidness of the personnel in particular Cecilia who has been very nice with my 18 month age baby during the stay 10 15 walking from downtown La Sagrada Familia Arc de Triump Plaza Catalunya Barrio Goric Barceloneta and near metro station to reach other historical places Taxi station in front of the hotel 20 driving to the airport depending on traffic

282292,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, During rush hour it can be a bit noisy For us it was no problem at all but I can imagine if you totally want to get your rest it can be a bit annoying Just ask for a room on a higher floor , The location of the hotel is perfect On short walking distance of Plaza de Catalunya Passeig de Gr cia Arco de Triunfo Parc de la Ciutadella 2 Metro stations are close by If you need a taxi there is a taxi stand just in front of the hotel There are several bars restaurants supermercados bakery s etc nearby The room that we had 112 was really spacious clean and smelt fresh The staff were extremely friendly They surprised me on my birthday with a birthday card cake and balloon The Quest Relations Manager Hugo even called to wish me a happy birthday Such a small thing to do to create an excellent quest experience Gracias Hugo 
282293,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, Would have liked English sausages for breakfast, Every element of the hotel was excellent Really pleased that the food and drink was really well priced no rip off
282294,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, The prices at the hotel restaurant are too high 20 each for breakfast is too much its best to book without the option and go get a coffee and croissant at one of the many cafes in the area , Great service spacious room and gym facilities were fine The area around the hotel is impossible to beat Best neighborhood in Barcelona 
282295,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, The room was ok Not special but ok The weather was warmer than normally on early December and probably due to that the room was a bit too hot , Location was optimal for us tranquille area and close to everything Breakfast was excellent and the children were paid a special attention 
282296,NH Collection Barcelona Podium, We wanted fresh towels but think they just refolded our old ones However they were only used once Compared to the rest of the room the skirting boards were a little tired Wifi was slow We didn t use the pool because it isn t heated so in November it was too cold , Lovely bathroom well stocked good location accessible to everywhere quickly friendly staff very comfortable bed
