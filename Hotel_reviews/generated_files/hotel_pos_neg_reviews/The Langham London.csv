417417,The Langham London,No Negative, Frankly disappointing I usually stay at Claridges and was expecting similar service levels On first day of my stay it took an hour and a half to get a simple document scanned and emailed to me and I had to ask three different people on reception to assist I was told when checking in that it may be possible to change my room which was end of corridor with a view of brick wall This didn t particularly bother me but thought it was a nice touch and shame no one followed up on it No information was given about breakfast gym opening times The newspaper I ordered on day of check out did not arrive No bespoke or particularly attentive service by any staff in the hotel Nothing particularly wrong just felt soulless and was not the 5 experience I was looking forward to 
417418,The Langham London, There was nothing I didn t like about the hotel , I liked the location bed and pillows size of the room the responsiveness and friendliness of the staff the amazing bar the room service and the wide range of TV channels This for me has to be one of the best hotels in Central London and I have stayed at quite a few

417423,The Langham London, Difficult question I guess when the renovation of the spa and pool will be finished it will be something to check out , Everything we tried in the hotel ranged from very good to excellent Room bed comfort bathroom Both restaurants are very good as well The location is also one of the best in central London 
417424,The Langham London, Be aware that if your room is in the Regent Wing that this feels completely separate from the main building of the hotel and means there is a bit of a trek to the facilities including the Excellence Club on the other side of the hotel However the room was very spacious especially for London and seemed recently renovated so there were some benefits to this room including a view down Regent Street , Worth the extra for the Excellence Club something that sets this hotel apart from others in London Fantastic food and drinks including Champagne made the stay extra special Nothing was too much for the staff in the Excellence Club they were attentive and an asset to the hotel Thank you for making the stay so memorable and I would definitely stay here on my next trip to London

417428,The Langham London, Service was poor for a 5 star hotel From checking in to check out it was just ok Coffee is better at Starbucks unless you take an espresso The service is very slow I have stayed at better 5 star hotels in London in the same area at the same price that were delivering Also the rooms were a disappointment compared to photographic images they were too photoshoped and did not represent the reality We were somewhat disappointed , The location was at my convenience The restaurant Roux for dinner was just perfect and immaculous

417486,The Langham London, Everything was perfect , The surroundings were impressive The food was good but most of all the staff were so caring and couldn t have been more helpful The location was perfect for visiting London 
417487,The Langham London, My only criticism would be the need for a mirror to be located near to a table and plug and at a height that can be used when sitting down to dry hair etc This was the only down side and did prove quite inconvenient, The decor especially the beautiful flowers and wonderful smell around the hotel 
417488,The Langham London,No Negative, Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff I ve stayed in a few of the Grande Dame hotels and The Langham surpasses them all I will be coming back 
417489,The Langham London, This hotel should not be rated as wheelchair accessible The entrance is not wheelchair accessible except through their excess ability lift which was broken upon our arrival This made our stay very uncomfortable as we had to travel in and out of the hotel through the spa which is also not very wheelchair friendly with the step at the main door and two steps to get you into the building The wheelchair ramp at the spa is too narrow to fit my mothers wheelchair which is wider than average What makes things more complicated is that the spa closes at 9 PM and if you intend to stay out later than that the hotel personal had to take us through the back doors of the loading area of the hotel into our bedroom which was a very unpleasant experience Even to get to the spa we had to travel from our floor to the ground floor take another lift to the first floor through long corridoors and then another lift and then go all the way at the other end of the building and finally into the spa It truly was like a maze Very ridiculous to spend about 15 minutes every time we wanted to leave or enter the hotel Moreover to go to breakfast at the club lounge we had to travel from our bedroom to the lobby at the ground floor and take a service elevator to the club lounge So the clubroom that is wheelchair accessible has no accessibility to the club lounge because it has a few steps at the entrance We checked out the next day Was not worth the daily struggle In my opinion the hotel should ve given us a courtesy call to inform us about the broken lift and gave us a choice to change our reservation to a more accessible hotel They also should have offered to deliver breakfast to the bedroom every day instead of us traveling to different elevators every day to get to the club lounge Finally beds are too high for a disabled person Can t get in or out without assisstance , Club Room was spacious with plenty of light and room beds were excellent for a normal person Disable wet shower room is excellent
417490,The Langham London, Room was a little small for a twin but not unusually so for a London hotel , This hotel has impeccable service the staff were unobtrusive professional knowledgable and approachable Breakfast buffet in Palm Court was exceptional fresh varied and again excellent service The location is ideal for seeing the sights or for shopping Despite being so central rooms were whisper quiet 
417491,The Langham London,No Negative, We have stayed here a few times now and although one of the most expensive it is by far one of the best Service cleanliness etc is totally on point 
417492,The Langham London, Given the rates charged rooms small breakfast really doesn t meet expectations afternoon tea expensive but average quality One wing under reservation contractors don t clean after themselves very well Again given the rates charged think it only fair to expect more , Location and grandeur of the building 
417493,The Langham London, People smoking on my floor It filtered into my room and woke me up during the night several times If the hotel knows this is an issue they need to address it and smoke alarms should be in every room to prevent this If someone smoking caused a fire it would be disastrous ,No Positive
417494,The Langham London, All executive Club Rooms should have a bath for the room rate paid , What is there not to like Coming to the Langham London is a treat unto itself You don t really need to leave the hotel beautiful food lovely attentive staff If you are going to stay here you may as well spend a little more and experience all the hotel has to offer in the way of the Executive Club Lounge A beautiful oasis in the middle of a shopping day to return to High tea and champagne The only thing missing is a foot massage A wonderful experience every time Bed manchester is silky and luxurious it must be a silk blend somehow with high thread count Such a treat you don t want to get out of bed A well heeled group of Guests Pricing strata ensures only those serious about quality are able to stay here a good thing
417495,The Langham London, We ordered a Grand Twin room I was travelling with a friend and we we re put in a Double room which was a bit disappointing We had to be off out quickly so didn t have time to remedy so just separated and pushed the beds out a bit So if you do book make sure you get the room you ve paid for , The Artesian bar is excellent and their cocktails are something else The gym swimming pool and spa areas are also superb The breakfast in the sublime Palm Court was delicious as well 
417496,The Langham London, It was expensive 18 for a cocktail is a bit much We spent nearly 3000 for a 3 night stay which by anyone s standard is a lot The room was pretty small again for the money , The facilities in the hotel were second to non The Artisan Bar and Roux restaurant were very very good Location was amazing Door staff very good The waiters in both the Dining areas made our stay very enjoyable by allowing ourselves to tour the kitchen which made my wife s stay Thank you for your kindness 
417497,The Langham London, Nothing it was perfect , This is the best hotel in London and the service is incredible I have been to this hotel many times now and each time I have been here from the moment you walk in you are made to feel welcome We had an amazing room upgrade the whole experience was very very special and I will definitely be back as soon as possible
417498,The Langham London,No Negative, Quality of food and drink was excellent Staff were friendly without being snobbish which can be the case at some more expensive hotels Location was perfect for shopping and an afternoon swim helped ease the soles of the feet 
417499,The Langham London, When u are paying decent price fur room the price of bfast on top too expensive After checking out and asking for a coffee to go getting charged the equivalent E10 over the top Antunes decent hotels have thus free in lobby, Nice sorroundings
417500,The Langham London, Service in bar area was a little slow Some bedroom furniture looked a little tired , Excellent location professional and friendly staff Bed was wonderful best night s sleep I ve had in years 
417501,The Langham London,No Negative, It was our 10 year anniversary and the staff couldn t have been better Their customer service was excellent we were invited to the lounge for a glass of champagne They really helped make our anniversary a special occasion
417502,The Langham London, travelling with a 17yr who wasn t allowed in bar at night which was a shame, Fantastic location we upgraded to club room which was really worth it
417503,The Langham London, Nothing much to dislike the only issue was a bit of a route march to the toilets , The hotel is in a great location with good facilities and impeccable service 
417504,The Langham London, Basically I found nothing to complaint If possible please offer 1 2 bottles of water per customer 2 a USB outlet for charging purpose or a USB charger with multiple outlets , We consider Langham London is a real 5 starred hotel 1 Grand and elegant building both inside and outside 2 Fabulous lobby design lovely pink roses in the lobby areas preferred great smell of fragrant smell just like other Langham around the world 3 efficient polite and professional check in and check out 4 detailed and friendly orientation made by the front desk reception staff right after our check in 5 polite and smart doormen which made us feeling we are valued customer of Langham London 6 we are offered the access of Langham Club Lounge located on the 3rd floor with full board light meals internet access professional sightseeing advice and free flow of bubbles we are impressed by the managers waiters and wateriness are well trained polite professional and smart appearance as well as positive attitude to their customers 7 Guestroom was clean with adequate source of light Although the switchboard and fixtures looks old I can tell that the guestroom is well maintained 8 I love the bed because it was nice and soft with clean bedsheet 9 The bathroom is large and clean we found no soap residuals or stains around the bathtub area The shower worked well and gave me a great time to relax during the shower time Since I forget to bring my toothbrush I was glad to see there s a cute pink color toothbrush with toothpaste offered in the bathroom thank you Langham London 10 The adjustable level of lights source is user friendly The little light above the pillow area help me not avoiding my mother s sleeping 11 The availability of a paper bag in the guestroom helped us on the last day s morning s packing 12 Housekeeping staffs are friendly and polite 13 Excellent location just a few minutes walk to the intersection of Regent Street and Oxford Street We enjoyed the walking on the Regent Street from Piccadilly Circus to the intersection of Oxford Street and Regent 
417505,The Langham London, No criticisms at all and I am hard to please , 1 Room a good size and very comfortable 2 Luxurious and many varied items supplied in bathroom 3 Every member of staff we dealt with from the porter waiters receptionists was unfailingly pleasant and helpful 4 A wonderful choice of food always presented well 5 Excellent spa and gym facilities with a good sized swimming pool
417506,The Langham London, Upgraded but put in a room next to renovation work and roof work which was noisy Had to ask to be moved for second night, Liked the older part of the hotel as had lovely large bathrooms
417507,The Langham London, Would have preferred proper coffee in the room as opposed to instant Nescafe a Nespresso machine for example like the Fairmont , Great customer service top notch facilities and don t get me started on the Artesian So many unnecessary little attentions but hey that s what luxury 5 is there for pure indulgence
417508,The Langham London, Breakfast was expensive even by the standards of the hotel I suppose the average person staying at the Langham wouldn t bat an eyelid at 32 a head for breakfast but it seemed excessive to me so we opted not to take breakfast Hardly a complaint to be honest as we had plans for food anyway so wouldn t have taken it regardless of the price but it did seem over the top to me , Staff were aware we were visiting for my girlfriend s birthday and left a card and a box of chocolates in the room nice touch Extremely accommodating of requests we made we arrived earlier than check in time so they moved our booking to a newer nicer room that was available earlier stored our luggage and sent me a text when the room was available Of course it s expensive but given the facilities of the hotel and the luxury of the establishment not mention a superb central London location I thought the price represented excellent value for money compared to other similar hotels Spa facilities no charge for access were excellent and a significant reason why I chose the Langham Would absolute stay again budget allowing we had a great time here and were made to feel extremely welcome staff weren t at all stuffy or snobby or anything like that Fantastic experience 
417509,The Langham London,No Negative, Very good customer service No delays no issues at all Provided a congratulatory cake at the time Excellent service overall very impressed from the chauffeur to the room service No faults at all Very enjoyable stay 
417510,The Langham London, No room service menu Staff called daily and knocked on door despite asking for no calls and do not disturb sign Everyday I asked again not to be disturbed Sign was ignored , The bed was comfy 
417511,The Langham London, Nothing, The staff at The Langham are as good as I have experienced in any London hotel Nothing is too much trouble and they go out of their way to make your stay memorable The rooms are very well equipped with lots of additional touches turn down service water and chocolates The hotel also benefits from having the best bar in London with a great atmosphere and exceptional staff 
417512,The Langham London, The swimming pool was too cold , Wonderful stay with very courteous and professional staff The decor was lovely Not too modern like many hotels Real quality without being flashy 
417513,The Langham London, At the arrival i was given a very noisy room When i asked to change the stuff told me its all booked and i should pay extra to upgrade to the next level which i didn t want to do Eventually a very nice young Russian stuff member helped to sort out the issue which i am grateful for but it took about an hour of walking up and down hotel floors to find a room , Location and great room service nice breakfast 
417514,The Langham London, Sometimes hall carpet needed hoovering Front desk check in out could have been quicker Room key malfunctioned daily , Sheets were amazing The wonderful floral smell when you enter the lobby and hallways Flowers in lobby Bathroom amenities were fabulous 
417515,The Langham London, Spa and Pool were disappointing Steam room was broken the jacuzzi was small and cloudy it wasn t relaxing 7 10 , Great hotel impeccable service atmosphere location style friendliness all excellent Our room was 110 was sumptuous with very generous everything but it did face a brick wall And the dustbin cart woke us up both mornings 
417516,The Langham London,No Negative, Everything I love the Langham its amazing Beautiful and the staff is very friendly coming to the Langham is coming to heaven well done and keep up the good work God bless
417517,The Langham London, The towel in the bathroom doesn t smell good don t know why , Great location Very nice and helpful staff Very comfortable bed pillow Enjoyed my stay
417518,The Langham London, It was unfortunate that a planned power outage stopped us enjoying our stay beyond11 am But we had been warned in advance and no doubt that explained the excellent value for money in the rate on booking com , The breakfast in the restaurant is always a treat if time permits and the staff are very attentive The pool also a luxury not many hotels in the area have The maze to get there was new and always a challenge 
417519,The Langham London, The cocktail bar although buzzy didn t have the wow factor we were expecting, Every point of contact with the langhams employees was excellent They really were all superb
417520,The Langham London, The English breakfast that we ordered to the room was a little elaborate for English breakfast The breakfast we had downstairs in the beautiful dining room was excellent , The hotel is absolutely beautiful it is very well located in the center of London close to everything opera musicals Oxford street it has a lovely spa with pool and jacuzzi the service is excellent and the staff are friendly and helpful 
417521,The Langham London, Nothing, Outstanding Attention to detail in atmosphere in service We loved the bar they have the most creative cocktails which were fun tasty Excellent breakfast selection It was such a pleasure to stay there 
417522,The Langham London, The bar was closed by 2am when we came back so we couldn t even sit and have a coffee downstairs, Bed was very comfy and duvet wasn t too heavy Breakfast was very good too 
417523,The Langham London, Nothing, We had a fantastic weekend celebrating my partner s birthday and they made our stay extra special by recognising his birthday by upgrading us The service was excellent and everyone we met treated us to an exceptional level of service The room was outstanding and the bed super comfy The location is also excellent 
417524,The Langham London,No Negative, The pillows were horribly soft but I nearl expect that of every hotel at this stage The staff were brilliant The food was amazing Drinks and breakfast and everything 
417525,The Langham London, Cooling in room should be looked at Room temperature at 23 which was too warm Would have preferred 22 Personal preference though Disappointed with Roux at Landau , Great room great bar in hotel Always felt welcome 
417526,The Langham London, Would have preferred a slightly larger breakfast option The choice of eggs benedict for example rather than full English Hotel lobby and restaurants were very beautiful but the room we stayed in was a little too traditional and outdated for our taste , Location is superb to Oxford St Regent St Harley St and surrounding areas Excellent staff and service bed was very comfy And they allowed us to check in early as requested We would stay here again 
417527,The Langham London, Another guest having a tantrum in the Langham Club lounge but the staff dealt with it amazingly professionally , The staff were excellent and couldn t do enough for us The food was delicious and the Langham Club lounge was fantastic 
417528,The Langham London, The Cold shower but very apologetic at checkout with discount so happy , The smell very clean and fresh good location and very friendly staff upgrade to club lounge a good option lots of champagne 
417529,The Langham London, Nothing everything First Class, As an 1865 member as usual Could not fault anything Club Lounge as usual wonderful All staff especially Norbert looks after everyone 
417530,The Langham London, Room temperature is hard to control a bit cold Water temperature is difficult to control either fairly hot or fairly cold The breakfast menu did not include every offering they have you will need to ask the staff for the extra offerings Sometimes for a small service you get many staff members helping which makes it difficult to tip the right amount to the right people , Staff were great at breakfast room service and the porters Booking managers are very organised thanks Beds are comfortable Pancakes were great
417531,The Langham London,No Negative, The whole experience was outstanding the staff were friendly smart and could not help us enough The rooms were classy with all modern facilities for example above the desk there were multiple socket types that would accept every type of electrical plug from around the world no adaptors needed in addition there were sockets to connect all types of media directly into the TV Another example of The Langham anticipating your needs prior to you knowing you have them The Artesian cocktail bar inside the hotel was also an unexpected delight I can not recommend The Langham enough 10 10
417532,The Langham London, Our room was a bit dated and the furnishings and bathroom not what we would expect from a 5 star hotel The coffee was bog standard Nescafe sachets and not many either and most surprising no biscuits I have never been to any hotel or even B B where no biscuits of any kind were included in the tea making facilities Also our view was of a brick wall and fire escape , The bed and pillows were fantastic sheets wonderful Best of all the out of this world staff who made us feel so special 
417533,The Langham London, Better gluten free options on the breakfast menu only white toast available , The staff made us feel so welcome even though we only stayed one night and didn t book the most expensive room the hotel is so clean it sparkles our room was spacious even with an extra bed for our son We could open the bedroom window so slept well and although it was a Friday evening and the hotel was busy once inside our room it was peaceful and quiet 
417534,The Langham London, Breakfast was not as expected of a hotel of such a rating The dining was quite cramped when staff are attending to the next customer their backsides with very short skirts are almost touching the next table Tea coffee were cold eggs not served to the specified or requested consistency sausages were cold poorly prepared It s our 3rd stay at the hotel this was the worst we ve seen it Something has changed because we ve never experienced this before , The staff s attention to detail
417535,The Langham London, Breakfast for the price should be included without a doubt , Amazing Expensive but amazing Beautiful hotel Don t leave your room Just enjoy the surroundings and luxury and get your monies worth 
417536,The Langham London, I love everything, Gorgeous rooms Beautiful fragrance that flows throughout the hotel The Langham club the staff One of my favourite hotels in London 
417537,The Langham London, Waited in bar for a drink prior to eating had to leave after 10 mins no one had taken our order and didn t want to be late for meal if that s the time it took to order , The feeling of being comfortable cared for and not the first to walk the corridors or sit in the restaurant being happy Staff overall soo nice to know and meet 
417538,The Langham London,No Negative, Just back from a wonderful three day break at the Langham A very special thank you to Vicky who made our stay extra special by her thoughtfulness and professionalism 
417539,The Langham London, pay a huge night for one month but don t get access to movies recommendation would be free movie when you book a hotel and then charge if people select to watch without adverts or something let s be honest most people who go to the langham are not froglets but not everyone has deep po lets so the option of a free movie would be awesome , I have stayed in well over 100 hotels for business Obviously the premier inn Mercure etc The langham really showed me that you really do get more for your money when it comes to hotels The food was absolutely beautiful my room was pristine and the staff were delightful I normally ignore these surveys sorry but these guys really did nail it I took my girlfriend here
417540,The Langham London, Leisure facilities not as well managed as hotel Bar super busy table booking required , Room wonderful Splendid common areas Attentive service Worth treating yourself to 
417541,The Langham London, the pillow were not comfortable and i got a neck ache every morning although I requested another pillow and still it wasn t that good, the location is extremely perfect in quite area although its very close to oxford street many restaurants around the staff were very friendly and helpful it is the perfect hotel 
417542,The Langham London, The way the queues work also when getting tickets at the sites is not great The sites could learn a lot from the Americans , The location was good enjoyed it got you out for a walk and close to the shops if needed The golden bus tour was ok
417543,The Langham London,No Negative, The best hotel I have stayed in by far Fabulous staff amazing facilities and the biggest room with the comfiest bed ever Could not hear any outside noise whatsoever Excellent location Can t wait to go back 
417544,The Langham London,No Negative, Great location very friendly staff catering to all our needs The bed was really comfy We used the Club room a lot also for breakfast and afternoon teas Pool great and great for kids on a rainy day
417545,The Langham London, We had a hiccup with our room at the beginning of our stay however this was dealt with quickly and with the utmost professionalism We were concerned this lovely hotel was losing it s touch however after spending the weekend here all faith has been restored , This hotel has a wonderful ambience would highly recommend for a special occasion or just for a lazy weekend in London where everything is on your doorstep 
417546,The Langham London, Booked a Grand room but it was anything but it was small and dark In the end had to upgrade to a more expensive Club room which was excellent Some staff at breakfast on Sunday seemed a bit off hand we ate well before end of the sitting for breakfast but felt we were being rushed to finish our meal when we asked for things i e more coffee or butter it didn t come and we had to ask again , Food Excellent especially dinner the the Landau Staff in the main very friendly and helpful
417547,The Langham London, My club room was quite small however as I was given a free upgrade to this room with club facilities I am grateful The club rooms in the Regent wing are a lot bigger although its very difficult to navigate your way back to reception due to renovations on the hotel , The location is excellent as it is a 2 minute walk from Oxford Circus so you are close to everything including the tube station The club lounge is fantastic and does an awesome breakfast with really friendly staff who go out of their way to ensure you are always looked after The doormen are super helpful also 
417548,The Langham London,No Negative, Loved the turn down service Naseem the doorman was really friendly and helpful Great cocktail bar The spa and leisure facilities the bed was very comfy and the vegetarian sausages were fantastic 
417549,The Langham London, Rather small room views on wall with AC lots of walking and long labyrinth of hallways takes about 10 minutes walking to go from room to the pool past the lobby Lacks glamour , Great location just at the beginning of Regent St and shopping area Really large and nice bed good room equipment plugs iron etc and generous amenities great service and in room dinning menu and food quality 
417550,The Langham London, It wasn t very clear where reception was located but I wouldn t really say that was something I didn t like I didn t like breakfast being 32 pp per day but that s what you can expect from a Central London 5 hotel , The room seemed quite average on first impressions but the en suite bathroom made up for it It really had the wow factor The bed was amazing Huge comfy and a deep feather topper ensured a great night s rest I was very impressed to see crystal champagne flutes in the glass selection with the minibar and the toiletries were very generous Staff treated us to a gift each of Belgian chocolates as we were there for our birthdays and gave us a handwritten birthday card Fabulous location and very quiet considering how central we were in London 
417551,The Langham London, Breakfast very expensive but lots of choice nearby , Fabulous location in central location Great value for the comfort and service you receive Lots of nice touches like evening turn down and nice box of chocolates for my wife Very impressed with a classy quality hotel Loved the in house cocktail bar the Artisian a must for any visit 
417552,The Langham London, Limited parking and expensive valet although all valet is very expensive in London approx US 70 per night I believe , Great hotel Modern Comfy Clean and Luxury Location good Great value 
417553,The Langham London, Breakfast wasn t plentiful neither buffet nor ordered breakfast Range of food not extensive , We stayed here overnight as our son got married here Staff were all very helpful Room was very comfortable especially beds 
417554,The Langham London, The water pressure in the room was not satisfying but the hotel took immediate care of it and suggested an alternative room , Excellent Service Location very convenient 
417555,The Langham London,No Negative, like everything in the hotel the comfort the cleanliness courteous helpful staff excellent professional service of the lounge club staff The spa is a also big plus to the hotel 
417556,The Langham London,No Negative, Absolutely everything about our stay at The Langham was exemplary Every need was catered to with the minimum of fuss and great solicitude and care It was a truly magnificent way to celebrate a special birthday from the supremely comfortable beds to the magnificent bath shower the soft towels bathrobes etc It was a magical experience The surprise of a birthday cake provided by the hotel was quite literally the icing on the cake 
417557,The Langham London, The breakfast was very poor There was hardly any choice on the cold buffet No cereals etc For full English breakfast there was choice of either sausages bacon or omelettes I didn t check the vegetarian option For the astronomical price charged the breakfast was not worth it Also while we were eating at the table the waitress started making up the next table and waving the tablecloths which is very poor manners It was past 11 am on Sunday and there was clearly no great rush to do it , The bed was very comfortable and the location is great
417558,The Langham London, Room didn t heat up as we would have liked , Great location Welcoming and attentive staff The food was delicious highly sourced and well presented I don t usually drink wine but the Riesling recommended in the Roux at the Landau was a gorgeous accompaniment to the food The bed was heavenly Overall a delightful experience The hotel is not ostentatious but has a quality of style and decor that makes you want to come back We will too 
417559,The Langham London, The view from the room was overlooking an air conditioning unit, The elegance and ambience of the hotel The superb service consistently delivered by ever member of staff The Artisan bar with a wonderful atmosphere and amazing cocktail selection A delicious lunch with impeccable service from Roux at the Landau
417560,The Langham London, I thought the rooms were very basic for a 5 star Was woken up early by workmen Room also seemed dated TV must have been 10 years old There didn t seem to be an obvious facility for breakfast in the room Usually there is a card at hotels to leave on the door Didn t like that there wasn t a separate shower from the bath , Palm court and artisian and all communal areas Nice bathroom products 
417561,The Langham London,No Negative, We are frequent visitors the The Langham Exceptional in every way W London prices to match Club Lounge redone is terrific Fitness center terrific Warm staff at the Club floor 
417562,The Langham London, The lack of internet and the fact they burned my shirt Inattentive staff Too expensive for the quality of the service They just want to rich money and doesn t care about clients ,No Positive
417563,The Langham London, A slight lack of choice for evening meal on a Sunday , Very helpful and friendly staff who always had a smile for you Loved the champagne man tradition 
417564,The Langham London, I booked a grand twin room whose size was recorded as 28 square meters In fact the room looked very small and the size was like 20 square meters Maybe a structure problem or anything else I asked a high floor with nice view at reservation with 3 nights but found the assignment in a completely opposite way It was totally out of my expectation with a high price room reservation The room also had a shower drain problem I do not recommend a grand twin room at least for a family , A staff was impressively kind and he tried to help me with a smile at every moment unlike two female staffs 
417565,The Langham London, we got a noisy room because of work in the hotel but after we complained we got a quiet room, breckfast Staff was very good Bar staff Excelent Concierge Verry good
417566,The Langham London, Pool cold staff non existent in pool area nor helpful when there had to wait for our room as not ready despite confirming arrival time, Room service cleanliness staff except the spa pool area
417567,The Langham London, There was building work going on and felt disappointed that we having stayed at the Langham many times were put in a room where the noise level of the building work was disturbing When we complained we were put in an excellent room and feel this should have been done in the first place without the hassle of changing rooms , Location helpful staff particularly the concierge and the doormen 
417568,The Langham London,No Negative, My daughter and I were visiting over the New Year holiday We were upgraded to a larger room Had an incredible panorama view of London and were able to enjoy New Year s Eve fireworks from the comfort of our room Staff is efficient and attentive rooms are larger than usual for London Beds are comfy 
417569,The Langham London, We ordered soup in the room and discretionary charge was added to the price and then this was bumped up by 5 tray charge making it 19 for only tomato soup which is even expensive by London standards, Excellent location
417570,The Langham London, Nothing, What a great hotel we stayed on the 31St of December for new year From the start to finish it was excellent The room was spotless we had great views of the London Eye for the fireworks which we where on the 9thfloor plus we had the club lounge which was superb from 3pm till 11pm we had unlimited champagne and canap s and snacks It was a beautiful club lounge The best one I ve been in and lastly a great spa and swimming pool really clean
