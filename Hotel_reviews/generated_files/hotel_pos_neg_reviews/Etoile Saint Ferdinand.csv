163170,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, For a 4 star hotel I would expect better bathroom supplies Also in one room the bathroom door was not fully opening , Great location Near metro lines and the arc de triumph Friendly staff and clean rooms 
163171,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, It is NOT 4 star hotel at all A very small hotel in a street lobby is small a tiny lift can fit only 3 persons or with one bag only one person Corridor is narrow hardly it can be given 2 stars Very poor value of money Breakfast is so so and budget oriented , I stayed for 4 nights with family in two rooms Rooms were clean but small in size Location is good close to metro station and tourist attraction Staff is helpful 
163172,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, Rooms are a bit small for a family of 3 sharing the bed , The staff were excellent especially Katherine and Mr Zouheir himself Very close to the metros and easily accesible to the shopping district of Champs Elyesee 
163173,Etoile Saint Ferdinand,No Negative, Staff was very friendly Free breakfast consisted of caerel breads fruit hard boiled eggs coffee and juices Pocket wifi device was 3 euro per and totally worth it I kept it in my pocket and my iPhone was connected to wifi for the whole day Made navigating texting and obtaining Uber s very easy 
163174,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, Probably value for money Expensive for room quality and size Clearly one is spending for the location , Great location Close to good restaurants and to Metro 
163175,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, Very small elevator Hardly place to park in front of the door to drop of people and luggage , Fresh pastries at breakfast very friendly staff Hotelroom was very quiet and clean and we managed to sleep all 4 in one rather comfortable bed kids on 8 months and 2 years Parking around the corner for 1 per hour Residential area plenty of restaurants nearby 
163176,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, The shower bath combo could have been much better it was very slippy there was no handrail or anything in the bath to prevent you slipping and the glass panel didn t have the rubber under it to make it stay in one place The person I was staying with fell while showering and got really hurt , The staff were very help The rooms were nicely decorated and the hotel is in an excellent location 
163177,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, The rooms are a bit old except for the bathroom for a 4 star hotel but otherwise comfortable I would say it s a 3 star hotel with aspirations to 4 , I really appreciated the kindness of the staff they were extremely helpful and friendly Also the location was nice the neighbourhood classy and it provides easy access to metro Arc de Triomphe and main sightseeings Many restaurants and boutiques around as well 
163178,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, a chair rather than stool would have been nice I had a bout 5 hours work to do , the staff were outstanding Special mention to Caroline who was super enthusiastic and helpful I really liked this hotel and the ethos Free coffee and an honour bar were nice relaxed touches 
163179,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, The receptionist at the weekend was absolutely rude disrespectful to me and my guest It was my bday and friends came to congratulate me for a party If we were too loud he could have simply given a call and we had left Instead he questioned me very rude the next morning and was also very disrespectful to my friends on Sunday This guy is seriously not fitting the happy culture and makes a very bad impression despite the othr staff being so amazing Breakfast was very small and simple there could be more choice The rooms were small but charming Bathroom sink a lil unusual but all in all it works A minibar would have been nice , The staff apart from the weekend night guy at my welcome was super friendly and very welcoming We felt much at home There was free coffee tea at the reception area and there is a happy hour wine cheese tasting and they offered us in the evening the rest of one open bottle to finish Very nice gesture 
163180,Etoile Saint Ferdinand,No Negative, Nice hotel in very good location Cozy clean everything what you need I expected a bit bigger room in 4 stars hotel but it is OK Wi fi worker perfect breakfast was good Nice and helpful staff 
163181,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, Consistent internet connection disruptions breakfast was fine but low variety and the dining room is small , Convenient location superb daily wine cheese parties in the evening nice calm area around with restaurants and shops nearby staff was very polite and friendly 
163182,Etoile Saint Ferdinand,No Negative, Excellent hotel Great location and the wine and cheese at 6 00pm a lovely touch All the staff were lovely helpful attentive and funny Breakfast varied Just make sure you exit the Metro at exit 4 There are 7 exits 
163183,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, There is not much room for breakfast I had to wait a couple of times for a free table , Staff are very kind and accommodating The honesty bar is great 
163184,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, Noisy The hotel was very noisy as one heard noise from the street as well as from the corridor and other rooms a lot more than in other hotels Cleaning The cleaning of the room was not very thorough Broken window The window in the room couldn t open as the handle was broken I reported this to the reception but in the following days didn t hear anything back Because the window couldn t open the temperature and air in the room were not pleasant , Every night from 6 to 8 PM cheese and wine were offered free of charge in the hotel lobby Coffee was also available free of charge during the day 
163185,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, The room was awful the view was a brick wall inspite of the fact we paid for a better room there were no drawers to put anything in it looked shabby there was a tile coming of in the bathroom disappointed to say the least, The staff on the desk were amazing very helpful a credit to the hotel
163186,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, The rooms are a little bit small but for a couple of days it s absolutely fine, The staff was really friendly they always tried to help The location of the hotel is also good we walked about 20 minutes to the eiffel tower All in all a really good hotel 
163187,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, We could hear the guests next door to us snore very loudly , Everything was fantastic I had contacted the hotel prior to arrival as it was my mums 60th when we arrived the staff decorated our room and had a birthday cake it was such a lovely touch
163188,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, One of a staff member was rude We booked twin room and we got double room instead When we asked to change it we got another double room only We were disappointed as we booked this hotel way in advance, Good location near to metro station shops and restaurants
163189,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, Our room was next to a noisy lift could hear conversations and not very private The bathroom sink was the most ridiculous ever designed 5cm deep and painters woke us up on Monday morning having a conversation outside our door , Staff were very helpful and place was clean 
163190,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, Actually there is nothing not to like , The location of the hotel is perfect You can reach anywhere in a few steps whether it is Arc de Triumph or the green and beautiful Bois de Boulogne and the subway station Argentine will be waiting for your adventures It is not just the location too The hotel itself is a typical Parisian architecture with an elegant entrance long corridors throughout the hotel cozy rooms The bonus is you have the luxury to reach your room with the help a tiny cute elevator We stayed in a lovely room at the back of the hotel We slept really well It was a very and comfortable quiet stay The bathroom has a bathtub Although we did not use it it is always nice to have such facilities in a room also such as an electric kettle The staff at the hotel is very friendly and ready to help Free city map is also provided at the reception that you can take with you Overall it was a great stay at the heart of Paris Thank you 
163191,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, Sometimes I momentarily had problems with the WiFi connection but this did not affect my stay as it would work again in a few seconds , I felt welcome from the very first moment because of the very friendly and kind staff they really made me feel at home The room was perfect and cosy the bathroom was very clean and so was the rest of the room The hotel s location is very convenient as it is just like 3 minutes away from Porte Maillot subway and RER station therefore one can move around Paris without having to change lines many times There are several restaurants and cafes in the area which is perfectly safe and L Arc de Triomphe is within walking distance I would definitely stay again 
163192,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, Room was a little too warm , Wonderful friendly staff Nothing was too much trouble It was a quiet area but plenty of restaurants nearby Free wine and cheese early evening 
163193,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, The breakfast is simple not wide range of food Sometimes long waiting for the croissant but at least it is fresh , The atmosphere is really good wine and cheese tasting every day clean tidy room nice receptionist Coffee machine in the lobby awesome 
163194,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, The bathroom could not have been smaller, The staff and the Happy culture time Comfortable bed although I got twin beds instead of a double bed that I requested when booking 
163195,Etoile Saint Ferdinand,No Negative, Very well located close to the arc de triomphe metro close by They have wine and cheese tasting in the evening very nice Also complimentary nespresso in the lobby
163196,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, the rooms and bathrooms are very small fine if you are there for just a weekend but not so good if you are staying longer the elevator small and slow, Very friendly and efficient staff perfect location if you arrive by car and don t want to drive in Paris close to the ring road as well as to a parking lot and an underground station nice wine and cheese happy hour if you are staying in one of the hotels of the chain in Paris you can enjoy the happy hour at any of their other hotels wherever you are in Paris at that time very lively area quite a number of shops and restaurants 
163197,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, Lift was small so had to squeeze in not an issue if you are all friends , Comfy bed helpful staff good location and the nice touch of happiness times wine and cheese tasting mobile phone chargers in communal areas and the honesty bar 
163198,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, The 4 stars of this hotel are too much The room was not large enough the towels were not well ranged some of them were hidden in the wardrobe and not in the bathroom The little glass was not enough large to prevent the shower water to spread out of the bathtub There was not a little fridge The wifi dialogue box was not user friendly and no more than one appliance at a time was allowed with a single e mail address So we could connect one computer or one smartphone at a time but not the two at the same time , The geographic situation close to Porte Maillot and the access to Beauvais airport 
163199,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, There is no fridge in the rooms and there was hair in the carpets The location wasn t that good slightly far The lobby furniture is old fashioned and small ,No Positive
163200,Etoile Saint Ferdinand,No Negative, The location was the best feature of this hotel It s close to everything you need and is safe and full of lights when u come back to the hotel late in the night You can walk in it s nice streets to get to sightseeing places Great great place The room was extra clean and pleasent Loved the free coffee in the lobby Loved the happy time of serving cheese and wine The staff were very friendly 
163201,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, The showers only have a small glass panel that shield the bathroom from the water When I would finish my shower the bathroom floor was inches deep in water Perhaps there is a technique I m not privy to as an American to keeping the water contained , Beds pillows and linens were incredibly comfortable Room was small but charming French doors onto balcony were a definite plus could bring in lots of fresh air and light The breakfast was superb everything one could want The location can t be beat quiet with a neighborhood feeling and great bistro s on every corner but only blocks away from the Arc de Triomphe Wonderful I would come back again and again 
163202,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, Despite putting do not disturb house keeping still knock the door and then they open and enter without even permissio Never seen this before ,No Positive
163203,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, the rooms were very small especially the bathroom shower in which manoeuvring into and out of required vast knowledge in gymnastics , Staff was extremely cooperative and sensitive to our needs day and night They were both pleasant and very helpful with issues arising from our stay as well as general information in which they were very helpful and knowledgeable 
163204,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, Everything was great only one minor personal problem encountered The shower head didn t go up very high but I m over 2 meters 6 8 so that can be expected , The staff was very friendly and helpful Any questions we had were answered and they provided us with information about Paris The room was very nice clean and had all the basic needs The location was superb Within a couple of minutes walk there are three subway stations and even the Arc de Triomphe is well within walking distance 
163205,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, The wardrobe doors banged very hard when closing we could hear this clearly from The bedrooms next door Rather annoying late at night or early in the morning When other guests were coming in late or leaving early , Even though The hotel was small it was very clean with a Very comfy bed 
163206,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, there is no refrigerator in the room 504 Safe box does not work bath room floor is the all time wet could be leak under closet elevetor very old not clean and very narrow I don t understand this hotel four star, location near the congress center and metro station next the hotel ferdinand on the corner near the hotel restorant would be very pleased

163214,Etoile Saint Ferdinand, The manner of the manager she doesn t care about the customer and their opinions I wanted a late checkout she asked me for extra charge where in lagare hotel at Venice they didn t ask for any extra charge, I only liked the location because the hotel is old and I don t think it deserve to be 4 star it should be like 3 star
