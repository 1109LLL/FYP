158065,Georgian House Hotel, There as no lift so the flights of stairs to the 4th floor was a little hard going, Lovely breakfast with excellent variety in a modern setting and attentive staff Easy quick check in and out with thanks to the very helpful and knowledgeable reception staff Location fantastic very clean area and felt safe not too far from the tube Victoria train bus station restaurants bars Would definitely stay again and recommend but top tip would be to request a lower floor 
158066,Georgian House Hotel, Poor sound proof tiny tiny room and bathroom receptionist wasn t very welcoming luggage storage wasn t very secure, Super close to the coach station clean The White Company toiletries breakfast was not bad

158069,Georgian House Hotel, Its not 5 stars hotel no AC Super small room endless numbers of stairs divided to few buildings strange place Save for the location not worth the money ,No Positive
158070,Georgian House Hotel, The country was experiencing the hottest weather since 1976 The hotel has no A C and with four flights of stairs and as heat rises our 4th floor room was very uncomfortable We were then provided with a floor fan which helped considerably when in the room or sleeping , The breakfast was delicious and the staff were very charming efficient and attentive 
158071,Georgian House Hotel, Some members of staff were more friendly and helpful than others , Very clean and stylish property beautifully decorated with a lovely comfortable bed Very close to Victoria train and bus station and of course the tube Beautiful White Company toiletries and fluffy white robes and slippers for use during your stay 
158072,Georgian House Hotel, EVERYTHING, Nothing expensive not actually located where I was told ie the address I went to up 4 flights of stairs and you had to go out of the room to change your mind NEVER AGAIN 
158073,Georgian House Hotel, Wasn t particularly keen on see through bathroom door haha but that s truly the only thing I can think of and that s being hugely picky , Service on the reception desk was fantastic Room was lovely and comfortable Breakfast was amazing Easy walk from Victoria Station 
158074,Georgian House Hotel, We were there on the hottest day of the year Could not sleep due to no air con and no fan The room was clean however the walls very very scruffy and could do with painting , Staff were lovely Main building was lovely 
158075,Georgian House Hotel, Very disappointed we booked the hotel based on the photos on their website We were put up in a third floor apartment two streets away very basic decor nothing like the website photo s no porter in our building and no lights working in the apartment Thankfully we only booked for one night , Staff were very helpful and friendly and good breakfast 
158076,Georgian House Hotel,No Negative, The property was in a safe quiet location With Victoria station an easy 5 10 minute walk traveling on public transport was convenient The greatest bonus was the complimentary use of a Hotel Handy while we were there It was equipped with data and google maps making navigating the city much easier and I was able to preserve data and battery on my own mobile The breakfast was locally sourced fresh and delicious A takeaway breakfast was even offered on the mornings we left the hotel prior to when breakfast was served I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends 
158077,Georgian House Hotel, The place is very loud from the restaurant where sound seems to amplify to the rooms where my wall was shaking every time my neighbor closed the door It made it very hard to sleep longer than 7am when the hotel starts to wake up The single room is also VERY small Basically it suffers from the same issues as most London hotels in older buildings small and very noisy , Clean and nicely decorated great location friendly staff OK breakfast great if you pay the premium 
158078,Georgian House Hotel, Are room was in the basement so we had no view which was a shame when we had paid for a slightly more expensive room , Lovely location bed was very comfy friendly helpful staff and lovely clean hotel 
158079,Georgian House Hotel, The shower was not as powerful as I usually like but it was otherwise lovely , It is a charming little B B in the heart of Victoria I loved the quaint feel in the check in and breakfast rooms with artsy and historical decor The staff were all wonderful and helpful I booked an extra small room which was almost at the top The room was very cute with lovely lattice work in the cupboards tasteful decor exceedingly clean I especially loved the usual room extras including bathrobe and slippers and especially the rental mobile phone for use in London 
158080,Georgian House Hotel, There was nothing I didn t like about this hotel , Very comfortable compact and well furnished room and extremely helpful and friendly staff made my stay here a pleasure Great to have a coffee machine in the room so that you don t have to suffer terrible instant Nescafe THe continental breakfast was good with eggs cheese and cold meats if you wanted fresh fruit salad and juice too 
158081,Georgian House Hotel, The bed was to hard bathroom to small with a tap that was not attached well enough to the sink and the shower head was making noise when in use That was not really 5 stars quality The Continental breakfast should include fish too There was not enough food to choose from Both continental and english breakfast should be included in the price when you already have to pay for breakfast The tea that was served at breakfast was not as tasteful as I expected , Friendly staff clean room central hotel 
158082,Georgian House Hotel, Front desk attitude see above, The room was tiny the reception staff need to learn the word smile One looked like a scowling Russian weight lifter most of them look exhausted The dining room staff were great
158083,Georgian House Hotel, I would have preferred not walking up 6 flights of stairs but I also realize this is how the buildings are and I love older places with character , Super comfortable beds the staff could not have been nicer The best Continental breakfast I ve ever had Very clean all around perfect stay 
158084,Georgian House Hotel, Didn t serve food except snacks not ideal for business travellers who need evening meal, Great room very modern and very quiet location for central london
158085,Georgian House Hotel, We didn t get to stay in main hotel put in another house round the corner Room small with no window just patio doors Sky lights where birds liked to make a lot of noise at 5am in morning , location handy Clean and food good 
158086,Georgian House Hotel, Just for being supercritical moving from apartment to main building for breakfast, Good apartment for travelling with family or group Outstanding location if you need to be around Victoria Station
158087,Georgian House Hotel, Not a single complaint not a single fault, Staff are very polite professional and courteous The room was beautifully designed clean luxurious and the bed was so comfortable The breakfast was very impressive with selection and quality Amazing value for money Will have to Highly recommend 
158088,Georgian House Hotel, I didn t like that you can t order room service rang staff at the desk no answer I rang about 3 times Checked out early because it felt like even when the windows were closed there was cold air coming through Also night staff didn t seem bothered why we left early Also I had to go downstairs twice to get water there should be water in our room, I liked the location and the price
158089,Georgian House Hotel, Our first room was very small there was no room for suitcases The beds were very comfortable The kindly switched us to a bigger room the next day and while we were greatly appreciate of more space the beds were not comfortable , The hotel itself is charming and inviting The staff is friendly 
158090,Georgian House Hotel, Dirty bedsheets They were not cleaned as i found a piece of sweet and hair all over the bed Very noisy walls are so thin that i can hear peoples steps toilet etc Super small toilet with very bad water pressure , Good location
158091,Georgian House Hotel, Definitely not 5 quality Maybe it was just our room but then charge 3 rates for the smaller noisier room Would have expected a room like this in a TravelLodge Very noisy with our room right next to the stairs to the breakfast room and a public toilet right outside our door Not ideal ,No Positive
158092,Georgian House Hotel, The room I was in was in a second building set a street behind the main building this should have been made clear at point of booking the room was then up 3 flights of very steep stairs which were difficult to negotiate with luggage in the morning when leaving , The overall quality was brilliant the staff were friendly and accommodating and the room was clean and well presented 
158093,Georgian House Hotel, Nothing, The location of the hotel was great just a 5 minute walk from Victoria The hotel itself was lovely with rooms in three different buildings les than a few minutes away The room wa lovely decent size with great amenities including eye shades ear plugs and white company toiletries The continental breakfast was delicious with locally sourced produce
158094,Georgian House Hotel, Room temperature challenge to keeped stable Most open and close window , Great location very friendly service Great bathroom amenities The White Company received a welcome drink voucher has we booked via booking com 
158095,Georgian House Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is located within a walking distance from Victoria station It also takes 15 20 min by public transport to get almost anywhere in the city centre The district is charming lots of small restaurants around no problem with that The hotel itself is cosy rooms are small but clean and nice The self service breakfast is very fair Apart from it you may have a full English breakfast a porridge or a good granola for 5 extra pounds The only drawback is probably the long narrow staircase if you stay on the top floor there s no lift That apart the hotel provides good value for money I would definitely choose it again if I need a place in the centre for 2 3 days 
158096,Georgian House Hotel, Personally I thought it was a little too far out of the main areas I wanted to go Soho Picadilly etc but other than that I dont have any complaints theres a tube station just a few streets up , Staff were brilliant very friendly calming and a good laugh Food for breakfast was a continental buffet and it was really delicious and the dining area is very relaxing Room was one of the bigger ones that I ve been in in London and bed was very comfortable and room was quiet 
158097,Georgian House Hotel, I had to wait 20 minutes in reception before I could check in as nobody was at the desk which was disappointing There wasn t any water in the room despite reception telling me there would be , Breakfast and staff in the morning were great 
158098,Georgian House Hotel, The only thing I didn t like about this hotel was the size of our family room It was expensive but we d decided to treat ourselves for our daughter s birthday Unfortunately it was just a bit tight for the four of us We had two double beds and not much space for anything else The bathroom was a tiny closet in the corner I didn t bother with a shower as it was just too claustrophobic for me , The breakfast is top notch A really lovely quirky restaurant with lovely meats and cheeses and beautiful croissants served with the continental breakfast And lovely staff Also the cleaner was kind enough to let us have a peek at the wizard s chamber and it looks amazing I really like the bookcase door and how it is all done My children loved it I also appreciated the upfront communication from the hotel with directions invitations to drop off luggage etc It was really helpful being able to leave luggage at the hotel And when we checked in later it was already upstairs in our room Really nice touch The reception staff were very helpful even trying to flag us a taxi The location is also fantastic We walked everywhere we needed to on the first day 
158099,Georgian House Hotel, The many stairs to climb But they were good excercise , The rooms were great nice beds and quiet Great breakfast lovely croissants friendly and helpful staff Good location
158100,Georgian House Hotel,No Negative, Decor of the room really beautiful Wonderful breakfast Toiletries with elegant fragance Maybe the lighting could be improved with a lamp on the table to make ambiance cosier
158101,Georgian House Hotel, I was in a separate building from the main hotel, Great location and friendly hotel including free breakfast so no need to pay the earth for a bowl of cereal
158102,Georgian House Hotel, A lot of stairs to climb to rooms however its understandable that theres no lift due to the age of the building, The handy phone is a nice touch a complete guide to what london has to offer and complimentary calls and internet for if you get stuck out and about a great touch if youve never been to london before the room was very modern quirky and comfortable and the hotel had a lot of character i will be booking here again on my next trip to london
158103,Georgian House Hotel, The walls were paper thin We were disturbed by phones being plugged in TV and people talking We shouldn t have heard any of that And certainly not into the small hours of the morning when we had a breakfast meeting at 8 a , The room was nice 
158104,Georgian House Hotel, Staying in another location than i thought I booked ie bower house Around the corner More like a b and b than hotel Tiny space A tidy double bed a tiny bathroom ,No Positive
158105,Georgian House Hotel,No Negative, Comfy beds clean quiet location for central London Breakfast was gorgeous Staff were helpful The bathroom was very small and felt like a cupboard but did everything a bathroom needs to do Would go again 
158106,Georgian House Hotel,No Negative, Comfy bed quiet very clean not to stuffy Period features Excellent breakfast til 10 30am Stored luggage use of bathroom to freshen up change in after check out Great location 
158107,Georgian House Hotel,No Negative, My single room was extremely small and very hot even with the window open in February Otherwise a good clean hotel very friendly sraff good bufet breakfast and good location in walking distance to Voctoria bus and train stations 
158108,Georgian House Hotel, The Toilet was broke didnt flush and we had a constant sound of running water I suffered it for a few hours Nevertheless it was dealt with immediately as soon as I alerted the reception staff so I was happy , Smart yet quirky Sophisticated yet not overwhelming There are quite a lot of stairs so a little bit of creativity with extra training I loved the character of the building and especially the original features that have been kept and still remain in the rooms The staff where friendly and helpful yet not over powering A good all rounder and good value for money 
158109,Georgian House Hotel, It was our second stay at Georgian House and it has been kind of a disappointing experience for a series of reasons 1 At our arrival the heating in our room was off and not working at the beginning of February The room was obviously cold and the only tool available to heat it was an electric heater No possibility to move to another room Not exactly the kind of welcome you wish to receive Luckily the heating was fixed the day after 2 There are many fancy beauty products in the bathroom but no bottle of water nor glasses When we asked the receptionist if she could bring us some water she said that she could not come upstairs We specified that we were already in bed wearing our pajama and our room was on the 6th floor but she maintained that if we wanted water we would have to go down six floors to the reception Not the answer you expect when you find yourself in a cold room without heating after a long trip 3 At arrival the receptionist asked us to pay the whole amount of the stay We specified that we needed an invoice for the first night only and she said that it was not a problem suggesting us to ask for the invoice at check out On the day of check out other receptionists told us that it was not possible to have an invoice for the first night only since we paid the whole amount in one time We were really surprised because at arrival we had been very clear about what we needed However after some discussions we obtained our invoice 4 Even if the d co in the public space is very nice and the House is furnished in good taste managers should take better care of the hotel There are some holes in the sofa cover located the hall and the armchair in our room had some spots and a broken foot , Location quality of the beauty products in the bathroom comfort of the bed breakfast cleanliness good taste of the furniture 
158110,Georgian House Hotel, Fire doors jammed room doors jammed I could not sit at the toilet as my knees were impeded by thick heavy towels So poorly designed Tacky decor in a period room No lifts , Breakfast was lovely Very helpful breakfast staff Staff helped me with luggage 
158111,Georgian House Hotel, Noisy staff shouting from kitchen area Tiny bathroom not enough room to sit on toilet due to proximity of shower cubicle Given worst room as booked through booking com Won t be staying here again Awful , Checking out
158112,Georgian House Hotel, Photos on the site are not true I booked a classic single room This room has a bath n the photo And the site indicated the area of the room is 14 m2 In fact there isn t a bath and the area of my room was not more than 8m2 I do not see the difference between this room and a cheaper small single room As for me it s not fair Very nice staff They are great But I faced here with such unpleasantness ,No Positive
158113,Georgian House Hotel,No Negative, Breakfast was excellent many many great food choices The housekeeping department couldn t be nicer and the front desk answered every question with a smile 
158114,Georgian House Hotel, The bed while comfortable was very squeaky and we were in the second building which was in a different road which we weren t aware of when booked, The little touches in the room the nespresso the lovely bathroom products and the turn down service The breakfast was also delicious
158115,Georgian House Hotel, There were a lot of stairs up to our room The wi fi signal was poor , Continental breakfast was all very good quality Bed was comfortable Staff were all very nice helpful 
158116,Georgian House Hotel, We did ask for double bed but got two singles attached together which I personally hate , Great value for money excellent location clean with friendly staff 
158117,Georgian House Hotel, FOUR flights of stairs we had to climb to our room No lift The room was freezing The bed was two beds pushed together One of the beds was higher tham the other making it all quite uncomfortable The room also wasn t very sound proofed either as i was awoken by the cleaners every morning Don t know how they claimed to be a 5star hotel, Buffet breakfast was very nice Staff were friendly Room was clean 
158118,Georgian House Hotel, Sound carries easily through the walls but this is a minor complaint There were very few times with high traffic The service and amenities made up for it , After a delay checking in everything else was great The room was so cute and fairly spacious except for the bathroom It s in a great area with only a short walk to Victoria Station It was the perfect stay for our London experience Breakfast was a nice touch but the room got crowded fast The great thing was how long the breakfast was available 
158119,Georgian House Hotel, Everything about he hotel was good EXCEPT that there was I got water I did NOT enjoy having to have a cold shower , Everything about he hotel was good EXCEPT that there was I got water I did NOT enjoy having to have a cold shower 
158120,Georgian House Hotel, Separate buildings so reception wasn t close by Basement room with no lift facilities , Extremely comfortable room with every little thing thought about Great location 
158121,Georgian House Hotel, Far too hot I wasn t able to control the room of the temp and the movable aircon unit was far too loud to have on at night , I liked the room very individual with a very comfy bed Nice coffee machine and biscuits too 
158122,Georgian House Hotel, The walls were quite thin so could hear the noisy family next door quite clearly Breakfast started being served at 7 30 so due to an early morning meeting had to miss it , The staff were excellent and the room was clean and tidy 
158123,Georgian House Hotel, I was accommodated in the separate building and had to cross several crossroads to reach it Furthermore there were no lift and I had to climb to the top floor with my suitcase Credit card terminal at the reception desk didn t work and I had to spend extra time to finally pay the hotel bill , Wonderful breakfast
158124,Georgian House Hotel, We weren t informed that we would be in a different location to the main building and the breakfast we had just paid for was therefore 10 minutes walk away Not a problem if we had known that Because we were in a different building the pictures of the rooms were nothing like those on the website which are of the main building The sister location isn t that far away but the standard of accommodation is far below that of the main building including though not limited to single pane sash windows which needed a piece of 4x4 to stay open heating on full blast and no fan We were also not informed that we would be in a different location when we booked in and paid for a breakfast When we called reception to complain we were told that we had not specified any special requirements in our booking However after a discussion they managed to find a room for us in the main building , Once we had moved rooms we were pleasantly surprised at the standard of the accommodation The breakfast is lovely though a full English is extra Location is great 
158125,Georgian House Hotel, Bathroom made for lover not for amical people due to lake of door and intimacy, Good breakfast mobile phone available to use for our visits free of charges
158126,Georgian House Hotel, The mattress and pillows were very hard which made sleeping difficult , The staff were really friendly It is tastefully decorated and very clean The breakfast was very good The hotel is quiet and in a pleasant area 
158127,Georgian House Hotel, You could hear people s conversations in adjoining rooms We were woken at 6 by someone in the room above using the toilet The hotel said breakfast was included but this meant tea and toast you had to pay extra for cooked items even though a poor cramped room cost 130 pounds , It was very central 
158128,Georgian House Hotel, Hotel was very noisy which meant I had trouble sleeping people and staff outside very disruptive Room was very small , Bed was very comfy Staff very friendly and polite 
158129,Georgian House Hotel, Would of been nice to have a small bar fridge in the room, Loved the location such easy access to everything The room was larger than we were expecting for being in London was a wonderful surprise Breakfast was lovely the staff very friendly helpful Will definitely stay here again
158130,Georgian House Hotel, The bathrooms are really small and the breakfast room way too hot , This was our second time we stayed in this hotel and this time we used one of the apartments It was as good as our previous stay The rooms are clean the area is quiet the location is perfect and the size of the apartment was perfect for our group of four 
158131,Georgian House Hotel, There was no hair dryer Very limited seats during breakfast , Room was lovely bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows and cushions Staff was helpful and I had a room that was quiet 
158132,Georgian House Hotel, The bathroom was very tiny The shower was great but the bathroom had no room at all to move around in and felt very claustrophobic The room was well equipped and had a great TV although the TV was on the side wall rather than opposite wall to the bed Which made it difficult to watch while in bed To us it would have been much more convenient and made more sense if the tv was opposite the bed , The hotel is situated in very close proximity to Victoria train and tube station which makes travel around central London very quick and easy As it is so closely situated if you fancy walking to close attractions like Buckingham palace or Hyde park this is also possible only taking 20 30 mins The hotel although very close to the business of central London is located on a quiet and pleasant street The continental breakfast is delicious and the breakfast room is lovely The bedroom was a good size and I liked the decor in the bedroom also 
158133,Georgian House Hotel, So that we didn t have to get fresh towels everyday for environmental reasons it would have been handy to have hooks in the bathroom Likewise fresh water could have been provided with the coffee tea facilities , The staff were friendly and helpful The breakfast was excellent and the rooms comfortable and well appointed even though our suite was in the other house separate to the main hotel restaurant Excellent location near to Victoria station 
158134,Georgian House Hotel, Our room on the top floor which was up 8 flights of steep stairs , The location and the clean contemporary feel of the hotel are the best points of this hotel 
158135,Georgian House Hotel, Noisy street vehicles so didn t get much sleep , Quality of the room decoration large comfortable bed good en suite excellent amenities in the room coffee machine iron etc 
158136,Georgian House Hotel, There was no where in the room which stated receptions telephone number so at 1am I had to go down to reception which wasn t great The room was at the front of the building around 5am 6am when the traffic started building we were woken up many times as there wasn t much sound protection , Great location Helpful staff Good sized room Breakfast was lovely 
158137,Georgian House Hotel, If possible the handbasin in the bathroom could be a little bigger, The room although tiny was cosy comfortable well equiped and the bed excellent Breakfast is very good and the crew alert and kind
158138,Georgian House Hotel,No Negative, This was a very pleasant one night stay The beds were comfortable and we had a good nights sleep The window opened the breakfasts were excellent If you are fit this is a great hotel Although there are ground floor rooms there is a steep staircase down to the breakfast room The staff were amazing always helpful and pleasant 
158139,Georgian House Hotel, Being a listed building there is no lift and a lot of steep narrow stairs Breakfast very basic Graded 4 but we felt more like 3 , Lovely old building Clean and comfortable Friendly staff
158140,Georgian House Hotel, The en suite bathroom was well decorated but the door was constructed with lattice type doors They did not have any frosted or opaque glazing therefore the occupant of the shower room was fully visible from the bedroom OK for some people but not acceptable for anyone who doesn t want to see someone sitting on the toilet , The bedroom was a good size and well decorated The bed was very comfortable The complementary breakfast was more than adequate and the cost of an upgrade to full cooked breakfast for only 5 was exceptional value 
158141,Georgian House Hotel, No lift and I had my foot in a cast which meant they had to switch my room very quickly from 3rd floor to ground floor but the staff were very good The room was a bit small for 2 people , very clean lovely staff excellent breakfast
158142,Georgian House Hotel, you hear everything from your roomneighbours TV toilet shower doors small room, Friendly staff good breakfast nice clean room bathroom about 5min walk to Victoria Station
158143,Georgian House Hotel, The bed was a tad short for my husband , Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful Our flight came in early in the morning and they had facilities for us to freshen up and store bags until our room was ready Area was beautiful and very close to the Victoria trainand coach stations 
158144,Georgian House Hotel, Room was too small and not really a room at all Even bathroom too small No room in shower for free movement Not suitable for elderly or immobile people as stairs too steep for room and breakfast access , Breakfast
158145,Georgian House Hotel, Being woken up early by what sounded like someone cleaning the small toilet next to my room no 14 but that would be the only thing it wasn t really enough to complain about , The receptionists were very friendly helpful The decor was stunning loved the uniqueness of the rooms Breakfast was delicious presented beautifully great choice 
158146,Georgian House Hotel, The wifi reception throughout the building was a 1 out of 5 There were constant excuses and reasons offered by staff but it seemed to be a chronic ongoing situation We took to using the local pub and the library for our wifi needs , Everything was acceptable excluding the wifi reception walkable to bus and train and most other Westminister sites 
158147,Georgian House Hotel, There wasn t a thing I would change , The hotel is an amazing gem off the beaten track in London no mean feat and the perfect place for a surprise anniversary trip with my fiancee The staff we excellent and fulfilled my extra requests The breakfast is well deserving of the awards it has won and we will definitely be revisting this amazing hotel 
158148,Georgian House Hotel, Unfortunately I could not fully shut the windows so it was a little noisy I would have liked to see ear plugs in the rooms or at reception as an option as I realise this is a very old building and there is only so much you can do , The room was very comfortable and the staff very helpful 
158149,Georgian House Hotel, We had a room in the basement which felt stuffy in the morning when four of us were there and in the basement there was little natural light but this did not affect our opinion of the hotel which was lovely and would go back but to an upper level room if possible , The staff were very friendly and helpful The breakfast was lovely 
158150,Georgian House Hotel, Only one negative Poor sound insulation between rooms due to old building Particularly noise due to footfall noise in room above which woke us up morning and night , Lovely decorated and clean rooms nice modern bathroom good breakfast excellent location with short walk to Victoria great staff reasonable value considering location 
158151,Georgian House Hotel, We were told that driver ordered by hotel to take us to the airport would take a credit card He could not and we were not prepared to pay in pounds Ended up using American dollars and paid more than what was quoted Bummer, Room was large and very comfortable Lots of amenities very clean Helpful staff would recommend 
158152,Georgian House Hotel, For people who are allergic to perfumes please do not use highly perfumed bathroom products as it can bring on an allergic reaction Had to remove soap and shampoos body wash products out from the room En suite a little cramped , Great breakfast offered
158153,Georgian House Hotel, Be warned there is no elevator I did not mind at all since it was great exercise staying on the top floor and climbing four flights of stairs but for those with limited mobility it would be a problem , Beautiful small historic hotel that is beautifully decorated with character and charm in central London Continental breakfast was included and was great with a good selection of breads fruit cereals and homemade jams Only stayed one night but would definitely return and highly recommend 
158154,Georgian House Hotel, Our bathroom was very tiny and tight The sink was so small I could barely shave using it But it was very nicely done I ll give it that , Loved the central location the historic quality good breakfast and great staff

158157,Georgian House Hotel, I didn t book this room and while it was nice and roomy it was a block away from the hotel which meant a walk in the rain for breakfast Also having to drag sour bags to reception to book out , We were accommodated in the 2 bedroom annex which was in a residential street and very quiet Lots of room for bags The hotel building had been renovated staff were friendly and breakfast was good 
158158,Georgian House Hotel,No Negative, The interior design really made this somewhere special to stay it is rare in London to get such homely surroundings All the staff from reception to porter to waiters and waitresses were so friendly and made you feel very welcome they seemed really happy to be working there which reflects in their service to guests Really happy to recommend this hotel to you 
158159,Georgian House Hotel, Bed was so uncomfortable and loud We both had sore backs after staying here and sought out a massage place nearby Every time one of us moved on the bed the frame would make a loud noise and wake us both up There was also no lift so walking up and down the stairs especially down the stairs with luggage on the final day was annoying Wifi was slow in ghe room , Great location convenient for sightseeing Staff very friendly and helpful Nice breakfast options with either the continental buffet or upgrade to things like eggs benidict etc 
158160,Georgian House Hotel, No elevator but the staff were quick to help with luggage , Very nice and cozy hotel Friendly staff clean rooms and nice breakfast Strongly recommend

158164,Georgian House Hotel, Checked in at address then taken to another building in another street No bed side surface to keep a cuppa specs mobile and kettle was too big to be filled up in the hand sink so had to use a mug and drenched everywhere Will be contacting the hotel soon , The coffee machine in our room the bathroom toiletries and the decor The jams at breakfast esp the morello cherry

158167,Georgian House Hotel, Only down side was will being on the top floor the amount of stairs we had to climb , Lovely hotel in an excellent location Will be booking again when we visit again next year 
158168,Georgian House Hotel, The number of flights of stairs No lift No help lifting luggage up to the room I hurt my back doing this I was expecting a lift, Comfortable bed Nice breakfast room
158169,Georgian House Hotel, cooked breakfast could have been included in the price although the continental breakfast that is included was excellent , the room was decorated beautifully and there were lots of luxurious little touches like the nespresso machine and the white stuff toiletries 
158170,Georgian House Hotel,No Negative, Very nice staff and an excellent location within walking distance to some of the most important sights in central London for people who love walking 
158171,Georgian House Hotel, No shower in room only a bath didn t have a record of my booking so it was fortunate that they had space for me I stayed in room B1 is on the ground floor near the front door which had noisy people traffic from 5am until 11 30pm They need a decent thick carpet and thick well fitted door to soak up the noise as I was consistently disturbed while trying to sleep , Decor was excellent and the breakfast was fantastic 
158172,Georgian House Hotel,No Negative, Staff s service was excellent and they are friendly Our room was at the upper floor without a lift but we could stay quiet comfortably The room was also clean We will use this hotel again for next London trip 
158173,Georgian House Hotel, This is my first time writing a comment on a hotel Unfortunately I have been very disappointed of the property The room was so small that I was hardly able to turn the tiny table was taken up by a kettle already and in addition it was extremely noisy and you hear every person walking on the stairs Poor value for money ,No Positive
158174,Georgian House Hotel, The apartment scenario we weren t advised we had an apartment away from the hotel this caused problems for our disabled son , Breakfast was very good and the breakfast staff were very hospitable and service orientated 
158175,Georgian House Hotel, The water wasn t very warm for a shower early in the morning, The day time receptionist was extra helpful looking up train times without us asking him to 
158176,Georgian House Hotel, Toilet area was small bathroom area in general was tight Not much of a problem for us but if you are a big person you may not fit , Location was convenient to Victoria station within a quiet neighborhood No AC and I am a light sleeper so surprised at how well I slept With windows open it was cool enough with a light breeze There were 3 of us so we were upgraded to an apartment which was around the corner very nice with small kitchen area and 2 separate sleeping areas Staff here excellent in providing helpful information about the area and genuinely friendly Felt very safe in this neighborhood 
158177,Georgian House Hotel, First impression checking in at Reception casual dress of staff T shirts etc Climbing to 4th floor room , Comfy bed Excellent continental breakfast and morning staff Nice airy small room Central London and South Bank walkable without Tube 
158178,Georgian House Hotel, As a solo female traveller I did not feel safe at the Georgian House Hotel When I booked I wasn t aware that they have multiple properties On check in I was informed by the very friendly reception desk that my room was located in building number 2 and that someone also a really nice guy would show me to my room what I didn t realise was that building number 2 was a couple of streets away from the main house There was a tablet with Skype set up in each room so that you could contact reception however the table in my room wasn t working The guy said he would call me and that would activate it the tablet never activated so I had no way of contacting reception Wifi also wasn t working in the room You used your room key to get in the front door that was the only security The room was fine in general it was functional and suitable for the overnight stop while on business however the nearest restaurant shop was about 5 10 minutes walk away The next morning I had to walk around to the main house for breakfast walk back around to the building I was in to get my bags and then back to the main house again to check out not ideal when tight on time Perhaps I was more aware of security and safety because I was a solo female traveller but I did feel I should have it made aware before booking and that there should have been a phone in the room since the guy mention the Skype was temperamental , The staff were excellent really friendly at the Georgian Hotel Hotel Rooms were clean 
158179,Georgian House Hotel, Minor critisims were pillows too big and just not right and although the cooked breakfast was great quality the homemade beans were just not enjoyable at all although we apreciated the concept of trying to make the breakfast better than a standard greasy cafe type, bed very very comfy room very clean all the time with regular cleaner shower amazing and staff very helpful continental breakfast excellent tv great aswell
158180,Georgian House Hotel, Continental breakfast very poor Room basement level very warm and clamy with no air even with window fully open just very uncomfortable , Bed very comfortable Staff pleasent 
158181,Georgian House Hotel, Make sure you ask for a room on a lower floor as there are no elevators They were able to accommodate us by changing our room however , The staff were helpful The room and housekeeping was great as was the location I would highly recommend this place Then continental breakfast was very good 
158182,Georgian House Hotel, Put more sealing around the door to block out noise as you can hear people coming and going and the front door is loud , I loved the attention to detail the White Company shampoo conditioner the lip balm water bottles stunning decorations excellent room service 
158183,Georgian House Hotel, Did not like a bath in the room as showering was completely impossible without flooding the floor Toilet was shut away in what I can only describe as a cupboard , Location was good 
158184,Georgian House Hotel, Its shambels absolutely shocking in the name of 5 Star Other rooms might be better but this was horrendous , nothing basement and terrible smell DISGRACE in the name of 5 STAR
158185,Georgian House Hotel, There wasn t anything Only thing i would say is that it took a little while to find our room as the fire door to our corridor was not numbered , We had a standard twin which was small but clean and nice fine for 1 night stay Had to look for the bathroom which is hidden behind cupboard doors but we thought it was a quirky idea Unfortunately i am unable to add photos to show you Staff were very friendly and helpful Would love to see the wizard enchanted rooms The biggest croissant i have ever had 
158186,Georgian House Hotel, The sink in our room was tiny Could not wash my face or hands properly Very very small bathroom , loved the wallpaper in our room and in the reception area The breakfast room down stairs was lovely Great location and helpfull staff 
158187,Georgian House Hotel,No Negative, Location was amazing Staff friendly and helpful Beds were incredibly comfortable and suites were spotless Breakfast was excellent as well Good value overall
158188,Georgian House Hotel, Front desk staff Clutter in hallways Fire exit blocked by storage and in out materials , Good hotel Clean Fair price Comfortable A solid 4 hotel Facilities are fair by which I mean good and perfectly acceptable But this is not 5 and it is not especially standing out as a memorable or boutique experience Best part was breakfast which was an impressive continental cold spread with room to upgrade pay for cooked breakfast That was very good indeed And great location Perhaps my problem was expectation management photos are especially grand but hotel has nice rooms in an otherwise straightforward terraced house in Pimlico Breakfast staff very good Front desk staff weak and more self involved than customer focused If you stay there you will be perfectly fine Just don t invest a lot of expectations in the hotel itself 
158189,Georgian House Hotel, Concierge did not offer to carry single ladies bag strange , Nice hotel cosy but well kept and quiet rooms All staff were really friendly and mostly outgoing 
158190,Georgian House Hotel, put us on 4th floor no lift Biggest issue was that this floor was used by a family who ran up and down corridors shouting and screaming from 6am onwards I told staff and they just said sorry to hear that ,No Positive
158191,Georgian House Hotel, I was in room 1 and it was very noisy in the morning as it was beside the entrance to the breakfast room, The breakfast was in a really quaint room and very good quality I highly recommend upgrading to the full breakfast yum 
158192,Georgian House Hotel, I was located in another part of the hotel 2 streets away The complimetary bottle of wine was appreciated though , Helpful and genuinely friendly staff including in the dining room 
158193,Georgian House Hotel, The bed was the most uncomfortable thing we d ever slept in and we were opposite a construction site so was woken up very early every morning Most staff members were very polite and helpful however there was one who was insanely rude and disrespectful to my partner due to his visible tattoos on his arm We asked for a recommendation to a nice restaurant before our trip to the theatre and after recommending a fantastic Italian she eyeballed him top to bottom and said how the restaurant was a very posh and she recommended that nandos was around the corner Whilst this could be misconstrued as funny I thought it was extremely rude and unprofessional , The location was quite good We were in walking distance of everything we wanted and everywhere we wanted to visit
158194,Georgian House Hotel, Tiny bathroom fumes from pipes comin into room no light beside single bed rude reception staff broken hairdryer and problem with tv Very expensive for what it is , Breakfast was fine and bathroom was clean
158195,Georgian House Hotel, I do not have something very importamt to tell but at my first stay they were doing scrambled egg for free when you buy continental breakfast They charge it now It would have been very good not to change it It would be also good to have chicken or turkey salami as an option alongside pork option , It is my second time there Rooms are perfect kovely and comfortable Location is great It is very close to Victoria and quite at the same time Great stay snd definitely will go again 
158196,Georgian House Hotel,No Negative, Staff were excellent very friendly and helpful We stayed in the apartment which was a good size and had all mod cons The location to rail bus and sights was excellent
158197,Georgian House Hotel, Size of room The bed was so small put at the corner of the wall This is not a 5 star hotel as it mentioned The breakfast was poor , The room is super small no lift My feeling in the room was very bad feel like trapped in a hole 
158198,Georgian House Hotel, The shower was the smallest I have ever been in and the washroom in general was very poor but this is the only thing I didn t like about our apartment , location was perfect for sight seeing Staff were friendly and helpful 
158199,Georgian House Hotel, No number on room door Difficult to find apartments late at night Shower pretty useless Pillows terrible and no air con Couldn t provide us with bottled water , Location Staff greeting White Company toiletries always nice Overall good standard of cleanliness 
158200,Georgian House Hotel, Only adverse comment would be that the staircase was a bit run down , Continental breakfast was excellent Room and onsuite was well maintained and clean 
158201,Georgian House Hotel, one of our rooms only had a high claw foot bath in the middle of the room lovely but not appropriate for a 79 yo, I would recommend this hotel to my friends Quiet room friendly staff Funky modern dining room nice continental breakfast close to great eating strips and transport options 
158202,Georgian House Hotel, Only down side did get woken up at 5am with the banging of a kitchen door which went on continously Would book again but would want to stay in a different room because of this, Excellent breakfast good choice friendly staff Toiletries in room lovely Room very comfortable 
158203,Georgian House Hotel, I couldn t check in early because I had to go to a show at 12 o clock So in the end I checked in at 11 o clock at night , Breakfast was really tasty The decor in the room was elegant Staff were very helpful Thank you
158204,Georgian House Hotel, We were placed in the Cambridge St annex on the top floor which was fine since we re young but lots of narrow stairs to climb and was around the corner from the main building , Continental breakfast was great A fair sized selection for the buffet and for a few extra pounds there were additional breakfasts to choose from Room was very clean and tidy given lots of toiletries including a sleep kit with ear plugs and eye mask 
158205,Georgian House Hotel, Not sure The two locations of the hotel were ok as weather was fine in wet weather could be difficult to get to breakfast and reception Overall happy with hotel and would go there again I had two different stays this time , As I have coeliac disease a gluten free diet is essential I was provided with gf bread and gf cereal Also soy milk as I am lactose intolerant Staff at breakfast helpful and very pleasant 
158206,Georgian House Hotel, No safety catches on up sliding windows slight worry with young children Steep stairs but had been made aware when booking Very trivial but no lock on en suite door , Very clean and tidy well maintained Modern decor Very friendly staff extremely welcoming very informative and always willing to offer assistance if required 
158207,Georgian House Hotel, The room was quite stuffy although a fan was provided There is no bar and the lighting was useless for applying makeup , The room had lots of wow factor plus great tolietries robes and huge TV Staff were really friendly
158208,Georgian House Hotel, double bed is small due to the size of the rooms, beautifully decorated pleasant atmosphere high quality toiletries excellent continental breakfast location very close to Victoria station
158209,Georgian House Hotel, Humidity meant a small single room on upper floor was very hot even with window open , Staff were exceptionally helpful and accommodated an early check in
158210,Georgian House Hotel, Didn t like being in basement and recent rainstorm left strong smell of damp Foot traffic up and down service steps outside our window was disturbing This room shouldnt be used for guests being so expensive , Beds were very comfy Room was spacious and attractive 
158211,Georgian House Hotel, Our room had a tiny toilet shower with tiny hand basin Too small to shave without spilling water on floor Our friends had a reasonable sized room for a similar price,No Positive
158212,Georgian House Hotel,No Negative, Best night s sleep I have ever had in London Really friendly and helpful staff Continental Breakfast was great Really near Victoria Coach and Rail Stations 
158213,Georgian House Hotel,No Negative, It was the first time I travelled alone and the staff was more than helpful with directions and any other questions I had The room was very comfortable and up to date in style I would definitely come back 
158214,Georgian House Hotel, We were on the top floor I didn t realize I should have asked for a lower floor If you have mobility issues make sure to get a room on a lower level I found the climb to the top with a toddler and very pregnant incredibly hard , The breakfast is out of this world yummy Best eggs benny The decor is really cool and unique The staff are so wonderful and friendly and nothing is too difficult even carrying luggage up the stairs 
158215,Georgian House Hotel, Room very close to reception on ground floor No air conditioning and room was stuffy, Very good choice on the breakfast buffet didn t need to order more food 
158216,Georgian House Hotel,No Negative, I loved the hotel It was in a good location for us as we were down for Trooping the colour The decor throughout was done to the highest standard The rooms were compact but had everything we needed The guys on reception were so helpful and friendly I can t thank them enough Breakfast was scrumptious Will definitely recommend and be back if ever I m in London again 
158217,Georgian House Hotel, We had a family room on the very top floor luckily we are all in good shape but no lift to bring up the luggage the hotel staff were very helpful though I think the lack of elevator should be mentioned as this could prove to be a problem for some travellers , Almost everything very clean I have very high standards stylishly decorated room beautiful LARGE modern bathroom fantastic breakfasts 
158218,Georgian House Hotel, Bed and room were small if my husband had been with me we d have struggled to both fit but I guess this is what you get in London The main issue was the noise I d asked for a room not too far from reception because of a mobility issues and even though there s no bar a bunch of drunk guests arrived back late and sat sitting at each other in the lounge area for ages I could hear neighbouring rooms toilets and showers and staff and guests started going past the room from 5 30am Definitely don t ask to stay somewhere accessible if you d also like sleep , Very sweet hotel clean pretty in a lovely area with great access 
158219,Georgian House Hotel, Nothing, This was a great hotel and what made it extra special was the staff We arrived with our two son and daughter and grandchildren aged 4 and 6 and the staff on reception were brilliant with them one lady immediately occupying them looking for things on maps We were lucky enough to be there for an investiture and the staff did everything they could to help us storing our luggage hat in huge hat box included Allowing us to change back into our ordinary clothes afterwards keeping the luggage again and joining in our fun when the men in the party had the hats on after our return from Buckingham Palace The staff are an absolute credit to the hotel I am sure they regularly meet guests heading for Royal events but this didn t stop them from sharing in our excitement and fun Thank you to all 
158220,Georgian House Hotel, No air conditioning and upper rooms get very warm in summer , Wonderful staff The ladies serving breakfast are lovely and the front desk friendly and helpful 
158221,Georgian House Hotel, It s an old building and a walk up with no lift so being on 3rd or 4th floor can be a hike for some First room was very small on top floor and had a slope so we bumped our head a few times as it was the only area to put our luggage They worked to find us another room comfortable but drafty window Heat worked so not a huge problem Low water pressure in showers , This is a very quaint boutique hotel in a very good section of London Walkable to restaurants Buckingham Palace Hyde Park Most other tourist areas require transport Underground is about a 10 minute brisk walk which is the best way to get around London Authentic d cor Friendly and helpful staff fabulous included breakfast and worth the 5 pound upgrade if you like hot items London is expensive so I think overall price was very fair for the lodging 
158222,Georgian House Hotel, My only comment that is in any way negative is that breakfast is only available after 07 30 I needed to leave earlier than that so I would prefer cooked breakfasts to be available from 06 30 even 07 00 would be acceptable Other than that this is an excellent place to stay for business stop overs , The room was spotless the cleanest of any hotel I have stayed at in London All staff I met were friendly polite and eager to assist When I realised that breakfast was not served early enough on my day of departure they offered immediately to prepare a grab bag of drinks and continental breakfast items This turned out to be fresh croissants muffins fresh fruit etc and was handed over in a sturdy cotton linen tote which will come in handy for other purposes as a bonus Really well thought out and a great attitude to service I will definitely come again when I need an ad hoc stay over in town Excellent 
158223,Georgian House Hotel, The stairs were difficult for me as I have some health issues This I should have said when I made the booking , Continental breakfast good choice we did pay the extra for full English Our room very clean decor restful excellent staff Ideal location for the theatre sight seeing This was my daughter mine first visit to London I know we would stay here again on our next visit 
158224,Georgian House Hotel, We were in the secondary building which is just around the corner Top floor up many flights of stairs slight concern if there was a fire as the fire escape was the front door and all the landing doors which were fire doors were wedged open Could also not stand up straight in about 50 of the room and no drawers for storage , Staff very friendly and helpful breakfast was nice Quiet location
158225,Georgian House Hotel, Better selection of gluten free stuff that was of high quality May be gluten free granola or muesli not just cornflakes Gluten free stuff is so easy to make and get these days , Very relaxing Really friendly staff Beautiful decor and very clean Really quiet location but amazingly close to transport and places of interest Excellent breakfast and breakfast room 
158226,Georgian House Hotel,No Negative, Staff very polite and attentive loft apartment was ideal for three of us overnight and a great recommendation for dining at the caf restaurant in the next street Walkable to lots of shops pubs cafes tube Pimlico and into Westminster 
158227,Georgian House Hotel, The buffet of breakfast space is quite small It s very difficult to move but the quality of breakfast is perfect , Breakfast staffs and good situation 
158228,Georgian House Hotel, Our room was warm and with an open window noisy for sleeping , Staff were very friendly and accommodating They responded quickly and efficiently to our requests Great location with charm and functionality Breakfast was very good and had nice ambiance 
158229,Georgian House Hotel, The breakfast room was supposed to be open after a remodel but it was 2 3 weeks behind The breakfast was in a bag not very good They did comp 5 pounds per day but that hardly covered it Bathroom was microscopic with no shelf space for things a traveler needs to have out , This hotel is actually in several upper middle class Victorian era town houses bought up and divided into hotel rooms Rooms are in buildings that are not necessarily contiguous Desk staff was accommodating and helpful Super convenient location Five min walk to Victoria train and tube stations Bed was very comfortable Location was quiet which for a city like London is important Good restaurants a short walk away Decor was nice and things were clean and in good repair Nothing was shabby or failed to function Our grand kids and their parents were able to stay in the Harry Potter room Expensive but really cool as one turned 10 on the trip 
158230,Georgian House Hotel, The room was rather small and there wasn t a lot of space to store anything especially in the bathroom which was very small , The location of the hotel is very good the staff is extremely friendly and helpful The beds in our room were very comfortable and the continental breakfast we had was really tasty I would stay here again 
158231,Georgian House Hotel, The lack of sound isolation understandable to some extent due to the origins of the building , The friendliness of the staff the cleanness of the room 
158232,Georgian House Hotel, Strictly no to travelers carrying luggage no lifts and miniature bathroom Was given top floor room where 2 windows had no outside street view due to facade Dirty carpet on inital stairs while going upstaris, The room atmosphere queen bed with sofa and reclining chair and well laid out theme Cleanliness in room and bathroom 
158233,Georgian House Hotel, Top floor room a bit compromised on head room to one side but still comfortable lots of stairs to get up to it , Nice breakfast clean comfortable and nicely presented hotel in a convenient location and good value for London
158234,Georgian House Hotel, Breakfast room small for the amount of people Felt very busy and had to wait a while for drinks The food was good standard though , Great location Room was excellent very comfy bed Didn t want to get out of the shower Had a free upgrade which was amazing 
158235,Georgian House Hotel, Access the climb up the stairs was tiring as there are no lifts , The bed was very comfortable with beautiful Egyptian cotton sheets the pillows were plump and soft Cleanliness was outstanding
158236,Georgian House Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly and helpful staff team clean rooms and very good breakfast I really liked our stay and appreciate everything provided Thank you so much
158237,Georgian House Hotel, Being transferred to a modern boutique outpost of the actual Georgian House hotel Horrible colour scheme banker s grey more suited to an industrial setting creaky chrome bed Enthusiastically described to me by the receptionist as more spacious the bathroom is poky enough to be twinned with an airplane s facilities and if you get a thrill from trapping your nipple in the shower s folding doors then this is the place for you , wonderfully quiet well stocked tea and coffee very clean 
158238,Georgian House Hotel, Noise of banging door from opposite room about 3 feet away and the landing door at 5 30 am and 5 am on both mornings of my stay Noise from room above and from work going on in building Room had obviously been updated but carpet was shabby and stained The carpet on the stairs same as in room also very shabby and areas of stairwell scruffy and uninviting , Staff were courteous and helpful 
158239,Georgian House Hotel, loved the breakfast in a bag but really what a lot of plastic packaging It is an old building so expect to hear your neighbours door corridor floorboards in the morning No lift but that didn t bother me , Beautifully redecorated hotel comfy beds new bathroom with nice toiletries Easy to get to from Victoria station 
158240,Georgian House Hotel, Ensuite very small Coffee machine with special coffees not to our taste would have preferred sachets More breakfast tea bags please , Friendly helpful staff Excellent breakfast choice Tasteful decor 
158241,Georgian House Hotel, Not having a proper breakfast is really uncommon for a 4 star hotel A bag on the door with maximum 1 sandwich is not a breakfast As I m young and in a good health climbing the stairs with luggage is not a problem But I can image that elderly people are surprised to see a 6 or 7 floor hotel without an elevator , The room although very small looked pretty nice although I could hear my neighbor next door almost breathing 
158242,Georgian House Hotel, We paid for cooked breakfast but was not informed until arrival that it would be breakfast in a bag in our rooms because the restaurant was closed maybe this was lack of communication with the hotel and this website The breakfast was nice croissant fruit juice and fruit came in a bag for life If we had known we perhaps wouldn t have paid for breakfast and would have eaten out , The room was clean and a good size although the bathroom was a little small The staff were friendly and very helpful Our room was located down the road from the main hotel it was peaceful and easy to get to 
158243,Georgian House Hotel, Everything in the room was tiny bathroom bed table Breakfast room was being renovated so they offered fully packaged breakfast which was very disappointing Not even fresh coffee , Location easy walk to Victoria Staff was friendly 
158244,Georgian House Hotel, the dining room was under renovation we got very basic breakfast to the room this was a little disapoiting since we paid for English buffet breakfast , Everything accept the very basic breakfast was very good espiacily the level of clean and very well decorated The location is also very good nice neighborhood Overall would recommend it 
158245,Georgian House Hotel, A few stains on the furniture chair not adequate to work from , Loved my breakfast in a bag fab ham cheese and pickle sandwich Lovely boutique hotel comfy bed and great pillows 
158246,Georgian House Hotel, No elevator but staff carried our suitcases to our third floor room, Great service location and room Breakfast in a bag delivery while breakfast room was being renovated was a smart and cute alternative
