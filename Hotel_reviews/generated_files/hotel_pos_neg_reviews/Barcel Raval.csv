424812,Barcel Raval, Don t follow the advice of the hotel and book private transfers as they are more expensive than normal taxis There s also a taxi rank right outside the hotel so no point worrying about availability Breakfast was average Any services provided by the hotel at ridiculously expensive 4 50 to wash a pair of underwear seriously breakfast is 15 if not included in your booking Best advice is to not do anything at the hotel that requires paying over and above , The location styling of the property 360 bar is worth the hype 
424813,Barcel Raval, Was on the 10th floor so we had a luxury room but room was next to the staircase to enter the rooftop terrace So it s noisy all night with people coming and going until it closes at 1am So we were very tired, Facilities and care given by staff
424814,Barcel Raval, it was much smaller than the pictures and very dark inside it was quiet nosey as the rooms were not well insulated we could hear the cleaners until 3 4 in afternoon as well as guests passing by very small pool area location was ok but not a very nice area to walk alone, the hotel was modern with beautiful views
424815,Barcel Raval, Tended to be able to everything on the street from the room It did not keep us up but was noticeable Interestingly there is a campaign in that neighborhood for keeping the noise down , Good location if one wanted to be in the middle of the busiest tourist spot in Barcelona La Rambla All sorts of shops and restaurants and people There is a great roof top deck that give you a 360 degree view of the city 
424816,Barcel Raval, I loved the hotel but there wasn t many sun loungers on the roof and the queue for the bar was always long but didn t really bother us , Roof terrace the amazing room the staff everything Would love to come here again
424817,Barcel Raval, The rooftop bar is a wee bit expensive no other downsides , This is the 2nd time we ve stayed here Excellent location friendly staff and the rooftop bar and pool are a godsend on really hot days Looking at booking again for next year 
424818,Barcel Raval, The swimming pool was really really tiny They should do something about it May be expand a little bit more, The rooms were excellent Comfortable bed amazing location panoramic view of Barcelona 
424819,Barcel Raval, The airconditioning system in the room was super noise but given the heat we couldn t turn it off we should have complained at the reception but we didnt the swimming pool advertised is slight bigger than a single bed I would not call it pool let alone swimming pool, Great design great location great stuff decor of the room was very Austin Power but super cute huge bed and great view on the city The terrace up to the top has an amazing view 360 on Barcelona and sunset there is beautiful
424820,Barcel Raval, The hotel were unable to provide a late checkout facility despite liaising with booking com The hotel facilities are very good however which compensated somewhat , Friendly staff Lovely accommodation Hotel decor throughout Rooftop bar 360 degree panoramic views The cocktails Close to La Ramblas
424821,Barcel Raval, The 360 degree view from the roof, The air condition in the room is not working properly I have to change the room The new room was noisy due to the air condition noise
424822,Barcel Raval, The only thing I thought could be improved is the air conditioner in the room The coolest it allows you to go is 19 degrees which was a little to warm for me and my partner , The staff were excellent and helpful They also allowed us to check in 2hrs early 
424823,Barcel Raval, The area outside was a little ghetto smelly we didn t feel safe walking the area backroads at night especially so spent extra money on taxis or buses so we didn t have to walk that particular area , The bed was so comfy staff very helpful hotel itself was fab 
424824,Barcel Raval, Location not ideal but did not impare our stay there is a noisy square below hotel but only early evening Some evidence of street sleepers close by There is no swimming pool at this hotel it is a paddling pool on the roof , Bed exceptionally comfortable Room spacious for city hotel Fantastic view from room and roof bar 
424825,Barcel Raval,No Negative, A modern quirky hotel in a great location just off the Rambla Staff were very welcoming and helpful The buffet breakfast was extensive and generous with something for everyone Room was comfy and wonderful views from the rooftop bar We ll be back again 
424826,Barcel Raval, The toilet in the bar at the top bar was in a mess when we tried to use it later in the evening around 11pm and loud drunk people with no body watching over things breakfast average in the room the toilet door is so heavy to open on the inside it s difficult to open due to such a small hand hold would be nice to open a window but understand it is in the design , The bed was very comfy the view from the top of the hotel was brilliant
424827,Barcel Raval, The rooftop bar is open to non residents which draws many people to it As a hotel guest it was difficult to get a table standing space at times It also means many visitors to the hotel it appeared that they could visit every floor making security a little worrying There was a security man on the main front door but that was all, The hotel is conveniently located A good breakfast Very clean rooms Great comfortable bed
424828,Barcel Raval, We really think that this wasnt meeting our expectations for the price we paid 180 euro per night The room was small and the drawers still had stuff from the guests before us The rooftop bar isnt as amazing as they say it is Its very small We wanted to hang out on the rooftop but it was already super packed with 8 people at the swimmingpool area , We really like the comfort of the bed and the shower was good too And the modern design at the lobby and the staff was friendly 
424829,Barcel Raval, Superior room wasn t different enough to justify price differential some signs of wear in the rooms thought breakfast should be included as standard, Good location comfortable beds good bathrooms quick and efficient front desk 24 hour reception
424830,Barcel Raval,No Negative, I give 5 stars for hotel RECOMEND Excellent hotel original and tasty style with very amazing 360 terracce Rooms are clean breakfast was fresh and normal selection better than we waited Great location near from La Rambla street and popular market Terracce with bar stylish music and very friendly staff Thank you bartender Albert it was really good service with perfect cocktails friendly information about city and very helpful with situations 
424831,Barcel Raval, The Deluxe room was a total scam I booked 3 rooms and they mixed mine Deluxe up with another guy Identical They called it Deluxe Matrimonial but same room different floor 150 per nt extra SCAM,No Positive
424832,Barcel Raval, The roof bar was not always open so difficult to get a drink The hair dryer never worked despite us telling the cleaner The lights were faulty in the room and took two days to sort out The breakfast buffet area was very compact need more spae, The staff were very helpful the bed was super comfortable The location was excellent 
424833,Barcel Raval, Even though we were on the top floor we could still hear the street news The partying pretty much went on until 4am on the Saturday Hotel rather dark in places , We were upgraded to the top floor the rooms was great and the bed huge Great views over the city and the roof top bar is amazing Rather futuristic and probably boutique style which I loved The electronic curtains were fab in the room 
424834,Barcel Raval, Streets directly around hotel until you get to the ramblas full of prostitutes and shady characters , Lovely interiors and rooms Great bar at the roof with 360 views of barcelona Walking distance to ramblas 
424835,Barcel Raval, Photos on the website make it look a lot better than the hotel is The room gets a daily smell treatment that isnt required and overdoes it If you get put on the top floor you will get no sleep as all you hear is the drunks getting to the roof top bar Left after 2 days to stay at another hotel even though we paid a non refundable for 5 days, Staff at the front desk were helpful 
424836,Barcel Raval, Maybe higher floor and would of been nice to have a view of the el raval square, Amazing large comfiest bed ever lovely shower Surprise Cava chocolate covered strawberries for 30th Anniversary made our day Even let us borrow a brolley when it decided to rain Perfect 
424837,Barcel Raval, I couldn t fault anything It was sheer luxury and really helped us relax , We requested a double room The bed was huge and very comfortable Lots of choice of lighting to help relax or read whatever your mood Staff are really helpful and friendly Wish we could have stayed longer 
424838,Barcel Raval, Not the hotels fault but care is needed around Barcelona pick pockets beggars and dog poop, Great location to las ramblas Food was very good too also wifi
424839,Barcel Raval, Advertised as having a pool and jacuzzi but didn t actually have either Reception lounge area closed on the last day of our stay for conferencing so unable to relax in the hotel , Roof top bar and quirky decor 
424840,Barcel Raval, Downstairs seating a little limited, Given an upgrade to a room with a great view of the city Bed very comfortable Las Ramblas a 5 10 minute walk away Only another 5 10 minute walk to the harbour waterfront 
424841,Barcel Raval, Paying extra for breakfast Because when I was booking the hotel i didn t get options for that , Every thing was perfect but didn t like that we had to pay extra for breakfast 
424842,Barcel Raval, Rooms not soundproof Design not always very logical , Comfortable bed Great location to start city exploring Nice personel Great panoramic terrace on 11th floor 
424843,Barcel Raval, Pool was tiny, View from the room was great bed was really big and comfortable Toiletries that were provided even included a new toothbrush everyday and lots of tv channels 
424844,Barcel Raval, The rooftop bar should stay open a little later , The rooftop bar was amazing the bar staff would serve you things that weren t on the menu if they had the correct ingredients and all the cocktails were made superbly but the sangria was the best we tasted whilst in Barcelona 
424845,Barcel Raval,No Negative, The beds were very comfortable and the staff were all excellent The roof top terrace was a big highlight and the breakfast buffet was great Also the hotel was situated right near the street of La Ramblas and was quite central to a lot of places 
424846,Barcel Raval, The breakfast was a slightly limited for a Personal Trainer some avocado would have been a great addition with more options of hot food Everything else was great though , The hotel itself is in a great location if you re looking to be close to La Ramlas but also close to the Gothic Quarter We walked from the port one day which only took us half an hour The rooms were fantastic with an even better view the mesh around the windows make it that little bit better However the rooftop pool bar 360 was INSANE We love our sunrises and sunsets and from there you can see it all whilst sipping a gin and tonic with a DJ playing 
424847,Barcel Raval,No Negative, Great accessible location We took the A2 airport to central La Catalunya bus as we landed in Terminal 2 The bus journey is a non stop service and takes roughly 30 minutes We paid 6 for a single ticket as we were unsure of how we would travel back to the airport at the time The hotel is a 15 minute walk from central La Catalunya La Ramblas is a 10 minute walk away so really ideal You re away from all the noise yet close enough to walk there The hotel Amazing hotel with unique decor Really comfortable rooms providing the necessities such as towels shower gel shampoo conditioner a shower cap and a shaving kit Great for those staying for a short time with only hand luggage Great views from our hotel room as well as from the 360 hotel rooftop bar Easy to access using the hotel lift and just phenomenal views They have a bar which is reasonably priced Definitely worth it to view a sunset The pool is quite small which is why I scored it in the middle We didn t check the pool size and not sure if the dimensions are on their website but we were prepared with our swimming gear in case however they didn t come to use The hotel breakfast This was complimentary in our price and the breakfast was delicious Great coffee machine with teas available too Good selection of fruits breads juices cakes as well as sausages scrambled eggs mushrooms tomatoes and bacon They even have a toastie so you can make your own grilled sandwiches with sliced meats and cheese provided P S We were handled by Irene at reception who was really helpful She gave us the advice we required as well as handy tips and recommendations Thank you Irene 
424848,Barcel Raval, nothing worth mentioning, friendly staff and good facilities location good for walking around Ramblas and other sites slightly down at heel microlocation but minor compared with all other benefits
424849,Barcel Raval, Walking on the surrounding area late at night was scared me on the first few days Because of old dirty and dark narrow streets but it was OK and we try to avoid those streets and not go back to the hotel too late , Everything in the hotel was perfect breakfast was excellent and lots of choices Fresh fruits 
424850,Barcel Raval,No Negative, A modern designed hotel clean and friendly However with some flaws each small but all adding because of the limited size of the rooms the architect opted not for one enclosed bathroom but three separate parts which are also combined with the closet The closet door doubles as the toilet door too Not the most convenient Also the hotel has only 3 elevators for its total 200 rooms and 13 floors causing quite a wait for an elevator to come The room windows are locked preventing open air Small desk not allowing comfortable use 
424851,Barcel Raval, Quite loud at times the location is good and central but quite a scary area at night , Excellent location in that it is short walk from las ramblas clean hotel spacious room
424852,Barcel Raval, Lifts are too small and need to wait for a long time The hotel leaves a note in every room to ask customers help them save water and energy to reuse the towels If we d like to help we need to hang up the towels they didn t say where We did it with only one hook in the bathroom Then the next day the cleaner took away all the hand towels including the clean ones and the wet ones for an unknown reason and just left two bath towels for the whole family Don t really understand the reason why Its inconvenient to call them and constantly ask for more towels , Good size bed and good bathroomshower Roof garden has stunning view Staffs are friendly 
424853,Barcel Raval, The website mentioned that there was a rooftop pool and a jacuzzi the water was too cold for these to be used they should be listed as seasonal and it should be made clear that the jacuzzi is not in the wellness centre but on the rooftop The wellness centre has a great little gym and a nice sauna however when I went to use the sauna it wasn t on So I wasn t able to make use of the sauna jacuzzi or pool all of which were featured why I booked this hotel The area that the hotel is in is good in terms of being a short walk from the main tourist strip and the gothic area harbour and beach However it s a very edgy area and there were lots of prostitutes and other characters around that made it feel risky to walk back late at night I was travelling with my daughter and we ended up coming in early every night as the local area didn t feel safe The room initially didn t have a coffee machine even though this was listed on the site I asked for one which they brought but it didn t work It was frustrating my daughter is coeliac and I am lactose intolerant so having breakfast in the room was necessary as not many cafes can cater for us Lastly on our third day we left the sign on the door asking for our room to be cleaned and went out for 6 hours when we returned it hadn t been cleaned The maids apologised we went out again for another hour or more and still it wasn t cleaned I would expect better service considering I feel this hotel rides on its aesthetics and unfortunately the service and facilities don t live up to it I ve stayed in cheaper places recently where they have been more attentive we have had much more space been in a better area and have had Netflix and YouTube available on the tv as well as all the foreign channels There was nothing at all to watch on the tv and no way of connecting the phone to it as the tv was old , The overall design of the hotel is great the view from the rooftop bar is amazing The staff were welcoming when we arrived the beds and shower in the room were lovely 
424854,Barcel Raval, Room very warm even with air conditioning on , Unusual design The roof top terrace with 360 degrees panoramic views are must Enjoy at night with a cocktail Great bathroom very open plan No cramped bath just a large shower cubicle 
424855,Barcel Raval, The bedroom was very modern but washbasin and mirror impractical Shower dangerous as slippery floor surface The towels were thin and should have been replaced Quiet room though , Beds and pillows very comfy 360 bar was great fantastic views of Barcelona Reception and other areas very trendy 
424856,Barcel Raval, Superior triple room was very small and cramped very little storage area No separate bathroom some things did not work well , Location easy walking distance to many areas
424857,Barcel Raval, Nothing major except that the swimming pool is best described as a plunge pool very small the pictures descriptions give a completely false impression , Breakfasts were very good but a bit expensive The position of the hotel was excellent v close to La Rambla main square and the port with shops restaurants and bars all 5 mins walk 
424858,Barcel Raval, The service it wasn t that good I had a broken glass at night time and I ask someone from reception to send someone to clean and nobody came And the next day when the cleaners came the didn t clean probably because the was still glasses on the floor,No Positive
424859,Barcel Raval, One of the worst places we have ever stayed for sure I have travelled all around the world but this place for sure deserves to be entitled campsite They are under staffed and over loaded You ask for some ice and get charged 5 Euros even for delivering food to your room they charged you 5 They don t change the bedsheets and pillow case assuming that you would not find out They just turn them around and use the same dirty sheets The location of the hotel is awfull where you seriously fear for your life if you want to go out after 8 pm Even taxi drivers refuse to drop you off there Honestly there is no management at all Btw your breakfast was awful and the same Sh every day I will never ever stay at your awful place again and not even recommend your campsite to my enemies For the people from some countries your campsite may look alright but let s face it you are not even close to being fine , Nothing at all 
424860,Barcel Raval, Staff in the ground floor bar were not very attentive Waited 20 minutes to be asked what we would like to drink Had to go and ask at the bar after this time , The bed was very comfy Excellent view from our room 
424861,Barcel Raval, Our room was located on the fifth floor there was a little bit of Street noise, Fantastic hotel great location and just a stones throw away from the main strip Really enjoyed our stay there
424862,Barcel Raval, We were made to wait an hour and a half to check in but were reimbursed for this by the staff , It was a beautiful modern and unique hotel with excellent staff 
424863,Barcel Raval, In the reception area are a row of small coffee tables the stains that appeared on the tables on our first night were still there when we left as I say silly things but also important but overall a good impression The welcome glass of Cava was a lovely touch , The bed was the most comfortable ever The view was of a busy city lovely to just sit and watch clean towels clean bed Very quirky lounge lovely views from the roof terrace I think the breakfast arrangement needs a little tweeking silly things like where do you lay your plate when you want to fill it Silly little things that would make a big difference Was not too happy with dinner menu and I think expensive 
424864,Barcel Raval, Slow service from the barman really slow A little dark in some parts of the hotel eg stairs down to the basement toilet from reception had to hold onto the handrail , We were given a free upgrade to a junior suite which was great The bed was fantastic and great views across the city Fantastic location and staff very helpful Restaurant manager was great we arrived a little late and the restaurant was not taking any further bookings but he squeezed us in which was very welcome given that it was late and torrential rain outside The rooftop terrace bar is lovely We were given a restaurant recommendation by reception which was fab 
424865,Barcel Raval, I wasn t a huge fan of the location of the hotel Whilst we did not experience any issues I didn t feel very comfortable walking around in the evening near the hotel , The hotel was very nice and the rooms very modern The rooftop bar was also a bonus 
424866,Barcel Raval, Noisy in the evenings from outside we were on the third floor to the rear of the building Room cleaning very slow to happen twice we arrived back at the room around 4 30pm and it hadn t been done , Food and staff were brilliant 
424867,Barcel Raval, If the pool was heated would have been wonderful but I hadn t expected that, Great decor panoramic view deck was amazing gym was a nice extra though not completely fully equipped
424868,Barcel Raval, Leisure facilities could be better for a 4 star hotel Rooms are a little small and everything seems on top of you , The Hotel is very clean and tidy but the area it is located is a bit scruffy The pool on the top floor is very small and although there is a great view from the top of the hotel I think the hotel is using this to over sell itself 
424869,Barcel Raval, The lighting within the room, The bed was amazing absolutely huge the veiw was stunning and the staff were very friendly and helpful The location was superb Only downside is how dark the lighting is and the extra keen housekeepers who wouldnt stop knocking even with the sign up 
424870,Barcel Raval, Didn t like the lay out of the room Bathroom arrangement was poor with little privacy No bath Toilet was in a cupboard with a heavy sliding door The sink was divided from the bedroom with a suspended mirror and on the same shelf as the coffee machine so toiletries mixed up with drinks facilities No kettle the coffee machine didn t get the water hot enough for tea No wardrobe , The bed was comfortable The shower was great 
424871,Barcel Raval, Surrounding neighborhood isn t so great however police is around day and night , Great location walking distance from most attractions friendly staff clean and comfortable 
424872,Barcel Raval, the stuff was robotic inattentive the room was dirty i didn t wanted to shower bathroom was very slippy sheets had holes in it towels were hard wifi weak minibar poorly stocked and overpriced , no breakfast incl 
424873,Barcel Raval, Both bars were closed for refurb at the same time which meant asking for a drink felt like an inconvenience, the view from the panoramic roof terrace was amazing 
424874,Barcel Raval, They kept turning off the air conditioning so when there were no windows to open it was very stuffy until the air con kicked in again Kept asking for more milk but didn t get it until the 3 request Wouldn t stop us staying there again, Clean fresh and modern Not too far to walk to anywhere Friendly staff Didn t eat there so can t comment on the food
424875,Barcel Raval, Little bit noise in the mornings when staff start cleaning other bedrooms , Every member of the staff is ready to help always with a smile The bed is super comfortable and the attention to detail in the decoration is superb Gym facilities are great Get a glass of wine and go to the terrace to admire the view breathtaking 
424876,Barcel Raval, Cooked buffet breakfast not hot enough, Room modern bright and clean Roof terrace with view of city bar in summer Located not far from La Rambla Breakfast choice good
424877,Barcel Raval, I found the room on Travago at 50 off I felt that the original price was excessive, The view from the roof top is beautiful the location was right in the centre of Barcelona rooms and staff were excellent 
424878,Barcel Raval, Breakfast was average and the walls seemed too thin could hear movements across the hotel Room was also pretty dark which made getting ready a little tricky Shame that at this time of year there was no access to the rooftop , Great location friendly staff who went the extra mile to make you feel comfortable Lovely quirky well designed rooms Excellent amenities would definitely recommend 
424879,Barcel Raval, Only negative for us was the bathroom sink and the fact that the toilet didnt have ventilation , The beds were amazing To the point where my friends and i considered asking the hotel staff what brand the matresses were 
424880,Barcel Raval, The location is very odd it is just in the middle of a street You have to walk down a few back streets which do make you feel unsafe and have to watch your bags It is located in the rough area shall we say , Me and my partner went for a short break We thought the hotel was wonderful We had a lovely time There was no fault with the hotel or room the bed was super comfy It is in a great location just a short walk from Las Ramblas street 
424881,Barcel Raval, The set up of the room was not very convenient Especially the bathroom facilities were lacking privacy I would prefer a bathroom as a separate room with a door that closes Also the fact that you could either have the closet open or the toilet room was a bit annoying The quality of breakfast could be improved Eg better quality of bacon fresh scrambled eggs instead of powder type , The location was convenient for exploring the old City The terrace was nice for views 
424882,Barcel Raval,No Negative, We were well pleased with the hotel the staff were lovely especially the lady at breakfast nothing too much trouble Lovely central location Would certainly go back again 
424883,Barcel Raval, The concierge on the ground floor who is looking at you like if you were a rober just because we are young people The room was a bit cold, The bed was very confortable the 360 terrasse
424884,Barcel Raval, TV had no English channels We were also refused late checkout even tho late check out was advertised throughout the hotel , The room on the 10th floor was fabulous Jacuzzi and shower we re lovely The bed was so comfortable it was hard to get out of Only complaint I would have is there was no channels on TV in English Overall it was a very enjoyable stay Plus the rooftop is great Would be even better in summertime
424885,Barcel Raval,No Negative, This hotel was really nice clean and friendly The roms where quite unique both in color and interior A nice design hotel The Breakfast was great and they Tapas perfect Go there and enjoy Tom
424886,Barcel Raval, Cleaning could have been slightly better, Amazing view from the rooms and the skybar interesting hotel located in a wonderful charming area in the heart of Barcelona Rooms were really nice too with a great bed and great details 
424887,Barcel Raval, don t have a proper bathroom no carpets no slippers provided a bit far from the center unless you like to walk a lot, The view facilities staff
424888,Barcel Raval, Quite noisy with people playing cricket outside of hotel Also someone entered our room not sure if member of staff whilst in our room in the evening , Comfortable beds
424889,Barcel Raval, Can t open the windows so can t change the air in the rooms unless you ask the concierge to send someone to open them , Location rooms and value for money 
424890,Barcel Raval, The lights in the rooms and the whole hotel were very dim maybe part of the atmosphere but not easy to do any reading, The location was great as it was close to everything and still in a not so touristy part that had a character
424891,Barcel Raval, The hotels location was really good only a short distance from ramblas and all the main attractions however the side road which you have to walk down to get to ramblas is extremely scary You feel unsafe the whole time we stayed there for 4 days and in the day time the street was fine but as soon as it was night time it was awful we seen 2 fights down that street and every night the street is full of prostitues who constantly follow any men down the street Even when I was walking with my partner they would follow us and grab his pockets to try and get into them If you are English and alone I would definitely avoid this street during dark , The bed was extremely comfortable the rooms were immaculate and the roof top bar is amazing The reception staff were very friendly and welcoming The man who served on the bar there also very friendly however he seemed to make up the prices as he went along every time we went to get the same round the prices were becoming higher and higher it wasn t until we questioned him on the prices that they dropped 
424892,Barcel Raval, We thought that there should have been more power points The three of us found it quite difficult to charge our phones as two of the sockets were not working Also more mirror space Due to the minimal lighting only one person can easily apply make up at a time We made it work though , The pillow menu was a lifesaver Also the beds were very comfortable The staff were incredibly polite We would definitely stay again but on a higher floor away from the car horns 
424893,Barcel Raval,No Negative, Great location in eclectic district of the city it s an interesting circular hotel with great views 360 degree vistas a roof top bar which enjoys fantastic sunrise sunset photo opportunities 
424894,Barcel Raval, We stayed on the third floor and we had a surprising amount of noise from the street Also the flashing lights on the fire alarm interrupted my sleep , Venue is great funky decor Location really handy Staff are very polite and helpful 
424895,Barcel Raval,No Negative, Everything was perfect The room has just everything you might need Beds are comfotable lots of place for clothes even though some say the opposite Breakfasts are good as well The wifi is super fast 
424896,Barcel Raval, No bad points at all , The hotel was very impressive all round also they gave my partner Danka a surprise birthday cake which was a nice gesture We will be back 
424897,Barcel Raval, you had to pay for the mini bar in our room which wasn t stated until we rang up reception to ask before we got a hefty bill , staff were amazing so friendly from the start from the very end We were asked if we had visited before and because we hadn t we were given a map of the city and told what services and tourist attractions were close as well as a metro map and directions of how to get to places The room was one of the best bits bed is so comfy 
424898,Barcel Raval, If you want a room with a view you will need to pay for it Avoid the first floor as street noise from people will cause problems to a light sleeper , Very good location albeit in the less desirable Raval neighbourhood Walking distance or a couple of metro stops from all the attractions Very modern hotel with huge comfy beds power shower 
424899,Barcel Raval, Room could have been ready earlier but we had to wait Hotel gave us voucher for one round of drinks , Room clean Beds very comfy Panoramic view from top terrace 
424900,Barcel Raval, The location is good for access to la ramblas but the streets in and around the hotel can be quite intimidating with groups of men in the evening I would never want to walk here alone, The hotel and decor is amazing and the roof top views are outstanding
424901,Barcel Raval, The view from the rooms is obstructed by the omnipresent grills on the windows but it s easy to look past them, With a panoramic view on the rooftop it was wonderful watching the sunset and observing the streets below at the 360 Terrace Bar and swimming pool 
424902,Barcel Raval, we asked for slippers on our first day and didn t get them the cleaning lady didn t manage to clean our room in spite of us being out most of the day on one occasion, breakfast choices were excellent location was excellent close to old town and to the harbour design of the building very interesting view from the 10th floor amazing
424903,Barcel Raval, Triumph of style over function The funkiness translates into impracticality in the room Curved table tops mean only a small area is useable everything else slides off Not enough storage space or comfortable seating Lights are a law unto themselves and the loo is in a cupboard Not enough sockets for charging electronic equipment , A bit funky in design great roof top views excellent location with some fab Tapas bars right outside Away from the noisiest areas but close to all the action Clean room and comfortable bed Large shower with hand held and over head shower heads 
424904,Barcel Raval, Not enough counter space in the room Not easy to find a place where to put things , What I enjoyed the most was the wonderful way the staff behaved with us They were very helpful in every way they could very courteous and always with a smile great people 
424905,Barcel Raval, The cleaners cupboard was straight across from our room Only one tea bag not ideal for British guests , Room cleaned every day Rooftop area superb Lovely buffet breakfast Helpful staff
424906,Barcel Raval, Could really improve on breakfast being from England maybe more of a full English breakfast, Location was good staff helpful amazing views from the roof top terrace
424907,Barcel Raval, Not much to like about this hotel and for the price I paid per night I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone , Not much to like about this hotel and for the price I paid per night I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone 
424908,Barcel Raval, Cozy room with steel barred window It was safe but interruped to see outside The location was a little bit narrow road from the Lamblas street , Sky lounge was good for view All staffs were so kind abd nice 
424909,Barcel Raval, Location less relaxing to walk around during the evening Great to be so central though Pool on roof not really a pool , The breakfasts were fantastic and the decor such fun Gym and sauna good Inter connecting rooms for family really brilliant Great view from the roof 
424910,Barcel Raval, The room was a lot smaller than it looked on pictures the tv had no English channels it looks a lot more luxorioua on pictures than it does in person Very over priced mini fridge 4 for a small water no facilities inside the hotel room, The location was good only a short walk from las ramblas nice decor inside and throughout the hotel
424911,Barcel Raval, Little worn out on closer look , In our hotel room there was waiting an amazing surprise of champagne cava and strawberries Perfect way to celebrate our anniversary 
424912,Barcel Raval, N A, The hotel and rooms were very nice and clean Most comfortable beds and lovely original decor Bfast fantastic and fresh Very good location and helpful staff 
424913,Barcel Raval, 700 hundred euros for 3 adults sharing a small twin room with a bed setee is just totally unacceptable Complaint fell on deaf ears POOR , good location for exploring what I would consider the best areas of barcelona
424914,Barcel Raval, The elevators are a joke and have a mind of their own The doors are incredibly loud and when your neighbor opens or closes it sounds like someone is trying to get in The showers make a knocking noise ALL night long The area is really bad drunks druggies prostitues and dodgy looking guys everywhere Disclosure we are Parisian and are adjusted to these types I imagine it might be a lot harder to accept for Americans or Germans Finally the cleaning staff left our door ajar one afternoon God knows for how long Luckily we locked everything of value in the safe Overall pretty nice but a terrible location and a bit dated now , It was our mini honey moon before our big one and they sent us cava and chocolates Staff were very friendly and the cleaning staff were very generous with toiletries Very clean and close to las ramblas 
424915,Barcel Raval, Roof top bar and pool didn t live up to description very disappointed only booked hotel for pool so feel cheated as could have booked somewhere without pool a lot cheaper feel you are misleading customers , Bed was very big and comfortable room nice but not much storage space 
424916,Barcel Raval, Bedroom really nice except shower too close to wardrobe when two people trying to shower and dress at the same time, Lovely and very unusual layout of hotel 
424917,Barcel Raval, Lighting was poor in bedrooms lack of privacy would have been an issue had we not been travelling in a couple didn t feel the room was thoroughly cleaned each day ,No Positive
424918,Barcel Raval, Room too small for couple no closet or drawers for clothes not isolated well enough I heard noise from outside loud clear , Breakfast was good staffs are friendly 
424919,Barcel Raval, Location was in bad neighborhood people , Everything friendly staff and facilities and hotel style near from La Rambla street I faced a problem in my shower room they apologize about the problem and fix the issue one day after and gave us two days breakfast free although we didn t take it 
424920,Barcel Raval, On a hot day the AC fell short The room was too hot on the afternoon , The hotel s uncommon design is warm and inviting and the room is very comfortable 
424921,Barcel Raval, The cleanliness was a real let down for me, Amazing location with vibrant nightlife just below and amazing rooftop deck with spectacular views of the city and excellent drinks
424922,Barcel Raval, rooms poorly laid out not enough counter space and drawer space No bathroom counter space Don t like the covering on the outside of the windows , Great breakfast nice large comfy bed 
424923,Barcel Raval, Price of mini bar I m sure it is standard but I know that mini drinks cost less than 1 wholesale , Staff were extremely accommodating food was excellent and well priced and the view was perfect 
424924,Barcel Raval, Bar service is disappointing slow and staff could improve on customer service skills , Within walking distance of La Ramblas Comfy beds and an ample breakfast buffet Great rooftop bar 
424925,Barcel Raval, cheaper bar prices a balcony would be perfect or at least to be able to open a window was a little suffocating and claustrophobic at some points, Huge bed and lovely room We were lucky enough to be on the top floor with spectacular views Shame about the metal mesh in front of window though Bathroom and bedroom all in one room fantastic for couples as very intimate sliding door on the toilet room so no panic Fantastic location 5min walk form las rambla great bar 2 seconds walk from hotel rooftop terrace prices very high Would definitely go back
424926,Barcel Raval, The location wasn t as close to the beach as we would have liked however it is super close to La Rumbla , Loved the roof top bar at the hotel and the rooms were very spacious clean and with a quirky twist 
424927,Barcel Raval,No Negative, The hotel is located in a charming part of the city which is accessible to a lot of key attractions The bed was lovely and the room was very comfortable The staff were very helpful and able to recommend the best ways to get around the city and to some of the famous tourist attractions I would stay here again 
424928,Barcel Raval,No Negative, The staff were so friendly booked through them to see different attractions for fast track entry The hotel was clean and nice minutes walk from la Rambla 
424929,Barcel Raval, Tiny but annoying there was two plug sockets under the TV but you couldn t fit two adaptors in at the same time No other plug sockets around the room, Fantastic view friendly staff Bed was so comfortable Best hotel i ve ever stayed in would go back Amazing City too 
424930,Barcel Raval, Didn t like the glass mirrors everywhere in the room other than that no complaints, Staff very nice very retro hotel 10 minute walk to Las Ramblas Nice roof top bar
424931,Barcel Raval, The location is pretty bad Take a wrong turn and you are in the middle of prostitues and drug dealers real story on Sunday Morn at 11 a m I would not recommend it if you have children I would expect more cleanliness from a 4XL They were charging the entire stay on arrival without saying anything First time ever Some stuff are pretty rude while most of others are extremely friendly The place is very busy that might be the reason but still it s a 4Xl right , Gym WIFI Breakfast and restaurant pretty much Roof top bar
424932,Barcel Raval, Our room on second day could have been cleaned before 5 30 at night Staff rude when we asked why not Told it was a Sunday This hotel is expensive so didn t expect that Bottle of water as an afterthought apology , The room and hotel were very comfortable and clean The views from the roof were amazing 
424933,Barcel Raval, Bath tub in the room rather than a separate bathroom Ok for couples but not when travelling with friends Would prefer toilet and sink to be in the same place , Staff were simply amazing Super comfortable bed 
424934,Barcel Raval, Corridors stairs were dark not good for anyone with visual impairment Room lighting was a bit complicated, Reception cleaning staff were very efficient helpful Bed was very comfortable shower was great
424935,Barcel Raval, More frosting on the shower screens a travel adapter to be included would be nice , The bed was a great size and very comfortable The boutique style lounge was lovely and the roof top view bar and cocktails were fabulous The breakfast was more than expected with a fabulous full range the processco was a nice touch too The only draw back is the privacy of the shower and bathroom facilities 
424936,Barcel Raval, Breakfast corner small Room not comfortable for putting few baggages in Parking in adjacent underground public parking extremely expensive Overestimated , Design everywhere Maybe too ostentatiously
424937,Barcel Raval, The swimming pool is nothing of the sort We didn t use it and neither did any other guests Way too small and poor location The room design is interesting but not very practical OK for a few days but would drive you mad over a week , Bed very comfortable Nice roof terrace for a drink but pricey 
424938,Barcel Raval, Booked Superior Triple Room 3 Adults Advertised Sofa Bed was a Chair 33 inches wide totally inadequate Description Deceptive Room was paid for before I saw this on complaining to Reception Ruben said that was the sofa and he said he could do nothing I felt because we came through a 3rd party and had paid in full Only had Coffee and toiletries in Room for 1 though booking and charge for 3 this was every day If we knew an adult would get a chair to sleep in would never have booked this Hotel, Room Clean
424939,Barcel Raval, I ve never stayed at a hotel with such paper thin walls When the person next door opens their door I thought they were entering my room You hear everything in and outside The noise outside goes until 1 2am The plumbing was broken and I was told it would be replaced it never was , The staff was friendly 
424940,Barcel Raval, Bar staff incredibly slow very poor service We wanted another round of drinks but the first order was wrong took soooo long we gave up , Breakfast was good
424941,Barcel Raval, Hotel looking tired Cleanliness of common areas Atmosphere of restaurant plus quality of food served, The attitude of the staff Hotel location Quality of bed and bedsheets
424942,Barcel Raval, The settee was a bit ropey and one lamp and TV remote weren t working but it didn t spoil the stay A separate fridge from the mini bar might have been nice , The breakfast selection was amazing and vegetarians were catered for well The rooms were hi tech and trendy most impressive being the electric curtains I also loved the little gifts left for us on occasion 
424943,Barcel Raval, There was nothing that we didn t like, Staff were very friendly location was perfect as 5 minutes from la rambla 360 view was amazing room was exquisite 
424944,Barcel Raval, They weren t very good at making up the room every day we stayed for 5 days and there were areas that were a little unclean I m a bit of a neat freak so even with the little areas that weren t entirely clean it didn t bother me to the point of not recommending it to anyone It was quite minor The beds were clean and extra comfy The AC was nice too , The location was great Very close to all the main site seeing areas such as Las Ramblas El born and gothic area The rooftop patio was perfect to cool down in the pool and have a cocktail after a full day of sightseeing 
424945,Barcel Raval, This hotel was advertised as having a swimming pool On seeing the swimming pool we as a family were totally disappointed as it wasn t much bigger than a foot spa Needless to say no swimming was done or Splashing around in the pool was achieved We paid the extra for the hotel having this facility but we now feel conned , The view from the rooftop bar was amazing
424946,Barcel Raval, The view from the room overlooked the neighbouring apartments therefore couldn t open the curtains as builders were there Would have preferred a room with a different outlook , The bed was very comfortable and big the rooftop terrace was a delight 
424947,Barcel Raval, Whilst only a short stroll to The Ramblas there were some dubious characters at night Didn t spoil it however, Rooms were excellent extremely comfortable and stylish Really nice hotel and I have stayed in a few Roof terrace is a real bonus 
424948,Barcel Raval, Not all rooms have a great view but the rooftop is amazing , Walking distance to many attractions especially the Boqueria market and MACBA really comfortable beds 
424949,Barcel Raval, A better cup of English tea for breakfast would have been nice but other than that breakfast was fine , View from pool bar was amazing Rooms were spacious and comfortable Definitely coming back again for a visit 
424950,Barcel Raval, Air conditionned what a little bit weak as regard to Barcelona hot temperature , Nice place including small swimming pool on the top roof and 360 view on Barcelona Really Comfortable fashion room including Nespresso and giant bed convenient and friendly personnel always commited to help 
424951,Barcel Raval, Occasional sewage smell frI m toilet area potential plumbing issue, Good location friendly knowledgeable staff good variety offered at breakfast
424952,Barcel Raval, Nothing, The whole experience was outstanding The friendly staff the modern designer interior and excellent location made for a truly unforgettable experience one which would loved to be repeated again in 360 days 
424953,Barcel Raval, too dark in lounge bar when breakfest was served, Nice view from roof bar on the top of this hotel near by centre so we could go by walk to city center 
424954,Barcel Raval, No complimentary water in the hotel The neighbourhood seamed a bit dodgy in the evening , Great rooms amazing rooftop terrace and very comfortable bed 
424955,Barcel Raval, Pool and pool area very small no room to sunbathe in peak season Triple room was quite cramp, Comfy bed Excellent roof terrace bar Great location Helpful staff
424956,Barcel Raval, The breakfast was 15 euros per person which I thought was a little pricey but we had booked accomodation only therefore we chose where and when we wanted to eat Despite this there was a good choice of English and continential food for breakfast and the quality of the food was excellent , Excellent hotel The staff were friendly and welcoming The location was good and only a short walk to La Rambla where you can access the metro and the many cafes restaurants and shops not to mention art galleries and museums The view of Barcelona from the 11th floor of the hotel is amazing The food served at the hotel was of high quality I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I should return to Barcelona 
424957,Barcel Raval,No Negative, We had such a lovely stay The decor is really cool the rooms are spacious comfortable clean The staff were friendly helpful Breakfast was amazing so much choice good food Location is handy just a short stroll from La Rambla 
424958,Barcel Raval, The air conditioning in my room could of been cooler, The bed was incredible the most comfortable bed in any hotel I have stayed in And the staff were amazing especially the bar staff on the roof terrace in particular Claudia It was my friends birthday while we were there and she treated her like a Queen 
424959,Barcel Raval, It is clear that the hotel has had a lot of guest since it was built for aprox 7 8 years and it is not as fresh as it was then The furniture in the rooms should be fixed changed Some rooms we have stayed in smells of smoking in the rooms This time as well , We have stayed at the hotel many times The beds are huge and very comfortable the design of the rooms are cool and the rooftop terrace and pool are very nice after a day in the city Towel service good cocktails and snacks but a bit pricey We always get an upgrade for free when there are available rooms The location is good close to the centre 
424960,Barcel Raval, The hotel was OK but very dark no privacy for the shower the room layout is very poor the third bed was a childs chair bed not ideal for an adult with no mattress There was a flashing smoke detector that made it very difficult to sleep there was also plenty of noise ingress into the room at night and we were on the sixth floor, Great view from the viewing deck on the eleventh floor
424961,Barcel Raval,No Negative, Very goog hotel with perfect location Raval is even better than famous Rambla at least if you just want to sit and relax without too much tourists Pool area is very nice even though the pool itself is not really a pool more like big jacuzzi Make sure you book the room that is in top floors you only get the full benefits of your stay when you can marvel the great view from your room 
424962,Barcel Raval, Dodgy hotel neighborhood Swimming pool is a big bath with 5 seats Even deluxe room was claustrophobic small and no fresh air in room Very long queues at mini breakfast buffet , Beautiful building trendy interior spectacular view at rooftop 
424963,Barcel Raval, The bar was very expensive , The staff were really friendly and went out of their way to help The bed was also really comfortable and the location was perfect 
424964,Barcel Raval, I don t like that you can see the one who is taking shower everytime I wanted to take shower I had to tell my brother to leave the room , The decor is awesome the 360 terrasse is great 
424965,Barcel Raval, I thought it had a pool on the top floor but it was too small to swim in and so was more of a plunge pool Still a nice area to lounge around in with its fantastic 360 degree views , The location was excellent close to La Rambla and all the side streets off with all the great restaurants etc All the major sites were within walking distance or a short tube ride away The hotel itself was ultra modern and quite luxurious The bed was massive and extremely comfortable We were upgraded upon arrival to the eighth floor which meant we had fantastic views All in all good value for money 
424966,Barcel Raval, The location of the hotel isn t the best Only 5 mins walk to La Ramblas but there are prostitutes in the street nearby who you have to walk past at night We didn t feel immediately threatened but it was always nice to get into the hotel, Hotel was great Rooftop bar sensational and the staff very friendly and helpful 
424967,Barcel Raval, Air conditioning in hotel room was very loud especially when sleeping Room wasn t too clean on arrival Rooftop and pool open to public, Good location staff were helpful and rooftop was great for a drink 
424968,Barcel Raval, Only one English Channel is the news Good 30 minutes walk to the beach 10 mins to the ramblas Or 15 to the marina , Reception really lovely and helpful 360 bar staff lovely and friendly Beds and bedding so so comfy had raeally good sleeps Basic room big enough for me and my 10 year son 
424969,Barcel Raval, Didnt like the open plan bathroom , Excellent hotel a bit dissapointed with breakfast Choice Pool very small U wouldnt really consider it tobe a pool Hotel was clean and modern Liked the location and service 
424970,Barcel Raval, Our room was described as a triple however turned out to be a double with a fold out bed I complained and was offered another room but it was another double with fold out bed They said they don t have triples This was very cramped only 1 wardrobe between 3 people , Location was excellent and staff were very friendly but three people for a week in a room designed for 2 was very cramped 
424971,Barcel Raval, The first and second day during my stay my shower flooded and water ran into my room all over the place After calling in the team to get it fixed the problem was rectified however in almost any other hotel a room upgrade would have been offered that wasn t the case Location of the hotel is good however more located on the rougher side of the Ramblas Not very safe at night in some nearby streets prostitution and drug dealing is clearly visible My friend got mugged right outside the door of the hotel entrance phone stolen , Hotel design is nice Rooftop terrace has a great view and is fun during sundown Staff at reception is friendly and helpful Rooms are well designed though I wish there were more electric sockets for charging etc Room service is good Sauna in the basement is good 
424972,Barcel Raval, Asked thru booking com to check in early Booking com replied this would be ok for extra charge This was acceptable to me However when we arrived hotel had no knowledge of this , Staff v helpful
424973,Barcel Raval, Very dark hotel difficult to see where u were going at times Not much space for storage bathrooms not that practical , Comfy bed good location as we could walk to other areas easily 
424974,Barcel Raval, Some of the staff where a little moody the room size was a little smaller And if you are sharing a room there is a mirror right near the shower so the other person can see you There was always some event on outside so was a little loud at times, Bed was so comfortable loved that you could choose the scent in your room And the Tonka bean icecream in the restaurant is to die for
424975,Barcel Raval, Noise from street room was on first floor which is one up from ground floor Small room not adequate for 3 adults or families Towels and toilet tissue were not soft The pool is more like a large jacuzzi should not be advertised as a pool , Good location Beds very comfortable Female front desk staff very helpful especially Nita Gym was nice Beautiful view on top 
424976,Barcel Raval, There were issues concerning the cleanliness of the room details maybe but couldn t remain unnoticed If traveling with kids it s helpful to have in mind that the bathtub is inside the room , Breakfast although not of an extream variety was really tasty of a very good quality and containing local products Great view from the hotel terasse and from our room too Hotel staff was really helpful Bathroom amenities included everything one could need plus toothbrush and toothpaste kit and a comb 
424977,Barcel Raval, Would have been nicer to have a bigger pool but we knew what size it would be before booking so no complaint really, The 360 Bar on the roof is brilliant Great views and a great place to relax and have a few drinks whilst looking across superb views of the city The beds in the room were huge and extremely comfortable 
424978,Barcel Raval, There needs to be better plug points in the bedroom One of the beds had a plug next to it and the other didn t staying in a twin room The plug point under the TV was faulty and beyond that there weren t any other plugs in the room , The Bed was extremely comfy a gorgeous view from the rooftop and a lovely view from the bedroom Very lovely staff as well And the brunch food was delicious 
424979,Barcel Raval, The swimming pool is very tiny but there is a small jacuzzi at the end of it The deepest area in the swimming pool is 1meter and the tiny pool closes at 6pm It was still nice to use it to refresh yourself The view is so amazing that it was still OK to have a small pool We didn t mind but there is no privacy for the shower as it is in the room It might be an issue if you want some privacy while showering , The hotel is 5 min walk from last ramblas and metro stop liceo You can walk to the gothic quarter 15 20min Walk to el born quarter 30 35min walk to plaza de real 10mins and walk to Christophe Colombus 30mins The area where the hotel is located isn t the prettiest but there are many restaurants around I won t recommend a solo woman traveller to walk late at night We walked back around 12am and it was still lively We love the rooftop terrace bar at the top wines from 6euros sangria and some cocktails are at 10 euros The bed is so comfortable it was amazing We were upgraded for free to a deuce room on the 9th floor The view from the room was amazing The lightening in the room is cosy There is a large safe in the room and a Nespresso machine in some room The hotel has a great service to help their customers You can what s app them and ask them any requests We used it several times and the staff Julie and others was pretty amazing at booking restaurants for us via this app There is the possibility to book a late check out till 3pm for 22 euros Check out is at 12pm but many get it until 1pm for free Otherwise there are toilets and showers downstairs in the gym sauna to use and you can leave your bag in a secure way at the reception after you check out There is the bocqueria market 4 min walk it worth it to visit it The arume restaurant 2 min walk and the cera 23 restaurant 1 min walk are amazing book in advance 
424980,Barcel Raval, Nothing by far my favourite hotel I ve stayed at in Barcelona , The rooms were luxurious clean and modern The view is fantastic we were on the fifth floor And you couldn t get a better location We highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again 
424981,Barcel Raval, The superior tripple room was very small for three persons The pool on the roof a bit too small to be worth the name Expensive breakfast , Excellent view from the roof top bar Excellent breakfast 
424982,Barcel Raval, The pool on the rooftop needed to be heated and bigger , Bed was superb and it was a quirky room As it was my husbands birthday we received a free upgrade to a suite 
424983,Barcel Raval, Difficult to get taxis at time would of been a bonus if the hotel could of called one for us, Staff were excellent location was great loved the room bed was so comfty and loved the modern touch The rooftop pool had a spectacular view The restaurant food was outstanding breakfast and tapas we had was divine 
424984,Barcel Raval, Though in Las Ramblas at an end with small bars and restaurants surrounded by quiet dark streets Not much else to see within walking distance, staff was pleasant and accommodating room was clean bed very comfortable loved the panoramic view top of building Liked the quirky decor
424985,Barcel Raval, Breakfast wasn t good very limited choice and not worth 15 , Lovely modern hotel get location and amazing views from the 360 roof bar I would definitely return 
424986,Barcel Raval, A few elements of the bedroom needed attention fixing which did take away from the awesomeness of it all Pool water is freezing and there arent enough sun beds The whole hotel is wrapped in cage wire which some people may not like obscuring bedroom window, Super modern Comfy bed Free WiFi Decent hotel gym Friendly staff Optional 3pm late check out Rooftop vibe and fantastic views
424987,Barcel Raval, Hotel is modern and well noise insulated from the outside and between rooms however local children were letting off fireworks adjacent to the hotel till midnight each of the 5 evenings So don t expect to drop off before 12am This was not a problem once we were expecting it , Friendly staff good location quality hotel and rooms with good food service Also 3 top class restaurants within 10 minute walk The rooftop lounge has a fantastic view of the City and the Mojitos are brilliant 
424988,Barcel Raval, Staff was meh At best Room was hot even with acon blasting Cleaners did poor job and my feet were always dirty Breakfast was horrible tasting and all cold Many items were empty and I was there at 8 30am Staff at bar 360 were not friendly to me although Daniel and Albert I think that was their names waited on pretty females first with a seeming good attitude and let the men stand there Oh yes they were often they were rude when they finally had to wait on us Female staff did even really try to pretend to be nice to anyone FYI not the best part of the city Lots of hookers , The roof top terrace had an excellent view of Barcelona
424989,Barcel Raval, The bathroom was poorly designed My friend had to stay on the bed whilst I showered so she didn t see me because you could see the entire room from the shower due to the mirror The surrounding area wasn t very nice either as a young girl in a foreign country I didn t feel safe walking down the roads around the hotel so got taxis from right outside most of the time, The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was ultra modern with great lighting the 360 bar was great amazing views and drinks just a little expensive for the drinks The interactive map where you could book sight seeing things and the staff were extremely helpful when it came to location info
424990,Barcel Raval, All round good hotel Only grumble would be that the shower area is not that private was not a problem for us but could be if you were travelling with a relative or something , The bed was very comfy and was a good location The 360 bar has amazing views and the drinks were not expensive as you would probably imagine them to be Rooms ultra modern clean and well maintained 
424991,Barcel Raval, There was not enough areas for storage drawers in the room or enough wardrobe hangers, Roof top bar high end d cor Staff were very friendly helpful and gave great recommendations
424992,Barcel Raval, Rooftop bar was expensive but as you might expect with a spectacular view over the whole city and out to sea , Clean modern decor and the bed was very comfortable Staff friendly helpful and courteous Quiet room on upper floor and walking distance to explore most of the old city 
424993,Barcel Raval, The roof terrace is a little narrow and can easily become overcrowded The pool is a bit of a joke It would have been better to have used the space for more seating , Comfortable bed Good sized room Great location for exploring the old town Good view from the roof terrace 
424994,Barcel Raval, Nothing, Absolutely amazing place staff were so friendly Bed was huge 360 viewing roof balcony was superb Special thanks to Raphael simione and Joaqu n Cheers
424995,Barcel Raval, Activating the lights was a nightmare Breakfast ws not a good deal Too expensive for what was provided, Staff at front desk were extremely helpful Room was spotless
424996,Barcel Raval, There is too much of dullness in the place because of colours blacks and greys used The storage space is limited The idea of wash basin within the room does not gel with me In an effort to make the hotel look different it is more quirky , The location and the roof top bar 
424997,Barcel Raval, The roof terrace is something special , Good modern hotel with a great breakfast However the area is as rough as a badgers bum Not a great place at night 
424998,Barcel Raval, For a 4 star superior hotel I would expect a little bit more comfort in the hotel rooms Though they are very new and modern they are very small Privacy is not really given as the toilet door is acually a thin mirror wall which you can push to the side and back Furthermore probably it will be no problem for a couple but as I ve been traveling with a group of friends it was first a little bit unpleasant as the shower or the bathroom at all is not seperated from the rest of the room , The Hotel is located very near to the La Rambla Street so perfect for discovering the centre of Barcelona by a little walking tour The breakfast offers food vor every taste nationality and the free Prosecco gives you the final Feeling of being in vacations Above all the 360 overview on the roof top of the hotel was really amazing and higly recommendable 
424999,Barcel Raval, Noise from other guests in hotel corridors Some of the surrounding area was rundown , The bed was extremely comfy The roof top bar was excellent Staff very helpful 
425000,Barcel Raval, One of the receptionists was a bit grumpy but all of the other hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful, The location was fantastic beds were extremely comfortable and really enjoyed the roof top bar in the evenings 
425001,Barcel Raval, Cereals not offered at breakfast No ventilation in rooms only air con Very limited space for clothes only 1 small drawer per person , Spacious shower cubicle Attractive design and decor Comfortable bed Friendly helpful staff Convenient for tourist attractions 
425002,Barcel Raval,No Negative, Lovely breakfast nice to sit on the roof terrace after a long day sightseeing great view from the room liked the electric curtains and room scent gym and sauna very nice
425003,Barcel Raval, Unfortunately 1 of our party fell ill just before travelling to the hotel and was unable to make the trip On arrival we asked to cancel her breakfast for the duration of our stay as it would not be needed and we did not want to pay extra for something someone was not going to eat We were told they needed to speak with the manager but the manager was not present We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights and asked every day to cancel the breakfast everyday we got the same response and again the manager was never present On the final day when we were leaving we asked about the cancellation of the breakfast and a refund They told us we should have contacted Bookings com why they could not have told us this at the start of the holiday I do not know They told us they could not give us a refund and that we should have gone through Bookings com If they had told us this when we first asked at the start of the holiday we would have As such I think it would only be fair and property that Bookings com provided us a refund for this breakfast for the 5 days and they can seek compensation from the hotel ,No Positive
425004,Barcel Raval, Really tiny room and bathroom layout not proper for family traveling with children or friends Just couples and for very few days just in case of extreme necessity Awful neighborhood The towels looked 20 years old and had to ask for them every single day The shower wasn t that clean , Some members of the staff were really nice and did everything and more to help us with the problems we had 
425005,Barcel Raval, Too small area for the breakfast and the staff couldn t follow with cleaning and food No cleaning bedroom after midday , Excellent area situation the view from the bedroom or the roof the design of the hotel
425006,Barcel Raval,No Negative, Fantastic hotel staff very helpful great location Staff couldn t do enough for you Thanks to Barcelo Raval for making our trip to Barcelona amazing Only thing missing the sun 
425007,Barcel Raval, The hotel is located nearby Rambla main touristic Street of Barcelona but the neighbourhood is ill famed junkies beggars etc So the hotel is a jewel in a sewer as I may say ,No Positive
425008,Barcel Raval, partly loud airconditioning with strange noise The pool is not a pool but a bathtub , 3 different choises of different types of pillows fancy rooms Good and nice for couples less for familes due to bathroom section which doesnt allow real privacy Perfect roof top with view over complete city 
425009,Barcel Raval, The restaurant manager was extremely rude and unhelpful its a real shame as all the other staff were so attentive and helpful Its a shame that he let the entire work force down It was because of him we and our experience we decided to refrain from eating any food at the hotel which would have meant we would have spent more money in the hotel rather than go outside , The location was excellent The reception staff were amazing The rooms are fantastic 
425010,Barcel Raval, The tea coffee tray in the room didn t have English breakfast tea and very few milk pots Also one of the bar men was a little rude to us which surprised me as all the other staff were lovely and polite , The room was exceptional Huge and very comfy bed awesome shower and electric curtains Amazing Breakfast was incredibly good Cava and everything you could dream of to eat Really very impressed at the value for money if the hotel and breakfast 
425011,Barcel Raval, Nothing Location of hotel was fine a bit off the main drag but quieter in the evenings A couple of dodgy streets late at night but no different to any other city Felt safe enough , Super modern hotel with really large comfortable beds and great views from upper floors Ruben at the desk was very accommodating and helpful 
425012,Barcel Raval, Would have preferred a separate bathroom rather than the odd configuration in corner of rather a small room considering the price, Lovely extra large comfortable bed and view from roof fabulous 
425013,Barcel Raval, Other receptionists less friendly Rooms not suitable for families as bathing area lacks privacy and rooms are too small Roof top pool bar not open during the day The air conditioning in our room 920 made a very loud motor noise every half an hour even through the night which disturbed sleep Mini fridge in room was hardly cold and the coffee machine didn t work as the water just poured out , Wifi was excellent Good location just off the main las rambles location 360degree rooftop terrace with binoculars view novel idea Lotte the trainee girl on reception very helpful and polite other staff need to take a leaf out of her book Modern hotel probably most suited to couples Nice decor Plenty towels left in the room comfortable bed with good pillow selection Room smelt nice and refreshing Relaxed atmosphere
425014,Barcel Raval, Food was mostly spanish and none of us like tapas , The roof terrace pool was a big hit with my two grandsons as were the panoramic views of barcelona Ramblas was just a block away the gym was also very popular 
425015,Barcel Raval, Lack of privacy if adjacent to the office building as opposed to the open aspect of the street side of the hotel , Facilities cleanliness and helpful staff at all times 
425016,Barcel Raval, When we arrived we were charged more than when we booked the hotel with booking com this was above the city charge which we accepted we would pay on arrival Memory foam topper on beds was hot at night and meant less sleep for us Third bed soda bed in triple room means it s difficult to get in and out for one person in main bed Small roof terrace pool not open until summer which was not clear when booked Although overall very modern clean hotel in a fantastic location , Fantastic location and modern clean hotel Great views from roof terrace 
425017,Barcel Raval, Shower has no privacy bathroom floor could have used some cleaning Not enough soap or towells Area where is located is shady Even the cab driver said something about neighborhood as soon as he pick me up from airport not a good way to start your vacation , Comfy bed plenty of windows and daylight hotel has a beautiful decor rooftop view to the city Walking distance to Ramblas and Boqueria Market 
425018,Barcel Raval,No Negative, The hotel is completely perfect Modern and gorgeous rooms perfect facilities great location approx 3 minute walk from La Ramblas and friendly staff I would definitely stay here again 
425019,Barcel Raval, Only that the pool wasn t open maybe think about getting it heated and using it all year round, Everything A very clean and modern hotel with excellent friendly staff
425020,Barcel Raval, Booked a room suitable for three adults but the third bed was a fold down arm chair Not great for our 6 5 son Aircon was poor glad it wasnt the height of the summer , Location was good for las Ramblas and the city 
425021,Barcel Raval, Location although nice and central is in a slightly downtrodden area out of keeping with the hotel , Excellent facilities particularly the roof top cocktail bar Staff very friendly and the resteraunt offers realy good set menue deals 
425022,Barcel Raval, The interior design in the ground floor is dated and quite horrible it almost put us off booking , the breakfast was very nice and the top floor viewing 360 terrace is pretty spectacular 
425023,Barcel Raval, Not much really prob just best to avoid over priced breakfast dinner etc as plenty of places to eat out, Good location 5 min walk to los ramblas comfy and trendy hotel pillow menu view from rooftop superb
425024,Barcel Raval, This is one of those places which thinks the hotel is more important than guests Staff routinely ignores requests they spray some horrible scent in the air which gives headache and the rooms are dysfunctional in the attempted modern look Location is not good The neighborhood is scary with open street prostitution and drug dealing plus groups of men hanging in the street corners ,No Positive
425025,Barcel Raval, Room v cold Pool more like a roof top water feature Location v central if you didn t mind walking past all the prostitutes after dark, The bed was amazingly comfortable View stunning Location v central
425026,Barcel Raval, Although we were staying on the ninth floor the noise from people on the street was sometimes distinguishable , Very complete and of good quality breakfast
425027,Barcel Raval, The location is near the centre las ramblas however not a good part of Barcelona a lot of locals and groups of homeless people right outside the hotel in the square Did not feel safe The staff were unhelpful with directions booking restaurants very reluctant to give you their time There is no coffee maker in the room despite it saying so online Air con didn t work If your sharing the room with a relative or friend its no use as everything is open plan and you can see the other person taking a shower Very small rooms 3 people in our room and still would only give us towels glasses for 2 No rooftop bar despite again saying online you have to buy drinks from the ground floor and take them up The pool is no larger than a front porch ,No Positive
425028,Barcel Raval, The water was very hot in the shower didn t seem to get cooler It was bearable though wasn t something to complain about , The location was great The view from the rooftop was wonderful and the bed was a dream The best bed we ve ever slept in 
425029,Barcel Raval, Nothing, Great Location very clean lovely room 10 min walk from tourist areas but not out of the way Friendly staff and very helpful Would definitely stay again 
425030,Barcel Raval, As a lone female traveller I found that the Raval area at night had some unsavoury characters which made me look over my shoulders a little but in the daytime I was ok and just tried to be as streetwise as possible The Hospital gardens and Boqueria Market were conveniently within 5 10 minutes walk and the port was about 15 minutes walk which was useful as I made use of one of the boat tours which ran from 12 15pm as I was there out of season , I loved the decor There was a really artistic and relaxing ambience My room was superb and so were the panoramic views from the terrace The Hotel is wonderful and the staff were really pleasant for that reason I d return 
425031,Barcel Raval, The area it was in didn t seem the best and it looked very out of place in its surroundings however it was very central for all the tourist attractions We didn t eat in the hotel but the breakfast buffet didn t look very appealing That wasn t an issue as there are loads of cafes and restaurants practically on your doorstep and a short walk away , Hotel was beautiful and the staff were lovely They were very helpful and accomodated our every need The view on the balcony is a must see 
425032,Barcel Raval,No Negative, This was definitely one of the most special hotels we have ever been at the team was amazing and absolutely naturally friendly and welcoming And we kept staring out of the window of the unique junior suite most of the time the view and spent the rest of the time taking in the panorama from the rooftop terrace We will come again 
425033,Barcel Raval,No Negative, Couldn t fault it Clean tidy friendly staff Beds comfy Location fantastic Lots of lovely eateries nearby and only 5 minutes walk from Las Ramblas
425034,Barcel Raval, It is mentioned there is a pool just a heads up it is very small and is more like a seating area to view the city from lovely too in the sun but just in case you were looking to go for a proper swim D, Excellent location very modern friendly staff great cocktails We didn t stay for food but it looked lovely and there was a great buzz at Sunday morning breakfast The vibe to the hotel is like a boudoir somewhat romantic with all the pink The shower has a frosting glass I was with my sister so was fine but perhaps not the best if staying with someone whose a bit conservative 
425035,Barcel Raval, Just round the back of the hotel is a dodgy red light area even at 10 in the morning But once you know the streets to avoid it s fine , Comfiest bed I have ever slept in nice boutique hotel great view from the rooftop and perfectly placed for the city 
425036,Barcel Raval, The room was seriously strange with the bathroom integrated into the room Looks quite stunning but not practical , Smart clean hotel Easy journey from the airport and then to cruise terminal 
425037,Barcel Raval, Not enough tea and offer in rooms also no bes pressie machine which was on the facilities for the room, Lovely decor and friendly staff good choice of wines and spirits in the bar
425038,Barcel Raval, The location is very poor We felt very unsafe when arriving at the hotel working girls standing in the side street next to the hotel Its a real shame as the hotel is actually rather nice The terrace bar was not open however was full of empty glasses and full ashtrays Just didnt give the feel of a 4 hotel , 1 Comfy bed 2 Good Breakfast 3 Modern Room
425039,Barcel Raval,No Negative, Amazing rooms massive comfortable bed Unique hotel design especially with lights Warm Very nice staff with multilanguages Special thanks to Receptionist Andrea very helpful and friendly Had some laugh speaking over the phone and at the hotel thank you Will defenitely stay again 
425040,Barcel Raval, Some rooms are not in the best conditions and some views from the hotel are not the best just they are good if your room is at the 9 10th floor , The location and the service attention provided by the staff were amazing 
425041,Barcel Raval, the bed was very soft I got mugged in Barcelona not in the Hotel the area does not look very safe, I liked the decoration and the ambience of the hotel 
425042,Barcel Raval,No Negative, This is a great hotel central for everything Very clean great huge beds fantastic front desk staff Everyone goes all out to be friendly and make it a great stay they are the most helpful to everyone staying at the hotel 
425043,Barcel Raval, Location is a little bit of an issue a 10min walk to metro stop, Modern feel of the hotel The 360 viewing platform was a real bonus Plus some nice touches for NYE
425044,Barcel Raval, The wifi was hit and miss and we had to ask the cleaner how to open the curtains , Modern Hotel with some trendy bars close by Good location and the roof top terrace has spectacular views 
425045,Barcel Raval, 1 Room showed signs of doors and bed side tables chipped and needing painting plus wallpaper next to window stuck on with white mastic 2 Neighbourhood not the best in Barcelona , Friendliness of staff and boutique feel of the hotel 
425046,Barcel Raval, Coordination with Priceline not clear Was charged additional fees for high floor although reservation was made for this an cost more in initial reservation Breakfast was expensive and terrible ,No Positive

425048,Barcel Raval, Thought breakfast was expensive at 18 00 each but was offered a voucher for a 3 00 discount Went to a fabulous bakery just round the corned and had great food and coffee for 10 00 for the 2 of us , Liked the location Room was great Service was very good Bar staff and the wine they recommended was good 
425049,Barcel Raval, Water pressure in the shower a bit low We paid the onsite upgrade of 22 for a move from a superior to a deluxe room yet apart from being moved to the last floor great view the room seemed to be identical to the pictures of the superior one Not worth the extra buck, Amazing bed good location decent breakfast good staff views of the cities
425050,Barcel Raval,No Negative, What I loved about the hotel is that before we arrived we mentioned that it s our wedding anniversary so we wanted to make sure we get a queen bed Because it was our wedding anniversary we got upgraded and also got one bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries It was such a pretty gesture of the hotel management They made our anniversary start very very positive Clean rooms amazing view Good location I would definitely recommend the hotel 
425051,Barcel Raval, There is no slippers and bathrobe as well as no bottled water only mini bar The rooms are very specific for business travelers shower is just behind the glass wall with white pollination from bedroom This hotel will suit more for couples , Modern stylish hotel not far from Rambla Tasty breakfasts but each day the same op variety of food options Nice view from the top floor 
425052,Barcel Raval, Nothing negative to comment everything was perfect , Very pleasant and helpful staff both in the reception cleaning and restaurant cleaning was immaculate comfy beds cool rooftop bar with amazing views over the whole of Barcelona stylish design in the whole building gym worked pretty well and had everything necessary for a quick workout My girlfriend had her 40th birthday while we were there and the staff brought a little birthday brownie up to the room as a surprise Easy to get around 7 8 minutes walk to La Rambla and Metro 
425053,Barcel Raval, The need to request additional soap and coffee milk due to insufficient being made available , The friendly welcome and assistance given by the reception staff and friendliness of bar staff 
425054,Barcel Raval, The only thing was our room wasn t clean when we came back but its not like they missed it out they just planned to do it much later than we expected , Excellent location central to La Rambla Staff were very helpful I forgot my euro adaptor and when I asked for directions to local shops they told me not to worry and gave me one of theirs to use Would highly recommend The terrace was fantastic with amazing views Good selection of breakfast too 
425055,Barcel Raval, 1 Small rooms 2 15 min walking away from the Shopping street 3 placing steel bars all around the building right across room windows which makes not a good view to look down the city 4 beds and pellows are uncomfortable 5 bathrooms walls made by nearly cristal clear,No Positive

425065,Barcel Raval,No Negative, The decor of the hotel is outstanding very modern trendy perfect for a young couple having a romantic trip The 360 terrace is cool with beautiful views The food is very good general ambience of the restaurant is chilled and again very modern The rooms are gorgeous not huge but really nice additional touches see through shower electronic sliding blinds full length windows fluorescent lighting that you change colour over the bed coffee machine iPod dock flatscreen TV and a massive sized bed Don t worry about other reviews about the area yes honestly it s not the nicest part of Barcelona but you are 5 minutes walk from Ramblas if that Like all cities all over the world stay on the main streets you won t encounter any undesirables Overall we loved it Would absolutely stay here again and massively recommend for young couples 
425066,Barcel Raval, The breakfast is pricey and limited in selection , The staff were so helpful They were able to accommodate all of our requests to make our visit extra special We asked for champagne to be in our room prior to arrival as it was our honeymoon and they totally delivered more then we could ve imagined The junior suite is the way to go So much space Shower hot tub were amazing The bed was super soft and comfortable The Nespresso machine in the room was nice to have available anytime you wanted The location is in walking distance to some great restaurants and Las Ramblas The area surrounding the hotel is a bit eclectic not so touristy You are definitely in the city not near the beach Make sure you visit the rooftop bar which provides amazing views of the city 
425067,Barcel Raval, Layout of room was a little odd with very little storage space no real bathroom only separate area was the toilet meaning very little privacy , Location cleanliness and staff were fantastic
