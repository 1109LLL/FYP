424045,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, The wifi was extremely slow We did not get bathrobes in last two nights , Great location and easy access to other parts of the city Also the guest desk provided useful tourists information 
424046,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, The pool and terrace were being renovated and unavailable There was little food available and the breakfast was incredibly expensive The local restaurants were good value although limited range of food For a good value breakfast go to the Nostrum 50 yards from hotel Not really a 4 experience , The friendly helpful staff 
424047,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n,No Negative, The decor is very modern and the rooms are very spacious The beds are extremely comfortable The fitness center is small but adequate with modern equipment The breakfast offering is superb there are plenty of options The hotel is very well kept and extremely clean The staff is very welcoming and friendly 
424048,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, It s just a note we booked for a dinner at their restaurant for the New Year s Eve and was somehow disappointed in a sense that there was no touch of festive atmosphere The table was not set for the occasion it was just like having your normal breakfast as it was also in the restaurant where they serve breakfast The staff tried their best and the food was not bad so in the end it was nice Just the bar guy he was very much understressed and did not even acknowledge that he could not prepare our cocktails and was passing our table as if he did not see us It was not very polite of him , The location cleanliness friendliness of the staff were superb Bed pillows were comfy Breakfast has so many choices and were excellent 
424049,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, TV is big but only has only spanish channels not even English The food in the restaurant is really good but the restaurant has no atmosphere better to go out for dinner even for a quick bite , Clean efficient very nice business hotel Everything in the room was good including the shower 
424050,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n,No Negative, Every thing was wobderful starting from chick in to check in to check out The location clean services style and staffs were great also i would like to provide aspecial thanks to Mr David he was friendly helpful and respectable
424051,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, Staff were lazy didn t encounter one member of staff that I didn t get the empression that they just wanted to be somewhere else Turn down service wasn t even what you would call travel lodge standard Security at the door looked rough Nice hotel but the staff ruin it , Very comfy bed Nice shower Great location
424052,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, We had made our reservation 2 months ahead of time Upon arrival we were told that no room with a large bed was available as we had requested Finally 2 single beds were made up into one large bed The room was very small Decor has priority over functionality Space was accorded to a very large chair that we did not use The chair was hiding the full lenght mirror that we could not use The small closet was located inside the bathroom The toilet was inches away from the bathtub Such a room pleasant to look at was not planned for two people who travel with luggage I do not call this comfort Considering the price we paid it was a big disappointment , Excellent breakfast Good lighting in bedroom Quality bed linen and comfortable bed Guest relations staff really helpfull Convenient location 
424053,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, Terrible unusable wifi in room during this trip Previous trip room at different location on the floor was much better , 2nd stay at this hotel once leisure once business Location is IMHO pretty good rooms are comfortably sized and clean Nespresso machine is a nice touch Breakfast is copious though doesn t change One can get fresh smoothies but need to know where to get them Staff is friendly 
424054,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, the restaurant food and service were not good waiters were not busy but stood around talking and i had to get my own menu card they charged 15 euros per hour for late check out on top of the high roomrate , room was good bed comfortable
424055,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, Room with big problems i e no warm water in the morning bathroom had an inappropriate scent We were offered to change the room and was given a replacement of a lower category though the staff insisted that it was the same standard with was less then half the size of the original one The restaurant food quality was not as could be expected for a restaurant belonging to a 5 hotel This is definitely NOT a 5 star hotel , location
424056,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, Nothing major Seems elevators need maintenance services, Excellent location recently renovated very clean rooms with comfortable bed Specious bath room great shower 
424057,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, Well we were charged nearly 33 each for breakfast whether it was a cup of coffee and a piece of toast or eat everything that was displayed Only at checking out did we find that if had ask there was an area for those who wanted a light breakfast so after the first day we ate at a local pub full English breakfast 12 big difference I booked for my brother to join us for a few days his accommodation was breakfast included our was just the bed , The staff make you feel special smile greet you at all times when not busy
424058,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, None at all, Great housekeeping service multiple times per day and wonderful area to explore the city of Barcelona as most hotspots are within walking distance
424059,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, There were inadequate drawers shelves in the rooms for us to put some of our personal items , The staff were all very pleasant helpful Location is excellent 
424060,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n,No Negative, Roof top pool was amazing The views were gorgeous Hotel was in an amazing location right on Las Ramblas hotel was super clean great staff that couldn t do enough for you Beds mega comfy room service excellent Clean towels every day chocolates on pillow slippers at bed side Excellent 
424061,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, The bed wasn t very comfortable also we asked the concierge to book a restaurant which they agreed to do and then forgot , Great location easy access to all the tourist attractions We could walk to everything from the hotel Good view of the city from the roof The breakfast was nice The gym is pretty small so we haven t rated excellent 
424062,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n,No Negative, We were celebrating a special anniversary and they upgraded our room Made it very special The only thing we didn t get was our genius reward of a bottle of wine from booking com
424063,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, Nothing unfavourable , Welcoming reception with iced drinks sweets Location literally ion doorstep of shops restaurants Well resourced room Security man at entrance always felt safe Would recommend to others without hesitation 
424064,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, Everything was great but maybe think of adding fans in the bathroom as it gets really hot and muggy after a shower , Excellent service very helpful staff Great location with many restaurants just in front of the hotel Shopping area is close grocery store just around the corner Rooms are quiet clean spacious and nicely decorated Candy and water always available by check out thought that was a great idea 
424065,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n,No Negative, It is a great renovated hotel close to the center city of Barcelona You can easily walk to the Ramblas The room was perfect just like the breakfast It was ideal to swim in the swimming pool at the roof of the hotel in the morning before visiting the city The view over the city from the swimming pool was great 
424066,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, The self service coffee machines at breakfast were a nightmare Very noisy when they worked Would be no more labour intensive to have staff pouring coffee as staff were having to help guests work the machines , Great location very comfortable beds and the rooftop pool is perfect for cooling off after a day s sightseeing 
424067,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, Air conditioning started automatically although turned off, The bed large TV and perfect location very close to Rambla and Gaudi houses with terraces also in front of the hotel
424068,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, Just for info the breakfast is 30 euro per person the parking 26 euro per day and the late check out 15 euro per hour , The location is great in rambla street 2 min walk from Catalonia plaza the hotel is clean and the valet parking is a good service
424069,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, The rooms and the bed are smaller than it seems on the picture gallery They don t have the king size bed but on booking com they have king size bed option The biggest they have is queen size bed which is small even for a couple or two single bed together The last option isn t comfortable because it has a gap between the two beds The staff is nice but The one who did our Check in Laura gave us a very small room and didn t want to give us a larger room and wasn t very friendly , The location was good the hotel was modern and new 
424070,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n,No Negative, We loved everything about the Hotel They upgraded our room because we were celebrating our special Birthday and anniversary there Made us feel special with little cakes on those dates Roof top pool and view was amazing Location was perfect Staff were super nice and they helped us from making reservation in a very hard to get into restaurant to finding our way around town Breakfast was the best part of waking up We loved the Hotel so much that we booked an extra day on our last day back from traveling to Cadeques to Barcelona For sure we go back and stay there 
424071,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, I arrived to hotel after a very long flight around 1 pm and my room was not ready I had to leave my luggage in the storage room and stroll around the area for couple of hours until my room was ready The room rate was somehow expensive but it was worth it , The location of the hotel is very central and in a vibrant Street few blocks away from La Rambla The hotel staff were very helpful and courtuous The breakfast buffet was very rich and there was even a corner for gluten free products The room was exactly as I requested and very clean It had a coffee maker and a kettle with a daily complimentary water bottle I would definitely recommend this hotel for a solo traveller or a couple visiting the city for work or leisure 
424072,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, We asked if we could check out at 2 a clock The portier said that we could have one hour and after that she had to charge us extra We stayed for 5 nights at a 5 star hotel so was this a big deal , The breakfast was very good with different choise of warm food and a very good selection of meat and cheese Cleaning was excellent Very good beds Staff was very good Location could not be better 
424073,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, Breakfast was disappointing low quality products poor service I had to look for someone to make eggs and they forgot to bring my order One day the room was not cleaned no place around the pool Quality over price rate is too small , I Like the sweemming pool the guest desk was very kind and helpful 
424074,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, With this price it has some rooms which are situated in dark place or some are interior with poor view First night we had unexpected room but the day after we asked them to change the room and they kindly did it , The location is great Breakfast is very good Kind staff 
424075,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, Limited common areas Checking in took a very long time around midnight as reception staff couldn t find our booking, Clean newish rooms good towels and quite a c
424076,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, The air extractor from the bathroom did not work and the shower floods the bathroom because it does not have a door The air conditioning made a lot of noise , The bed is very comfortable Very nice view from the room and from the rooftop terrace and pool 
424077,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, The internet does not work in any room this is my second stay here and both times it did not work a five star hotel should have descent service in this day and age, Great location great hotel comfort
424078,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, Wi Fi was very bad Connection was very poor in some parts of hotel including our room , Excellent location and very friendly staff Close to everywhere with bus or metro 
424079,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, Expensive breakfast but there is a snackbar by the hotel where you can sit down for a bite instead It has OK food and great coffee , Location helpful and friendly staff very nice and clean rooms
424080,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, they did not change my bed sheet it has stain on it and my room has a strong cigarettes smell when we first got in , great location very convenient great and very attentive staff 
424081,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, Lack of a bar at the rooftop pool could of had more facilities like a masseuse Hotel bar located in the restaurant wasn t a nice place to have a drink by yourself , The style of the hotel and the free upgrade I recieved
424082,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, The staff is very slow at check in They don t know the welcome drink in the beginning Breakfast 30euro pp is way too much, Room is clean Roof swimming pool view
424083,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, We left the room in the morning made some sightseeing tour and around 2 pm we have returned to the room to change our cloth The door was closed and when we opened it there was a cleaning lady quickly going out from our sleeping room and went to the bathroom When we entered the sleeping room we have seen it is already cleaned so we didn t understand why she went out from there once we have entered But then we found out there is our suitcase laying on the ground even so it was in the corridor s cabinet before we left the room in the morning After that we have discovered it is unlocked by an airport security key even so it was locked before we left When we asked the cleaning lady why has she manipulated with our suitcase she didn t answer as she didn t speak English Then we checked our second suitcase and we found out it was manipulated with it as well But the fact that in such hotel category someone tried to rob us was simply shocking When we said this to the customer service the only result was they have apologized for it but that s all they did No compensation for such behavior nothing Just saying we apologize And at the end when we have checked out the nicest surprise waited for us We have received the invoice having our address totally wrong It was written there that we are from Bucarest Rumania Croatia and Republica Checa Actually only the name was correct With kind regards, Great location
424084,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, Didn t have breakfast as it was very expensive , Pool and roof terrace were fabulous Great location but not noisy Lovely street for restaurants Great shower and bath Comfortable bed and pillows Staff were very polite and helpful 
424085,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, It was a mask from 5 star hotel Really it was a 3 star like lubby so small our room was small WC was damaged and smelling bad specially during midnight till morning , Location
424086,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, The price of the breakfast 30 head did discourage us we dit not try it Two napkins and an empty plastic glas drown in the swimming pool , Size and layout of the apartment Bed super comfortable Bathroom top clean modern and very well equipped Kind attentions like chocolates water etc welcoming us Well thought and elegant cupboards Free wifi Swimming pool on the roof with top view to the sea side Montjuic and Sagrada Familia Super friendly and helpful staff special thoughts to Vanessa who masters the town and exactly what would correspond to you is incredibly fluent in French and English front desk super smily you really feel welcome
424087,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, prices of the minibar ridiculous 4 50 Eur for a small coke calling roomservice for the same coke was 3 60 weird situation , Room was great pool a bit small but ok Nice staff well organized and everything very clean In the center of the city
424088,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, Breakfast a bit pricy at 32 Euroes pr person if you do not have the breakfst included , Perfect location within a short walk of the major attractions Nice rooms good aircontion soundproof windows nice bed and plenty of pilows Nice pool area at the roof with about 12 deck chairs and towels 
424089,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, Honestly the price was very steep I believe it was probably because it was almost peek season end of June We paid 777 AUD for two nights which is super expensive for us the most we paid for a hotel on our whole European trip and although it was a five star hotel I just didn t see the value for money it wasn t that impressive sorry , This hotel was lovely we had a great time here and loved Barcelona Firstly the staff were very helpful There was a dedicated staff member to provide advice on what sights to see where to go to eat shop which was very helpful We only had two days in Barcelona but we managed to fit in the main sights with help from the hotel staff The location was excellent I don t think we could have gotten better It was just a few hundred meters from the main street in Barcelona La Rambla and right near the beautiful Catalunya Square It was easy to get to everything and in walking distance to loads of restaurants and shops The actual hotel was in a very modern style with all the amenities you would want Our room was very spacious with nice furnishings and functional spaces especially the bathroom It is a five star hotel so you would expect nothing less It also had a beautiful pool area on the rooftop Level 11 with magnificent views you could literally see everything including all the main sights and the ocean Wow and you could even order food and drinks and laze on the deck chairs up there Very good service I would highly recommend this hotel based on the location staff and service 
424090,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, Room was a little dirty and dusty and the pool area could do with some attention, Loved the bar staff MSK was amazing Reception and guest services fabulous 
424091,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, the internet is terrible in room could not use it unless in lobby Considering a five star this day and age internet should work This one my one complaint , Location cant be beat and the hotel is clean rooms are good size and staff is friendly Overall super hotel 
424092,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, On our last day the door lock to our room was changed out for a sensor lock with no communication that this was being done We had to go back down to the desk get a new key come back up A little note on the doors or by the elevators would have been nice , The rooms were clean contemporary The bed was very comfortable The breakfast buffet Marta s friendly face each morning was a highlight of this property Well done This hotel is also in a very central location great for getting around 
424093,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, A little pricey That said most 5 star hotels in the Eixample are just as pricey , Fantastic location Great breakfast Very nice and friendly staff 
424094,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, There was no iron or ironing board in the room and my travelling companion forgot a toothbrush Housekeeping delivered both promptly I just expected to have those things in the room already rather than have to call for them , This hotel is on a busy street with lots of restaraunts etc but the room was super quiet and I didn t hear a thing going on outside while I slept I also truly appreciated the full size hair dryer and beautiful shower with great pressure 
424095,NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calder n, The hotel overcharged my credit card for EUR30 10 but only EUR20 10 was refunded in cash Now I understand why they not credited back to the card Bathroom door is very difficult to close and make a loud noise to close Could not double locked both of our 2 rooms as they were broken A lot of dust under sofa no carpet on room floor as it made of ceramic tile make my feet cold when walking and loud noise when moving luggages , Good location Not far from subway Free regular speed wifi faster speed has to be purchased
