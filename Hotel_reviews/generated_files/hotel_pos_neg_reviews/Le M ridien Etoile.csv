252960,Le M ridien Etoile, The door key that turns on the electricity is annoying but I understand that wasteful use is expensive , Loved the Jazz Club Great entertainment Went with my grandson and he really enjoyed the location the food the room was very comfortable The breakfast was wonderful This was my second visit to this hotel and I will return again at my next opportunity The restaurants near the hotel were as good as I remembered from my last visit The hotel was very helpful in making sure that we got the twin beds that I was concerned about I called Booking com practically every day before this trip and was told that I could only find out when I checked in whether I could have a twin room or not This aggravation was unacceptable In future I will use a travel agent 
252961,Le M ridien Etoile, It took more than 30 minutes three calls and two trips down to concierge and reception to finally get my luggage up in the room Except once I had to call the reception or guest relations several times for every request I had during my stay Many times no one even picked up the phone WiFi was awful very very slow with countless disconnections , The room was clean contemporary and had a good view Check in did not take long and went on smoothly Breakfast buffet was large and varied Bed was comfortable 
252962,Le M ridien Etoile, Room faced very noisy street vending machine charges Euro 8 for a beer toilet cubicle extremely small reception staff very indifferent towards guests at check in , Good location for walking tours comfortable bed 
252963,Le M ridien Etoile, Regarding the Parking it was mentioned in the hotel facilities description that parking is available for 35 euros day However I stayed for three days and I was charged for 4 days This is not the 1st time happen to me with this hotel Moreover I always found mistakes with my billing during when I check out from the hotel Some time extra food others eating from the lobby restaurant I end up always with asking to talk to the manager and the manager of course as usual refuses to show up and finally he show up and correct the bill which is not practical ,No Positive
252964,Le M ridien Etoile, Dear Sir We do not know why there is a no show charge put on one of our bookings when we were present for all the days booked by our party of 4 Please investigate and rectify the mistake and cancellation fee We are perturbed by this although the we have no complaints on the location of the hotel Regards , location is convenient with lots of eating places nearby
252965,Le M ridien Etoile, The room was very cold and there was a draft from the window Noisy and too busy breakfast area , Comfortable bed and quiet room facing the back asked specifically for this 
252966,Le M ridien Etoile, The price is high but it s worth it , The bed was very comfortable shower fantastic staff very friendly clean modern good wifi didn t try breakfast so don t know Will stay there again Location is great 
252967,Le M ridien Etoile, breakfast was very crowded Therefore there was not much choice and table as rather uncomfortable , Staff very nice esp concierge and people at reception desk were very helpfull Nice comfortable rooms Cosy bar with life music for an evening drink On walking distance to Bois de Boulogne and the Vuiton museum easily to be reached by Metro 
252968,Le M ridien Etoile, the room was littel and there is no cafe or tea maker in the room and the refrigerator was empty, it s near the station and the workers were polite they gave us our room immediately hotel was so big and had very good bar and lobby to seat and relax and talk had good breakfast
252969,Le M ridien Etoile, Room has no amenities No kettle no coffee maker Room have no view , Location is amazing Breakfast is good Once I changed rooms it was pretty good 
252970,Le M ridien Etoile, Upfront payment and additional euro 500 as safety margin as if we will escape and when asked why reception staff said because your reservation was through Booking com and this is the way we act as hotel policy towards such visitors coming through them,No Positive
252971,Le M ridien Etoile, Pressure of water in the toilets was not up to the mark , Yes it was and we even checked the brand of the comfortable mattress Breakfast was enjoyed at different places in Paris 
252972,Le M ridien Etoile, there are not drink water when we reach to the hotel not coffe and sugar inside the room thats very important when any visitor reach to the hotel ,No Positive
252973,Le M ridien Etoile, The air condition was not working They changed my work but it was not working at that room as well They brought a heater but the heater also didnt work after 3 minutes The room was cold and then I found out that even the window had hole near its holder It is not at all a good hotel especially for that high price that they charge they charge almost 250 Euro per night but their services compared to other hotels only worth 40 Euro per night It is even not a real 2 star hotel let alone 4 star , The breakfast was good 
252974,Le M ridien Etoile, Nothing it was all great , Close to several restaurants staff was very helpful and friendly spoke our language Hotel rooms were clean Perfect The jazz club was icing on the cake

252977,Le M ridien Etoile,No Negative, Located in in a really nice area down a short road from some cafes and restaurants and a very short trip to the arc All staff were helpful and friendly no rudeness or coldness about being non French speakers It s a very large hotel with a very vibrant entrance hall if you re like me and prefer that atmosphere rather than a small and not very populated place

252979,Le M ridien Etoile, The reception desk was not very communicative The lights in the room turned on only by putting the room key card in a slot by the door It is such an unusual way to turn on the lights in a room that one would think that the the desk clerk would tell you We also shut the door with the key cards in the room We went to the reception desk and they issued us another card without telling us that the original key cards were invalid And last but not least we were charged 57 00 euros for 4 drinks at the bar We expected higher charges but not enormous charges We paid 12 euros for the same drinks at a cafe down the street We really left with sadness about our experience The last time we were there they were much more efficient Seems like the arrogance of the French towards tourists is coming back Too bad the city was basically empty of tourists No waiting for popular sites ,No Positive
