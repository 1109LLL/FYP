485832,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, We could not have an early breakfast on the day of our departure it had to be requested way more in advance than we thought, The public transportation is very close to the hotel There is also a 24 7 store within walking distance Very quiet area Comfy bed and a minibar in the room
485833,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, The breakfast was quite minimal and the rooms a bit dated , The staff were very professional and polite The room was quiet and spacious The room and hotel were kept very clean 
485834,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, The shower was very small so it wasn t comfortable The hotel is quite old with outdated decore , The staff was incredibly nice and helpful The hotel location is great I am vegan so I was scared that there were not going to be many options for me at breakfast but they were waiting for me with vegan croissants which was a very nice touch The bed is very confortable the shower is small but has a nice water pressure The rooms are wide clean and have everything you could need for your stay even a minibar and a boiler 
485835,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, The staff could have been a little bit more friendly For example we were not told at check in whether we had breakfast or not We had to ask extra the first evening we came back to the hotel and it turned out that we did have breakfast included You know how it is nowadays you never know what s included and what not We went to try the breakfast once and unfortunately we were pretty late a couple of minutes before closing times However there was still food left at the buffet and we wanted to take a couple of croissants with coffee Then one of the waiters came and took the food literally from our hands We found that to be quite unprofessional We didn t go down to breakfast anymore since there were many options around the hotel where you can get a nice Italian coffee with a nice panini Also the coffee from the coffee machine at the breakfast buffet can hardly be called coffee Seriously it s that bad The management should take a look at what they are offering Another thing was the knocking on the door at 9 a m from the housekeeping staff This was probably the worst part of our stay since we were exploring the city till late and we always like to walk around and experience things so sleeping in was essential for us Unfortunately housekeeping came knocking on the door at 9 a m and 9 30 a m So there was no sleeping in , The property is overall nice The area is very calm and it seems that it s safe There is a subway station two minutes away within walking distance from the hotel It takes around 15 20 minutes to get to the centre where the cathedral is The room was spacious the A C was working nice and the wi fi unlike in most places was actually working with a decent speed 
485836,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, breakfast could be more diversified excellent wi fi signal in the hotel lobby but weak wi fi signal in the room, great location very close to metro station Gerusalemme from where you can easily reach city center or train stations Garibaldi and Milano Centrale quiet and very clean room with air conditioning and comfy bed excellent minibar towels changed everyday friendly and helpful staff possibility to use a computer with internet access and printer in the hotel lobby secured baggage room very good pastries at breakfast
485837,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, Weird shower very very small shower straight out of the Dr Who Tardis Breakfast very chaotic as tables on top of each other, Good service lovely sheets good towel excellent parking email
485838,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, I didn t like that the room was not taken care off very well I found sushi left from another visitor in the fridge and that the bathroom s tap was broken and it looked like superficial fixed , Good breakfast and coffee if you ask for it to be done fresh not from the coffee machine Comfortable bed and enough space for a couple 
485839,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, There was no iron and when I asked for one I was given a snarky remark instead of an offer to have my things pressed for me Half the staff is great the other cannot be bothered to say good morning to the guests Generally people in the hospitality business should be hospitable , The room was clean and on par with comparable modern properties Bed was comfortable bathroom was well appointed 
485840,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, The mattress was a bit too hard for my taste Furniture and overall look a bit obsolete The staff I would not say rude but rather indifferent and unfriendly Breakfast low in options but the coffee is very good , Very clean rooms the towels are changed every day Good Wi fi The bed is extremely generous I had two interconnected rooms one with a double bed actually resulting from the union of two single and one with two singles The bathroom is a bit cramped but equipped with the necessary ones a plus for the existence of the bidet even a little above average the bathroom or the shower in the children s room with hydromassage I don t like to use the hydromassage so I don t know if they re actually work but i assume so 
485841,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, Some mornings the cleaners housekeeping staff were noisy not mindful that guests can hear them from the room and at the corridors Guests are tired and are looking forward to a restful and peaceful night so they must be quiet Sometimes the wifi got cut , Speedy check in thanks to Jessica who was very friendly and very helpful Front office staff namely Guiseppe and Daniel were likewise very attentive to my needs and very polite and accommodating lent me scissors and packing tape pen etc People at the bar namely Renze and Giaco also gave superb service Breakfast had plenty of choices bread jam croissants eggs hotdogs cold cuts cheese salad items coffee machine was excellent Sufficient to take you for a day of fun touring and shopping in Milan I felt very safe in the area Hotel is in the middle of 2 Metro stations Domodossola and Gethsemane I prefer to use the tram where S19 takes you direct to Duomo Bus at next street may also take you to Cairoli Sforza Castle Needless to say location was excellent to public transportation Big plus was a huge supermarket 2 blocks away where one can even get cooked food like pasta sushi grilled chicken and more Check out was also fast a guy helped me with my luggage My preferred hotel in Milan Oh and lastly i was able to use the computer at the lobby for online check in and have it printed by front office Little things add up to a great experience 
485842,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, Dissapointing brekfast for a 4 star hotel Not much choice for hot drink Coffee was not very good Staff at check in was very rude We did not feel welcomed His behaviour was unacceptable Checking out was with a lady was fine, Near metro station Quite and pieceful 
485843,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, Location a little outside of Milan but it s a nice walk to get there Some staff seemed a bit off , Good price quiet location Good breakfast selection 
485844,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, Nothing important really i have stayed in more luxurious 4 star hotels but it only matters if you care for luxuries The breakfast lacked fresh fruits and fresh juice and the TV had a limited choice of stations Practically i can say nothing negative , The location next to a metro station and less than half an hour from the city center The breakfast was rich i enjoyed the cakes and croissants The room was very clean and the bed very comfortable The personel was very polite especially Roberto who accepted my request for a water boiler and the Sicilian lady at the reception who helped me with a difficulty i had with the initial wifi connection The area was very quiet and safe Overall a pleasant stay and definetely a choice i would return if i were to visit Milano again 
485845,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, When booking a room with cancellation option immediately dropped money for one night A taxi cost from Malpensa airport to the hotel 100 euros Quite far from the city center , Clean room comfortable bed good breakfast A beautiful park not far from the hotel Metro station is close 
485846,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, The wine got wrong right after opening the bottle by an impact of the foul air in the room Even the way to get rid of that wine was a bit tricky as the sink was clogged Air conditioning was not ready TV remote is working for men only It doesn t react on female s button presses , Nice people receptionists breakfast was fine Location is very close to metro that s a very big advantage Room was clean It is the value for the money 
485847,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, The breakfast was a bit poor and the coffee from the machine was probably a soluble Nescafe , The room as well as the bathroom was clean and tidy The hotel is well accessible as it is located conveniently near to the Gerusalemme metro station On some days there is a market on the street just next to the hotel You can find fresh fruit and veggies as well as clothing and shoes etc 
485848,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, 1 View for the window is boring you see just the opposite side of the street however very good windows make the room quiet 2 Monotony on the breakfasts the choice is not bad but this is all the time the same choice I have been already 4 or 5 time in this hotel and almost nothing changed in the breakfast menu 3 Air condition it looks like it is somehow switched off out of the season Staying in February and March I was not able despite of trying many positions o the switches to make the machine cooling the room I like when it is not to hot , 1 Very well located You are in 2 minutes in Metro Milan has a very nice network of subway If you have some spare time you can enjoy also walking to the Parco Sempione and then to Castello Sforzesco and Duomo lazy walk took me around 1 5h please bear in mind that I am slow walker 2 Very comfortable bed 3 Friendliness of the staff 
485849,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, Breakfast was less varied compared to the pictures no fresh fruits and vegetables Also it was 100 the same everyday so it wasn t very satisfying ,No Positive
485850,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, TOO HOT IN THE ROOM DUE TO UNSEASONABLY WARM WEATHER SO WE HAD TO KEEP THE WINDOW OPEN THIS MEANT THAT THE ROOM WAS VERY NOISY IN THE NIGHT THE STAFF WEREN T VERY HELPFUL ABOUT THIS RECOMMENDING THAT WE JUST KEEP THE HEATING OFF WE HADN T TURNED IT ON BUT THEY COULD AT LEAST HAVE OFFERED US A FAN FOR THE STAY THE BREAKFAST WAS MEDIOCRE FOR A 4 STAR HOTEL BETTER RANGE OF BREAD I E HEALTHIER BREAD AND ALSO FOR THE TOASTER THE COFFEE WASN T VERY GOOD AND THE CEREAL WAS FAR TOO SWEET A RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO OFFER HEALTHIER OPTIONS LOWER SUGAR CONTENT AND ALSO DIFFERENT TYPES OF MILK , NICE BATHROOM AND COMFORTABLE BED
485851,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, The breakfast hour better lasts until 11 am The room rate was a bit expensive but it was during Milan fashion week so still acceptable , Love the breakfast and the restaurants nearby The staffs are very nice 
485852,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, This hotel was a disappointment it makes me doubt about the entire star system not sure if it is really worth believing in it There s a lack of some basic services here there was no coffee machine or anything to warm up water to make a tea inside the room The TV was tiny and the remote control was not working properly Also the room needs a refurbishing It looked a bit 1960s But the worst part of the entire experience was the internet It s really slow and it doesn t work in all the rooms to make my flight check in I had to be in the floor hall close to the elevator as it didn t work inside my room nor in the hotel lobby when I tried there I would recommend booking another hotel , Location was actually the only positive aspect of this hotel although the subway pink line is not the best one because you always need to make a connection but if you are on holidays and have time on your hand you can walk downtown It takes about 30 minutes to 1 hour 
485853,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, I saw filling scrambled eggs from the plastic bucket at breakfast and it looked horrible and unsanitary otherwise ok, very very good destination clean room helpful staffs 
485854,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, The metro line doesn t get you directly to the city centre and you need to change line but not a big hassle , Everything was nice and the staff very friedly The hotel is close to metro station the bed was big and comfortable The room was clean and the breakfast very nice 
485855,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, little choice coffee is a disgrace there are far better machines than that thing you have in the breakfast room no brown bread, Very large room very quiet comfy hotel small bar 
485856,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera,No Negative, Daniele and Charles were extremely nice to us and even offered us another room after we complained about noise in our actual room Top Service The breakfast was fresh and good A nice hotel if you re interested in Soccer because San Siro Stadion is very close Good hotel for dog owners 
485857,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, The beds are very hard and the pillows are very thinice but that was the case in all the hotels Just different from the States Also the hair dryer was very awkward , The hotel was lovely and so was the staff The staff was extremely helpful with all of our questions The breakfast was delicious The hotel very close to the train station and it made it very easy to see the city 
485858,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, This is not a 4 star hotel it is really a good 3 star hotel but the price is also appropriate , Good location close to metro station Quiet clean and comfortable rooms Breakfast also not bad for Italy Friendly reception staff Private parking 
485859,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, We had to wait long for checking in , Optimal located next to the metro station Gerusalemme line M5 or purple line Direct access to the Stazione Centrale with the tram Nr 10 and to the station Cadorna with the tram Nr 1 fast and direct connection from to airport Malpensa to from both railway stations The Duomo and the Teatro alla Scala as well the fashion district are also reachable with the tram Nr 1 13 14 stops 
485860,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, Breakfast was poor no vegetables and eggs was not on my taste It was the worst coffee I drink in Italy , Hotel has a good position 5 minutes of metro subway 2 stations 20 minutes of Park Sempione and easy to go to city center It s a supermarket at 5 minutes of walk The room is clean and staff is polite WiFi has a good signal and speed is ok 
485861,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, A bit pricey but this is apparently common to Milan hotels it turns out that also in low season Breakfast could be a bit better and include ANY vegetables like tomatoes cucumbers Prices at hotel restaurant very high , Great location Just 50m from metro station Gerusalemme but you can even get to Sempione Park and further to Sforza Castle on foot Area seemed safe and quiet Clean and comfortable rooms friendly and attentive reception staff My special request at time of booking was fulfilled which is I think the 1st hotel that did it 
485862,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, Cleaning especially under the bed should be improved no gym available poor breakfast, Very good and friendly staff at the reception desk helped me to find gym restaurant etc
485863,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, Our mini ref did not work had to be replaced Problem solved after 1 day It was important because it was very hot July and we needed cold drinks badly Other room we booked 2 rooms had defective airconditioning so they had to transfer to another room the following night after a guest checked out hotel was probably full It was inconvenient as we had a long list of places to visit but at least they did something Replacement room was better spacious and you can have a massage by a machine while taking a shower They were probably upgraded , Speedy check in all Front Desk staff were accommodating partucularly sorry forgot names was it Charles or Lawrence who helped us get ice it was peak of summer Another guy in Front Desk helped us book a big taxi to airport for our departure Free simple but tasty breakfast was an added plus We particulaly liked the location because we can take bus tram or train direct to Duomo and Sforza Castle Hotel is between Domodossola Station and Gerusalemme station so it was easy to go anywhere Big supermarket with ready to eat cooked food is only 2 blocks away so we never go hungry Room was clean and beds were comfortable 
485864,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, Our mini fridge did not work it was peak of summer and we desperately needed cold drinks and it took 2 days to be repaired replaced Kettle was not provided but was delivered upon request All in all front desk was responsive to our requests , Close to transportation buses tram Metro Huge supermarket nearby 200 mts Free breakfast was good Front desk Charles 2 young girls everyone else was helpful and attentive check in was swift Because it was summer Renz at the bar accommodated us with some ice for our drinks Room was clean They kept our luggage after check in since we had a late night flight Front desk assisted us in booking a big taxi to airport Enjoyed our stay 
485865,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, Breakfast could have been better for sure selection was limited However the hotel was great overall so this is a very minor minus point , The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated Location is central Staff was great
485866,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, on front desc call a taxi for us to Malpensa airport and the guy say it will cost you 70 80 eur but taxi driver say 95 and we argue little, everything was great quiet room perfect bad good breakfast
485867,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, Room needed renovation badly there was wet on carpet each time after shower door mouldy from wet No ventilation in Bathroom Breakfast really not 4 star but not to bad would really sugest to change that Scramble egg dish it was very unpleasant in all ways you have to change metro to get to city center , Location is not bad near metro station Room was cleaned very well There is shop other side of the hotel 
485868,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, More vegetables in the breakfast teh room was really old water pressure in shower was low , The breakfast was good and the bad was comfortable ice shop ice cream near the hotel Good location for public transport
485869,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, It is a little old with very basic facilities Hotel has no iron very inconvenient to business travellers The electricity in our room tripped 3 times withing a night and reasons given was someone use some high voltage electrical items unacceptable for a 4 star hotel Cleaniless to be improved there was worm inside room , Location is good close to Underground 
485870,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, Breakfast poorly Better quitting For a 4 star hotel it was embarrassing , Staff extremely polite and helpful The hotel is located close to transport 
485871,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, For 4stars no extra amenities but for short stay not very important I guess , Liked the area where hotel is very nice part of town close by is beautifull park close enough to city center and we walked as is pleasant area metro station few hundreds meter from hotel staff is very helpfull and nice breakfast is good all in all would stay there again garage is for sure very usefull 
485872,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, Breakfast was average at most good selection of sweets but lack of hot dishes and more choices of bread and toppings Location is good in terms of being near to a metro station but not very central overall , Quick check in friendly staff and comfy bed Room and bathroom are spacious and of high standard 
485873,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, Lack of iron , Everything was perfect The guy at the reception was amazing He gave us a map and explain us in details what we should see and which places areas we must visit The best ice cream in Milan is at the back of the hotel 
485874,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, Upon Checkin I ve been welcomed by Unfriendly sad receptionists stay away from this hotel However the Philipino barman was very friendly They Don t answer the phone when you call them A 4 star hotel that doesnt not have any ironing and laundry facility and they dont even provide an iron just incase the guests can use it They Didnt even bother to help or assist us on finding a laundry place near by despite telling them that we are here to attend a wedding They responded Its basically your problem The Tv in the room is very old and the Remote is not working This is not a 4 star hotel its a 2 3 star hotel Dont be fooled by the reviews , The room is clean 
485875,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, the bathroom had a pblem on the shower and the water wa falling into the carpet of the coridor The rest room bed etc was good value for money , the breakfast was normal not very rich but omleta was not good prepared had a strage taste of many times used oil boiled egg some fruits but the tasted of the juice was bad 
485876,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, It is kind of far from Milan central station You have to take two trains in order to reach the hotel but still the hotel deserves every euro paid , The hotel has many facilities and very clean The staff were very kind and helpful
485877,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, The biggest problem is that the bathroom has no ventilation at all no windows no other means of ventilation whatsoever Unfortunately this is a common problem in hotels in general So not only that it gets like the sauna in the bathroom but also it is quite annoying that you have to use the toilet in the lobby well if you are sensitive to the smell that stays and won t go away We missed having kettle in the room but those are only for the superior rooms Unfortunately the majority of the staff working at the reception was not friendly at all apart from one man We had no problem with the location we knew in advance that it is not in the city centre but it s important to know that it is a 45 minutes walk to the centre The metro station is only 2 minutes walk but you have to change lines in order to get to the centre Or you can take the tram which would take you to the centre within 35 minutes , Beautiful hotel very clean impeccable and the regular rooms are comfortable size Very bright with big windows good air con and in a very nice area close to Sempione park Great price too with breakfast included There is minibar in the room which comes handy Also there is a big supermarket within 4 5 minutes walk 
485878,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, Although I thought I chose a none smoking room it had seemed like smokers had the room before , Very nice place to stay Perfect distance to walk to Mico Congress 15 min and right off of Corso Sempione leading right into Domo A good walk but I did it several times in visiting cafes and sights to see The breakfast buffet is the best I have had in Italy Many choices of things to eat My favorite was the mixed fruit The subway was 2 min away where I could travel to Central station The front desk was helpful and professional I would definitely stay again 
485879,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, our flight was at 6 AM so we had to leave around 3 for the airport We tried for 3 times to pay for the room on the first day but were declined every time saying that it will only take 2 minutes to pay when we leave And surprise at 3 AM the POS lines weren t working and because we didn t have any cash left there was a bit of moment of panic for the receptionist In the end we agreed to charge the room through the booking system since they already had the accounts and they got the money on the next day they promised they will pack the breakfast for the next day and we didn t get it although we paid for it no free parking but we could find parking spaces close by 1 2 euro hour, nice location close to 2 metro stations 35 minutes walking distance to the Doumo di Milan nice comfy bed great wifi
485880,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera,No Negative, Very good choice considering that Milan is primarily an urban setting for tourists The hotel is primarily a business hotel but still made it very easy for tourists The staff were friendly and courteous and provided great guidance around the city The breakfast was great too The hotel is a few steps away from metro station as well as places to eat 
485881,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, A little old furniture When the neighbors are loud you can hear it all , Was really very clean had a good connection with the city center and the staff was very kind Breakfast also satisfying and tasted good We had a really great time 
485882,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, The food was not always filled in time at brekafast if it was eaten out , The location of hotel is good there is tram stop The Wi Fi has high speed The breakfast is good the bed is comfortable 
485883,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, The parking was for low height cars we had a Thulle on ours so we couldn t get inside also the receptionist told us the price per night for the parking is 20 euros per night but he could arrange it to be 20 euros 2 nights is it a central market we re bargaining in or a 4 star hotel The bathroom had no ventilation nor window so it got pretty humid after taking a shower The breakfast was satisfactory but I ve seen way better in other even 3 star hotels Fun fact there was no chocolate cream whatsoever the first hotel I couldn t get my morning Nutella sandwich And pay attention the price you see on booking is not the final one turns out you have to pay extra 5 euros person night Milan tourist tax apparently which led us to a nice 40 euros in the final payment , The location relatively downtown have to walk about 30 min to be really in the centre of the city the metro is close
485884,ADI Hotel Poliziano Fiera, Hotel is located is in very nice part of the city but I did not like that you need to change 2 metro lines to get to the city centre It lasts around 30 minites to get to Duomo by foot or metro , Very nice hotel double room was quite small breakfast was nice personal was helpfull
