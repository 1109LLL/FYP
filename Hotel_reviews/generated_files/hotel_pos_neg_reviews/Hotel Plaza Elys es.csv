73015,Hotel Plaza Elys es, Still a little tight space in room makes it crowded with 2 people but expected in Paris where space is at a premium , Clean and modern facility located in residential area but within five minutes of the Champs lys es and another 5 minutes to the Arc de Triumph Breakfast included fresh croissants fruit some hot foods in a spacious and clean room Thoroughly enjoyed this air conditioned facility 
73016,Hotel Plaza Elys es, No porter to assist with luggage to room Mean on the supplies for the room 2 x decaf coffee no full strength I can t stand decaf and we usually have 2 coffees each of a morning especially when we are out of our time zone and awake at 4 in the morning The toiletries were pump bottles bolted to the wall If this had been a 3 star 100 night hotel I would understand but at this price come on What I didn t like was the room tariffs posted at reception were less than what I paid through booking com Felt a little ripped off by this , Quality rooms and fixtures Very modern and a little quirky Reception is a bit of a menagerie which was nice different This Hotel is not far from the center Just a short walk 10 mins for us to the metro and Champ Elysees Comfortable sleep 
73017,Hotel Plaza Elys es, Rooms were small which is a rule for Paris but still no restaurant or opportunity to have a cup of coffee inside, Hotel was really good excellent situation there is an underground parking nearby not free of course not a modern one but very decent for Paris Clean and friendly 
73018,Hotel Plaza Elys es, We struggled to find an open restaurant on Saturday night by the hotel but there were a couple open You just need to go down to the Main Street by the metro though as I m sure those restaurants will be open on a Saturday , Great location being only a 10 minute walk from George V metro station which is in view of the Arc di Triomphe and then another 5 minutes or less to be standing in front of it Lots of restaurants around and the Main Street by the metro is very lively and good atmosphere The staff were also friendly and helpful Good selection for the breakfast buffet and the gentleman that worked there was very friendly 
73019,Hotel Plaza Elys es, The fact that money was stolen from our room And we were made to feel like we were lying The view was terrible The bed was hard , The interior design is good Close to the champs elysee 
73020,Hotel Plaza Elys es, Liked everything about my stay at this hotel What s not to like , Lovely staff very warm and friendly special mention to Deborah who ensured that we made the most of our trip to Paris and while checking out Jennet who too was very friendly and efficient Location and room wise the hotel is value for money Keep up with the awesome work 
73021,Hotel Plaza Elys es, Breakfast was standard staff pleasant but struggled to cope with demand on one day Did not appreciate being woken by reception at 4 55am to be told our driver had arrived when we had not booked one , Room good and very clean reasonably comfortable bed toiletries good quality Staff friendly and helpful Hotel easy to find and very easy to get around on foot Local bar restaurant Marion s was excellent but there was something nearby to suit every budget 
73022,Hotel Plaza Elys es, Small bathroom with a weird slide door that didn t allow for privacy but normal to other Paris hotels we ve stayed at , The breakfast was very good and the staff was lovely 
73023,Hotel Plaza Elys es, The breakfast was a disappointment but that s in most hotels in Paris A small croissant with fresh orange juice and some other standard items you expect should not cost 18 euro s So I would suggest one of the many bakeries , My room was street facing but no noise from the busy traffic at all The walk in shower Yes no bathtub here is working great but be advised that the entire floor gets wet as the divider is to short I guess housekeeping is okay with this The room has enough storage and a window you can fully open Good internet and the option to connect the PC with HDMI to stream Netflix There is a nice little bar restaurant next door with a small terrace Very busy so do come early you can eat and drink for a very affordable price and good quality The decoration of reception and breakfast room is not to my taste seems a bit chaotic with bling bling everywhere But it s not a bother for me Staff is very friendly and speak very good English I would book again 
73024,Hotel Plaza Elys es, No sign indication of the hotel outside the hotel People will have to enter the lobby to find out if this is hotel plaza elysees , The staff was really very helpful great 
73025,Hotel Plaza Elys es, The wooden floors in the rooms got awoken a few times by people dragging furniture across the floor It would of been nice to have a bar in the hotel to chill out in the evening , Room was clean and tidy and the staff were informative and helpful 
73026,Hotel Plaza Elys es, Nothing, Room size was bigger than most typical Parisian hotels Staff was very helpful and very polite especially the young lady at the desk during the day shift Compared to more expensive hotels in the same area this is one of the best Close to all major public transpositions 
73027,Hotel Plaza Elys es, breakfast is way too expensive they charge 10 euros for a coffe and pastry but there are lots of caffes nearby , Amazing location cozy room My friend felt sick and they let her stay one hour longer for free after check out 
73028,Hotel Plaza Elys es, Breakfast very expensive at 10 or 18, Lovely room with excellent shower and very comfortable bed in a warm room Great location for sight seeing Would definitely stay here again 
73029,Hotel Plaza Elys es, to add more meat and friuts choice at breakfast, Very very good room and all in room a bit tiny but so comfortable that you forget about the small size Beautiful elegant furniture Very cheerful FDA Good location Quite rich ample of choice at breakfast 
73030,Hotel Plaza Elys es,No Negative, I had an excellent stay at the hotel The hotel is a stones throw away from the Champs lys es and handy for the Charles De Gaulle metro station and also Gare De Nord station The hotel staff were super friendly extremely helpful and helped us with directions and booking tickets for Disneyland Our room was spacious modern and clean Would definitely stay at the hotel again when I return to Paris 
73031,Hotel Plaza Elys es, I had a robbery problem in hotel While I was going to airport I noticed that my duty free package was left in the room I opened my baggage but it wasnt there Then I immediately called the hotel but they didnt find it I have never had a situation like this before I will never prefer this hotel anymore and no one will make a reservation to this hotel ,No Positive
73032,Hotel Plaza Elys es, They ask for the town tax in the last day 18 euro 2 person 3 nights it is too much 1 6x2x3 is 9 9 The person from reception ask me 18 euro and give me no bill That was not good , Position room personal style and cleaning services 
73033,Hotel Plaza Elys es, It would have been nice if there was a lobby with some seating , The friendly and helpful staff especially the female receptionist The comfy beds and excellent location 
73034,Hotel Plaza Elys es,No Negative, The lady at the reception was really friendly and helpful She was very approachable and was keen to help us answer any queries that we had She also went out of her way to provide food service by for example helping us change our euro notes to coins so that we could take the bus without hassle 
73035,Hotel Plaza Elys es, The room was tiny the shower didn t have a door or curtain so when you took a shower the water got everything wet the breakfast buffet wasn t ready on time all 3 days We had to wait outside for her to open the door 15 min and then only half the food was out There was only AC in your room so the moment you open your door it would suck the air out of your lungs , Very close to shopping
73036,Hotel Plaza Elys es, Room too hot when its off or too cold when air condition was on , Nice and friendly hotel lovely decoration easy walking distance to the lovely shopping in Champ Elyse and museum 
73037,Hotel Plaza Elys es,No Negative, Great location friends few day get away great base to see the sights Helpful and friendly staff enjoyed my stay Will suggest to others who are hoping to visit the local area Hotel interior was modern yet Parisienne vibe Hotel was spotlessly clean excellent
73038,Hotel Plaza Elys es, There is no lip guard to keep water from the shower from running out onto the rest of the bathroom floor The AC control panel didn t work Both minor inconveniences just put the bath mat down and open a window , Excellent location only a few blocks from the Arc de Triumph and Champs Elysees The room was comfortable and clean The bathroom was nice with great towels and even a set of scales There were ample sockets for charging cameras phones tablets etc one was even a USB port no adapter needed 
73039,Hotel Plaza Elys es,No Negative, Fantastic service Denis at reception was super helpful Great rooms and very quiet everything was in order and spotless Awesome location I frequently travel to Paris and have stayed in variety of hotels throughout Champs elysee and by far this was one of the best 
73040,Hotel Plaza Elys es, The breakfast room seemed very understaffed Despite the very hard work of the server several people were left with nowhere to sit after which little food was out and available this was only at 8 30am , Great location comfortable clean room Staff very friendly and helpful 
73041,Hotel Plaza Elys es,No Negative, Excellent hotel clean and modern with comfy beds Great buffet breakfast Good location overall to see the sights of Paris from Will definitely stay here again 
73042,Hotel Plaza Elys es, The girl at the reception The room service was poor in options, Bed like a cloud Bathroom was clean Entrance hall in the hotel The bathtub The shower gels and body cream
73043,Hotel Plaza Elys es, 1 Room size just enough for 1 person but a couple may feel slightly squeezed 2 Breakfast price of 20 euros seems unreasonable, 1 nice balcony in the room 2 bed softness is ideal 3 decent breakfast apart for the price 4 Great location
73044,Hotel Plaza Elys es, There was a construction in the hotel and was a noise almost all the day the rooms are very small our room was not enough for even to keep our bags the breakfast is not convenient , Location is very good clean and helpful staff 
73045,Hotel Plaza Elys es, One night during the stay I called the same number also for asking a question this time was another person answered my call and he was very very rude he hung up my first call before I finished my first sentence I thought it might not be intentional at first so I called him the second time then I heard he said that if I called the number again he would call the police How could you say that before you listen to me and know why I called you , Before I booked the room I called the hotel for asking some information the person talked with me was very nice and helpful 
73046,Hotel Plaza Elys es, The internet connection was unreliable Some of the staff made genuine efforts to help although it could be a service provider issue at the hotel I am sure they will fix it as soon as possible , Central location close to the metro and buses Very clean and housekeeping was great Mostly attentive and helpful staff Great breakfast buffet too 
73047,Hotel Plaza Elys es, I stayed with you during after the terrorist attacks on Paris and whilst the situation was becoming clear as to travel etc we requested a late check out ie 2 30 We were going to be charged 100 for this across the 3 rooms Would not expect that Best Western would look to profit from this difficult situation and would support travellers without charging them , That service ran as normal immediately following the terrorist attacks in Paris

73049,Hotel Plaza Elys es, My only comment would be to remove the large tigers in the lobby The antique furniture carpet Venetian plaster on the walls along with the beautiful art was so perfect and French to me the Tigers were a rather negative item in contrast Less is more , Loved the intimate size of property Loved the cleanliness quiet decor of the rooms Had a lovely buffet breakfast offered daily Staff was pleasant
