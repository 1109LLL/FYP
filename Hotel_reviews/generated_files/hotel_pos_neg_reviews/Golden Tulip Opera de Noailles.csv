259321,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Air con wasn t working properly to cool the room it was stuffy Bed was hard and had a plastic mattress protector that makes you sweat , Handy location to major sights and metro Quiet street Very friendly and helpful staff
259322,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles,No Negative, Nice hotel in a pretty good location very friendly staff with a very good service I have asked for room with the balcony and have been upgraded with no additional fee Good breakfast All good 
259323,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles,No Negative, Staff here is exceptional From the moment my cab pulled up and I was greeted by a staff member at the curb they were attentive and professional in every regard 
259324,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles,No Negative, Very nice small hotel in city center near Opera and Louvre Good staff and service I love small and friendly hotels This was great Very quiet in the side street Thanks
259325,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, I would have liked to have in room tea coffee available , We asked for a quiet room and got exactly that The bathroom was wonderful big bath and excellent shower Breakfast was excellent good quality and a lot of selections Easy access to public transportation 
259326,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Small dining room for breakfast and can be a bit crowded The elevator is small nothing out of the ordinary but it was out of work one night , Perfect location very close to the metro line The room was specious which is hard to find in Paris Comfortable bed and a nice breakfast 
259327,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Varmt i rummet eftersom man inte hade air condition p Farliga niv skillnader i golvet vid receptionen och i korridorer Kranar i badrum ocks spetsiga och farliga vid fall garen str var mer efter r tt design n s kert och bekv mlighet ,No Positive
259328,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Too small room to move Elevator so small I used the steps , Great staff Clean good location But Doing some remodeling and carpet was missing Very tiny elevator if small spaces bother you and the room tiny Could hardly move around bed although bed was adequate 
259329,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles,No Negative, Everything was great The staff is amazing very kind I had a problem with my knee they worked so hard to find the right medication for it Also nice breakfast with lots of choices
259330,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, The layout of the shower with the wc inside This meant the wc got soaked every time we showered not ideal Indeed had I not hidden the toilet rolls they would also have had a soaking There was a great deal of refurbishment going on during our stay though this did not impact on us Breakfast area a little cramped but put this down to the renovations taking place , We love Paris and love this area the location of the hotel was perfect We would recommend it for those wishing to discover Paris with limited time Near two metros lines and easy to get to from the Gard du Nord Eurostar The staff were excellent very attentive esp as our room was not ready and we waited 30 minutes Breakfast was ample with plenty of choice the catering staff very accommodating and cheerful they were working in rather limited space We will definite go back as location and ambience was spot on 
259331,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, The bedroom was quite small but there are different lounge areas which make up for it the bathroom set up does not give you much privacy it all depends on how prude you are the exterior was being renovated not an issue at the weekend I am a light sleeper and could hear the metro rumbling underneath in the early morning not to mention guests in neighboring rooms , Great location no street noise nice atmosphere good value for money
259332,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, While not a major problem there was building going on which is good for future guests but which affected the quality of the stay, The hotel was really beautiful a perfect break in a fantastic part of a fantastic city I would really encourage you to try this hotel out we had a fantastic stay
259333,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, The hotel is in an excellent location central to shopping museums and eating The hotel is fairly basic certainly no frills to be had at this establishment I m not sure it deserves a four star rating certainly a solid three would be more appropriate The rooms are clean an a reasonable size the breakfast passes with a push the bathroom accessories are on the cheapish side There are probably much better deals to be had so shop around and get a better bang for your buck , The location is good and the rooms are clean 
259334,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Extremely small rooms it looks quite bigger on the pictures wide angle Expensive for the real estate you get Breakfast was rather a joke machine to cook eggs was broken what no fresh fruits , Modern Clean Rather quiet for a central location had room giving on the courtyard though 
259335,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, There was nothing I didn t like , Loved staying here the hotel was lovely Really enjoyed the breakfast the staff were friendly and helpful and great location 
259336,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, The room should have bathrobes and complementary water bottle coffee tea, Thank you Mauricio for an extra attentive and dedicated service You made my stay much more comfortable and easier The hotel is well situated next to two metro stations very nice restaurants nearby and shopping stores including Lafayettes
259337,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles,No Negative, We appreciated lovely and always helpful staff of the hotel Everyone but really everyone was so nice helpful and polite Location is perfect with the wonderful breakfast We felt very welcomed and relaxed Can t wait to come back again Thank you very much for this special moment 
259338,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, The only thing which needed more attention are doors and corridors which needs renewals though it was not bothering us but we noticed it Also there is one small elevator and it was sometimes quite busy but it had character as the whole hotel , We booked 3 rooms which was bought on a special offer otherwise we would not have paid for valid price We asked for rooms with balconies and all close to each others We was given very private rooms with balconies everything was perfect The rooms were small but beautifully decorated we loved the use of lights and colors we had everything we needed Two of the rooms were conjuncted with a small corridor in between so we was able to open in between them Beds was very comfortable the bathroom was fabulous we got two with shower and one with bathtub all very modern The cleaning of the rooms was perfect even our cloth were folded Overall the room were very cozy comfortable and quiet some where facing the street and others the backyard One of our family members was old handicapped lady travelling with wheelchair with her The staff was extremely nice and helpful The wheelchair could be stored in the lobby and they put extra chair to have in the shower and more The lobby and the public area was displayed with modern and colorful art which gave the hotel very special character The breakfast was excellent sitting in the breakfast facilities was something you don t experience anywhere else The only thing which needed more attention doors and corridors needed some renewals though it was not bothering us but you noticed it Our first impression was we wasn t sure how the rooms would look like but they were indeed excellent Overall great hotel not too big which is a plus and the location is perfect Because of great and helpful staff and unique hotel we had a wonderful family reunion and celebration of our 80 years old mother in Paris Thanks a lot for a wonderful stay 
259339,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, We were unable to stay longer , An art boutique style hotel in the centre of Paris This was our fourth year visiting this excellent hotel and we were not let down Exceptionally clean and comfortable with friendly efficient staff Breakfasts were delicious and set you up for the day 
259340,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Room was a bit too hot and without AC the only was to cool it was to open a large window that wasn t child safe , Breakfast choice and quality was excellent
259341,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, It will be great if they provide kettle and coffee in the rooms, Everything location facilities friendliness of staff elegance of the ambience to the soundproof rooms 
259342,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, What s not to like , Everything A wonderful little hotel in a great location A special hats off to the reception staff who were always very friendly and helpful and ready to greet or assist us with a warm smile 
259343,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Slow WiFi, Abundant and good selection breakfast Unusual large spaces inside hotel compared to Paris standards Excellent location metro Opera Louvre Madelleine Velib
259344,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles,No Negative, Staff were very friendly clean good breakfast good bar for a nice quiet drink Room very clean and done everyday u wanted Localaty was ex for a visit very close to every thing Recommnd to any Cdn u try french they try english 
259345,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Very small room with very tiny bathroom The key that you needs to leave at the reception I have been told off not to keep in my bag , The location just next to opera 
259346,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles,No Negative, Service very friendly and helpful by french standards Location super and rooms very quiet and comfortable Breakfast again good by Paris hotel standards Air conditioning was essential in 38 degree heat Good Sushi next door
259347,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Try to dedicate some rooms to families that like more partitions especially to the bathroom Fitness center needs to be updated or at least provide access to the one across from the hotel , Breakfast was awesome I loved the uniqueness of the art pieces dotted everywhere 
259348,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, The room was very hot when we arrived , Very nice hotel very close to the Opera and a nice walk away from Louvre museum Very helpful staff comfortable room and great breakfast Plenty of restaurants specially oriental ones around Really good connections on the tube 
259349,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Slow wifi not terribly user friendly taps on shower , Great location in the centre very very friendly and helpful staff good facilities for a city centre hotel good breakfast
259350,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles,No Negative, This hotel is the best and excellent services new furnitures and very clean They have gentle staff and very lovely and we feel that we are one family Great location and near from everything Thank you and we will come back again in the same hotel 
259351,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles,No Negative, Friendly staff comfortable beds clean rooms Location was excellent Lourve and D Orsay was within walking distance Eateries located around the area 
259352,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles,No Negative, Staffs are all very nice and friendly We had a small child with us but we felt that we are welcomed Location is perfect It was so easy to get around 
259353,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles,No Negative, Great location great hotel Highly recommended Close to the Louvre Tuileries handy for the RER B from the Airport and two Metro stops on the doorstep A lovely district perfect location for our romantic weekend 
259354,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles,No Negative, Room was clean and modern even though it was tight pretty normal for European standards The rain shower was great although the curtain didn t do a great job of keeping the water in the shower 
259355,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, We have five people and we ordered a room served three persons The extra bed is really simple and more suitable for woman I slept on this bed for three nights and felt the back area too loose And the lift can only serve 4 people without luggage But it is fine especially if you are young , All of staffs are fantastic and kind to customers The breakfast is ok but a little bit busy around 9 00 AM The position is also brilliant and it takes 4 minutes to Opera metro station 
259356,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Our room was comfortable extremely quiet large enough and beautifully designed and executed The bed was excellent and the shower also excellent What was a deficit was the location of the room in a wing on the street floor with no view except for the dining area of the hotel used mainly for the bar and serving breakfast Next visit I will for sure ask for a room at least on a floor above the ground level , The location is special especially adjacent to a neighborhood chock full of alternative dining choices with many Asian types of cuisine and an excellent Lebanese restaurant among others I also liked the pronounced affinity of the owners for art and art related decor which was amply displayed throughout public areas The place is designed with a tasteful eye towards esthetics 
259357,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Room seems dull when you enter turn on the lights and it does improve Had to call reception to get the air con started However it did work once I talked to reception , Location staff very friendly hotel is nice clean and they ve made an effort to make it look modern around the reception area 
259358,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Nothing, Customer service was the best I have experienced Excellent team of staff all round Room 407 was great size and had excellent facilities 2 mins walk to Metro All round very very good We look forward to another visit
259359,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Quiet small rooms at 250 euros a nght No tea or coffee making machine in room Too small lift enough for just 2 person Vry vry limited choice breakfast Huge disappointment Looking for atleast four star services at dat price, Center of the city location
259360,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, The rooms were on the small side and the bath towels were very thin , The hotel was in a great location in the Opera district The staff were very helpful and pleasant it was very clean and had a lovely bathroom 
259361,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, It would be helpful if the hotel has a map available that clearly shows how to get to the hotel from Avenue de l Opera We got lost and had difficulty to find the hotel again The street in which the hotel is has a name change by the time it reaches Avenue de l Opera , The staff at reception were very helpful and friendly and could speak good English 
259362,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, The price was a bit higher than I would have liked although 4 star I would have only have paid about 100 per night for location etc Breakfast to be served later than 10 30 maybe until 11 Although 10 30 isn t early when your away from home you want a bit of a lye in Check out to be at 12 rather than 11am as I found this a bit early compared to other hotels The shower was great and functional however I wasn t a fan of how it had two lines of water coming out The lack of shower curtain meant the bathroom got very wet There was also a door stopper under the toilet to stop the door hitting it This was in a bad location as a couple of times I hit my toes on it and as it was metal was rather painful I think from seeing the one behind the main door it was missing the rubber cover so this needed replacement and it had accumulated some dirt inside wasn t isn t very nice , Really good location helpful staff breakfast was fine for what I wanted and the sauna and gym in the basement you could use if you asked staff they would open for you and put the sauna on 30 mins before you wanted to use it Room was lovely and how most rooms are over a secluded garden meant there was barely any city noise other than a few sirens The room was a good size with everything you would need for a trip Loved the window seat nice comfy bed bath was great and all the bathroom facilities Room included a hairdryer and slippers and minibar The room was clean and I had enough towels for 2 people which was nice as I was using the room alone Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful not only about the hotel but also restaurant recommendations and informing about how to get around the city Would definitely stay here again 
259363,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, The room size is small this is common in Paris but it can get uncomfortable , A modern hotel with all required room amenities in an excellent locaiton 
259364,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, The Wifi went down for 12 hours The elevator was too small fit my family with luggage , The staff were incredible Nicest hotel staff I ve ever dealt with Amazing with the kids The breakfast was also very good 
259365,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, A fully enclosed shower tub would be more efficient , The entire staff was extremely helpful and friendly They made our quick stay in Paris much more memorable My friend and I also loved the red motif in the rooms 
259366,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Nothing coffee could have been abit cheaper , Amazing staff extremely helpful with every request Room was excellent with an amazing shower wet room Bed was incredibly comfy also 
259367,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, All the rooms and common spaces are tiny Even the Bowls and plates are small No additional facilities like a Sauna or Pool And saw a three person elevator in a 6 Floor building for the first time , Location is good Tucked away from the Main Road yet very close to a Major Metro Station Opera so easy to move about Design and Decor is very good The rooms are well maintained Good value for money The staff were extremely friendly and helpful 
259368,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, As for almost all hotels breakfast price is too high Hard to justify 18 if you look for a coffee and croissant and little more only , Well located walking distance from Opera and many restaurants Standard room size is adequate Clean and silent 
259369,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, The planning of the shower toilet is not great as you cannot have a shower without getting the toilet area wet , The Junior Suite was quite sizeable for our family of 4 and the nice terrace that the room had is a great extension The location is great with Opera being really close and other sights also not far away 
259370,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Very small room but ok for a short stay Rooms aren t soundproof can hear what s going on in the hallway loud and clear Bathroom didn t have ventilation , Beautiful design of both rooms and other spaces Very chic and modern feel Toiletries and housekeeping was superb Room came with a cute patio Very professional staff Excellent breakfast Definitely worth the extra Amazing location 2 minutes away from Opera great sushi place next door 
259371,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles,No Negative, Perfect location walking distance from Louvre Rooms were small but cosy and clean Breakfast was not luxurious but consistent No vegetables at all but otherwise more than enough 
259372,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles,No Negative, Spotlessly clean everywhere Extremely good location close to two Metro stations well served for restaurants a business area so quite at night Decoration and contemporary art add to the smart modern feel Staff pleasant and friendly but not overly familiar 
259373,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, None, Our daughter like Japanese Food all around plenty of Japanese Food Very closed to city center just a few minutes walk we arrived to the main street quite convenient 
259374,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles,No Negative, I Had asked for a room with a nice view on the courtyard and I got a room with q view on the street I selected this hotel because it was written it was very quiet Yet the noise made by the entrance door kept us await all night long I usually am very happy with golden tulip very disappointed in this very case 
259375,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, No bad experiences I think if you re claustrophobic you might struggle with the lift but we were fine with it , The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful with directions and advice The place was clean and well kept The location a few minutes from a tube stop and within walking distance of lots of Rue de Rivoli 
259376,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles,No Negative, I stay here frequently when traveling with work but also with leisure it s my first choice The staff are so warm and welcoming and nothing is too much trouble A home from home 
259377,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Expensive breakfast rate Hard bed mattress I usually do not mind smaller rooms but this was squeezingly smalI I would have preferred a downsized bed for more space Coat hanger would have been handy , Very friendly staff Spotless and exceptionally clean room Nice and safe area pretty sound proof away from the city s hustle and bustle A chic Parisian funky style hotel 
259378,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Fresh fruits for breakfast would represent an improvement of something that is already excellent, Location room the junior suite excellent staff reception area
259379,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Only slight inconvenience is that the door of the bathroom is just a milk glass screen so you hear what is happening in the bathroom, Great location very good atmosphere well managed staff is super friendly we loved the breakfasts at room service the elevator I had a problem but was immediately fixed Great beds 
259380,Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles, Variety of breakfadt could have been better, Great location Nice friendly staff Comfortable beds we we re 2 adults with a 3 yr old in the same bed and slept well
