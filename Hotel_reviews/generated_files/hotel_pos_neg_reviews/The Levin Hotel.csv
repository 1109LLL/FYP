129721,The Levin Hotel, Rooms almost due for a refresh Lift was not always available due to old mechanism which relied on fellow guests closing the front door which they didn t always do A minor issue, Staff incredibly helpful ahead of and during our stay Very personable and helpful Fruit basket and complimentary bottle of wine was welcome Location was ideal Close to Harrods and the Tube We were also able to use the facilities of the sister hotel next door The Capitol W
129722,The Levin Hotel, Breakfast We included breakfast with our stay and turned out didn t worth it Better to go out and grab something to eat then eat in the hotel Room is a a bit small For one person is ideal but for two and after you do some something is a bit small , Location The location is excellent I guess it is the nearest to Harrods you also have the Zara Topshop nearby Very convenience for shopping The stuff were very friendly They greets you as you leave and meets you with a smile when you come back Very safe from this aspect A very lovely boutique hotel
