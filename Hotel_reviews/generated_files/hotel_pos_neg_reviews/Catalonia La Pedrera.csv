291777,Catalonia La Pedrera, Nothing, Friendly staff hotel clean and tidy Also before I went I emailed the hotel and told them it was my partners birthday on arrival to our hotel we had a complimentary bottle of champagne and a tray of fruit waiting for us
291778,Catalonia La Pedrera, No comment, The lovely fifth floor room very comfortable bed room safe nice quiet room no disturbances Nice outlook overlooking community courtyard and the pleasant and helpful staff Central location easy to access popular places of interest Scrumptious buffet breakfast Supermarket next door 
291779,Catalonia La Pedrera,No Negative, The bed was very comfortable and the room was spacious The bathroom was great as well Everyone I interacted with at the front desk was very helpful We enjoyed the neighborhood very close to public transportation and a grocery store cafes and even a laundromat We would stay here again 
291780,Catalonia La Pedrera, The pool was small but that was to be expected from the images of the hotel, The staff were helpful kind and informative and the location was perfect for everything including restaurants shops and using the metro
291781,Catalonia La Pedrera, everything was lovely even when I realised I had forgotten travel adaptor it wasn t a problem a box was produced from under reception for us to take our pick , very friendly helpful staff lovely breakfast great location lovely area
291782,Catalonia La Pedrera, I had a corner room from the yard side That was not a problem for me as I was the whole day outside but is not really bright inside The fact that the hotel offers room service but the room doesn t make you feel nice staying in it s a bit problematic Really small pool I mean it s nice to be able to go to the roof top and drink something but the pool is more like to wet your legs You cannot swim , The location was good 40 if you like to walk to the beach 20 by car The hotel was clean and the staff really polite 
291783,Catalonia La Pedrera, I realy dislike the noice coming from corridor walls seems to be totaly not sound proof , Polite and helpfull staff swimming pool on the top with view on Tibidabo cold galss in the fridge in the room 
291784,Catalonia La Pedrera, Definitely not value for money The room wasn t well equipped plus the window amd door to the terrace were both broken and despite mentioning it more than once not repaired At one point I asked for a plate and knife to use and was refused despite there being a restaurant on site A lot of the staff had attitude the rooms and facilities are dated and I have stayed in places where n Barcelona that were cheaper and much more comfortable and better equipped, The location
291785,Catalonia La Pedrera, No towels or service at pool Poor signage to get to the pool from 4th floor , Really comfortable beds Great little Tapas bars close by and a quiet street
291786,Catalonia La Pedrera, Cigarette smoke intruded the room and noisy hallway and if open window at night you get the party revelers noise The rooftop pool did not have towels when I there and the pool is the size of an extra large hot tub No comfortable space on the rooftop for privacy and lounge chairs where tightly cramped No bathrobe or slippers The lobby had some issues going on smelled like a sewage backup problem the days I was there , I liked the extra fluffy towels and toiletries The digital safe was a good size for small travel size laptop valuables and easy to use WiFi was great Housekeeping was great too 
291787,Catalonia La Pedrera,No Negative, Very comfortable beds in a good part of town in Eixemple near great restaurants and and convenient to the metro more of a neighborhood Excellent stay 
291788,Catalonia La Pedrera,No Negative, I had a great experience in that hotel Actually we booked a family room but since they did not have family room there they gave us two rooms with the same price one room was free for us The stuff was so kind and polite rooms were clean well located I really liked this hotel 
291789,Catalonia La Pedrera, Constantly had to request towels for pool No pool bar only 3 sun beds Shower overflowed in room Could not do late checkout no courtesy room had to wash and change in single toilet No tea and coffee making facilities Safe doors did not close unless in use so they fouled the mirrored sliding doors In fact one of the doors came off the runner Drinking glass cracked for 3 days even though left it out for maid to change had to ask in the end for replacement Crockery and broken glassware left in lift , The pillows were comfy
291790,Catalonia La Pedrera, The noise of room above could hear the movement of the bed The noise of the doors of other rooms and the lift very noisy as guests slammed doors ,No Positive
291791,Catalonia La Pedrera,No Negative, Nice hotel in a handy location close to Diagonal metro station Nice but small rooftop pool ideal for relaxing after a day s sightseeing around the city Far enough out of the way to be away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to walk to certain places and access the metro 5 minute walk Staff very friendly and helpful Would recommend this hotel to others 
291792,Catalonia La Pedrera, Swimming pool hours were not satisfied Open at 10am and closed at 8pm Would rather see open at 8am and close at 10pm so we can just enjoy a little of swim before heading out or chill out outside with drinks on the patio by the pool at 9pm, We stayed at the top floor and the swimming pool was right there which was perfect Breakfast was great as we could eat as much as we can then not worry about eating until dinner time Location for this hotel was perfect so close to everything Staffs were very friendly and helpful 
291793,Catalonia La Pedrera, The reception guy is not very friendly while the lady was better and When we tried to use the safe box and asked whether it is charged we were told to pay 20 Euro for that Later when I checked on the booking web that it should be free I called again and I asked whether it is just for deposit answer is yes is that too confusing and The room is a bit small There is no kettle tea or coffee pack Swimming pool is tiny on the top of the building It is really not worth the money paid , The location is good Room is clean They helped to take our luggage to the room before we could check in 
291794,Catalonia La Pedrera, Price was riduculous 340 for 2 nights room only Too far from all shops bars and restaurants Have to take metro which is dodgy and over crowded with unbearable heat , Clean hotel and friendly staff
291795,Catalonia La Pedrera, The toilet was facing the bidet so there was no leg room when using the toilet and i m 5 foot 3 inches Also the walls are very thin i could hear my neighbor snoring and the water running when the shower was on very loudly clearly Mattress was thin Breakfast was just ok ,No Positive
291796,Catalonia La Pedrera,No Negative, The hotel is in excellent location very near the metro station Diagonal which is connected with 3 metro lines So it was easy to go everywhere fast The hotel was very clean and comfortable i liked very much that had option to make late check out because my flight was in night For sure i will choose it again 
291797,Catalonia La Pedrera, Having travelled to six continents of the world I have never stayed in a hotel that didnt provided a kettle unless staying in a premier room I would rather have done without toiletries At a cost of 518 81 with no breakfast kettle airport shuttle and a brick wall view curtain were closed on entering the room and remained so during our stay hotel was over priced Such a pity as I have friends waiting to hear of my experience so they can visit this summer This break was a surprise for my husband on our 29th wedding anniversery However Laura 2 kept the room spotless Thank you Laura , Cleanliness
291798,Catalonia La Pedrera, The bed is a little too soft for my taste The Tv was not great there was a lot of flicker and the picture was distorted so I could not really watch it I had to keep up with the news via the internet , The location is perfect just 15 min walking to Sagrada Familia in one direction and 15 minutes walking to Casa Battlo in another direction The breakfast is very good The staff at the front desk is very helpful with tickets taxi reservations etc The cleaning lady is super nice too Internet was excellent worked all the time The water pressure and temperature in the shower was good 
291799,Catalonia La Pedrera, The only thing is didn t like was the room was slightly too warm for me but I do in uk sleep with my windows slightly open , From the moment we arrived to when we left excellent service friendly especially Jamuel and Jordie the manager He was always around to help The cleaning staff did lovely job even leaving a decoration on the bed Nothing was too much The swimming pool on the roof was small but served its purpose of relaxing a a little swim There was free internet and printer in reception Area good Lidl shop 5 mins away Churros bar across the road It was a soundproof room which was brilliant Room service excellent what more can I say I m more than sure you will as I did enjoy your stay 
291800,Catalonia La Pedrera,No Negative, Located in the residential area of the city but only 15 20 min walk into the city Lovely place to stay and very helpful friendly staff I was alone and felt safe always in and around the hotel
291801,Catalonia La Pedrera, air conditioner in the room didn t work we we re roasted , on our arrival the room we were supposed to stay was upgraded to room with a balcony valentine s day we arrived at the hotel 3 hours earlier but we did the check in on the arrival and they let us go in room 
291802,Catalonia La Pedrera, The price of the hotel is a bit high not only for the rooms but also for the breakfast and services , The bed was very comfortable and the hotel clean Nice and polite staff I liked my stay there 
291803,Catalonia La Pedrera, we had to ask the maintenance service for the proper use of the bath the lavabo not very clean needs a lot of maintenance, Location very convenient between gracia Paseo de Gracia
291804,Catalonia La Pedrera, Breakfast was poor very little fresh fruit and limited fruit juices Some of the food was not very warm obviously it had been left out for a while , Location was excellent 
291805,Catalonia La Pedrera, The shower was old with poor pression , Very calm perfect location Habitation was big enought with a baby 611 nice mini bar in the room Good room service with sushi The bar in the corner for breakfast was perfect and for 15 we had a full breakfast for 3 coffee orange juice sandwitches croissant 
291806,Catalonia La Pedrera, Nothing We simply enjoyed Barcelona knowing we had a great place to stay, We stayed 5 night Location was superb We walked Passieg de Garcia into city areas several times and took Metro on occasions Walked to Sadrada Familia and other sights enjoyed local food wine and tapas Room and facilites were ideal and the staff could not do enough to help us 
291807,Catalonia La Pedrera, The worse customer service of my life they treat me like a criminal since the minute I made the reservation because i used the wrong card by accident and when i corrected the mistake they still treat me very poorly and demanding The food in the restaurant buffet is discussing dont try it for 32 you can have a very luxurious breakfast in Passaig de Gracia in a lovely terrace The food was RAW and cold Overall i will not repeat and i certainly do not recommend it , The bed and pillows are comfortable Although it was not a double bed as announced it was 2 single beds together that separate and move very easy which is frustrating 
291808,Catalonia La Pedrera, The cost of the breakfast was expensive compared to the local cafes , The staff were very friendly and helpful The room was comfortable and there were gluten free options at breakfast It wasn t a problem but be warned that the swimming pool was a postage stamp It was clean and very much appreciated for a cool off at the end of a hot day sightseeing 
291809,Catalonia La Pedrera, we supposed the room was equipped with a tea maker as seen in photo but it wasn t told us it is available only in premium room we really need it as i told i could pay only one kettle the response was no no not possible, good location near to major attractions
291810,Catalonia La Pedrera, On the description of facilities it said spa hot tub Non of those were in the hotel Very small pool , The hotel is located just in the midlle between catalunia squere and sagrada familia So it was 15 min walk to each direction Very quite area 
291811,Catalonia La Pedrera, No toilet brush Also the bathroom door is made of tinted glass So it doesn t hide sounds very well This is very common in all modern hotels I don t know why the architects think that s a good idea maybe I m getting too old Lol, Book this hotel without a doubt I had the junior suite Was very spacious and even had a balcony The bed was extremely comfortable AC and internet always worked The bathtub had a jacquizzi function I liked everything 
291812,Catalonia La Pedrera,No Negative, Nice I Clean Walking distance to Metro Passge d Gracia Right down the Hotel is 24 Hrs Supermarket where it makes you feel at home Staff are awesome 
291813,Catalonia La Pedrera, Obviously its a city hotel so couldn t expect the pool to be bigger But it is pretty much 5 people max per time , Massive wide beds for 2 people were excellent and comfy Alfonso and the team try to cater to your every need Rooftop pool is a great bonus too Great little mini market directly next door 
291814,Catalonia La Pedrera, only 1 person at the reception and we have to always wait to be attended if there are other guests being attended, convenient location for my work at reasonable price 
291815,Catalonia La Pedrera, Just the one lady behind the desk who didn t Puy much effort in searching information for our train Guy on the next day made up for it real good , There were some maintenance issues at the hotel The Catalonia hotel chain gave me a free hotel transfer 1 day before my arrival Stayed at the Catalonia Ramblas hotel and would recommend it to everyone Rooms are clean beds are superb 
291816,Catalonia La Pedrera, Only the elevator is smells cigarettes all the time , The staff from Reception down to cleaners Technician are really warm hearted very friendly accommodating namely Alfonso Pepe Alejandro I surely recommend this Hotel voz it s very accessible to all 
291817,Catalonia La Pedrera, We didn t eat here as the breakfast was expensive 14 each I think The local cafes just around the corner a lot cheaper for the same thing , Rooms were fab very cozy Beds were very comfy location was excellent rooftop pool was amazing Staff were excellent Computers printer in lobby which was great as we needed to print boarding passes Would definitely recommend 
291818,Catalonia La Pedrera, Very busy and small swimming pool , Very confortable bed gluten free breakfast Kindness and professionalism of the manager who gave us another room because of construction works near the first one 
291819,Catalonia La Pedrera,No Negative, excellent location close to the metro and popular spots lots of restaurants in the local neighbourhood quite room with big comfortable bed helpful staff 
291820,Catalonia La Pedrera, Lovely clean refreshing pool but pretty small Great to cool off but no good for swimming , Yummy breakfasts with plenty of choice Very comfy bed and pillows Good central location but not noisy as windows blocked out the city noise also great curtains that blocked out light 
291821,Catalonia La Pedrera,No Negative, The location was ideal for walking strolling to say nothing of the great selection of restaurants nearby Staff were very friendly and helpful Bathroom was quite large and very well appointed 
291822,Catalonia La Pedrera, At 16 Euros we gave breakfast a miss but the 3 course meal in the evening was also 16 Euros we didn t eat there in the end but was a good potential option and better value There was a small rooftop area with a pool but only a mouse would have got a good work out however it was a nice if small area to relax in , The hotel was well located for all the main sites in Barcelona La Rambla was about a half hour walk with the beaches at Port Vell and Barceloneta another half hour but the underground and main rail lines were also close which made day trips out of Barcelona easy It was nice being located near to the residential area and we ate in Spanish bars and restaurants The wonderful Sagrada Familia is only a quarter of an hour walk The staff were friendly especially the barman during our stay and the reception staff were very good at giving us directions 
291823,Catalonia La Pedrera, Quality in general of the structure It is fairly old style Anonymous Pool Very very very small Cannot be considered a pool at all , People 
291824,Catalonia La Pedrera, The second bed was shaky One pair of legs needed fastening or something Making the internet work was cumbersome Stupid system where you get the password in a mail that you couldnn t use before you had connection to the internet If you didn t use the net for a day you dropped out and had to get a new password A code on a piece of paper given when checking in would be much better , Internet fast enough for us Good breakfast Very nice people in the reception Cleaning done well 
291825,Catalonia La Pedrera, internet log on system a pain it sends code to you on internet so you have to go to reception and log on to get it When on strong connection Internal rooms have No outlook at all but quiet didn t have breakfast looked expensive, nice pool and roofdeck good bed great linen clean room very helpful and friendly staff english speaking good internet

291827,Catalonia La Pedrera, Breakfast needs to be improved I would recommend to give more options for vegetarians , It was very comfortable bed perfect cleaning service and unbelievably helpful friendly staff I arrived early check in time but my room was ready and I was able to relax before meeting after the flight It wasn t expected but very pleasant 
291828,Catalonia La Pedrera, The air conditioning wasn t on in the rooms they hadn t turned the system on so room was hot and stuffy Had to open the windows in order to cool it off a little but the noise from the street was really loud so made sleeping impossible , The bed was really nice 
291829,Catalonia La Pedrera, Noise insulation was poor I was able to hear the noise of people walking and talking in the corridors and the closure of doors Because it was cold season the AC cannot provide cooling system so the rooms were very warm, Location of the hotel was great and staff was very helpful and kindful
291830,Catalonia La Pedrera,No Negative, The room was very good in terms on size and facilities The room service was done daily and the overall experience was great The staff was very helpful and tried their best to find solutions

291832,Catalonia La Pedrera, No complaints at all I would highly recommend it , Close to Metro station and shopping area Lovely patisserie close by that was open for breakfast and then until 10 00pm Hotel was spotless and housekeeping was superb 
291833,Catalonia La Pedrera, more napkin should be provided it d be good to have microwave in the room and provide hot water, very convenient close to popular spots such as Casa Mira Casa Ballito etc clean and good quality of bedding towel staffs are also nice
291834,Catalonia La Pedrera, We didn t have breakfast because it seemed quite expensive overall for a family of five , The beds were very comfortable The rooms were quiet Ivan on the reception desk was very helpful The hotel is 5 minutes walk from Diagonal metro station 
291835,Catalonia La Pedrera, No fault to be found with this property , Loved the location The staff were very friendly and helpful Room was very clean and comfortable The bed was perfect 
291836,Catalonia La Pedrera, On the day first the bath tub had black dirty stains We found unwashed cups glasses in the evenings Toiletries did not provide on Wednesday Friday One evening I had to request shower cap from reception desk Razors were in very poor quality , Mainly good location Reception staff friendly and welcoming 
291837,Catalonia La Pedrera,No Negative, The hotel rooms have been designed with the traveller in mind good easy to use showers eye level safe ample amount of electric points It was a stress free stay 
291838,Catalonia La Pedrera, The breakfast area It lacked ambiance The person who appeared to be in charge was quite brusque in his manner No jugs were available for cold milk , I found the bulk of the staff were incredibly helpful and pleasant I had a problem in my room where the electricity supply stopped working This problem was dealt with speed and consideration to my well being 
291839,Catalonia La Pedrera, Air conditioning unit squeaked which was a bit annoying during the night so we had to turn the fan off Breakfast expensive so we ate out , The room was clean and a good size

291843,Catalonia La Pedrera, I booked at half price which was good value for money but the normal price is too expensive The breakfast was not of 4 star hotel quality and definitely not worth the 16 euros , Clean hotel polite and helpful staff kettle in room for coffee tea nice complimentary offerings 
291844,Catalonia La Pedrera, Wished there was more facilities A faster wifi Maybe more suggestions for tourists Good list of restaurants You know more facilitation for the visitor to the city That will help this hotel a lot, Staff Especially Ferran a guy that works in the hotel gave me a great list of thins to do for a guy my age also facilitated many requests for me during my stay Reception was very friendly House Keeping was very quick and excellent It s near many activities 
291845,Catalonia La Pedrera, Break fast is mediocre Break fast area looks dead for some reason Most people don t opt for in house breakfast and make a trip to the nearest bakery break fast bar , Rooms are very clean Bed is very comfortable Air condition works brilliantly No road noise inside the room as there are two windows Mini bar in the room is good Bath room is clean bright and there is a bidet The hotel is 10 minutes walk from the nearest metro There is a good coffee shop bakery shop as well as a breakfast bar within 100 yards of the hotel The breakfast bar seems to close by 10AM The bakery coffee shop is very cheap A capuccino and muffin cost only 1 5 euros There are many restaurants in the vicinity and surrounding areas Rambles is 10 minutes away beach is 25 minutes walk acquarium is about 40 minutes by walk Sagrada Familia is 20 minutes walk Metro is very cheap A 10 euro ticket allows 10 trips on the metro Taxis are affordable Look for the green sign on top of taxis before trying to stop them Barcelona is better discovered on foot and I walked to most attractions On hot days I took taxi Metro stations get too warm and evenings are ideal for travel by metro
