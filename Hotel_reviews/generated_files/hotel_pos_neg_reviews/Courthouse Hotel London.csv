79054,Courthouse Hotel London, Rude arrogant woman who worked at rooftop bar I now understand that this is separate to the hotel but no mention of this on booking Lovely sunny afternoon and we had to have a drink by reception as the hotel bar was full , Nice breakfast free infused water at reception
79055,Courthouse Hotel London,No Negative, I stay at this hotel on most occasions i visit London it is friendly always clean and in an excellent location the rooms are spacious beds are comfortable with good quality linen I would recommend to others
79056,Courthouse Hotel London, The entrance door of the room would not close by itself and you had to close it by force and make sure it s locked which is not good for security The tab at the bathroom was loose and was not working properly and though I did mention it to the reception nothing was done about it The breakfast was OK and ordinary compare to the price they charge , The room size was good hotel is close to Regent street Oxford street Carnaby st Which is quite convenient for shopping 
79057,Courthouse Hotel London, Staff need to be trained well It was a electrical interlocking in one of our room cracks in air conditioner on the ceiling and potentially this could lead to a fire but it did take a time for us to find somebody from hotel personnel and invite them to the room to look what has happened They did try to find any excuse do not come to the room When I managed to bring receptionist and some other hotel staff to my room they did not know where the electric fuse box was located to turn off the electricity It was a really dangerous situation for hotel guests , Location
79058,Courthouse Hotel London, all expect location, not worth the money the shower glass was broken i smashed into it twice the hotel didnt fix it and transfer me to another room no towels in the room always need to ask for them staff at the breakfast are cold as ice and forget what you order and when they do it takes ages more guests were complaining about it if location is not an issue i would NOT recommend this hotel 
79059,Courthouse Hotel London, There were several broken things in the room The reception manager was quick to act and change to another room but even in the room there were small things not working NO EUROPEAN PLUGS in the room atall And no adaptors in reception either You need to use the TV to charge your phone ,No Positive
79060,Courthouse Hotel London, I asked early check in didn t get it I asked Late check out didn t get back to me on that and didn t get it Asked to include breakfast and they charged me Asked from the concierge from recommdetsiones nearby he told me that he is now in London and don t know places in London On the first day they didn t clean my room until 18 00 The Key didn t work half of the time The servers where bad in breakfast, Nothing
79061,Courthouse Hotel London, Overall I was really disappointed with my experience We were upgraded to a junior suite but it was disappointing the wall paper was coming away from the wall the shower didn t work properly I shower head didn t work and when you turned it on it came away from the wall the cushions looked grubby and I just didn t feel we got value for money We were attending the cinema there so booked the hotel as an extra on the Saturday afternoon when we first arrived we couldn t get a seat in the bar as it is set out for groups all tables we occupied by couples and had so many seats left but not that were socially acceptable to sit on as others were at the table the leather seating at the bar was also tatty and needed replacing The tables at breakfast ALL wobbled and I don t mean a little wobble which could be fixed with a menu but were unstable to a point that you worried whilst cutting your food The food at breakfast was lovely but ruined by the tables which is not what you expect for a 5 hotel I raised my concerns at check out but didn t feel they were addressed or listened too , The restaurants at the hotel were really nice and staff were friendly 
79062,Courthouse Hotel London, Breakfast until 10h30 but as from 9h50 empty plates such as the fruit were not filled up anymore Every morning we had to ask 3 times for our coffee Furniture needs some updating cloth on the chairs were ripped We had an old room not shown when booked and its old fashioned and somewhat worn out , Great location right in the middle of bars and restaurants Even though the neighbourhood is very alive at night the hotel offers quiet rooms Clean rooms Friendly and helpful dutch speaking staff at the reception
79063,Courthouse Hotel London, Initially the toilet didn t flush in my brother s room the battery did not work in the safe and the staff could not provide a bottle opener for the room when he ordered 4 bottles of Peroni ,No Positive
79064,Courthouse Hotel London, It took on average 5 mins or more for reception to answer the phone when we wanted to ask anything This was quite annoying so as long as you don t need anything you re fine , It was a great location and the bedroom had no outside noise What we like very quiet 
79065,Courthouse Hotel London, This is not a 5 hotel The room was dingy The bed was lumpy One concierge was great The other did not know anything including information about a hop on hop off bus We definitely overpaid once you convert the pounds to , The location was fantastic Close to everything 
79066,Courthouse Hotel London, Bed was probably the most uncomfortable bed I ve ever slept in shower couldn t be regulated and when the tap was turned up to make it more than a trickle it soaked the whole bathroom including the ceiling Room was poor quality for somewhere that markets itself as a 5 hotel and the TV kept cutting off with no signal, Location is probably the only bonus of this hotel
79067,Courthouse Hotel London, For the money thought there would have been complimentary water in the room It felt tired and needed a makeover , It was convenient to stay the night as we were going to he movie there
79068,Courthouse Hotel London, We were upgraded to a suite which makes me wonder how small our room would have been if we hadn t been upgraded The room was tired and not particularly clean We were at the front of the property which was noisy and the back of our room over looked a nightclub so it was even noisier luckily our aircon unit was so loud that it drowned out most of the music and people shouting Our bathroom smelt of raw sewage all of the time which was disgusting and made both of us wretch on entry to th bathroom Breakfast was a very average buffet in a very tired room Overall this hotel is very tired and needs a refurb We called concierge to ask for an iron which we had to chase as it didn t show up it still didn t show up at all and we had to then rush out for our dinner reservation in creased clothing The staff were underwhelming and no one even asked us on check out how our stay had been which makes me think that they know how bad it was Waiting 10 minutes at the concierge desk twice once for someone to show up to help and once while one person was on the phone to what sounded like a friend I am so disappointed by this hotel especially as it was our wedding anniversary weekend celebration I would actively recommend you don t book this hotel there is no redeeming features other than the central location , The location
79069,Courthouse Hotel London, Rooftop bar was advertised as part of the deal but we were turned away and told it was by invitation only disappointing , Comfortable bed with plenty of room around it for luggage etc 
79070,Courthouse Hotel London, It was quite basic for how expensive it was Also the staff wouldn t let my boyfriend back into the room one night as they didn t believe that he was staying there , The location was unbeatable It was a comfortable bed and the bathroom was nice The breakfast was also quite good 
79071,Courthouse Hotel London, The hotel seemed unfriendly staff looked fed up no smiling faces to greet you The bed was extremely uncomfortable almost crunchy when turning over we didn t sleep well at all and for that reason we wouldn t stay here again and would not recommend anyone to do so , The location is fantastic 
79072,Courthouse Hotel London, Bed and pillows were terrible Toilet didn t flush on the second day of our stay we have to go down to lobby for toilet use A staff came to our room and simply said you have to wait for technician to come at 8am No sorry at all for the inconvenience I can t believe this is a 5 hotel it definitely doesn t up to that standard, Location
79073,Courthouse Hotel London, Very very untidy and very old and not maintained reception staff bad rooms are very bad even if you look at ceilings you see the plaster coming out bathroom taps comes out if you press them what a waste if money the hotel was , Totally waste of money the hotel is not even 2 star but showed as 5 stars I regret booking this hotel never recommend anybody to stay there instead tell everyone not to choose this hotel 
79074,Courthouse Hotel London, Probably the worst hotel bed I ve slept on from anywhere I had a double bed and there were two deep bumps in each side like someone had been sleeping there for years The middle had a huge hump I ve never seen such a bad mattress Also this was waaaaay overpriced for what I got out of it , Design was nice Location was great 
79075,Courthouse Hotel London, Beds not that confortable Cold unfriendly staff on roof terrace Noise from talking on corridor from roof bar terrace Awful furniture old or tatty and incongruous in lobby, Location 
79076,Courthouse Hotel London, We arrived there very late after midnight and were absolutely exhausted 22h at airports and airplanes so we didn t have the energy to complain about it since we had only few hours time to sleep but the air condition didn t work and the room temperature was 28 C With that price 420 you would think to get a temperature you like Horrible rip off experience , Location 
79077,Courthouse Hotel London, We were extremely disappointed with the facilities of this hotel We had booked on the basis that it had a pool and spa facilities as we were expecting to be doing a lot of walking throughout the day so would be pleased just to get back to the hotel and relax in the evening We returned to the hotel after an extremely hot and tiring day only to find that the leisure suite closed at 7pm this resulted in us hurriedly rushing down to the pool where the staff indulged us in a 5 minute swim We then decided to check out the rooftop bar which for us was the main highlight of this hotel and with such lovely weather it would be the icing on the cake We were denied access due to the bar being fully booked by people who weren t even staying in the hotel asked if we could maybe book for later on that evening but told no the whole evening is booked We were never advised that this facility was outsourced and so no priority given to guests staying at the hotel in fact quite the opposite applied To add insult The quirky inside bar was being used by a film club We decided to find an alternative place to eat and then more walking to try and find a nice place to relax for the evening We felt thoroughly cheated We had decided to pay more for our stay in London than we would usually to ensure a nice place to return to with good facilities and ended up feeling another time we could choose a cheaper hotel and book in advance to use the rooftop bar , The breakfast was very good and the staff very efficient Although there was a good self service buffet we also ordered several items from the menu which were brought out to us without having to prompt anyone Nothing seemed too much trouble The location of the hotel couldn t have been better great little restaurants nearby Oxford street shopping on the doorstep and theatre land a stones throw away Should have been the perfect stay 
79078,Courthouse Hotel London, security up to to the rooms in the lift anyone can go into the lift and go to any floor you do not have to enter your room card to use the lift this is a concern , Breakfast was lovely and the beds were very comfy
79079,Courthouse Hotel London,No Negative, The convenience of being so close to the hub of Soho but the hotel was quiet and understated The concierge team are amazing They not only accepted parcels for me before I arrived but they also let me know they were there Outstanding service to a fantastic team 
79080,Courthouse Hotel London, Paint was flaking off the bathroom ceiling there were hairs in the towels that belonged to neither me nor my wife and there were no effective lighting for reading in bed other than the main light , The location was excellent 
79081,Courthouse Hotel London, The room was very dated and in a general worn down state We asked for a quiet room and were given a very noisy room on street side Until 11PM a party continued on the roof of the hotel , The room was larger than originally booked
79082,Courthouse Hotel London, I have stayed in better 4 hotels than this 5 hotel Very disappointed as when I booked the room I explained that it was for our wedding anniversary but no reference was made to this at all Very surprised that bathrobes were not included in the room for a 5 hotel this should be the norm Also when I filtered the search I asked for hotels with breakfast included this one came up but when I checked in I was told breakfast was not included However we went across the road the next morning for breakfast in a bar and had an excellent cooked breakfast for 4 95 Although the location was excellent I certainly would not use this hotel again ,No Positive
79083,Courthouse Hotel London, Really uncomfortable beds Missing options for breakfast very bad cooking broken plumb at first night in the room broken minibar the other nights in new room non sense indoor pool hours policy , Location only 
79084,Courthouse Hotel London, The room , The breakfast was very good It is a meal I would say All I like for breakfast were there It is possible to order fried eggs the way we want Coffee and hot milk as well 3 kinds of juice Several kinds of bread No complaints at all 
79085,Courthouse Hotel London, Staff could do with a bit of training or at least smile Keys to room handed over at 6pm receptionist on duty didn t give any details oh how to get to room where the lifts were only told us in quite a rude manner we couldn t use the roof bar as a function on at same time my friend was collecting our luggage and was told we could use roof bar Room service was a joke Foreign person who could not speak or understand proper English answers we tried to ask what the days soup was which the answer given didn t make any sort of sense tried asking again and he hung up Tried calling back and took 3 attempts of at least a minute before answering call eventually got food fries omelette etc no condiments or cutlery brought up with food which took so long food was cold by the time it arrived alongside a request for 2 glasses of prosecco and the reply being there is none in the building at this time What a terrible experience Won t mention no flannels no English tea in room only flavoured and a kettle that leaked all over the place Never again , Location
79086,Courthouse Hotel London, Nothing comes to mind , The staff were all very professional friendly and helpful The hotel was beautiful and the beds were extremely comfortable Lovely breakfast with lots of choice Very close to shopping Carnaby Street Oxford Street Regent Street Piccadilly about 15 minutes walk away Lots of choices close by for eating and just around the corner from the London Palladium Would highly recommend this Hotel and plan to visit again 
79087,Courthouse Hotel London, The equipment in the room was old the wardrobe was broken all the nice things that made me decide for this hotel were closed the terrace was under works the pool with impossible and short working hours It was impossible to turn on the TV a technician had to be sent to the room to switch on a well hidden switch the WiFi was the most user non friendly ever seen , This hotel does NOT deserve a 5 stars rating its services and equipment should be rated barely a good 3 stars Only good thing is it s location and kind staff Otherwise a disappointment 
79088,Courthouse Hotel London, The hotel could benefit from some refurbishment in places but it in no way spoiled our experience , The location was fantastic right by Liberty s opposite Carnaby Street It s a very short walk to Oxford Street or Regent Street and only few minutes walk from Oxford Circus tube station The bedroom was bigger than I ve had in other 5 star hotels at 3 times the price Also to find a hotel with a pool in central London is unusual and we thoroughly enjoyed our time spent in it The staff were all very friendly and helpful during our stay and we were very well looked after 
79089,Courthouse Hotel London, The bed was very uncomfortable with springs poking out The rooftop bar is very very expensive but on a sunny day it s still worth a quick drink The pool in the spa was absolutely freezing we couldn t stay in which was a real shame , This hotel is in a fantastic location and very quiet at night which was surprising The room was gorgeous and we enjoyed a spa treatment
79090,Courthouse Hotel London, VERY hard bowed and uncomfortable bed noisy aircon and lumpy feather pillows with no anti allergy alternative , central location top of Carnaby St and opposite Liberty store Large room
79091,Courthouse Hotel London, the bed was terrible was like a elephant sleeped there before us they change the bedroom but was the same old crap springy bed needs a huge makeover and new beds in all rooms cheers,No Positive
79092,Courthouse Hotel London, Whilst the location is excellent the hotel itself is not 5 our room was tired and needed re decorating in several areas I expect more from a 5 rated hotel The rooms are very small and even the towels were a dingy grey rather than white ,No Positive
79093,Courthouse Hotel London, This is not a 5 hotel wobbly dining tables decor is tired with odd combinations of furnishings Breakfast was definitely not worth the money food was obviously sourced from cheap suppliers , Location 
79094,Courthouse Hotel London, Staff did not give instructions how to find to the room on arrival nor details on their services like breakfast so I did not have breakfast in the hotel Problems with the wifi provider , Excellent location Silent room with a view to a office building next door Double bed rsuitable for a lonely business traveller like me at the time Comfortable bed Clear instructions how to use TV Bathtub 
79095,Courthouse Hotel London, For a 5 star hotel I thought my room 415 was tired and in need of a make over the material on the chair was worn the bed was uncomfortable with a cheap mattress the cushion was tatty and frayed there was a big gap of over an inch under the door which allowed light and noise into the room the bathroom was clean and decorated to a good standard however the towels had been well used and not what you would expect in a hotel with these ratings It might well be that this is not the case for all the rooms within the hotel and I may have just been unlucky I had a great trip but the above issues were disappointing because there were lots of positives about the hotel and staff , The location of the hotel was excellent with plenty going on around it The bar and restaurants were great and the staff were very helpful and friendly A big plus was that the room had sky and there was a swimming pool 
79096,Courthouse Hotel London, First of all they changed our rooms to the Penthouse as they had given our rooms to someone else which was in a seriously bad state of repair Very rundown Entrance door looked as if it had been battered Shower room dirty and old Baths which spat out filth when we ran a bath Plaster falling from the walls No side lights besides the bed Smelly old feather pillows This is supposed to be a Five Star Hotel Who in Booking com gave them that level The personnel can barely understand English Breakfast served in the old courtroom but in the style of a work canteen Horribly expensive for such low standards Final amusing comment when I asked if all the rooms were in such a bad state Oh Madame I believe we have one or two rooms which have been renovated , Nothing 
79097,Courthouse Hotel London, Shabby exterior Noisy dated tacky the prices was outrageous for the quality Would ask for refund if I had time , Close to night life and shopping
79098,Courthouse Hotel London,No Negative, The location to the London Palladium we were going to a show and it was perfect Just opposite the Liberty shop and Carnaby St The hotel is in fact the old courthouse with some original features like jail cells incorporated in the bar area 
79099,Courthouse Hotel London, Shower was horrible A few minutes taking shower and the water temperature went from warm to super cold and suddenly super hot many times , Location is great Internet worked well all the time that we needed 
79100,Courthouse Hotel London, Super hard mattress and no support from pillows Comfy mattress is needed after a day out in London Definitely wouldn t rate the rooms 4 5 star More basic 3 star and view of offices from window Room very small basic Rood terrace not open due to refurbishment Private Cinema club very expensive Shop around for better hotels luxuries around same price Some cheaper in different areas, very handy to Picadilly theatres Pallidium and Carnaby district across the road It was expensive for room only though Staff were great hotel very clean Round corner from the tube station
79101,Courthouse Hotel London, it needs some TLC restoring it is not 5 star e g no robes in bedroom, We have stayed here before It was a lot better then It felt shabby this time Staff for breakfast were pleasant but not entirely competent Table was not laid fully for our breakfast e g cup and plates missing Breakfast order was not understood 
79102,Courthouse Hotel London, Mouse in our bedroom Not what you want when you pay for 5 star hotel Staff could be more upbeat and smiley they were welcoming but a little bit lack lustre not very forthcoming Noisey room traffic wise if your room is street side so best to ask for room at back of hotel Can t beat it s location but hotel not really a 5 star hotel in its service delivery and they need to sort out their mouse problem as has happened before to others , Amazing location especially for getting to The Palladium Liberty and Carnby Street couldnt be more convenient 
79103,Courthouse Hotel London, Breakfast charge 15 we didn t know if we were going to be up for breakfast and it was extra costs if deciding that do so on the morning 22 50 Plenty of places outside hotel to eat and cheaper, lovely rooms and very clean excellent location and staff were very friendly 
79104,Courthouse Hotel London, Apart from the fact that the spa was absolutely tiny and barely had any facilities the spa was extremely shabby and in dire need of decoration The door to the sauna hit the floor so it made an awfully loud scraping noise every time the sauna door opened There were no bath robes provided in the spa I booked a massage and had to just wear a swimming costume with a towel wrapped around me , The reception staff were really welcoming friendly and professional The location of this hotel right near Oxford Circus station couldn t have been better I wish I lived there The room was very clean and the bathroom was nicely refurbished I had a quiet night s sleep which was amazing for central London I didn t eat there so cannot comment on the restaurant facilities 
79105,Courthouse Hotel London, Had a little issue with pre authorisation that was held on my card current still waiting for 1000 to be released and to be told my bank is lying to me from the general manager was very unprofessional and communication with the accommodation is poor Receptionist we dealt with was rude Not the best start for our European trip , The location was great right in the middle of Soho Breakfast was good 
79106,Courthouse Hotel London, We had a really disappointing time accessing the spa One of the main reasons we booked the hotel was the swimming pool When we went down to the pool there were no staff around We waited for 30mins but no one appeared We went to reception to let them know and they said they were probably doing treatments All we wanted was a key for a locker to put our clothes We were told to just persevere We tried for 2 5 hours ringing the spa but with no luck I did ask reception if someone could look into it so we could use the pool the next day This did happen but trying to locate the spa staff was a nightmare We went down at 10 as arranged but had to hang around until someone appeared It was really unfortunate we couldn t go when we wanted to and this was what let the overall experience of the hotel down I would have given it 10 10 if it wasn t for the poor spa service access to facilities , Check in was prompt and being able to store are luggage after checking out Sky in the rooms Nice bathroom
79107,Courthouse Hotel London, BREAKFAST very disappointing for the money Waited each morning to be seated and the quality of cooked breakfast was very poor indeed, Location comfort cleanliness
79108,Courthouse Hotel London, Wished the Sky bar was open Breakfast in those bain Marie s could be hotter , Bedroom was extremely comfortable Bathroom by the tap needs some attention fantastic shower Always hot water Would have been nice to have had some biscuits with the tea Staff were so friendly and nice Some thing silly the wine glasses in the bar were so clean credit to the staff 
79109,Courthouse Hotel London, We were there for 2 nights our room was only serviced after 4 30 after our first night The air con was loud On the day of our departure house keeping wanted to get in to the room a 9 30 am , Staff were lovely and we were offered an upgrade 
79110,Courthouse Hotel London, I was going to take a photo in the bar in the morning didn t realise it was locked up until 11, Staff were extremely helpful and friendly I went to see a show at The London Palladium and this was ideal location just around corner
79111,Courthouse Hotel London, When we arrived with booking a month in advance the Reception told us that rooms were not available and proposed to take a penthouse We refused and asked to book us another hotel The Reception found two Magistrate rooms one of them being much smaller than advertised but costing the same Dispute with Reception probably cost me 3 nights of bad sleep as second set of windows were opened and noise from the street was really loud I didn t notice because of drapes and shades ,No Positive
79112,Courthouse Hotel London, No hot water No room to sit other than on the bed Breakfast disappointing scrambled eggs cold and like eating in Victorian tiled lavatory , Bed comfortable and room quiet 
79113,Courthouse Hotel London, room even tho an upgrade only slightly tired liked every thing else even the room, excellent position mostly friendly staff rooms clean choice of eating and drinking areas only stayed one night but would have been happy to stay longer 
79114,Courthouse Hotel London, The fixing behind the selector in the bath was loose The carpet and upholstery in the room looked as though it could do with a deep clean rm 402 , The style of the building itself reflecting its previous use The reception area and all the staff The breakfast menu was very good but make sure you read the table menu to get the best out of it Overall a good experience but small things could have made it excellent 
79115,Courthouse Hotel London, Beds not the comfiest and pillows a little too soft was refused drinks in hotel bar at 1am as bar was closing As a resident this annoyed me, location was excellent walking distance to most places Clean hotel with great interior features
79116,Courthouse Hotel London, Constant noise throughout the night from air conditioning system I could turn the room one off but the noise from the system coming through the bathroom you couldn t It did drown out the noise from revellers in the local area however , Staff were excellent and location good
79117,Courthouse Hotel London, When we arrived 10 minutes early to booking in time did nt expect to go to room straight away b ut had to wait a further 30 minutes to book in as rooms were not ready I had specifically asked for a twin room but at reception a very pleasant young lady said they had upgraded us I don t know why so I said thats great as long as it was a twin room so when we finally got to the room after keys not working so another trip to reception to sort this out I was dismayed to find a double room be it very large the beds could come apart but the bedding did not allow this as we were only staying one night we did not bother to change rooms as time was precious as we had a show to see and only a few hours before we had to attend the show I was dissapointed as I had planned this stay as a special birthday treat as well as the theatre also as my friend was in recovery from a bad illness this is why I wanted a twin room to make her feel comfortable The bed was very comfortable and the room delightful but not what I asked for The next dissapointment was breakfast we went to breakfast at 9 30 not too late nice dining room and asked immediately if we would like tea or coffee but nothing was explained to us that there was a menu for anything else that was on offer other than what was on the tables to serve yourself so as some items had run out on the hot selection I had to bring this to the attention of the waitress who was lovely but then told me it would be another 10 minutes but in fact this was more likely 30 minutes so had a cooked breakfast minus 3 items then discovered a small menu under a plate Also had cereal but first bowl I picked up was very chipped which is really not acceptable , The extra items in the room such as slippers and umbrella well thought layout in room and comfortable smart and immaculate
79118,Courthouse Hotel London, Pillows were awful Switch was hanging out the wall near the sink in the bathroom Breakfast was basic Had to ask for milk The food and the coffee wasn t hot enough The toast took 5 goes to toast Silly things but when you are paying for a 5 star hotel shouldn t really happen , Location was excellent Afternoon tea was very nice 
79119,Courthouse Hotel London, Towels were rather thin and tired looking and there was a broken fitting in the bath long standing by the look of it , Staff were efficient and helpful on check in in the bar and at breakfast They were very keen to please and make sure we were happy Room was very clean and bed comfortable 
79120,Courthouse Hotel London, have recently broken my wrist so a walk in shower would have been better than bath shower combo also no water in room except mini bar and only 2 sachets of coffee bit stingy for such a classy hotel, upgraded on arrival lovely room with fab bathroom
79121,Courthouse Hotel London, Very poor customer service by general manager and concierge Informed that no water in hotel for one day When asked if we could get a refund and check out was told a flat no with no options Extremely poor attitude by general manager when I said this will be my last time staying here he retorted that this is always your prerogative and feel free to do whatever you want The no water situation lasted two days Beds are in very bad condition and need replacement,No Positive
79122,Courthouse Hotel London, Very old hotel for sure needs some upgrading to be a five star At the most now four star Hotel did not get my booking so we waited for over half an hour on check in day at 21 30 Not a fun start especially when travelling with a kid However staff was polite and tried their best to help The room was clean but again furnitures need upgrading to be called five star hotel On our stay the water was shut down for one day Staff helped us move to another hotel , Destination was perfect Short walk to shopping on Oxford Regent and Picadelly street Tube station two minutes walk away Hotel staff was polite and helpful 
79123,Courthouse Hotel London, The gym and pool are not decent at all they re small and old and tucked away in a windowless basement Bar and hotel lobby need an urgent facelift also the rooms could be a bit more modern deluxe queen room with a sofa are by far nicer than the basic rooms which are very small Overall price is high for what you get perhaps think twice before you book many other alternatives exist around the Soho , The Courthouse is a nice hotel but lacks the luxury expected form a 5 star hotel Breakfast is nice and so is the location which is amazing Rooftop terrace is also lovely but invites many walk in guests which are not supervised or vetted once inside so make sure you lock up your room Overall price is high for what you get perhaps think twice before you book many other alternatives exist around the Soho 
79124,Courthouse Hotel London, Outside signage tiny so difficult to locate unless standing right outside entrance woulf have like choice of how egg cooked at breakfast , Ideal central location smart spotlessly clean hotel and helpful staff
79125,Courthouse Hotel London, Hotel is tired in need of major face lift Our bathroom floor got very wet due to I ll fitted shower screen there were tiles missing from wall Not what you expect from a 5 hotel more like 3 Staff not overly responsive to complaints This is our 2nd visit to the hotel 1st visit wasn t great either having to wait over a hour and half for our food in restaurant Staff were not overly responsive then either It could do with good clean in reception Saying that location is fabulous and that s about all hotel has going for it It s such a shame because it could be a wonderful hotel , Fab location
79126,Courthouse Hotel London, They have a wonderful terrace that is closed beyond the bar s working hours including all Sundays It would be nice to be able to sit up there even when the bar is closed, The staff was geniously polite the comfort and decoration of very high standrards Very good breakfast 
79127,Courthouse Hotel London, We had pre booked afternoons on tea this is supplied in miniature compared to previous locations we have been The Vegetarian offering was cheese and pickle and tomato and pickle erg sandwiches Clearly the chef lacked imagination This was qualified when we took our pre booked 3 course British Menu dinner the following day the steak and kidney pudding was no more than a pie which looked like someone had popped out to the local supermarket which was served with salad The apple crumble cake was totally inedible as it was stewed apple heavy on the cinnamon and then wrapped in seriously in baked pastry Please do not waste you re hard earned cash rating here there are loaded of great restaurants on the hotels door step so take a walk , We were kindly offered a free room upgrade however the room looked rather tired and the marble and glass on top of the maple laminated furniture looked wrong The staff were friendly and helpful As it was a beautiful sunny warm day the sky terrace bar was open sadly open to none residents too so really over crowded
79128,Courthouse Hotel London, The room we stayed in was on the side of the hotel and therefore a side street It was quite noisy at times from local businesses emptying their rubbish in to the bins , The hotel was amazing The staff were really friendly and the room exceeded our expectations 
79129,Courthouse Hotel London, Just ok and disappointed for rating been to better for less, The decor is looking tired and the bar did not have enough seating the entrance was looking unkept the food was good
79130,Courthouse Hotel London, Was told to park car in car park for 40 a day when it was free outside till 12 30 the next day glad I spoke to traffic warden staff where no help what s so every, nothing
79131,Courthouse Hotel London, The Jacuzzi Jets in the bathtub did not work in either one of our rooms The street was super loud It is right in the middle of the crowded downtown shopping area So people were out late and partying on the street The street cleaners came early in the morning and dump the garbage cans and were loud early in the morning as well, The staff was really friendly and helpful The breakfast was good in the morning The bar was friendly and good atmosphere 
79132,Courthouse Hotel London, The view from the window in our room but it didn t take anything away from the enjoyment of our stay , We loved the location of the hotel and the original features and history within the hotel 
79133,Courthouse Hotel London, Very very unfriendly staff I tried to engage in friendly conversation and I am not sure if it was my Yorkshire accent but the staff looked down their noses at us We felt very uncomfortable I am a professional with a university degree A first with honours however the staffs attitude made me feel like I was rubbish , Clean

79141,Courthouse Hotel London,No Negative, The location of this hotel is amazing just at the top of the pedestrian shopping area around the corner from the Oxford Circus underground stop Very lively shopping restaurants and crowds to be found in the evening all around the hotel but the hotel itself was super quiet and comfortable We didn t make use of the facilities other than the room because the weather was so good during our stay and we wandered all around London Did use room service one night for a later night snack and the food was quite good

79148,Courthouse Hotel London, 1 Room assigned last room available although the reaervation was made weeks in advance was on the top floor and near the skybar which although was closed it continued to be a source of nuisance with people moving bottles in the afternoons 2 Showers and tv did not work on arrival And the bathtub stopper did not work 3 One day upon returning to the room the door had been left open after the room was cleaned Highly not acceptable 4 Manager and staff offered no apology to the inconveniences I complained so that others would not face similar treatment not to be offered a chsnge of room when and if one becomes available , Location is very good I stayed here before but the service has deteriorated tremendously

79163,Courthouse Hotel London, Not all the team is service orientated I know some times you have a tough day at work but when you work at reception you need to always be presentable good mood hair done dressed properly The first room we were given was a disgrace for the price that we paid It was a very small room you look outside the window and you had an office with all the staff working and eating in less then 5mts The doors of the closet were broken and a micro tiny bathroom So we requested another room and the manager that answered understood the situation and did a fantastic job to solve it The second room that we were assigned was 10 times much better clean bigger better placed and it was then our holidays started as expected , The location of the hotel and the clean conditions of the hotel As well the great service of some member of the staff

79166,Courthouse Hotel London, Bar staff were foreign and could not understand our order we asked for a baileys and got nibbles We woken up every two hours by a noise outside the window It must of been a generator no one at pool to tell what to do Had to move kettle in our room as no plug socket near enough, Lots of verity
79167,Courthouse Hotel London, The breakfast experience was appalling This was a gift for my parents and i booked it partly because breakfast was included and it was really terrible There was no cutlery no plates the staff all seemed terribly rushed which we know can happen if they re busy and understaffed but seemed very disorganised and the the little food that was there was cold and disappointing After having to ask twice for numerous different parts of the breakfast my parents made a compliant on the way out to which they were told i would receive a refund I still havnt received this even after a few phone calls to the hotel, liked how quirky the hotel was but not made enough of very nice rooms

79172,Courthouse Hotel London, Some of the furniture in the room was worn and weathered one of the swimming pool lights was hanging off the inside of the pool the sauna door dragged on the floor as you opened or closed it a switch box inside the sauna was covered in tin foil the breakfast was pretty average and the dining area furniture was pretty basic and dated and you have to pay for an ice bucket and wine glasses to come to your room Not what you would wholly expect from a 5 star rated hotel that is fairly expensive for what you get , Nice central location clean hotel 
79173,Courthouse Hotel London, Outlook of room 410 was overlooking offices and had to close inadequate curtains for privacy Had an unduly long wait for bacon and sausages to be available at breakfast Bed was hard , Quiet at night Room facilities Location Friendly staff Breakfast selection

79184,Courthouse Hotel London, When I called the Hotel in advance the service was curt and the assistant on the other end even hung up without saying goodbye The double bed was two singles pushed together which gradually moved apart during the night Not a 5 hotel many 4 we have stayed in have been more comfortable and customer service is rather remote and brusque , The proximity to central London was great A quirky hotel limited by the listed building status particularly the dining room which was bizarrely painted with a cloudy sky theme on the wall like Disneyland A spa and pool although the spa closed early and the pool area needed to be cleaned
79185,Courthouse Hotel London, No menus for room service no wifi code in the room in fact no information in the room at all The mini bar looked like it had been raided The room service guy had to come and bring a menu and stand at the door whilst we decided what we wanted The cleaning lady let herself in our room at 8am I wasn t even awake , The staff couldn t do enough The location was perfect

79214,Courthouse Hotel London,No Negative, Excellent location in Oxford Circus walking distance to countless attractions of the great city of London Room was larger than what you expect here Good breakfast 
79215,Courthouse Hotel London, I couldn t find anything in the hotel first I walked past the hotel on arrival as it is not clearly signposted then I had to ask where everything was the toilet the lifts the breakfast room and the restaurant nothing was signposted The room itself I would definitely class as 3 4 star and I had booked a superior room I was disappointed and the rooms on the website look like more 5 star and newer I was not happy paying 250 a night The bed was big and looked inviting but as soon as you lay down on it you settle into a well formed hollow in the mattress so it was clearly fairly old the room was cold and there were no obvious instructions how the aircon worked when I pressed the arrow up nothing happened it just reverted back down to 21 degrees I am sure if I had phoned reception they would have fixed it the towels were thin and worn if the property is a bit worn there are still small things you can do to really improve a stay such as new thicker towels and I would really expect a bathrobe in a 5 star room the slippers provided were shabby the tv was great and the sky program selection but after a while the tv says it will automatically shut off after 1 minute unless you press the OK button but there is no OK button on the remote control and none of the others work would also be nice to have a bedside lamp above the bed there were just ceiling spot lights it would also be a nice touch to provide a bottle of free water maybe some biscuits perhaps lay out a welcome information book I tried to find a menu for the restaurant but only found it on departure tucked away in a drawer you could also advertize the spa better by putting a leaflet out maybe offer a 10 discount for residents I think the room should be spruced up mattress definitely replaced new carpet to give it a fresher colour change and with attention to the small things the impressions could be improved by 25 , Great location opposite Liberty s and just off Regent s St The food breakfast had a good selection and hot food was very good good selection of magazines outside the breakfast room The Silk restaurant s food was really excellent with great service and it was very atmospheric being in the former magistrates court The bedroom was very quiet and the sky tv selection was great everything was very clean the bed sheets were comfortable plenty of drawers cupboards and wardrobes Bathroom was perfectly fine tolietries provided very good plenty of power sockets and plenty of space to dry hair in front of a mirror in the bedroom with a little table in front radio next to bed looked good although I didn t use it Staff very helpful

79245,Courthouse Hotel London, The accommodation was very poor There was mold in the bathroom the shower wouldn t heat up and the handle fell off We asked for an iron and ironing board but the one that came was dirty covered in stains and very unsanitary The seat in the room was falling to pieces and the springs in the bed had collapsed in the middle after years and years of use , The location is excellent 
79246,Courthouse Hotel London, I didn t like the fact the swimming pool was closed precisely at the time when people are able to use it The pool opened at 10 am and closed at 7pm not at all suitable timings for a tourist, Overall good except for the pool facilities
79247,Courthouse Hotel London, Having to speak to concierge for them to then pass you onto the Reception Cleaning Staff very noisy in the morning We were room 604 cleaning cupboard right next to it Cracked tap in the bathroom Scales in the bathroom Not the cleanest, We loved the Soho Sky Terrace bar We had a snack and drink Great service warm welcome Helpful staff on entering hotel We used the pool and sauna that was lovely and quiet Room is basic Paid 406 for two nights Sky TV was a bonus 
79248,Courthouse Hotel London, There is far too much furniture in the room It felt very small and cluttered really needs rearranging and getting rid of a few pieces, Location is fantastic 
79249,Courthouse Hotel London, Small room staff were not that helpful with the concierge knowing very little staff were unwilling to change the room which was standard room when I paid for an executive King , Comfortable but the I paid for a superior king and it definitely wasn t that really disappointing as been before and was impressed with the room Secondly I had asked for Champagne on arrival which didn t happen 
79250,Courthouse Hotel London, Quite pricy but expected for central London luxury, Super place to stay staff go out of their way to help Lots of great stories about the history of the hotel Food amazing Silk Every type of drink available

79254,Courthouse Hotel London, Where shall I start It says Luxury at its finest on the key card holder but it is far from it Average room in the attic with old furniture below average hot food at breakfast some staff rude broken sink surround in bathroom window did not open had to ask for room to be made up 5 star hotel constant noise at night day from fan on roof etc etc I did write a complaint and Duty Manager instantly gave me 15 discount which was good of him but General Manager too busy to meet with me offering upgrades and free dinner via DM Think he missed the point It was a treat from me based on a promise from him It is said that you get what you pay for not in this case I am following this up with the General Manager and if necessary the owner as I would like my money back so that I can really treat my partner Hope this helps you , The Location is excellent which sold it to me as I booked it as a treat for my partner s 60th birthday taking her to dinner and the theatre in London as we live in Scotland BUT Basically it is an overpriced 2 star hotel which was a disappointment and an embarrassment as I thought I was treating her to something special 
79255,Courthouse Hotel London, TV had been set incorrectly Milk in little pots off Though staff dealt with both quickly Incorrectly described as 5 stR hotel, Great location friendly staff
79256,Courthouse Hotel London,No Negative, The location could not have been better easy access to Oxford and Regent streets and Carnaby street directly opposite Beds very comfortable and spacious room 
79257,Courthouse Hotel London, My room was on the road side with no extra glazing it was very noisy and i didn t get any sleep The Shower is integral to the bath and unless you are 4ft 6 inches or lower you cant really use it The breakfast has stewed scrambled egg with a thick film on it and the ambience of a train cafe rather than a five star hotel ,No Positive

79262,Courthouse Hotel London, The bedside lamp did not work There were no spirits in the mini bar only beers and soft drinks We were unable to adjust the aircon it was set at 20 and that was it , Nice comfy beds and fluffy duvets although a bit hot when we stayed 
79263,Courthouse Hotel London, Room was a total disgrace in a poor condition nowhere near the room as advertised Over priced as well , Staff were brilliant hotel was pleasant enough 
79264,Courthouse Hotel London, Gymnasium Only used it once as it was in a very poor location with no ventilation Pricing I know its London but very overpriced bar and restaurant Never used restaurant bar twice but reluctantly , Rooms pleasant beds comfy 
79265,Courthouse Hotel London, Reception staff could of been friendlier Pool opens at 10am so no time for a swim before work, Breakfast was fantastic nice to have a pool staff in Spa were really great and helpful
79266,Courthouse Hotel London, The room wasn t cleaned during our two night stay The safe didn t work the aircon didn t work the tv had no sound The concierge was rude The towels are thin and need replacing Very overpriced , Only the convenient location
79267,Courthouse Hotel London, Reception staff rude took 50 deposit when the room had been paid in full in case of damage or if using the hotel facilities The restaurant was dirty we waited 30mins for each starter main course to arrive then our hot dessert s were half frozen in the middle The service was too slow not good in general I had paid for luxury queen room there was nothing spectacular or luxurious about it the bed was uncomfortable the room was a bit tatty frayed in places A big disappointment for a supposedly 5 hotel i wouldn t give it 1 for the amount of money I paid I expected a better hotel , The cinema was good
79268,Courthouse Hotel London, Air conditioning did not work so had to call reception in the middle of night as my room was like a sauna Unfortunately nothing could be done but I did not receive any compensation or was not offered to move rooms If it hadn t been for this fault the hotel would have got 10 10,No Positive
79269,Courthouse Hotel London, the reception staff were extremely rude they made a error on my bill and charged me 4 times and then proceeded to tell me that it was not true even after i spoke with my bank ruined the exercise for me , the bar was and the location stunning
79270,Courthouse Hotel London, Nothing all in all a fantastic experience, Hotel is lovely they have retained some of the original court features which is fabulous The bar area has the original court cells which you can now use as a private booth Bedrooms lovely comfy beds fantastic breakfast staff lovely and helpful Overall we had a fantastic stay and would definitely return Location is also brilliant close to Oxford Circus Tube station 
79271,Courthouse Hotel London, The Air Con was leaking and the builders woke us up early , They upgraded our room on arrival and we came back home after a night out to find a cake with a happy birthday message 
79272,Courthouse Hotel London, Staff were always serious in demeanor helpful yet a little scary to approach A few more smiles would go a long way in welcoming the guests , Great Location room was fairly quiet for Central London and bed was comfortable as expected Wifi was adequate
79273,Courthouse Hotel London, The free Wi Fi required logging in anew constantly very annoying The speed was alright though Breakfast was good but not worth the price , Excellent location in central London Soho within walking distance of the Oxford Circus tube station Nice modern rooms with good amenities and safety deposit box Bath was nice too Air conditioner actually worked unlike in some other hotels very nice I didn t try the spa the pool nor the gym so can t comment on those but they are supposedly good too 
79274,Courthouse Hotel London, The staff trying it on, Expensive hotel no iron in the room Paid for breakfast on the booking on arrival they tried to fleece me of a 100 refundable deposit incase of mini bar usage apparently and then a further 45 for 3 of us for the mediocre breakfast most of which was cold Before paying 45 for breakfast they said it would be 60 as we had 2 rooms but a single person in one of the rooms Tried it on at every opportunity Need a lot of wedge to stay there quite frankly they are not the best hotel in London to charge that amount 
79275,Courthouse Hotel London, I only did not like the fact that the concierge was positioned where he had no view of the entrance to help the guests with bags on arrival, Everything Rooms clean staff helpful location great
79276,Courthouse Hotel London, I tried in several ways to ensure the hotel was accessible It was but not once was it mentioned that a well hidden buzzer next to the main entrance with stairs and not near the entrance labelled for the handicapped I had to climb the front stairs with my walker and 2 suitcases with the help of 3 strangers passing by in order to get into the hotel at 11PM at night Then I was shown the buzzer I tried to have breakfast at 1045 only to discover it had ended early and there was no service any more There was a chair in my room no desk chair though that was so filthy and worn I would not have put it outside my house for trash pickup Had to cover it with a towel , Croissants from the bakery next door were lovely and the staff very helpful The hotel staff were helpful too the bathroom was beautiful and the room large 
79277,Courthouse Hotel London,No Negative, Fabulous location and really friendly staff We had a slight problem with the room we were given and the reception staff had no problems relocating us to a different room Breakfast was lovely and the roof terrace is perfect for a relaxing drink especially on a sunny day

79279,Courthouse Hotel London, Service could have been friendlier , Good facilities pool sauna and rooftop bar great size room Queen very comfortable bed excellent location for Oxford Circus the Palladium Regent Street and Carnaby Street 
79280,Courthouse Hotel London, Rooms are too small for the price you pay but then again in central London what do you expect So no complains there, Location location location just 10secs away is Starbucks Ben Cookies and Oxford Circus is less than 5mins walk
79281,Courthouse Hotel London,No Negative, Staff couldn t do enough for us and even gave us a free upgrade as we celebrated my birthday Breakfast was good sausages really tasty Would definitely stay again Quite a bit of the old court is still intact and has been incorporated into the hotel such as the holding cells in the bar area 
79282,Courthouse Hotel London, Slightly more comfortable bed but we re nit picking , Wonderful location just across from Liberty and Carnaby Street Building full of character ex famous magistrates court Charming helpful staff Excellent breakfast 
79283,Courthouse Hotel London, not much at all perhaps a discount structure with the local Q Car park as this is quite pricey , The hotel is in a fantastic location within a short walk to Carnaby Street opposite Libertys and a walk to Regent Street The room was excellent the bar was superb and the roof terrace amazing 
79284,Courthouse Hotel London, The roof bar wasn t the best The service was slow and the drinks rather pricey Pool was small and didnt open until 10am it would have been great if it opened earlier so you could go down before breakfast , The hotel is in a great location We got a complimentary upgrade which was lovely Great size room 
79285,Courthouse Hotel London, Service wasn t great We requested a spa treatment and didn t receive a response and they were not very accommodating when we did speak to them which was disappointing , The room and bathroom were good Lovely cocktails in the bar Location is excellent for the West End 
79286,Courthouse Hotel London, None, The location was absolutely perfect the staff were really helpful and the room was lovely and a very high standard I would definitely recommend and I will definitely be booking here again for my future London trips Also the roof top bar is an absolute must 
79287,Courthouse Hotel London, The room was a bitt tired Needed an uplift we could hear the room next doors clients talking through the adjoining door curtains didn t fit properly and were unhooked and hanging off the rails on one end shower was old and messed all over the floor our friends had a bath robe in their room ours didn t not enough plates at breakfast roof terrace advertised a BBQ on Sunday morning on the website but was unavailable , Situated near regent street and the London palladium Also near Euston station good central location
79288,Courthouse Hotel London, We were upgraded to a room with a kingsize bed We booked a twin room with 2 separate beds That was a bit awkward being on holiday with a friend Also we could hear everything that was going on in the rooms next to ours , The location is just perfect for a citytrip The reception staff were very friendly 
79289,Courthouse Hotel London, Breakfast pastries were on the dry side but otherwise we will definately stay again , The position and the old courthouse aspect We were going to the Palladium and this is next door Plenty of lively coffee shops and restaurants in the immediate vacinity Regent Ste Oxford street Carnaby St all close
79290,Courthouse Hotel London, no provision of face cloths in bathroom only hand and bath towels provided Also there was no iron ironing board provided, Good location cleanliness good and pleasant staff Dining room could do with refurbishment especially some of the chairs
79291,Courthouse Hotel London, Ac not working gave us seperate bed even though they saw a couple did not ask if we wanted smoking non smoking room Ordered a iron came very late Not worth the money had better luxury for the price,No Positive
79292,Courthouse Hotel London, The TV didn t work a socket didn t have the safety cover on the magazines were out of date and only 1 soap when it was a double room But maybe that s standard in a 5 star hotel Also a socket didn t work The inner curtains had holes and the bedding had a stain , The scones were nice that were part of the afternoon tea and the staff mannerism couldn t be faulted They were great 
79293,Courthouse Hotel London, Tea coffee a bit sparse in the room but we could have asked for more Otherwise it was superb , The room was lovely clean spacious soft towels hot water Location great for Oxford St the Palladium 
79294,Courthouse Hotel London, Incredibly noisy bedroom at front of hotel Very difficult to sleep No menus or info available in room for Room Service etc Mini bar poorly stocked , Serving staff in restaurant at breakfast and in Carnaby excellent friendly and efficient Fantastic location right in the heart of shopping theatre and restaurants 
79295,Courthouse Hotel London, The breakfast wasn t a great selection and service for tea coffee was slow as not enough staff We also got sat in another room as the breakfast room was full and then had to walk through all the other guests tables to get to the buffet , The location was excellent Bed comfy and room clean
79296,Courthouse Hotel London, Buffet breakfast a bit chaotic perhaps due to so many concurrently arriving for the Sunday 9 15 9 45ish slot Made worse by poorly arranged breakfast bars that resulted in people criss crossing repeatedly before being able to return to their respective tables , Location great for those of us travelling from the North West in to Euston and from the South coast in to Waterloo Spot on proximity to Oxford Regents and Carnaby Streets on Saturday and Hyde Park on Sunday Bonus up grade into the Penthouse suite 
79297,Courthouse Hotel London, Decor is very tired and warn out Breakfast was poor quality for a 5 star hotel Too few staff to serve breakfast as well , Location and front desk staff
79298,Courthouse Hotel London, Bed a bit hard but that s personal choice, Excellent location very clean bedroom and bathroom very good choice at breakfast very polite and helpful staff Would stay again
79299,Courthouse Hotel London, Fridge not working Reported but was not fixed Pool tiny Not a proper spa Breakfast expensive Tea horrible No menus on table Didn t know so much more was available until after we had eaten Broke my little toe on the ridiculously shaped glass table no power point for kettle Rooftop view from room not good Towels rough Not enough shower gel etc for two people Everything basic no luxury , Reception staff Location 
79300,Courthouse Hotel London,No Negative, Surprisingly big room with big bed Location fantastic opposite carnaby street with great roof terrace bar Breakfast lovely staff really helpful Definitely stay there again 
79301,Courthouse Hotel London, Slow service lack of basics in the room even though free upgrade No flannel Bath Robe Biscuits in room and very poor quality bed and mattress , Swimming Pool location Food Relative ease to achieve Free Dinner Wine to make up for shortfall in services 
79302,Courthouse Hotel London, Nothing, The staff was alert courteous and very helpful The weekend manager was especially helpful The location for our purposes was excellent We would return to the Courthouse on another visit to London Thanks N Atkin MD
79303,Courthouse Hotel London, Would have been good to have known in advance that the roof terrace and downstairs bars were no go areas leaving very limited space for guests we were then told must line up in narrow space between rope and order and carry our drinks back not in its self a problem if had somewhere to take the drinks luckily a manager noticed our problem and guided us to a cell I had invited friends that also had a room for night as thought would be good to meet them on the roof terrace for drinks , The bar staff though under enormous pressure as two private functions leaving no where to have a drink showed to a cell and tried their utmost to offer good service 
79304,Courthouse Hotel London, The swimming pool does not open until 10 00am which is very poor for someone like me who likes to have a morning swim around 8 00am, Very good location for the price
79305,Courthouse Hotel London, A room was ready for my arrival around 9 00 am and even though it was next to the lift it wasn t too bad The room was really nice but the bed was very uncomfortable I could feel the springs in it and that wasn t good for my back at all My back is still hurting me Someone had a key to my room and walked in whilst I was sleeping It was quite frightening to wake up to hear them coming in the room I did report it to reception at check out and was told that it would be investigated I haven t heard back from anyone as yet The TV was not easy to work out and it keep turning off after about an hour , The hotel is quite unique The layout and the look they ve maintained of the court house has just a touch of elegance The staff were great I d like to point out that Anielle Ralph and Jose were really great 
79306,Courthouse Hotel London, Felt that considering this a 5 star hotel did not meet what I expected Unfilled holes in bathroom eg above mirror Also very expensive full breakfast especially as it was buffet style expected sliver service for the price Luke warm Glad didn t full price for room as was disappointed , Staff very helpful room ready when we arrived
79307,Courthouse Hotel London, Our stay was going well until the electricity went off and couldn t find the emergency exits to get to the ground floor initially There was a lot of confused people trying to get out of the hotel and no staff on the floors to help us get out or work out how to get out What if it had been a fire People were stuck in the lifts even One lady looked worried and an elderly couple looked confused Finally I found a dark staircase and decided to try that which finally led me to the ground floor trade men s entrance I walked round the block to get to the front of the hotel The staff apologised but said it wasn t there fault these things happen I explained it wasn t their fault regarding the electricity but it certainly their responsibility to make sure guests can exit the hotel , The location is ideal for getting around plus the hotel was ultra modern
79308,Courthouse Hotel London,No Negative, The location was great a few minutes walk from Oxford Circus tube An M S nearby as well as the Berwick St market for street food One of our party is vegan and we found all sorts of places nearby serving vegan food a real bonus Shopping on the doorstep Liberty across the street A real social vibe in the area and you can walk along Regent St to arrive at Piccadilly Circus and onto Leicester Square Convenient to theatres too the Palladium is around the corner from the hotel We would definitely use the hotel again when staying in London 
79309,Courthouse Hotel London, There was a leak in the bathroom sink, Breakfast was excellent the staff were friendly and very helpful the beds were comfy and clean and our room was quiet hence a good nights sleep I would not hesitate in staying in this hotel again 
79310,Courthouse Hotel London, Staff unhelpful and hard to understand and rude Most uncomfortable bed we have ever slept on The bed was sunken in and springs were poking us in the back We complained about bed and the put a mattress topper which didn t help at all We walked around London for seven days with aching backs , The only thing we liked was the location 
79311,Courthouse Hotel London, Our bed was too hard but I appreciate this is a personal choice The curtains also didn t lap over the windowsill so it quickly got light early in the morning , Location was excellent and the cocktails in the bar were delicious 
79312,Courthouse Hotel London, Bar prices are a disgrace over 6 for a can of Guinness they even build in a service charge A service charge For opening a can of beer for a resident For this reason I would never go back that is modern day theft and they should be ashamed of themselves for treating customers that way, Location
79313,Courthouse Hotel London, Double bed was actually 2 beds pushed together so had a huge lump in the middle and duvet was lumpy Bulbs broken so lamps didn t work in room Room organised very strangely so TV and chair in front of mirrors Spa only had small pool and sauna No dressing gowns provided We ordered room service and the order that came was completely wrong ,No Positive
79314,Courthouse Hotel London, We would have preferred the hotel we booked as lost time in taxis in bad traffic and the location was next to London Paladium where we needed to be Over half hour each way to Bentley hotel , The hotel called the day before e arrived to tell me we were double booked by booking com We booked in November I also rang week before to confirm booking They arranged for us to stay at Bentley hotel in upgraded room but did pay taxi there and back to Courthouse and gave us free meal and wine back at their hotel Did all they could but we did book Courthouse as next to London Paladium which was where we wanted to be for concert Also then cost us more in taxi to get back to Euston from Bentley Hotel in Knightsbridge 
79315,Courthouse Hotel London, The cost of drinks was high plus the fact that a service charge was added to everything, Classy but not ostentatious Location Soho beside the London Palladium just off Regent Street across the road from Carnaby Street and a few minutes walk from Covent Garden
79316,Courthouse Hotel London, The reception area should be improved as it has little tired look, Good courteous staff Excellent Location l will stay here again on my next vacation
79317,Courthouse Hotel London, The place was a bit tatty missing toilet roll holders plates on electrical points around the bathroom sink hanging off in both rooms I stayed in I had to remove the plug from the bath with tweezers in one room because there was no chain I had to move rooms because the first room had very poorly fitting sash windows which provided no noise reduction from the street with rubbish collection trucks at 5am each morning My room wasn t cleaned after leaving at 9am and coming back to 2pm Just minor things but they all added up The location is very hard to beat though , Great location interesting building it used to be the magistrates court and has the old prison cells off the bar downstairs very interesting and quirky bar and restaurant on site and also a roof bar which is sometimes open depending on the weather Very friendly and helpful staff responsive and nice every time I met them 
79318,Courthouse Hotel London, Didn t take breakfast as I considered this expensive my sister stayed with me and she had breakfast at O Neills opposite the hotel a much cheaper option , Large room with Bath shower good supply of hot water however the bath plug was difficult to remove after bathing Bed very comfy feather pillows and quilt so good nights sleep Large TV so didn t need my glasses to watch it in bed Location fantastic directly opposite Carnaby Street so great for getting to theatres and restaurants etc 
79319,Courthouse Hotel London, Shower was badly designed and couldn t really fit under even for a slim girl of 5 6 Charged for items I haven t purchased from the mini bar only knew of this because I checked my bank account Tea was bad at breakfast Cleaners came in twice even with sign on door saying do not disturb and I had checkout at 12pm the same day , The location
79320,Courthouse Hotel London, A fuse went on our floor at 12am and was not fixed until 10 30am leaving us without lights in our room Was told to show credit card for security reasons and was told no money was to be taken to find out when checking online banking a 50 deposit had been taken bad communication , Excellent location lovely room rooftop bar amazing experience pool lovely and clean Original holding cells a lovely feature Overall an extremely lovely hotel 
79321,Courthouse Hotel London, I felt that for a 5 star I would have expected there to be robes in the room Also the shower screen was missing a part though we were only there 1 night and I expect it would have been fixed immediately , All staff very friendly and the location is hard to beat Was also given a free upgrade as it was our anniversary Returned to our room and the hotel had delivered some cake to celebrate too 
79322,Courthouse Hotel London, Hotel was falling apart Furniture broken cupboard coming off in your hands lobby furniture was broken and had holes in the sofa A nightmare and most certainly not 4 stars , Great location 
79323,Courthouse Hotel London, Some of the furnishings were a little tired Breakfast was very expensive 20 so we did not take it , The comfort of the very large bed and the spacious room 
79324,Courthouse Hotel London, Lost my phone in the hotel and when I asked the staff they didn t seem that bothered but I perservered and eventually one of the managers found it with some story saying he was about to hand it in lost my confidence with the hotel a little but will stay here again Also not enjoying the price hike on rooms should be some sort of loyalty scheme for regular guests , Stay here quite regularly and also have a pleasant stay
79325,Courthouse Hotel London, Room was above the service area bins were being emptied at 7am Don t rate buffet type breakfasts wasn t very hot, attention to detail and personal touch
79326,Courthouse Hotel London, Room was smaller than expected awful fitted furniture with no real bedside table the bed glided around and you could feel mattress springs Oh and there was a missing cover to the shaver point in the bathroom,No Positive
79327,Courthouse Hotel London, I couldn t access the wifi but there was a business suite which I could use and very speedy in there , My husband needs a wheelchair and the staff couldn t have been more friendly and helpful Big comfy room nice toiletries and very clean Bar staff also very friendly although a bit overworked and the bar very noisy but it was Friday night 
79328,Courthouse Hotel London, The room bathroom could have been cleaner There was hair in the bath left over from the previous guest , Location was fantastic The bar was very pleasant 
79329,Courthouse Hotel London, Bed mattress felt old lumpy and work out Breakfast cold afternoon tea was a little hit and miss asked for newspaper Sunday morning but didn t arrive When I asked I was told they hadn t time to go and buy it even though there was a stall outside hotel, Bedroom clean and tidy roof terrace nice idea and good atmosphere Fantastic location 
79330,Courthouse Hotel London,No Negative, Lovely hotel in an excellent location Turned up at 1130 just to check our bag in we were able to get straight into our room As we went for my wife s birthday they left us a piece of lovely chocolate cake with happy birthday on the plate Roof terrace is beautiful as well 
79331,Courthouse Hotel London, Tried to check into our room at 2 15 pm and was told that we couldn t for at least 45 mins We had plans and these were sadly ruined because we were unable to change and shower in our room which we had paid for to check in at 2 00 pm We weren t even given a courtesy refund or the opportunity to stay an extra hour the following day Very disappointing , Location was good
79332,Courthouse Hotel London, Poor service staff don t speak much English shabby or tacky corridors too expensive for what you get, There s nothing much to like about this place apart from the location 5 star prices for a 2 star hotel 
79333,Courthouse Hotel London, Everything was old The couches of the lobby were broken and so unconfortable It needs a renewal straight away, Location was top The rooftop bar was also cool 
79334,Courthouse Hotel London, Not being disturbed at 7 30 AM by the whole floor being revamped and workers trying to come in Also didn t like the hidden security fee , I loved how the hotel is immaculate and is well run 
79335,Courthouse Hotel London, Booked a twin room but got a double eventually got a change Door cards had to be reset no kettle in room no plug for bath breakfast was from 7 but nothing was ready at 7 Pool and spa didn t open until 10am restaurant had selection of steaks but had ran out Not ideal for the marathon before or after but location was perfect, Location good breakfast lovely very clean
79336,Courthouse Hotel London, The lack of help from staff everything we asked was passed on to someone else and never dealt with which caused stress to our stay The second day was the morning of the London Marathon at breakfast there wasn t anything out at 7am despite people wanting to leave early We had to wait and ask for everything and it wasn t even busy The spa is a grubby sauna and a tiny swimming pool, The location
79337,Courthouse Hotel London, Breakfast food was on the cool side Mattress too firm for my liking obviously this would suit some Tried to charge us for breakfast even though we had booked breakfast included After mangers involvement it turned out that they were charging me another guests invoice , Location recently decorated very clean 
79338,Courthouse Hotel London, The fact that the spa was fully booked so not spa tmts on a spa grate day and could not get late lunch in restaurant as its only serving afternoon tea I did not like the card show either Waste of money, Breakfast buffet amazing Really lovely room and great staff
79339,Courthouse Hotel London,No Negative, Fabulous hotel in the heart of everything we needed Couple of minutes walk from Oxford Circus tube great shops restaurants Perfect for shows 3 stood from kings X Perfect and loved the up grade 
79340,Courthouse Hotel London, Since I paid a lot of money for the rooms I would have expected better service The rooms were not ready at 2pm as promised Instead we were asked to wait in the lobby while they check if the rooms are ready We waited for 30 minutes after which I went back to the receptionist to ask what was taking so long and she actually lied and said that she had looked for us in the lobby but did not find us That was just not true we had been sitting on the couches four people the whole time and I had been looking at the reception She definitely had not come look for us However at that point the other room was ready but they were still checking if they could give the other one as well Well we happened to go past that room on our way to the other room and the cleaning had only just began It took another hour or so before the other room was finished All of this would have been understandable had they apologised and maybe offered drinks at the hotel bar while we were waiting but instead they chose to lie about the situation and not only once So got a bit of a rocky start which affected our whole stay in the end Every hour was important since we only stayed a day in London , Great location quite big rooms very clean 
79341,Courthouse Hotel London, Room not quite up to my standards No dressing table mirror no bedside lighting Whichever light switch used all lights went on or off therefore no choice of lighting in the bedroom area , Staff were all efficient and friendly Breakfast very good

79343,Courthouse Hotel London, After looking at trip adviser I was expecting terrible hotel but what I saw of it pleasantly surprised, The best located hotel in London I have ever stayed in my wife s 40th birthday on checking in was upgraded and after a bit of shopping returned to room to find birthday cake nice touch
79344,Courthouse Hotel London, The bar staff Friday evening were a little short we were in the bar having drinks Before we went to our rooms and the bar staff were quite rude It was late close to closing time but they made us feel uncomfortable which was a shame as we were all on a high from our first night being in the London But we met at the bar the next day and the service was a lot better for the rest of the weekend , The location was amazing The rooms were a great size Really enjoyed our stay The hotel was beautiful lovely staff and cocktails 
79345,Courthouse Hotel London, Everything from the price to the state of the room We had a free upgrade to a superior King The room was small and dirty with mould in the bathroom This hotel calls itself 5 star but does not deliver Very poor standards, Location in the centre of city
79346,Courthouse Hotel London, The air conditioning was rather noisy particularly during the night , Excellent central location Waiter in Carnaby Restaurant was a very pleasant young man

79350,Courthouse Hotel London, Service at reception was poor could not find booking for 15 minutes Only one room available when checking in room 101 so reception gave that room to our friends even though we did the booking We were allocated room 609 later in the day the room was smaller than room 101 and was extremely noisey preventing reasonable sleep Why was I given the worst room when i made the booking and paid for it We were told it was a room upgrade so I dread to think what the original room was like Paid 170 for the room was not worth 100 Would like a refund please, Location
79351,Courthouse Hotel London, Almost everything could have been better We have been staying at the courthouse for 10 years so over 10 visits It used to be a fantastic hotel in every respect However it is well over due for a refurb it is tatty and tired No excuse for painted walls to look shabby Rooms are dated and tatty Bed was in need of throwing out together with the bed linen it was appalling Usually this hotel provide little touches that I have found as standard all over the world robes toiletries and a fresh set of towels each day We had to ask for house keeping to visit the room not best pleased Staff were fairly helpful but also seemed miserable and fully aware the hotel was not up to standard we were told as much by the supervisor who offered a free upgrade to a magistrate suite as she was used to guests complaining We refused the upgrade as it was far worse than the room we already had All in all we came back because of location but even 2 years ago it was looking bad but we used to love this hotel so went back We will not be returning until it is refurbished I have only left feedback because I would hate for this hotel to be a let down for that special anniversary or birthday The hotel cost us 600 for 2 nights not the most expensive nor the cheapest but for less money we could have stayed somewhere that was in less of a state inside , The location is very good for shopping on Oxford St and Regent street Right opposite Carnaby Street 
79352,Courthouse Hotel London, staff at concierge service not so smiley felt like they where bored to help quite the opposite of what they should feel like Booked this hotel among other things for the spa tried calling the spa during opening hours for like 5 times during 2 hours they did not pick up the phone even once so no Spa for us unfortunately , perfect location and really nice breakfast staff at breakfast really nice and service minded Perfect starting point for shopping vacation

79357,Courthouse Hotel London, Very poor breakfast quality Is better to be avoided Although genius member they did not allow me check out at least 1 2 h more The hotel is not 5 stars but max 3 in my opinion The worst thing was that from the beginning they blocked my card with the whole amount for all days plus 50 pounds per day for guarantee For a single room ,No Positive
79358,Courthouse Hotel London, This is one of those tick box hotels 5 stars mean xyz tick All those nice touches that one expects from a 5 star hotel forget it A bit of thought on furniture free water fruit decent minibar gin vodka etc not just two cans of cheap lager bath robes forget it Even trying to get a morning paper was just way too much to ask They know what the minimum is for the 5 star and keep to the minimum no extra effort If it is the cheapest in the west end by all means go for it but i have stayed at 20 better places withing half a mile over the last 3 years , Great position for London sights and shopping really good restaurants easy walking distance 
79359,Courthouse Hotel London, They took a 40 deposit for any extras which is complete nonsense Had to open door to the fridge and aim remote behind it to change TV channels Bed was hard , Breakfast was nice Room was nice Everything worked 
79360,Courthouse Hotel London, When I checked in I was given a tiny tiny room Had my stay been one night I would have stayed and never gone back As it was the next morning I told the front desk manager that my room was unacceptable even for one night and I had three more to go He said pack your things and check when you return that they would find another room if possible They did I moved That s all great but more importantly the attitude of the staff and their willingness to intervene I would absolutely recommend the hotel , location staff I didn t drink or dine at the hotel 
79361,Courthouse Hotel London, Maybe bigger rooms but it doesn t really matter when you spend all day outside, The staff was really nice breakfast was good and the location was perfect Between oxford street and the soho a lot of good shops around and 3 minutes walk to the underground rooms were nice and the stuff were really nice to us
79362,Courthouse Hotel London, Bedroom quite plain and dated decor Bathroom had a few issues no working plug for the sink hole in the wall just above and behind the mirror toilet roll holder pulling off the wall , Very courteous and helpful staff helped us change rooms very quickly after unfortunately putting us in a smoking room first Breakfast food was good quality and plentiful 
79363,Courthouse Hotel London, Our bed had seen better days the mattress was hard and saggy I suggest the hotel speak to Premier Inn whose beds are very comfortable, The actual building is beautiful I like that they have kept the floors and many of the original features The holding cells in the bar are a great feature Staff in the bar were excellent and the drinks although London prices were not overpriced The reception staff were pleasant and helpful Our room was spacious and clean and although we were in central London it was very quiet 
79364,Courthouse Hotel London, The spa was a bit of a joke very basic Soap products not great either view from room average The website pics make this place look a lot better than it actually is , Comfy beds but moved a lot Rooms are old and tacky shower falling to bits def not 5 star 2 3 star at best Nice staff though 
79365,Courthouse Hotel London, Facilities were very poor We booked especially for a spa break in the light of the Swimming pool and sauna etc Very disappointed by what we discovered Swimming pool was more like a paddling pool and no way deep enough to swim and the sauna steam room very basic All round no luxury and was very average , Staff were helpful and the hotel was clean One big bonus is the sky TV and the large screen in our room 
79366,Courthouse Hotel London, Every time you switch the TV on you need to tune it , Location is perfect if you want to stay in central London rooms are spacious and staff is helpful 
79367,Courthouse Hotel London, I did not like that the hotel was very run down the wallpaper coming away from the corridor walls and that I could hardly see the sign to tell us that this was a hotel and a dirty rug as you walk in I stayed in Barcelona 5 stars and this was a 3 star compared to this and that was cheaper the staff were nice enough Seriously they need to get rid of the sofas and the lift broke down when I was in it I was really scared And the room view could not get any worse than an office block so you had to close the curtains but don t expect an amazing view in London just buildings , I like that Oxford Street was only a foot step away
79368,Courthouse Hotel London, Arriving to be told I had paid for 2 rooms Booking didn t go through first time so tried again 3 weeks later successfully The hotel won t reimburse you booking com wont reimburse after taking money out twice Booking com is a rip off be very careful , Location for central London

79371,Courthouse Hotel London, Some of the staff including the bar staff were very rude The service overall was poor for this standard of hotel We had booked a reservation for dinner but the reservation was lost We had booked for the cinema but the reservation was lost The Concierge should have resolved these things as we were guests at the hotel but didn t seem too bothered and left us to resolve ourselves The Sky Bar was also out of use for a function one of the reasons we booked Overall this hotel wasn t worth the money we spent to have a little bit of luxury in London , The rooms were clean and the hotel was in a good location

79376,Courthouse Hotel London, on Sunday afternoon we decided to have a quiet drink but the whole atmosphere was shattered by a group of children running around like banshees and with a scooter in the reception sitting area Parents didn t do anything to stop it and once the concierge came and told them to stop climbing on the furniture Not the hotels fault though, the hotel is perfect for theatre land and far enough away from Oxford Street to avoid the crowds The staff were without exception superb
79377,Courthouse Hotel London, Didn t like that I had to be questioned at breakfast as they only had 1 breakfast paid until manager agreed that I had paid breakfast wasn t nice for 5 hotel and the bar tried to charge my partner for drinks we hadn t drunk also in our room in the toilet was an open drain by the toilet which I would expect to be covered, Location is good round the corner from Oxford Circus station nice lobby and bar felt that receptionist could have been more friendly other then I ve been waiting for you for check in

79383,Courthouse Hotel London, Upon checkout we were charged an extra 20 because of a clerical error When I asked to speak with a manager the gal behind the counter turned to her coworker and mumbled something which I was unable to understand She turned to me and said he was unavailable Since I was unable to check my previous credit card transactions at the counter and needed to leave to catch a flight I reluctantly paid the 20 , The location was perfect for our two day stay in London We were able to use the hotel as our base and walk everywhere we wanted The concierge recommendations and directional help were spot on and we were able to store our luggage after check out for an extended afternoon While the room decor was a bit dated the bathroom and overall cleanliness of the room was fine

79397,Courthouse Hotel London, The only slight thing I could comment on as a slight negative about the hotel was furniture in the breakfast room were a little wobbly and some of the chairs had marks on them With everything else about the hotel being so amazing this would be the only thing that in my eyes that didn t quite live up to the rest of the hotel standard Having said that I d definitely recommend this hotel to anyone Thanks for a lovely stay , I loved the quirkiness of the hotel for example the bar area keeping the cells as a feature and decorating them and the fact there is a cinema there I d definitely like to try that next time I stay The overall look of the hotel corridors and public areas was lovely and bright and comfortable The staff at concierge Tarik especially were very helpful in helping us chose a restaurant to eat in but we ended up dining in the SILK restaurant on site which was amazing food and good sercice Highly recommend The Rooftop bar was cool and the cocktails were delicious too The blankets to keep warm were a nice touch

79402,Courthouse Hotel London, Had to wait for over an hour for our room to be ready Not fun after a long trip Staff were unfriendly and unhelpful as we had to ask many questions as nothing was explained how to get to the rooms concierge to have our bags breakfast and dinner etc Felt as if we had to keep asking questions and annoying them When we entered the hotel must have been a gathering or conference on as the lobby area was a terrible mess Empty food drinks bags and rubbish everywhere The toilets were an awful mess I didn t even attempt to use them as they were disgusting No toilet rolls no paper towels to wipe hands with and mess everywhere Breakfast was ordered to the room after waiting an hour we called and they said we had about another 30mis wait We had only ordered toast and cereals Check out again was a hassle as we had to go through and check the bill as many discrepancies be warned Even if you pay over 200 for a suite the mini bar is not included , Location
