475738,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Nevertheless location is far from perfect Despite on the map you see it as near Tangenziale it does not have straight way to it so you have to drive away 5 7 minutes before you get to any civilization The hotel itself is surrounded by dull industrial zone The parking is 8 euro per night but being located that far you expect the parking to be included in the price or free of charge The rooms need renovation We were a family of 7 people in 2 rooms and in both we experienced broken doors in douche not working lamps etc We also had broken lamellae of the additional sofa bed fixed by myself There is no kettle and tea coffee in the room and mini bar was extremely poor just two bottles of 0 5 water Breakfast is weak there was just scrambled and boiled eggs few types of sausage and very rare salad with no separate vegetables The next day of our stay the hotel was so crowded that one had to wait for even plates and cups for 15 20 minutes the same about main dishes That is really not what you expect from 4 hotel, The hotel is relatively not far from the commercial area where IKEA Auchan KIABI and other stores are located There is also a transfer to some city locations seems it is a metro station in the morning and in the evening Ostrich geese farm nearby by you cannot get close to them Desserts were rich
475739,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Parking staff need more training on how to deal with customers Find them extremely hostile and rude, Everything was upto the mark except the parking staff which were extremely rude
475740,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The floor was dirty the toilet wasn t cleaned thoroughly none of the lamps worked the room was unimpressive one of the beds was bad and looked awful and the breakfast was not that varied , It has a modern look on the exterior as well as the interior
475741,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Absolutely not a 4 star place Breakfast was terrible and so was the hotel It really ruined our stay in Milan I made a lot of pictures and will go after the entity who gave out these fake stars , The day we could finally check out 
475742,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Our allocated room was not made up and we had to relocate to a different room Didn t like the hand towels as they were cotton and very thin , Excellent information by reception speaking English proficiently on how to get to the city centre Easy access to centre of Milan by catching the hotel transport to San Siro underground station and thereafter underground trains cost only 1 50 one way Hotel great value for money as city centre hotels extremely expensive Secure car parking on site for 8 a day although reviews suggest otherwise Perhaps different when it s a Milan football match Breakfast was good although very busy Beware of mosquitoes especially waiting at night time by San Siro underground for the hotel transport maybe unusual for this time of year but bitten a lot 
475743,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The location is a bit far from downtown Milan but fortunately we had a car and were easily able to drive to the metro , Breakfast was included great value for money 
475744,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The breakfast could have been a bit more variable , For this price it was perfect Although it is quite far from the city center transport connection is really OK If you are looking for good a hotel in Milan where you can have enough breakfast to begin your day you rather travel 20 minutes more than pay hight prices this place is for you 
475745,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Many things that were included on the website turned out to be false There is no Airport shuttle the Bar is not 24 hours it is only open between 5PM and midnight There are no alternatives if the Restaurant is closed we had to walk 30 minutes to the nearest place for food , The breakfast was really good with a decent selection available The staff were always happy to help Though there are no Pokestops nearby the Pokemon around were amazingly numerous 
475746,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Hard to reach after 9 30 PM by public transport 76 With Bus no 80 we can reach it till 1AM but it is 1 2 KM away Double Bed in the standard room is not good it is bit hard No paper pen provided in the room to write some notes to the hotel , Room is very good with Ventilation 
475747,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Shower door could slide off the rail easily flies at dinner time killed it for my kids Safe didnt work Not near city centre and although the shuttle service says it is to city centre they dropped us at the first metro station only saving a 5 minute bus journey , Hotel was very neat Breakfast had lots of fruit personal preferance and cakes were delicious 
475748,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, It s dated and the location at first seems awful but with a bit of patience you can easily make it work for you Pillows were like stone Breakfast was truly awful but free , Value for money is exceptional and although the location is pretty horrendous every effort is made to help the guest and with a bit of patience it turned out to be the right place for us The rooms are 4 star the restaurant isn t however the breakfast was free and was edible My son and I like our own space so to get two rooms for under 100 was fantastic and we would stay there again especially now we understand the public transport system better The staff were very good and as helpful as they could be Public areas were bright and offered a lot of space but were very warm 
475749,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Very disappointed Upon my arrival I was introduced in an uncleaned room and I had to complain about it in order to receive a new one The new one was ok but the overall condition of the room was of a low quality not of a 4 star hotel Dirty curtains stained carpet the walls made from plasterboard had hits and holes the bar was supposed to contain some food and beverage but it mere had 2 bottles of water The breakfast was quite good but still hotel guys 4 star hotel requires a certain level of professionalism and respect for customer You cannot serve from scraped plates and cups Just get rid of them or replace them Parking is paid apart 8 euros per day City tax 5 euro person day This was my first time in Hotel Idea San Siro Without knowing the conditions I booked in advance a room for 2 different period of time Now knowing this I cancelled the second booking , Location is good Breakfast is very good 
475750,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, 1 we booked a room for three people and there was only a double bed in our room so we went to the reception to ask what was going on They promised us to bring an extra bed in an hour so we went for a walk When we came back in 3 hours there still was nothing So we asked once again and they managed to solve this problem by 2 am taking into consideration that we had to leave to the airport at 8 we didn t have a rest 2 no shampoo and shower gel in the room only for one person 3 broken facilities see photos 4 extra fee not stated in the booking for this mess we had to pay 5 euro extra pro person so 15 euro 5 poor breakfast 6 dirty walls, Nothing I will never come back to this hotel again it was one of the worst experiences in my life
475751,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Difficult to access without a car Parking is expensive No water kettle available in the rooms had to go to the bar for Hot water , It s near the airport Good wifi 
475752,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, It complicated to reach city center and the staff didn t inform us that tickets are not sold in buses , The room was clean The brekfast were good with various choices Staff was polite and friendly The hotel was good for the price 
475753,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, There was only a sheet in the room no blanket Only one town for two people Breakfast wasn t great but ok , The rooms were clean and the staff were friendly Location good for car and metro 
475754,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, You have to pay a city tax that is not included in the stay price and an 8 euro day parking fee even if you have a booking with them , Overall was okm
475755,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, My bed was broken and the staff vould do nothing about it so we slept on the floor Lack of blankets and pillows Smilled cigarettes every where Bad break fast Remote spot out side the city of Milan and they still ask for high city tax Plenty of parking spaces that guests needs to pay for 8 euro per night One of my worst stayings if not the worst , Almost nothing 
475756,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The hallways were gloomy and would benefit from new carpet and some light paint There weren t bed sheets for both beds and towels were missing After requesting more were provided but still not for everyone Some of the staff were more interested in their nails than the customers Parking cost 8 day Hotel is located in industrial area you most likely will need a car , Price was quite ok Breakfast was also quite nice and breakfast room was spacious The reception lobby was really nice and modern Pretty short drive to San Siro stadium and Santa Maria delle Grazie where da Vinci s The Last Supper is 
475757,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, reception only 2 active desks for such a big hotel parking strange automatic system you pay per day but then if you go in out several times day you depend on a person, very good melons for breakfast
475758,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The internet coverage was terrible No service in the room Each room only gets one internet code We had 3 people in the room and only one could use the internet I would not stay in the future because I am on business and need service ,No Positive
475759,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Maybe it was a 4 stars hotel ages ago D some places really needs a redecoration In the morning fire alarm was screaming in the corridors but no one reacted to that We called to the reception to ask about this situation but no one reacted I guess it is a normal thing for them D parking is 8 euros per day The location is awful It is outside the city border but they still charge you a 5 euros per night for city taxes The closest metro station is 10 minutes by car And by foot I don t know I guess you stucked in that place D, Really good breakfasts Big and comfortable bed 
475760,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Breakfast was better in simple 3 hotel than here There were a lot of flies in restaurant Parking cost 8 euros per night , Modern hotel Nice staff 
475761,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro,No Negative, The hotel is located in a remote part of the city there is no mode to reach the location in odd hours There is no restaurants or means of transport located in vicinity The airport shuttle service provided by hotels is very expensive and is not dependable I would suggest anyone planning to stay in this hotel to avoid it at any cost 
475762,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, An out of the city center hotel like this should offer free parking The 8 EUR that are charged here per 24 hours are not devastating but it s more of a principle matter , If you need a place to stay near Milan while driving past but don t want the hassle of going into the city with your car this hotel is the perfect place to stop at It s conveniently located and doesn t bite much into your budget but still offers you comfort and cleanliness for the night 
475763,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Perhaps the breakfast was basic but its ok everything was there at the end of the day basic is enough sometimes , Spacious rooms secured open parking at low cost 8euros per day 11km from the historical centre of Milano which is 25 min by car easy to find great solution for a stop by with a car or even visit Milan 
475764,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Reception clerk didn t tell me to sign up for the shuttle ahead of time He just told me to show up and they were booked up , The room is really nice
475765,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, I liked nothing about this hotel you could not even compare it to to a highway motel The service was non existing the restaurant in the hotel was closed being a Sunday the telephone was not working and the room was at the far end from the reception When my wife went down to inform the front desk the lady at the reception just shrugged to say she could not help her and so we had to go without food The next day we complained about the hot water in the bathroom and housekeeping told us to take the matter to the management which probably will arrive after we check out Overall it would be beneath me to even rate this hotel as a one star , A very big NOTHING 
475766,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Location it very hard to find Sat nav does not get you there Was driving around looking for the hotel Also car parking was 8 extra, Room was modern
475767,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Everything was dirty Blood stain on bed cover and bed cloth Extremely dirty staff were very angry They were always behave badly to the guest They even chid the guests it was awfull to watch while they were reprimanding the guests , Nothing
475768,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, We went there to stay after a concert since the website mentions a free shuttle service from to San Siro Turned out the shuttle service was not free at all it was 10 Euro each Value for money at least No that was to have only ONE small mini van that would travel back and forth from the stadium after the concert we had to wait on the street almost 2 hours to get on the shuttle And we weren t the last group going back some people had to wait even more Furthermore the travel was uncomfortable as we tried to get in as many people as possible so we were 14 in an 8 seats van The room was ok but it was impossible to switch the air con off and in the middle of the night we were freezing No blankets were available in the room so we had to sleep with our clothes on When we said so to the receptionist the next morning she said we should have opened the window to stop the air con as it is a system that can t be turned off manually I suggested to put a sign in the room or at least have blankets available she said we should have called them and they would have explained that to us I find it a ridiculous answer to give when I just told you I was awaken in the middle of the night by the cold No free wifi , Breakfast was good 
475769,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The hotel was not clean Several objects in the room were broken and I found it very dangerous Hallways and room smelled cigarette and trash The garbage was always full Breakfast was horrible One coffee machine was off and the other machine was pouring more water than coffee There were only a few pieces of cut bread and they looked like old sliced bread It was a mess I couldn t sleep because the bed was small for two people and too hard The room was not silent The elevator was dirty and with problem and we were afraid to use one of the elevators I would not recommend this hotel , Nothing 
475770,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Disgusting coffee big mess chaos and lack of cutlery for breakfast not enough vegetables poor chemical juices fortunatelly the rest food was ok , Room was spacious nice and clean 
475771,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Management Hotel got twice our money Because we paid at the reception and they made money transfer from our bank card also The receptionist didn t inform us about this important details , Good breakfast bed bathroom
475772,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The hotel staff advised us not to take our car to Milan and go to a metro station nearby We went to metro station parking and after getting back from city center we saw the glass of car had been broken and thieves stolen all of our luggage Dear Hotel staff Do not advise like this or give correct instruction ,No Positive
475773,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Location which is far from downtown and public transport is not that comfortable to use as closest metro line is 20 euros away by taxi or uber We had to rely on public buses to go to the nearest metro lines Coffee machine was not properly working and coffee was nothing to compare what you could get in the city , Room was comfortable and clean breakfast also good 
475774,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, My room was quite dark and didn t smell very nice I had almost the feeling it used to be a room for smokers Wifi connection was slow , The parking is secured all nights and is free for the first 2 hours It costs only 8 euro per night
475775,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Air condition was not working and their solution was to open a window Triple room does not fit for 3 persons The bartender was never there, The good thing about this hotel is the breakfast 
475776,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, What I didn t like that they charge for local calls and also for using the utensils to eat inside the restaurant It should be enough to pay for meals , Everything about it breakfast absolutely fantastic 
475777,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Staff was accommodating , After changing rooms twice once because of a leak second the AC AND fridge out of order third AC not working either we settled 
475778,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The location was terrible it is not even in Milano The price is not worth for 4 star hotel I m not even sure is it a 4 star hotel There are very amenities there and breakfast was so poor and same during the whole stay Some of the reception staff are rude and not helpful and don t understand English Getting public transport to and from the hotel is an absolute nightmare , Nothing at all
475779,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, It is far away from city centre If you want to come back from Milan City Centre after 10pm you should take M1 and then bus 67 and then another 1 5 km of walking And it will take 1 5 hours , It was clean and cheap Breakfast was good 
475780,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, This hotel does not feel like a 4 star hotel The staff was not trained the meal wasn t great everything outside the room felt disorganized and chaotic The restaurant was very slow and everything was micro managed by one person Would only recommend for a very short stay The whole area around the hotel doesn t feel safe and is rather abandoned , The room was decent and the location was good Parking was also possible in front of the location 
475781,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, It was too far from the center of Milan The taxi was too expensive There was no shuttle to take you to the airport , The staff was nice The hotel is pretty new and has a good ambience

475783,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, facilities is old, it is 4 starred Hotel but my feelings says it is not 4 because of facilities and other extra services as instant coffee hot water and few things in the mini bar of the room
475784,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Weird parking situation Dedicated parking for the hotel but separate company Expensive New hotel built with cheap quality shower doors broken ect , Not much 
475785,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The distance from city center listing online is wrong It s a 50 round trip cab ride from the train station so I would ve rather paid more for a hotel in the city Only recommend this place for travelers going to nearby area Room is small , Room was clean and bed was comfortable Shower had nice water pressure 
475786,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The hotel is 3 5 km away from Stadio San Siro metro station There is no late night bus with the last bus dropping close to the hotel ending it s run at 8 PM on weekdays and no service on weekends or holidays The hotel s metro shuttle runs till 10 PM on prior booking Be careful if you rely on public transportation and will reach the hotel late as the approach road is deserted The wifi is open without a password or authentication Good if you just want to surf the net but if you plan to get some work done VPN requirements will block you , The room was well maintained and the breakfast was wholesome 
475787,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, We had to pay additional city tax 5 person for the city of Milan when checking out We had to pay 8 for the parking which is expensive The wifi was not free compared to what was written on the website The cleaning personel just came in the room before knocking the door This is just the basics to have The remote control had no batteries The location of the hotel is not great You do need to have a car , The breakfast was very good The room was clean

475793,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, If you do not have a car moving to anywhere is extremely difficult The hotel s web site and in booking com mentioned that they have a shuttle bus to first metro station but that is NOT true We have to walk 2 km to reach hotel or respectively some transport It was terrible especially at the night , Nothing

475795,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro,No Negative, Extremely clean and comfortable beautiful and peaceful The hotel offers a shuttle to the nearest metro station that goes directly to the center which is amazing the shuttle is free 
475796,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, we had the breakfast included but it wasnt that good the offered cooked eggs omelette but all in all the taste wasnt good only the vegetables were great we wanted to sit on the windowside while having breakfast and there were many empty table But the waiter urged us to sit on the overcrowded side because of preparing the tables for the lunch at 10 am He also was annoyed the we kept sitting on our side weird The location is very poor we needed more than 45 minutes to reach the center of Milano , the price ist very good compared to other locations the entrance and the reception look great

475799,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The building is an orrible and sad piece of concrete The breakfast room was disgusting and the staff wasn t too kind , The price and the cleanliness of the room
475800,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Don t go there if you re already depressed It s relatively cheap so you get cheap stuff The have cut cost where possible and you can feel that from cleaning to simple soap water restaurant and breakfast , It s cheap when hotels in Milan are expensive and worth a try Eccellente Reception staff

475804,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Beds could be more comfortable one of them was even broken Bathroom could do with some maintenance and cleaning was smelly and hadn t been cleaned properly For a 4 star property and for what they charge they can do better The receptionists could definitely do with some English lessons as they scored low on this but was able to manage with my French , Good property well located onsite secured parking 24 hour check in close to public transport shuttle service available limited timings to San Siro Stadium and Metro good buffet breakfast spacious family room 
475805,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The food was good, We came for the Milan match football we wished that a coach after the match would travel us back to the hotel they just gave us a taxi number and no one answered 
475806,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The breakfast is not good vegetables and fruits were not fresh The receptions didn t help us with an iron and laundry , A good location to visit Milano if you travel by a car The room is a specious and clean 
475807,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Booked online weeks ahead and got the room at the end of the corridor Tobacco smelling walls although the smoking in the room was prohibited Breakfast area was always crowded and felt like a canteen with tired overworked and stressed personnel and the food was not always A grade The parking is not free it costs an additional 8 euros car night daytime parking is free however as they said it s under different management The hotel is rather hard to find if you travel by car , Clean and rather spacious room with a huge window that could be opened all the way Clean bedding and good communication with the reception desk personnel and cleaning staff 
475808,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, It is on the outskirts of Milano and you really need a car if you want to be independent Free shuttle to metro station is available however this one runs only couple of hours a day , Good hotel if you want to explore Milano Just the right breakfast to have a good start of your day
475809,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Although I paid the total price for my stay in cash during my stay my credit card was charged once again with the total amount This has never happened to me before I am quite disappointed and I am still waiting my problem to be addressed and solved ,No Positive

475811,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, DO NOT BOOK IF YOU VALUE TIME AND MONEY The hotel is about 1 and half hours from the international airport The staff were completely unhelpful and the manager was downright argumentative The hotel was very expensive yet the aircondition in the entire building was not working no shuttle except for a couple of hours in the morning and again at evening and even when we could get the shuttle it was stated that there were too many of us a Party of 11 I booked this in a hurry as our accomodation got closed down the day before we travelled from Paris so I did not have a great deal of time I looked at the information on the hotel page for Booking com and booked this hotel that infoirmation was inaccurate The manager basically told me that all complaints would come to him so my complaining was useless , Nothing at all
475812,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, If you look in Google Maps where is the hotel set you ll realize it is quite far from the city of Milan Therefore the way to get to the city is to walk for 5 minutes until the closest bus stop the line 76 to get to The South of the city in Bisceglie to go in the Metro line 1 to the center That takes around 50 minutes and it is the most practical way to get to the center from the hotel and viceversa Or this is what I thought until 2 days later an employee told us that there is a free bus to San Siro Stadium This makes the things a lot easier but ourproblem was that the first employee we met in the hotel a middle aged woman didn t even talk about anything else but the tourist tax night which is 5 person Personally I think that wasn t a misunderstanding but the lack of politeness and kindness of that employee in such a high rated and well known hotel just as they want to be known with their 2015 2016 Best Hotel Award on the desk I rated the location as poor because it s a fact but the rating of the staff decreases notably , Breakfast Buffet not a lot of things to chose among but still it is included 
475813,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The name of the hotel is very misleading It s miles from the San Siro and in the middle of nowhere cost an absolute fortune for taxi to the airport due to the terrible location,No Positive
475814,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Parking is paid at such relatively remote area from the city center 10km and most of all the city rule of no air conditioning at this time of the year making the room unbearable during the sun hours , Great attitude of the staff and great service

475816,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Asked for first floor room given ground floor made worse the bed was placed so you could only get out of one side Not good if you are a couple Lots of fixtures broken in the room in air con box n the wall bathroom fittings hanging off the wall Reported to reception Fire alarm boxes flashing all night in the room Could not leave window open securely at night , Location and the breakfast
475817,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, air conditioning didn t work it was too hot at night despite April weather too sweet breakfasts poor coffee served during breakfastst It had nothing in common with real Italian coffee it s not easy to get from the hotel to center of Milan without a car no glass cup in the room and poorly equipped fridge, Staff Beds Cleanliness there s a shuttle bus to San Siro metro station
475818,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, It was very far away And was nothing in that zone Was very isolated place And tha staf wasn t nice at all , The rooms where nice also the breakfast

475821,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The air conditioning wasn t working while we were there and we were just told to open the window to which there was no breeze or air at all I understand they can t control the weather but should of provided fans at least as we aren t used to the humid weather like they are Disappointed with what I paid for with the as the surroundings aren t nice and weren t blown away by the hotel , The location is okay If you don t mind traveling an hour to the centre It s only 10 min bus journey to the San Siro stadium which was good but that s all No shops near or anything 
475822,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, As I checked in my room I found my WC not even flushed with everything that you can imagine and dog food in the dustbin I understand that I went in a busy period but that is definitely not an excuse to provide such a service I had to keep my phone charging in the end of the room as the plug couldn t fit in an electricity plug between two light switches in the middle of the bed s headboard I also find it very cheap of the hotel when you have to pay for the water when it s not provided with the room I found 2 long blond hairs in the scrambled eggs on the breakfast buffet and the waiter that I reported to did t even seem to care about it It was just very frustrating to be in such conditions after a long day of work and meetings as the hotel is the only place where we should be comfortable during our travels Big deception And yes the location is very far from everything there is no direct bus nor train that can take you to it from the center so you ll definitely have to grab a taxi If you re lucky to find one from the closest station that the public transportation could get you to it ,No Positive

475826,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Breakfast was boring and basic and it reminded me of feeding time at the zoo You had to fight your way through hoards of school kids and people for a coffee half of what was out was empty and rarely refilled IE pastries also no cereal bowls for cereal The location is ridiculous Don t bother I d say pay a little extra if you are in Milan Expect a huge whack on you bill before you leave City tax 5 euro per person per night They also sell you bus tickets to catch the bus outside to San Siro station They fail to tell you that because they are 10 metres from the urban district area you will be fined by a bus inspector The inspector said that the tickets they sell are useless because the hotel is out of the area code We refused to pay the 60 euro fine mind Instead we were issued with 150 euro fine to pay when back home to embassy The hotel never apologised Rude staff Instead simply said don t pay it then , Clean rooms

475828,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, This hotel doesn t value 4 stars you can see it in many details the rooms should be refreshed for example the carpet in the room was quite dirty In the first room where we were placed the window didn t close so we were moved to another room which was more spicious which is good but the question is why they don t give to the guests better free rooms from the beginning The hall downstairs was very cold while in the room it was too hot During the breakfast the staff forbid you to use the trays even though they re placed right in the middle of the breakfast room for the staff use only but it s not written anywhere We had a small child so the tray was very usefull to facilitate our breakfast Anyway it s a small detail but it s strange attitude for 4 stars hotel , The breakfast was good
475829,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, For me was a dissapointed night there, Its look like 2 stars hotel the lady that was in wed around 4 she was really nice other staff i dont know looks cheap the hotel bus of hotel disappointed really few things on breakfast bacon eggs some salami 1kiind of cheese few fruits few croissant coffee disgusted for what 4 stars

475836,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The room was noisy because of the chiller of the hotel The lighting in the room according to my estimation was not enough There are a lot of lamps but without central lamp it was really dark There was no wardrobe and for stays longer than two days will be really inconvenient , The hotel is good for business trips or groups Access from the highway is easy There is available parking 8 EUR per night The breakfast is very good with fruits and dishes for vegetarians also 
475837,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Only 1 receptionist and you have to wait a lot for checkin and out It was a bit strange for me to pay 8 Eur for parking in a hotel in a rural area where they have a lot of space for parking , The price was good overall good value for money

475842,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The only thing that seems bad is the location I was told by hotel staff that they couldn t arrange offered free transport to the nearest metro station but since Milan has very good public transport I had managed to reach all my locations quickly , Everything was just great Idea Hotel made my journey comfortable and enjoyable Breakfast was absolutely fantastic 
475843,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The hotel is too much far from the city centre however no shuttle bus services available The thing that I don t like the most is when making the checkout they told me there is a tax for each person in the room per each night, Value for money

475908,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The A C kept starting at night although we set it to off Breakfast staff started cleaning up the buffet shortly before breakfast time ended Also the quality of the food and the atmosphere was poor Hotel is located in an industrial area but you normally know that before , Nice and modern hotel Was worth the money when considering location and included breakfast Checkin and checkout was smooth and friendly 
475909,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Location in some dodgy industrial area entered the car park I had some guy follow me on a bike telling me don t park here it s dangerous which he then showed me a spot near the hotel entrance and charged me 10 the car park was 8 , Being close to the motor way
475910,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro,No Negative, At the arrival the key would not be working so we had to wait 20 minutes for new room in the new room previous guest was smoking and the smell was quite strong for your refernce check room number 255 and you will see that that guest wrapped cling film over the fire alarm on the other side great breakfast and plus point to stuff member called Husein He kindly helped us to sort out new room and smoke smell 
475911,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Safe wouldn t open Shower door fell off Shower flooded Shower head kept falling off Shuttle that was suppose to take us to the train station was missing , Was quite cheap
475912,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Payment of parking still I can t figure it out why since there is no other option and is their own parking Far from city centre compensated with a reasonable price , Very good for transit good breakfast clean room comfortable bed 
475913,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, We received a very good deal on this hotel so it makes it difficult to criticize but here are few points Despite the hotel looked very modern taps in bathrooms in two different rooms were very loose making it difficult to get warm water in one one of the rooms The position of the hotel wrt the centre of Milan is far from ideal The frequency of the public transport from the last metro station tram station at the Stadium of San Siro to the hotel is not very high The advertised shuttle was not operating during our stay It takes about an hour to get from the hotel to the center and you need to make sure not miss your bus , We stayed only one night in the hotel and we definitely enjoyed it Very nice rooms large comfy bed delicious breakfast but with horrible coffee 
475914,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, it s a not easy to find hotel The hotel is in an industrial area and we were going around and around for hours and we couldn t find it even with GPS You have to put the address via Enrico Fermi to find the hotel The hotel has a lot of parking area but you have to pay extra for it instead of being free ,No Positive
475915,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The room was dirty and the sealing was repaired and not finished the smell was awfull and yeah it s a 2 star hotel so think twice before you book here I don t recomend , Nothink to like 2star hotel Don t reccomend The price was good but the quality poor 
475916,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, additional cost wifi additional cost parking far away location not so clean not worth saving few euros its better to spend this extra money not on parking or wifi but for better hotel , Big breakfast
475917,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, It s not in San Siro It s much farer, The breakfast was varied and tasty the room is comfy and the internet was super in the first night 
475918,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Breakfast and dinner foods is not good The garden needed maitance Not enough chairs in the lobby bar Toilet for men are very bad en maitance needed This hotel is not 4 stars , The bed was good
475919,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Poor breakfast same every day The location is not so bad but the bus to metro is too hard to get , Great reception workers clean room nice environment 
475920,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, One of the worst hotel I have ever seen No cattle iron hairdryer is not working I requesting some ice to make Compresses to my child they answered no we don t have I requested a cattle to prepare some tea they answered rudely not available The breakfast is so poor bread and cakes The location is out of nowhere in the middle of industrial zone far from the center with 30 minutes with the car The staff need a lot of training how to deal with the guests they seems to be not caring if you are satisfied or not The room is full of mosquitos and flies Parking costs you 8 euro per night and you have to check the kiosk every time you come out the parking I strongly not recommending this hotel for any one , non
475921,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Location quite far from the city and even San Ciro need a car WiFi not very good and sign up is social network e mail bound If we are to pay for parking we should at least get some covered places Breakfast lacked variety and healthy options, Very good value for money you get quite a lot for the price Room was spacious and hotel was very quiet Facilities are very well kept Nice restaurant with decent prices
475922,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The worst hotel that I have ever stayed My hand bag stole at the hotel s restaurant while I was making breakfast When we wanted to look at the security camera records they said us that they don t have camera Can you imagine that a hotel does not have any camera What a fool situation Also the stuff took it normally as it happens every time Besides its location is very far away from the center Briefly if you don t want to perish with your money do not approach Idea Hotel Exactly 0 points , Nothing 
475923,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Do not like the breakfast arrangement very disorganised , Like the price cleanliness safe car park and the fact that they do not take any payment until you stay also that you can cancel until 24 hours before 
475924,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Breakfast is given as 7 10 30 and the most annoying thing was being told as we were eating breakfast finished rather rudely with no pre warning at about 10 35 10 40 and finding out the coffee machine etc all turned off and staff standing over us trying to get us to leave My rather slow eater 3 year old was pretty put out she couldn t finish all her co co pops Was also pretty annoying at the breakfast as we got there about 9 45 and the croissants ran out just as we got there and there wasn t much bread left either Strange as loads of cake cheese salami etc that no one was really eating but hardly any bread croissants Why not swop 4 cakes for a few more croissants Lack of proper coffee and proper juice The lay out of breakfast also quite strange and frustrating eg milk miles away from the cereal and spoons miles away from them Only had 3 pillows and 2 towels for 4 of us A little bit tired looking round the edges but fine for the price , Very good professional check in Good decent hotel for a one night stopover Clean good beds and powerful air con Decent breakfast if you get there before the croissants and bread run out Decor nice modern style Pleasantly surprised by the room Lots of fruit at breakfast 
475925,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, I choose this hotel only because before booking I read that they have FREE shuttle to airport After booking there was written that shuttle is for additional cost When I arrived to hotel I found out that shuttle buss starts only from 09 00 so beware that this hotel thinks that peoples don t fly in the mornings Taxi from hotel to airport we found out from reception that it costs 140 euros And to get from hotel to airport in the morning it s huge problem because you need choose multiple metros trains buses My advice for everyone who travels without car choose hotel which is in center because there from central station you can find shuttle for normal money Also in hotel room there was very weird unpleasant smell Left window open all night and still it didn t came out , Hotel was modern and with great breakfast 
475926,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Not good breakfast horrible Coffee Drink was served in plastic cup You must pay 10 2 per extra for city tax and 8 for 24h parking 30 minutes to city center by car , Very friendly staff room was very clear and comfortable The hotel is big and looks very nice
475927,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The hotel is nice and comfortable although is a bit far from metrostation That I did not like is when I check out the wifi network was fail and I had to wait a 40 minutes for noting i was delate for my flight and after that the reception took my credit card details to pay a tourist tax otherwise I have paid for overnight stays ,No Positive
475928,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Wifi is based on Facebook and Google sponsorship Breakfast is quite basic and very based on a sugar based menu cakes white bread choko pops rather than dark bread cereals fruit etc , Despite the hotels number of stars it should be recognised as a budget hotel If evaluated from that perspective it is a fine hotel Location is close relatively close to a huge water park San Siro metro station 20 minutes to Milano city Center and Doumo local supermarket and high way leading to airport Malpensa approx 35 minutes 
475929,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Restaurant pizzas were not nice waiter rather grumpy Stains in bed sheet Mould in the shower Fusebox making noises every 15 minutes Location outskirts of town not a very pretty neighbourhood, Breakfast was good Bed was OK
475930,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, It was not clear that the parking was not free and the environment outside was not marvelous , The room is very comfortable The breakfast is great even if there is a lot of people in front of the buffet there is a huge choice and good quantity 
475931,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Staff where a little rude some didn t seem to know what they where doing Location a little downside , Room was airy and spacious cleaned daily and air conditioned 
475932,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Wifi Connection was free but working very slowly in room and lobby Located in an industrial zone a bit far from city center but perfect for the exhibition centre, Very recomendable place Well equipped and enough space in the room Very comfortable bed Friendly staff at reception Very big lobby Great breakfast
475933,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, It looked like two star hotel AT MOST Dirty walls Stains on bed frame organic origin bleh There was naked man in my room when checked in When spoken with staff they seem not care too much about such a terrible mistake Didn t offered anything as apology just a short sorry They ve checked me in to a occupied room Wanted to ask for refund but I had not enough time and was too tired to deal with the situation Over all terrible experience 3 10, Location
475934,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Breakfast was poor Bad instant coffee bad juices bacon not cooked well and on the second day no bacon at all no sausages Location without a car is too far away , The room was nice and big Free parking behind the hotel gate 
475935,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The name San Siro suggests a location near the stadium and metro station This is not the case It s possible to travel to Milan by bus but the latest bus returns around nine at night , The room was okay beds as well 
475936,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Not 4 stars No tea coffee facilities A plastic cup in double room one towel in double room Staff not sure of approximate cost of taxes No complementary mineral water Terrace looks on to unkempt grounds and parking was charged for No porter facilities after 22 00 4 stars no way , Staff friendly and willing to get us food even though we were late arrivals
475937,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, At time of booking I had asked for a gluten free breakfast Unfortunately there were no gluten free products available at breakfast The sofa bed cover was soiled dirty The safe was locked from previous guest and therefore we were unable to use it No extra pillows in the room , Staff at reception and in the breakfast room were very polite and friendly Good shuttle service to and from San Siro 
475938,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Difficult to find even with GPS Paid parking for a hotel in an industrial zone outside the city ring , Well organized hotel good rooms good breakfast

475947,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The hotel is located in nowhere not close to any metro station and every taxi to the city costs about 20 25 The price was very high but we stayed during the UCL final The is nothing to do in the hotel itself so it s just a clean place to stay in , The hotel staff is very nice and the breakfast was pretty much ok
475948,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, There is a 8 euro per 24 hr parking fee and a 10 euro city tax so if you are on a tight budget you may want to take this on board but I personally like the secure parking , The best budget hotel we have ever stayed in Its really close to the Autostrada which is why we booked Staff are fantastic despite some very rude customers and one even phoned for a pizza for us Breakfast is so good with loads of fresh fruit and pastries

475953,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, It was a bit isolated from facilities bars restaurants etc outside of the hotel It is also perhaps not the best choice if you wish to go sightseeing in Milan despite it being within a couple of miles of the station at the end of the metro line , Clean comfortable and reasonable value for money Good for an overnight stop for those with a car 
475954,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The hotel is a little far away from central Milan although this is fine if you get the metro and the bus from just outside that takes you to the hotel The restaurant staff were not the most friendly , The room was large and very clean towels and bedding changed each day Reception staff very friendly and helpful Free wifi and shuttle bus to the metro station 
475955,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The room no hot water in the shower loud AirCond empty mini bar non working fridge Breakfast choice was very poor The hotel is right next to a highway which is pretty loud too Can t recommend ,No Positive
475956,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, We were not informed that the buses stop at 8 00pm on Sunday evening and that we could take the number 80 bus , The lift is very fast On Sunday it was good to have food delivered to our room Also it was very good to give us 2 extra pillows The location is excellent you can see the mountains at a distance and it is surrounded by a large green area

475965,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Dirty and very cold the hall was freezing The cleaning staff was poorly trained and left in the corridors a really unpleasant smell of sweating The room was without towels and cleanings products In addition was also very noisy Apparently not soundproof , Only the price but consider that you have to pay the parking From an hotel basically outside Milan it is not fare charging for the parking 
475966,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, You had to log into the wifi every time you wanted to use it There was a nasty spill in the mini fridge that had started to mold , The room walls had a really nice soothing blue color
