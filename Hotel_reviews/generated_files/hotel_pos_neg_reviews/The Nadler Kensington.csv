121850,The Nadler Kensington, Nothing really , Lovely location in Kensington very friendly staff nice quiet room with outdoor space and the staff had excellent knowledge of the area and restaurants 
121851,The Nadler Kensington, 1 only very small issue with air conditioning making a buzzing noise but really nothing as it didn t bother me , the staff were excellent so incredibly helpful I was in a long deluxe room so the size was great and good size bathroom too I was given a room with an outdoor patio too unheard of in central london
121852,The Nadler Kensington, The fridge should have had something to eat especially for people who arrive late at night and won t go out again to buy something Also as there s a shower there should have been two soaps Moreover I would strongly recommend stating that there is no hairdryer available just so you know whether to take it or not , The room was super cozy and the bed was extra comfy As soon as your turn on the TV they recieve you with jazz and blues The kitchenette was nice 
121853,The Nadler Kensington, Everything was wonderful No suggestions for improvement , From attentiveness to every little detail of guest comfort to superior help from front desk staff with anything at any time this was truly a gem of a hotel Situated in a lovely Kensington neighborhood within 5 minute walk to Earl s Court tube station I couldn t have asked for a better place to stay on my first trip to London Highly recommend 
121854,The Nadler Kensington, Bathroom was nice and updated but tub was too high which can cause getting in and out difficult specially for older people Also the glass shower screen was small and didn t seal completely Every shower ended up with water on the bathroom floor We had a problem with the key card to the bedroom every single day we stayed This was due to a malfunctioning set of cards sent to the hotel Even though this was annoying staff was extremely helpful and accommodating , We loved many things about this hotel Great location only five minute walk from public transportation both underground and bus Grocery store and restaurants also within five minute walk Nice neighborhood quiet street Beds were very comfortable kitchenette with mini fridge microwave sink nespresso machine with unlimited coffee pods and kitchenware for all guests Great WiFi connection Clean and quiet Great room service Last but not least staff was excellent always eager to help 
121855,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, The staff is the best I ve come across anywhere in the world Even the fanciest shmanciest hotels can t beat these helpful knowledgeable and kind people They made early check in easy and gave us great recommendations for things to do and places to eat And they went above and beyond I had an accident outside the hotel The manager and her team rushed to take care of me and my son What could have been a scarring event for both of us was soon forgotten about Thank you 
121856,The Nadler Kensington, No restaurant on site at the hotel and usually there are not enough people at the front desk to perform all the tasks needed due to high customer femand so sometimes we had to wait for them to answer the phone if we dial for reception or if we needed them to carry our luggage, Staff were very friendly and accomodating to our every need They even gave us the option of changing our rooms as we were initially placed in the basement which we did not loke at the start but ended up staying there due to the level of comfort of the rooms It was also around the corner from Earl s court unerground station with plenty of food options within a 5 min walking distance from the hotel to choose from They also offer discount codes to guests staying in the hotel to use in nearby restaurants and cafes which we found to be very nice 
121857,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Simply couldn t fault it Great location in a lovely part of Kensington Very conveniently placed for public transport especially if you re visiting Wimbledon yet also within easy strolling distance of Knightsbridge Hyde Park museums etc Well appointed comfortable room with excellent kitchenette facilities including a Nespresso machine Staff very helpful 
121858,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Location was terrific close to Earls Court tube station Lovely area to stay We had single rooms which were quite compact however very clean well designed and had everything we needed for our stay Air conditioning worked really well and room amenities included good hairdryer iron and tea coffee facilities and excellent shower Staff were extremely helpful and polite 
121859,The Nadler Kensington, Would have liked a bath Description misleading I thought that a compact double meant the size of the room In fact the bed was a large single Good job we had 2 of them , MIni kitchen in room handy 
121860,The Nadler Kensington, While still centrally located what I would consider outer circle and excellent tube access it was a little bit of a trek from central sights for quick long weekend trip to London Other trips to London I ve stayed more central where I could walk everywhere At the Nadler we would take the tube and then walk everywhere After careful research however I couldn t beat the price for such lovely accommodations so it was worth being a little farther out , Easy hop from Heathrow one tube ride Very helpful staff Beautiful room and spacious bathroom Many amenities provided including great coffee robes quality shampoo etc Charming neighborhood Excellent value for London Family room was outstanding value for family of four We will return and recommend to our friends 
121861,The Nadler Kensington, We travelled by car and had no idea that the hotel had two parking spaces on site Unfortunately we had already sourced parking elsewhere So it would have been good to know this fact prior to arriving at the hotel ,No Positive
121862,The Nadler Kensington, Not particularly friendly welcome or helpful for a family arriving quite late at night after a long flight delay unfortunately from there we only noticed the negatives There are some physical challenges for example all the stairs and doors with suitcases to navigate and the lack of breakfast service On reflection a okay hotel for couples or solo travellers , A good location near Earls court underground Kensington Museum Parks etc So the hotel has that on its side 
121863,The Nadler Kensington, Very tiny room no where to store our very large suitcases so we were tripping over them constantly The bed was a little small but still enough room for a couple Disliked that it was pushed against a wall so one person had to climb over the other to get in or out On the whole it was a nice experience and the minor negatives did not outweigh the positives , Very clean and really appreciated the kitchenette with fridge sink filtered water and dishes Small room but had a good size bathroom kitchenette and closet Air conditioning was a bonus It was within a few blocks of a subway station a main thoroughfare with restaurants and amenities but with just enough distance to be quiet at night The staff was wonderful and happily held our bags when we arrived too early to check in and when we checked out but wanted to keep touring the city for a while 
121864,The Nadler Kensington, The dirty blanket and floor room is too small Price is not worth , it is very convenient to go other places from the train station behind the hotel Staff are friendly There are a lot of restaurants near by 
121865,The Nadler Kensington, The room was smaller than I thought but it had all the things I needed , I liked the flexibility of the staff with check out and parking I will definitely be coming back as soon as possible with my partner P
121866,The Nadler Kensington, The window blinds in my room did not block out much of the light from the street however staff informed me that they are currently in the process of updating the window dressings in the hotel , Being alone in a foreign city can be daunting however I felt 100 safe and secure in this hotel and had complete privacy The whole room was modern and spacious especially considering I had booked a single room Staff were very friendly and accommodating 
121867,The Nadler Kensington, The room was a bit small but had good amenities complimentary hot drinks nice shower , The staff was wonderful I was alone and 4000 miles from home never been to Europe and they were so welcoming and helpful it made my first day here quite pleasant 
121868,The Nadler Kensington, Lack of in house restaurant However the pub recommended a short walk away was very good, Accommodation staff and location could not have been better Would certainly booked again 
121869,The Nadler Kensington, Only very minor issue was that the fridge could have been colder, Staff very friendly and helpful Clean and comfortable rooms Good location Useful kitchenette Had thought about putting extra towels in bathroom which we so often don t get when travelling with children thank you Staff gave our daughter a small duck as a gift which was a lovely touch We parked our car at the hotel whilst it was not a car park as such was very secure and a great service for us
121870,The Nadler Kensington, Nothing everything was great, Location to Earls Court tube station and high street with plenty of restaurants pubs laundry drycleaners of you want to get some laundry done quickly at a low cost It s on the right side of town for a quick trip out to heathrow Staff were super friendly and very helpful The property is very comfortable spotlessly clean the rooms were quiet and well appointed modern bathrooms plenty of space in the room I booked to stay in The kitchenette was great to make a coffee of a morning being back a few bits pieces to store in lieu of breakfast And house keeping was great each day thoroughly tidying the room bathroom kitchenette I would happily stay here again when I m back in London
121871,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, London hotels in this area are very small but this hotel does an amazing job with the space and the modern touches and friendly staff make up for the cozy quarters Would definitely stay here again 
121872,The Nadler Kensington, Nothing to dislike, The staff were excellent our room wasn t quite ready when we arrived but we given a bottle of wine to compensate Close to Earls Court tube and lots of restaurants and walking distance to the V A and other museums
121873,The Nadler Kensington, Everything was good and as I expected , The hotel is a very cosy bolthole furnished in contemporary style and with very good fittings I chose it for the convenience to Earl s Court Station which is very accessible to Heathrow and because I had previously enjoyed staying at the Soho Nadler I was able to check in early after an early arrival at Heathrow which was very helpful 
121874,The Nadler Kensington, Really happy with everything room was quiet being alone felt nice safe , Location was great really central and close to underground plenty of good places to eat Key fob was used to gain entry out of hours so could come and go as one pleases 
121875,The Nadler Kensington, The throw on the bed is incredibly ugly The thick carpeting on the floors can make it difficult to roll a suitcase , I have previously stayed at this property and return due to location and staff The rooms are compact but include some nice touches such as a Nespresso machine kettle refrigerator and microwave The shower is excellent 
121876,The Nadler Kensington, Wish the room had been a few square feet larger However the design and layout overcame compact room size in a most clever and sophisticated way , Staff best in our England experience Design very cool Room layout extremely clever Nice residential neighborhood a few minutes easy walk to restaurants and Underground Wonderful experience and our favorite stay in England 
121877,The Nadler Kensington, I have no complaints at all about the Nadler It was a great place to stay , Super clean room fantastic helpful staff someone at the desk around the clock Great security with card access to door of building and room Close to the Underground for easy travel My family was very happy here and I can recommend it wholeheartedly to others 
121878,The Nadler Kensington, The staff was great super friendly The room was clean and quiet and had everything I needed The housekeeping staff even let me sleep undisturbed I know rims in London are generally small but it was a little smaller than I expected The mattress was a little too firm for my taste I had difficulty sleeping and woke up a little sore , The staff was great super friendly The room was clean and quiet and had everything I needed The housekeeping staff even let me sleep undisturbed 
121879,The Nadler Kensington, The free wifi was very very slow and the paid options were expensive We are now in an apartment in Lisbon with fast free wifi why can t London hotels provide good wifi , Great location very quiet comfortable and clean 
121880,The Nadler Kensington, The room was not the same as that booked on Booking com Hotel were friendly but unable to change rooms as they were fully booked Booking com failed to respond to my messages , Hotel room was spotlessly clean excellent power shower Pillows mattress comfy 
121881,The Nadler Kensington, We don t really like to be in the basement room , we love the location and the stuff were very helpful and nice The neighbourhood is quiet and friendly There is a Holland Park and Hyde Park where you could have a morning walk and exercise nearby 
121882,The Nadler Kensington, Theres too much hallway and doors like a maze Wifi was choppy , They surprised us with hearts chocolates and and towels shaped like a swan on our bed Comfortable bed with fur 
121883,The Nadler Kensington, Nothing , Lovely boutique hotel set in a relatively quiet area off Earls Court High Street Great location within walking distance of the Tube Strange thing to say but the hotel was not only spotless but it actually smelled fresh and clean All of the staff were marvellous from front of house to the cleaners Many thanks in particular to Pauline in reception Great bed So glad we upgraded from small double to king size Great location for seeing the sites We don t get to London that often and have stayed in less than a dozen boutique style hotels but we would stay here next time and would recommend it 
121884,The Nadler Kensington, Breakfast could have been included, Location was truly excellent Rooms were very comfortable staff was welcoming and friendly Major attractions are at walking distance from the hotel 
121885,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Stay at The Nadler for 9 nights 3 adults Nice location less than 5 minutes from Earl s court station Easy access to central London and other attractions Great service and friendly staff Highly recommended 
121886,The Nadler Kensington, Nothing it was just what we wanted , Nice location loved the little kitchen behind the hidden doors was able to put my wine in fridge to chill instead of in the sink with cold water like most hotels 
121887,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, The location is perfect Short walking or tube distances to anywhere you would want to visit and explore in London So quick and easy to take public transportation from the airport The greatest surprise was the size of the room for 2 adults and 2 children it was enormous We could not have been more comfortable the beds were comfortable and the linens were fresh and inviting The bathroom was modern and spacious as well The kitchenette was a lovely surprise and very functional all in all a true 10 out of 10 I almost forgot the staff were friendly and helpful Shops bars and restaurants abound I would happily stay here again and highly recommended it to others A real gem 
121888,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Even though the rooms were compact the 12 foot ceilings gave them a feeling of spaciousness Heated towel bars GREAT shower Comfortable beds Very clean and great friendly helpful staff 
121889,The Nadler Kensington, The only disappointing aspect was having to leave so soon We will be back , Superb spacious bed but it was the accommodating staff that made the stay answering all our questions and suggesting places of interest 
121890,The Nadler Kensington, Room was too much small It was placed in the underground and it was very noisy both from the inner side because of a close slamming fire door and from the outer side because the window opened just below the entrance of the hotel ,No Positive
121891,The Nadler Kensington, Even being hyper critical I cannot think of anything I disliked , Comfortable room Very powerful shower Good location quiet residential street 5 minutes walk from Earls Court tube station 
121892,The Nadler Kensington, No place to hang dress without bunching the bottom Drawers for folded clothes were very limited , Staff were very friendly and helpful Water pressure in the shower wonderful Outlet at desk with mirror for hair dryer Nespresso machine microwave dishes fridge in tiny kitchenette in the room
121893,The Nadler Kensington, Rooms are very small and I didn t really have anywhere to put my suitcase, Great location close to shops to buy quick dinner and supplies Quiet spot but still close to the tube

121895,The Nadler Kensington, The single room was superbly small cramped The carpets could use deeper cleaning vacuuming The bath products were minimal , The location is very convenient The staff is very pleasant accommodating friendly The bathrooms rooms are clean 
121896,The Nadler Kensington, No European hotel room has much space but that is a minor concern , The staff was friendly and helpful The room a little small for 2 had excellent amenities kitchenette coffee maker and supplies fridge rubber mat for the shower on request Two blocks from the Earl s Court tube station 
121897,The Nadler Kensington, If there is a guest upstairs waking up early and moving around in his her room they may wake you up And unfortunately some rooms are really small , The staff is so helpful First they gave us a room reely really small with a small window it was like a ship cabin Before I visited this hotel with my children we were 3 and the room was really spacious for 3 people Then I asked the front desk if there was any possibility of moving into a more spacious room they helped with positive energy 
121898,The Nadler Kensington, The staff didn t offer to help me with the luggage I had multiple times and there two of them around when I arrived , Quiet street good sleep 
121899,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Clean quiet comfortable and well designed A good choice for London accommodation in this price range and actually much nicer than staying in a big four star hotel 
121900,The Nadler Kensington, Room very small Tube into central London is horrendously packed at rush hour , Good facilities Friendly staff Earls Court is a great neighbourhood to stay in 
121901,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Very convenient for the tube but located on a pretty quiet street so no noise at night Comfy bed good shower very clean and even my small double was spacious enough for my needs The kitchen in a cupboard is great As a solo traveller the hotel and also its location feel very safe and secure 
121902,The Nadler Kensington, The noise isolation from the corridor is not that great so we could hear the neighbour doors opening closing clearly in the morning , Equipped kitchen hidden in the cupboard Friendly staff Good wifi connection 
121903,The Nadler Kensington, not sure if we had been forgotten but I asked for our room to have some attention e g the windows to be locked wash liquid to be placed in the kitchenette and the air extraction in the bathroom to be looked at as it didn t seem to function It didn t seem that any requests were carried out we stayed a couple of nights this time Probably an omission but still I have given Nadler top marks in the past but this time was disappointed I had high expectations and have recommended this hotel to colleagues and friends Finally please use a different cleaning material when you come into reception its smells like Dettol weird , comfy beds nice linen cleanliness Everything always seems squeaky clean 
121904,The Nadler Kensington, The room was small, Clean Spacious bathroom Practical kitchenette Friendly staff Free WiFi Close to Museums Walking distance to Hyde park 2 minute walk to Earl s Court underground station
121905,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Friendly helpful staff clean quiet rooms close to transport We had a nice breakfast at the pub around the corner as recommended No parking but using JustPark found a spot under the Holiday Inn a couple of blocks away 
121906,The Nadler Kensington, Bathroom not great lacking hair dryer not a lot of lighting shower was leaking , Welcoming staff Location is great close to the underground station Room is cozy and comfy surprised by the hidden kitchenette in the cupboard 
121907,The Nadler Kensington, The bed was really hard no good for anyone with a bad back I didn t sleep much at all the first night and although I have rated other features favourably I would not stay again due to bed comfort I stayed at the Holiday inn at Manchester airport 3 weeks ago the comfort was amazing and slept really well which is important when you are away on business, Location Kitchenette free wifi
121908,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, very modern facilities and extremely large room possibly upgraded especially for central London Great location just round the corner from Earls Court underground station 
121909,The Nadler Kensington, A wee bit small for a family of 4 We had 3 big bags and 2 smaller ones Could not move around much Good that we were off very early in the morning and back late in the evening , Location was excellent Room was very clean Staff were friendly Thank you
121910,The Nadler Kensington, I woke up so early because I could hear the guest upstairs walking around in the room , The staff was so helpful thank you all The location was super comfortable 
121911,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, The staff was friendly professional and helpful It is clear it is very important at the Nadler Kensington that a high standard be maintained and it shows in everything they do 
121912,The Nadler Kensington, I liked everything good value for money , The king bed room was very comfortable despite being on the lower ground floor and not very large It was immaculate very well designed and clean Everything worked perfectly the bed was very comfortable shower excellent and even a little desk with enough power outlets at desk level to make connecting multiple devices very straightforward I highly recommend the hotel and I will be back
121913,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Great location max 300 m from the underground The staff is really friendly and helpful I can just recommend the hotel and will return next time when I am in London 
121914,The Nadler Kensington, Not so keen on the wet room type shower in the bathroom always soak everything but lovely huge bathroom , Fabulous Was upgraded to a superior room only problem was that I wasn t there long enough to make the most of it 
121915,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Having spent almost 24 hours traveling to London I was greeted with much warmth and enthusiasm from the concierge on duty always a plus when one is jet lagged The hotel while located close to the underground station is situated in a quieter area off main streets Each room is allocated its own Wifi login so that usage is not hampered by other residents I also appreciated the fact hotel residents are given a 10 discount at selected restaurants in the vicinity although the room has sufficient kitchen amenities to prepare small meals 
121916,The Nadler Kensington, No downside, Quiet location near tube great bed 135 cm which we found perfectly fine for two people great shower very clean nice staff Small Double Room perfect for luxury on a budget 
121917,The Nadler Kensington, No breakfast facilities but these are generally overrated in hotels and I m much happier going to one of the many local cafes , The best hotel I have found in the area Prices vary considerably from week to week but when the prices are good ie low it s a bargain Warm comfortable close to Earl s Court underground station good facilities all round 
121918,The Nadler Kensington, no common areas no personal touch from staff A bit cold and purpose built , good bed modern bathroom nicely decorated with new finishings well priced good location 
121919,The Nadler Kensington, Room was small ish for three people but was well designed and appointed , Great location very close to Earls Court Piccadilly and District lines Close to museums and parks Nice and quiet 
121920,The Nadler Kensington, I stayed at many hotels in 2016 and I never wrote a review before But because of the appalling stay I had at this hotel I decide to rate my experience which was HORRIBLE First the room was booked for someone else whose name were on the screen but they gave it to us for some reasons we didnt get Second the room we had was freezing and we couldn t increase the temp at night The wind was below through the window like AC Never had night like this before in all hotels we stayed in And what made it worst is the staff were so rude in the next morning when we asked them if we can get one night refund because we left the hotel second day even though we paid for two night Unbelievable experience so bad , Diddly Squats
121921,The Nadler Kensington, We received a room in the lower level we didn t open the curtains since there was a car parked directly in our window The rooms had 4 beds we were 3 people it was very difficult to move a very tiny table It was really not comfortable during the day and it was not a cheap hotel and our room was supposed to be luxurious The kitchenette was actually 2 cupboard doors not what I have expected , The staff was very nice and helpful good location
121922,The Nadler Kensington, I should have stayed longer There was nothing I didn t like , My only regret about staying at the Nadler was that we didn t stay long enough The Nadler lives up to its rating It is very clean and comfortable We stayed in a relatively large room and it was excellent The location is great and easy to find 
121923,The Nadler Kensington, Extremely small even by London standarda Couldn t even fully open up our suitcases , Location is great 3 min walk to underground Modern decor Stable wifi 
121924,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Amazing reception staff especially Maria very affable highly professional helped me to solve a complicated issue easily and with the highest client oriented approach 
121925,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, One of the best hotels I have ever stayed from perspective of hospitality the staff are very nice I enjoyed the stay thank you Nadler kinsengton hotel 
121926,The Nadler Kensington, The airconditioning made a the only disturbing sounds The mattresses in our room were wobbly without the supposed top pad and uncomfortable so my back ached badly Also the pillows are just okay but we had much better elsewhere I spend three uncomfortable nights The bathtub is tiny the water comes out burningly hot The furnishing a bit blunt The lighing in the room is not well balanced ceiling spots right above the bed are blinding No breakfast The safe inside the room is too small to fit a 13 laptop and the smallest I ever had So we had to leave our valuables at the front desk The price is on the higher end of comparable places we visited , The nearby tube station Earl s Court with it s elevator allows easy travel to Heathrow airport There are a lot of restaurants and stores within a walking distance The building and lobby are quiet elegantly furnished The staff is throughout very friendly and helpful It s exceptionally quiet we heard hardly any noise neither from the street nor the classical leaving guests door banging or houskeeping We found that remarkable The internet connection was satisfying for our needs though not all that fast No bothering led lights in the room Nice to have a little kitchenette Television size and quality are fine 
121927,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Spacious room with good layout well equipped very confortable beds and views of the gardens of neighbouring properties The hotel staff we encountered are hospitality naturals very welcoming smiling and accommodating Location close to Earl Court underground station is perfect 
121928,The Nadler Kensington, No restaurant However we did get a discount voucher to spend at Cafe du Coin or the Blackbird pub both with 5 minutes or so walk , The hotel was spotless and the room more than adequate The staff were very courteous and welcoming A second hand towel and bath towel were needed and these were provided immediately after we requested them Less than five minutes walk from Earl s Court station 
121929,The Nadler Kensington, I would like to be a little closer to the theater district but one cannot have everything , Having an espresso machine in the room is a real plus for me because I like espresso very early Also the staff was exceptionally efficient and caring Our room had a little terrace which we didn t have a chance to use 
121930,The Nadler Kensington, Nothing It would be nice if the bed is bigger for the budget room , There is no breakfast at the site The room has Nesoresso machine which I used every day It provides some basic kitchen appliances The room is on the small scale if u choose the basic suite The bathroom is in a good size though for London standard 
121931,The Nadler Kensington, Great location wonderful hotel very comfortable very easy to access clean rooms home feeling Thank you very much , the limited heat options in the room and no one to help me 
121932,The Nadler Kensington, Our room was in the basement right on a very noisy road traffic and people hardly slept at all Heating not working either in 2 of the 3 rooms we booked Also the location says South Kensington but it is NOT South Ken its Earls Court, The staff were excellent and moved us to a much quieter room for the next night
121933,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Good location easy access to most Central London sights 5 mins walk to Earl s Court Tube station Friendly and helpful staff and clean facilities Love the small kitchenette and fast internet connection 
121934,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Staff very helpful Hotel well positioned to 2 tube stations restaurants supermarkets Clean comfortable The kitchenette in the room was very useful The 24 hour front desk would be reassuring for the nervous traveller 
121935,The Nadler Kensington, Room Sizes are way too small even for a small room , I loved the staff outlook towards guests They were more than helpful Although they didn t have much knowledge about the events and stuff but they were prompt enough to check it online Also I liked the washrooms and the kitchenette Location is amazing and so easy to commute to Absolutely loved the area 
121936,The Nadler Kensington, Booked the small double room which is VERY small even in London standards I was fine there as a solo traveller but it s not recommended for a couple , Facilities were excellent In room kitchen and refrigerator were extremely helpful Good bed great shower very good wifi Central location close to both Earls Court and Gloucester Road stations 
121937,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Location is great for travellers heading to Heathrow by Piccadilly line Earls Court Station has an elevator and we didn t have to carry our heavy luggages up any stairs from the tube all the way to this hotel We will stay here again 
121938,The Nadler Kensington, The sound of shower was bit too noisy , This was my second stay in Nadler in this year It is always nice and welcoming with smiling staff Not too pretentious but modern and cozy very well balanced Will highly recommend to anybody who want to stay at the comfortable boutique hotel in the very convenient location 
121939,The Nadler Kensington, Although kitchenette was well set up we had to ask for dishwashing liquid and a towel and then discovered that there was no sink plug Our main issue was with the shower It started cold for about five minutes with good pressure and then decided to provide some heat at a lower pressure We did end up having a reasonable shower and so not a reason not to stay here , Secure hotel with very friendly staff and was very quiet at night Also excellent location for access to Earls Court station shops restaurants etc Kitchenette meant we could prepare our own basic breakfast cereal milk 5 pounds for a 3 night stay 
121940,The Nadler Kensington, I only have a small complaint about the bathroom I know the bathing facilities are designed for a long soak but if you just want a quick shower it s impossible to do this while keeping the floor dry because there s no shower curtain But overall this hotel was nearly perfect , I m so glad that we stayed here The staff were wonderful the room was so clean the wifi was reliable and the amenities were great We liked having the kitchenette if you re like us exploring supermarkets in a foreign country is always fun and having a microwave makes it possible to enjoy some of your gastronomic discoveries The location was also super convenient Considering the general caliber of hotels in London this one felt like a real gem 
121941,The Nadler Kensington, As I booked late I got a lower ground floor room would have preferred one higher up the building It was a nice room nonetheless , Staff were lovely and friendly Clean and comfortable room with good bathroom and shower Free WIFI and kitchenette were great to have 
121942,The Nadler Kensington, A bit disappointed with initial room which was on the lower ground floor and quite small Paid an extra 20 to upgrade Still fairly good value for money for the area , Good room Nice hotel Comfortable bed Really helpful friendly staff 
121943,The Nadler Kensington, not much really, the location is excellent and though the room is small it is very well appointed and ideal for a solo business traveller to this part of London
121944,The Nadler Kensington, The room was below ground floor so the view outside was very limited The beds for kids had a very thin matresses kids 40kg complained about the springs being felt Found only 1 EU power plug in the room the description implied more Toilet just didn t flush properly , The room deluxe was rather spacious it fit 2 large pieces of luggage 1 double bed and 2 single beds for kids rather comfortably No street sounds except for the occasional siren A short distance from Earl s Court underground station WiFi worked flawlessly 
121945,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Peaceful and quiet hotel in a nice neighbourhood We travelled with two kids age of 9 and 11 The hotel room was clean and we had enough space even with two extra beds The kitchen corner was useful We will definitely come back one day There was a good choice of restaurants and breakfast places near the hotel The location was perfect Very quick access to the airport 
121946,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Modern and stylish rooms with comfortable beds espresso machine rainforest shower head helpful staff discount at a fantastic pub restaurant easy walk to the Tube station 
121947,The Nadler Kensington, Having stayed at more than 50 different hotels in London I founds this one to be quite poor value for money The rooms are not just small they are tine I booked two different rooms during my stay While small double room was decent for its price the what was called a kind room was almost the same size with the bed occopying almost the whole room The room was so small that it does not it even have space to place your luggage I dound the explanations provided by the management by email to be misleading as the room clearly was not worth paying extra 100 pounds per night The bathroom was also quite small and the choice of amenities very limited There was also no water served which you normally get at the hotel priced at more than 200 per night , Location is good staff is friendly
121948,The Nadler Kensington, Only if it was free , Staff were excellent I stayed a few days to recover from jet lag before meeting up with a tour in Bath The staff made sure I got a quiet room was able to get into room early and got clear directions to close by shopping when I realized I was missing needed clothes I even returned for a couple of days until flight home when last hotel of tour was not acceptable Staff again helped with getting best available rate and delivering cold bottle of wine I highly recommend 
121949,The Nadler Kensington, Our room was at the basement and we had large luggages and a baby Had to go through several stairs up and down to reach the room Luckily the staffs was very helpful with the luggages , Love the bed and pillow We had a very good sleep Nespresso coffee was nice touch 
121950,The Nadler Kensington, Nothing it was perfect , I think the most friendly and accommodating staff I have ever come across I can t recommend this property highly enough 
121951,The Nadler Kensington, Would be great if there s breakfast served , Location is great Staffs are extremely friendly and helpful Loving the kitchenette Room was smaller than I have expected although I have booked a bigger room but it was a comfortable stay throughout Best choice around this area 
121952,The Nadler Kensington, We spent 5 nights there and had no complaints at all , This is an excellent hotel in a great location and very good staff The bedroom and bathroom were very well furnished and there was no noise from adjacent rooms or from outside a big plus No meals served but the kitchenette with fridge microwave sink and expresso coffee maker more than made up for this Only a 3 4 minute walk from Earl s Court Station 
121953,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Brilliant location loved the local area The Nadler is a lovely hotel The room was a lot smaller than expected but it was very clean The local pub The Blckbird is fantastic

121955,The Nadler Kensington, Rock hard pillows but it s a hotel what else can you expect , Staff were really welcoming nothing was too much trouble Room was very quiet considering how close we were to the Tube Shower was brilliant Handy having a kitchenette good way to keep costs down 
121956,The Nadler Kensington, Some of the other guests were a bit noisy late at night banging doors up down corridor could have been more considerate of other guests , Welcoming staff very helpful great location lovely room We had everything we needed Would definitely recommend 
121957,The Nadler Kensington, Our room was on the lower level so we didn t have too much sunlight But besides that it was great , Excellent staff and facilities on call 24 7 the location was very close to the Tube and a lot of great restaurants 
121958,The Nadler Kensington, Patio outside could have been cleaned of algae to give a more uplifting atmosphere to a downstairs room , Beds comfortable Pillows also good Homely feel although room was small Staff very pleasant and helpful thank you 
121959,The Nadler Kensington, The small double room is indeed small with am extra small double bed not ideal for more than a couple of days , Quiet but central location only 3 min from Earls Court tube The rooms were very clean stylish and functional though quite small 
121960,The Nadler Kensington, The kitchen area was not what we expected it read as if we could expect an open plan kitchen area It doesn t give a lot of scope and we couldn t even make toast We considered it to be no more than coffee and tea facilities , The fact that we could open the windows the comfy bed the cleanliness the bathroom facilities
121961,The Nadler Kensington, No kettle just microwave fridge is a normal minibar cooler that gets defrosted each time you remove room card No facilities for cooking a proper meal just cold breakfast , Location cleanliness entire staff very polite and ready to help

121964,The Nadler Kensington, Car service recommended by the hotel charged more than advertised Would have been helpful to know in advance that there was extra charge for delay at airport Knowing that arrival time for international flights will require extra time to check through customs Seems that car service arrival was designed to charge more I hope this is not normally the case , Staff was superb Very helpful Went above and beyond what I expected 
121965,The Nadler Kensington, Waiting 10 minutes to check in whilst the front desk try and book something for another guest which the guest could have done themselves is not great after a 10 hour day at work ,No Positive
121966,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Lovely quiet room Very comfortable bed Efficient air conditioning on a hot day No breakfast is provided although it can be ordered from an external partner for consumption in the room this is not a problem since there are lots of places around the hotel that do breakfast 
121967,The Nadler Kensington, The small fold down bed was very uncomfortable you could feel the springs through the mattress not great for the price of the room didn t match the high standard of the rest of the hotel , The Queen size bed was very comfy Very quiet hotel 2 minute walk from Earls Court Friendly helpful staff
121968,The Nadler Kensington, My sleeping top was by accident removed from our bedroom by the cleaning staff together with the linen The manager took trouble to get it back without success Instead of just apologising and suggest a way forward he implied that they were not at fault that his staff is reliable and that I may have made a mistake in that my sleeping top was not removed from my room His treatment of the matter was disappointing and I will never go back to this hotel ,No Positive
121969,The Nadler Kensington, My partner stayed this evening as a single occupancy guest so I am writing this from his comments the 1st room had no windows at all no phone reception at all and was rather grim design over substance so to speak They then moved him to another room which was still basement but had one bar of signal He decided to stay in this room as it was late evening but thought to himself I won t stay here again We normally stay in the Ampersand down the road which is about 40 more per room and it s a huge difference in quality service and facilities Shame it was full , The decor style was simple and business like Location was good for my business reasons 
121970,The Nadler Kensington, This is not the hotel but booking com I had paid in advance because I was obliged to be in London but that obligation was over ridden and there was no way to allow someone else to have my room on the second night even though the hotel was sold out , Absolutely fantastic quiet friendly great location for the city the airport 
121971,The Nadler Kensington, Very small and uncomfortable room steps noise from ceiling On Friday morning July 1st there was no water in the shower , Location friendly staff
121972,The Nadler Kensington, Nothing , Good location near museums yet in relatively quiet street Staff were very friendly Decor bright new and modern Room not large but very well equipped 
121973,The Nadler Kensington, Rooms were tiny We were given a room in the back ground floor of the Hotel and told it was an upgrade It had one open room for the bathroom which was for customers with disabilities We had paid for a King bed and this room only had a double After complaining we were given the room we had originally booked Very disappointed in our experience and we paid well over 300 pounds for our room Not good value for money at all ,No Positive
121974,The Nadler Kensington, That I could only stay one night , Fabulous staff who go out of their way to anticipate or fulfil needs of guests Really great location The rooms are beautifully designed and furnished with exceptional standards of housekeeping
121975,The Nadler Kensington, Bath too small a 1 2 bath double shower would be more practical Nespresso machine v difficult to use on day 2, Comfy bed proper nespresso machine
121976,The Nadler Kensington, Nothing really I couldn t fault this property for the price we paid , Great location close to Earls Court tube station Location is in a quiet residential area Our room was very small but that s what we paid for For stays more than a night or two I d suggest spending a little extra for a bigger room Wifi was excellent Small kitchenette with microwave sink and tea coffee making facilities was a good feature Numerous eating choices and supermarkets close by so the fact no breakfast is available at this hotel was not a problem I would definitely recommend this hotel 
121977,The Nadler Kensington, Rooms are snug Not unusual for London of course but be prepared , The Nadler is well kept very clean The hotel appears to be new or recently remodeled Quick walk to the Underground station and several coffee shops pubs etc Staff is very helpful always friendly

121981,The Nadler Kensington, The room was tiny I could nearly touch both walls at the same time as the bedroom was 2m X 3 5 M ish The wardrobe was really tiny and the double bed was pushed up against one wall This was room 105 If you are intending to swing your metaphorical cat look elsewhere There was also no bar nor restaurant , Staff helpfulness location and cleanliness can t be faulted All superb It is 2 minutes walk from Earl s Court tube and about ten mins from West Brompton The room had a microwave and a sink in it if you wanted to attempt some self catering The bathroom was nicely appointed too but not huge

121984,The Nadler Kensington, I booked a double bed on bookings com but what I got was a more of a single so very uncomfortable for 2 people Also the room we had was lower ground and the outside noise was coming in like as if we had that window open when in reality the window was shut , The location was brilliant just minutes away from the earls Court underground station
121985,The Nadler Kensington, Room was quite small but I guess that s typical for London The main problem was that our key cards did not work and had to be changed out several times Even then we could only get them to work 3 out of 4 times on average , Staff were very friendly and accommodating

122005,The Nadler Kensington, Though the hotel is great in all aspects and I will certainly stay there again there was a small downside the shower During the rush hour around 8 a m when all the hotel guests seem to be taking shower at once the hot water pressure is not high enough and one may experience an unexpected contrast shower with blasts of cold water However if you take your shower earlier or in the evening there is no such problem , Wonderful location just a 3 minute walk from Earl s Court tube station A couple of supermarkets within walking distance There s a fridge a microwave oven and tea coffee making facilities in the room which is very convenient if you prefer eating in The staff is friendly and cheerful The window in the room can be opened if you like fresh air or securely closed if you don t

122013,The Nadler Kensington, Breakfast weren t included, The staff were fab very helpful and friendly The room was well equipped and very clean My only issue is the cost of it per night and that breakfast was extra

122016,The Nadler Kensington, Heating via air conditioning simply has not been efficient enough to warm up our room in winter All night fan noise but still too chilly , Stefania Santoro and her team made this visit to a really remarkable one simply great Atmosphere and location is absolutely great
122017,The Nadler Kensington, Expensive hotel considering the fact that there s not even a breakfast room the location isn t central despite good there s no heat in the bathroom which was pretty cold during our stay linens and bed are okay only , Staff is kind and very helpful They are the readon why I would stay there again 
122018,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, The staff are naturally friendly and helpful treat you like an individual rather than one of a number especially the young gentleman on reception Whilst it is not difficult to find your bedroom they always show you to your room which immediately makes you felt looked after and ensures you have no hassle in locating the correct room They also pointed me in the direction of a few restaurants with a 10 discount card from the hotel This is the second time I ve stayed at a Nadler hotel and equally as outstanding as the first stay 
122019,The Nadler Kensington, The hotel doesn t have any eating amenities but is very close to places where you can easily buy food and they give you a discount card for several nearby restaurants as well which is great , Lovely staff and really nicely finished rooms in a good location

122029,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, The location is excellent Just a short walk away from the tube lots of eateries within walking distance as well The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were very ample and modern I loved the magnifying mirror and all the extras in the wet bar There was always wifi available at no charge throughout the property The best part of all however was the staff So warm and accommodating Truly treated us like family 
122030,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Staff were lovely and helpful room was clean bedding comfortable many outlets for charging phones iPads etc even had USB ports Hotel is modern and chic a block from the metro and easy to get to everything Felt safe in the neighborhood We had breakfast at a small spot near the metro Hotel has arrangements w restaurants for a discount GREAT place in London 
122031,The Nadler Kensington, On the downside the rooms are petite and it was hard to find enough space for our luggage For stays of longer then a few nights this would have been a real issue for us especially as there are few good restaurants close by , The staff are very friendly and helpful and the hotel is situated in a good convenient location The addition of a minion kitchen is a neat idea and allowed us to relax late at night rather than go out to find food 
122032,The Nadler Kensington, For two mornings the shower didn t work and at one of the evenings that happened too But again the front desk was quick to react and offered us another room just for us to shower On their own accord they presented us with a hamper that included daily necessities wine etc and a handwritten card as a form of apology and compensation Truly remarkable service , The location was less than 3 mins walk from the Earl s Court station and just a short distance away is the Sainsbury Local supermarket Front desk service was really good and Evelia one of the receptionist was very patient and helpful

122038,The Nadler Kensington, The bed was a little small short for our liking , Very friendly welcome from the helpful and informative reception team Excellent service throughout our stay in this well located and beautifully presented hotel 
122039,The Nadler Kensington, Hotel does not have bar restaurant You enter and go to your room , The packed continental breakfast served into the room the extreme kindness of the personnel the kitchenette in the room We had a very quiet room on the back facing the gardens 
122040,The Nadler Kensington, Nothing at all, The best small hotel in London Great location in a quiet mainly residential area of Kensington but near to a mix of bars restaurants and cafes to suit all tastes and close to 2 underground stations as well This hotel is a new concept that absolutely works primarily because the staff are excellent and totally committed to making it work The idea is that as you are in London you will get out and experience all that the capital has to offer and the staff are amazing in making this happen
122041,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, I stayed at the hotel over the weekend and would like to comment on the excellent service rendered by the hotel especially the front desk staff David He was very friendly and helpful The room itself is a bit on the smaller side but it is well equipped with a small kitchenette with a microwave sink and utensils 
122042,The Nadler Kensington, London has many places offering better value for money Bed shower at the Nadler are ok but for the rest room no 112 was nothing special little daylight no view bit crammed no art no pleasant surprises Hotel is very close to underground 5 min walk but the area itself is quite dull and offers hardly any well rated restaurants and or bars , Friendly reception decent bed and shower 
122043,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, Everything about the Nadler reminds its guests of a more gracious bygone age closer to Downton Abbey than a noisy crowded modern hotel Our room was small but very comfortable Its design made excellent use of the available space and its amenities were terrific a lovely shower and a fully stocked little dinette for example Besides being an elegant old world establishment the Nadler boasts a wonderful staff of young energetic concierges who cannot do enough for their guests My husband and I really enjoyed our stay in London and the Nadler was a large part of that memorable experience 
122044,The Nadler Kensington, Room was a little small and the view out of the window was to an uninspiring internal court yard This let very little natural light into the room , Staff were really nice Room was clean and well equipped Ideal base to travel around then sites of London with plenty of options for eating around 
122045,The Nadler Kensington, The hotel was very very warm all the time Though there was AC in the rooms so they could be cooled Room was on the small side , The location was great as were the facilities and the staff 
122046,The Nadler Kensington, The room was the smallest I ve ever been into the bed was so small I could touch the wall with my feet Very disappointed very bad value for money, The staff was really friendly and helpful
122047,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, The staff was knowledgable and friendly and helped us plan our daily excursions around London The hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood yet has easy access to the Tube We would definitely stay here again 
122048,The Nadler Kensington, Location of the room was horrible In the basement suite level minus 1 with a nice view of a pile of garbage Extremely disappointing given the price of the room , Good proximity to Earl s Court metro 
122049,The Nadler Kensington, Small double was VERY small Worked ok for two children but even then crowded Front desk were helpful and ordered a taxi for us However it took a strange route was very expensive and did not take a credit card The journey back in a London cab was a third of the price , Rooms were quiet and clean A critical factor 
122050,The Nadler Kensington,No Negative, The staff is really friendly and welcoming I would like to especially thank the receptionist with glasses sorry I can t recall the name for giving us a warm welcoming tour The pillow and the WiFi is amazing 
122051,The Nadler Kensington, Teensy tiny cramped room Touted as a double maybe for an adult with a small teddy bear One chair one tiny closet No place for even one suitcase much less two and all we had were rollaboards Bed sideways against wall so inside person has to climb over outside person Calling it a double is criminal No breakfast on premises or within a few blocks, Great location quiet side street a few minutes walk to earls court underground station Easy walk to museums 
122052,The Nadler Kensington, The wi fi was not so great A lot of my applications that I needed Whatsapp Maps etc were not working due to the slow bad internet connection , Super clean and had everything you needed Loved the mini kitchenette 
122053,The Nadler Kensington, My friend who stayed in a separate room had a problem regarding charging of her room to her credit card In the process of being reimbursed she lost money on the exchange rate It took 2 phone calls and some time before she was reimbursed for her loss , friendly helpful staff Always responsive to questions and quick to offer suggestions Helpful with directions 
122054,The Nadler Kensington, There is no restaurant at the hotel and although continental breakfast can be ordered on request the choice is very limited No hot breakfast , The staff was helpful The room was quiet and clean 
122055,The Nadler Kensington, On arrival staff seemed short handed and didn t follow up with a request Also we had a small room We agreed to this upon signing up It would have been perfectly adequate for a single traveler but was really too tight for two , Staff were friendly and helpful Very clean reception room and rooms Great kitchenette 
122056,The Nadler Kensington, Bed felt as though it was a 3 4 bed than a full double Also didn t like it up against the wall Meant one person had to disturb the other if they needed to get up over night , Very well designed and facilities where excellent 
122057,The Nadler Kensington, The bed was probably the most uncomfortable we have ever slept in , We liked the location the very helpful staff and the small kitchenette in the room 
122058,The Nadler Kensington, This is not a complaint just an observation I placed our used towels on the rail however housing keeping replaced them with beautiful fresh ones everyday we were there 8 nights That was great and quite unexpected thank you however from an environmentally energy saving prospective it runs the costs up for the Hotel and is not environmentally friendly in using precious water and power energy when it was probably unnecessary the heater rails dried the towels throughout the day We would have put them on the floor when we needed clean ones which seems to be the universal practice , Cheerful overly attentive staff nothing too much trouble attitude Cleanliness fresh modern appearance location great quiet and a pleasure to return after a lengthy day sightseeing and enjoying beautiful London I would not stay anywhere else I am telling my friends and family that they would find it hard to find anywhere better ideal in every way Staff all need a pay rise Thank you Nadler we will be back 
122059,The Nadler Kensington, The room is a bit small for 4 people and there s only 1 toilet bathroom NO breakfast , Everything in the room is new and clean The receptionist Evelia Hernandez was very nice and helpful 
122060,The Nadler Kensington, The room L12 was a bit small It was difficult to leave our 2 suitcases out to easily access our clothes etc The room was a little dark and no fresh air But overall it was a nice stay, The location was very close to Earls Court tube station with many caf s and pubs near by The staff were very accommodating and helpful
