463406,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, As always the staff were super Friendly welcoming and helped out re extra things I needed All with a smile Fabulously comfy bed and great air con it was a muggy night Highly recommend when I can afford it 
463407,The May Fair Hotel, The comfort in the room , We booked a room and we received another one a duplex with a bedroom upstairs without bathroom without space for luggage Hopefully we stay just one night I ll never come back 
463408,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, As always the staff were fabulous I had a rather last minute stay and so had to use their overnight laundry services They went out of their way to ensure I had everything I needed It s a great place to stay if you re travelling on business and if you re a lone female It all feels safe and secure 
463409,The May Fair Hotel, Would have liked some movie channels on the TV or ability to rent movies or watch Netflix , Location was excellent room was gorgeous bathroom was AMAZING staff was extremely helpful and friendly breakfast buffet was DIVINE Room service was great too It s hard to find a bad thing to say about this hotel It s one of the reasons our visit to London will go down as one of the best vacations of all time 
463410,The May Fair Hotel, Deadly for persons not so young e g 45 much worse for elderly bathtub shower entrance departure use single uselessly installed placed grab bar very slippery tub high unwieldy tub sides ,No Positive
463411,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, We were welcomed before we stepped into the doors the doorman added an extra touch We were warmly greeted at the Reception Desk and were made to feel like we were the only guests staying there The room was perfect not too hot not too cold the bed was heavenly the bathroom was spotless and had everything we needed and more The free Wi Fi was an added bonus In a nutshell we are going to be staying there anytime we go to London and recommend the May Fair to anyone looking to pamper themselves 
463412,The May Fair Hotel, Don t really like the new tall tables in the small bar area it s lost its cosy feeling, The location is brilliant very comfortable room staff very helpful sainsbury across the road for essentials walk to most places
463413,The May Fair Hotel, Nothing really there could have been more hooks I the bathroom but it s a minor thing , We booked a family room with two double beds and the room was much larger than I would have expected my daughter was literally able to do cartwheels in it Everything was very clean and the beds super comfortable It s only a hundred metres or so from the tube station Piccadilly line so a direct train from the airport The staff were super friendly and the breakfast was fantastic 
463414,The May Fair Hotel, Nothing was what I was expecting Rooms very small boring design staff kept changing their statements of what they said and what they did not say I arrived after long travel at about 10pm I went to the room It was like a prison cage When I asked to change my room they asked me to wait in the room and they will call me back No one called for more than 10 minutes I tried to call reception was not picking up I had to go down to the reception around 10 20pm They said nothing was available so I had to upgrade The lady at the reception told me the smaller Suite sells for more than 800 pounds per night I said this is more than my budget She asked how much is your budget I said 550 pounds She made a few calls and said she found me something I had to sign a paper and I am all set Tired and late at nigh I put the pen on paper and went to the room The room was really really horrible A small living area with stairs going up to a tiny place the could hardly hold the bed I thought I was in one of those fairy tale dreams in a bad way of course After three nights what I was checking out they present me with a huge invoice at the reception I asked what is this They said this is the 375 pounds that I had already paid at the time of booking online plus the 550 pounds upgrade It really blew my mind I said the lady clearly said the room sells for 800 per night And she will lower it for me to 550 How come it became suddenly 925 375 550 Doing all the math they could not explain the situation Finally I was confronted with a paper that I had signed late at night trusting their words that it was the upgrade price not total price I repeatedly asked how will do the math saying the room was selling for 800 and now you want me to pay 925 No explanation After making a lot of fuss one of the staff told me we can waive one night upgrade price Very unprofessional worst rooms and bad location , Nothing but the Concierge boys It was one of the worst travel experience I have ever had And I do travel quite often 
463415,The May Fair Hotel, view from the window horrible to the next wall roof and pipes small windows with ugly little blinds no curtains very small dark basic room not the one on the photo very crowded at breakfast, Great breakfast good location
463416,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is amazing In a very good location only a 3 minute walk to the nearest underground The staff were always so happy and very pleasant The rooms were always cleaned Even if we came back in the afternoon and sat on the bed they would come and clean your room again after you went out I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone 
463417,The May Fair Hotel, The view was towards an outside stairwell and air conditioning equipment The room wasn t as sumptuous as in the pictures more like an average hotel room Shower door leaked onto the floor Breakfast room was chaotic on one morning On the bill I was a Mr a sudden gender change The check out girl didn t say goodbye after I had said the room hadn t been that great The staff should brush up on their English and customer service skills Not a five star hotel Overpriced , The room was of a good size and the location was pretty good 
463418,The May Fair Hotel, As above awful I stay in hotel every week and have done for 25 years This was the worst by a distance, It was a dreadful experience from check in to check out The room was a disgrace more like a cell 
463419,The May Fair Hotel, The blinds in our room didn t block out the 5am sunrise and there wasn t a mirror plug located near one another for my hair straighteners , Excellent location right in the centre of London Walking distance to shops restaurants and attractions Staff were friendly and courteous and the breakfast was fantastic with a wide variety of choice 
463420,The May Fair Hotel, Bar used to be so busy but was lacking any kind of atmosphere although the drinks were good It was more like a luxury budget hotel than a luxury hotel I usually stay at the Bvlgari which to me is absolute luxury but wanted to give the Mayfair a chance Only one towel in the bathroom upon arrival It always intrigues me when the minibar is one that immediately charges you if you move any of the drinks it makes me wonder what type of people stay here for them to install such a minibar , Breakfast was the best thing about this hotel All staff were friendly 
463421,The May Fair Hotel, upon check in i presented the team with a 100 voucher birthday gift which was to be taken off our final bill unfortunately no one knew how to do this on our arrival so said it would be amended by check out the next morning Next morning the manager says he can t do a refund there and then not was they said the evening before and that the refund would be given by the end of the day and i would receive an email its now over a day later and I m still waiting for both my refund and email poor poor service,No Positive
463422,The May Fair Hotel, Normal room and bad view oily water comes from the bath painting the walls of our floor while we are in the hotel expensive mini bar , Location and clean
463423,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, Enjoyed our stay at this hotel arrived early and were able to check in this being 11am which was great staff at reception were very helpful and welcoming Room was nice and clean and bed was really comfortable only thing I would say about the room the carpet was a little dated Couldn t of asked for a better location bang in the middle of Mayfair itself local to trains and bus services lots of lovely shops in the surrounding area and only 10 mins walk to regent street and oxford street Only thing i was disappointed with in the hotel was that the breakfast was too expensive 35 literally 2 mins walk away there was a fab place fo eat called Henrys cafe bar which cooked the best breakfast full English for 10 including tea or coffee so definitely worth eating of a morning in there There is lots of lovely restaurants in the surrounding area we ate at Hakasan Mayfair also Mr fogs residence for afternoon tea Back to the Mayfair Hotel I would most certainly stay there again in the future 
463424,The May Fair Hotel, Everything was perfect , The location is convenient and close to Bond Street Regents Street Piccadilly Circus The studio suite is very spacious 
463425,The May Fair Hotel, Not much the decor in the room maybe a little tired and confused , The location was excellent as we were meeting friends in Mayfair The room was very good and so was the breakfast The bed was extremely comfortable 
463426,The May Fair Hotel, The duplex suite I ordered was very dimly lit The corridor outside our bedroom was extremely noisey The airconditioning machine had a noisey squeak which made it hard to sleep The atmosphere in the bar felt hostile , Huge hot shower in the duplex suite friendly front desk staff 
463427,The May Fair Hotel, I d like softer pillows like feder cosy pillow The bar closed at 23 0 a bit early for me , Location is great the bar is very nice Clean and nice 
463428,The May Fair Hotel, The dirty room and dirty bathroom even had the last persons dirty razor left in shower bed was very rickety and the balcony very unsafe to the fact you have to sign a disclosure to go out there very dirty and nothing executive about our room , Views
463429,The May Fair Hotel, The view wasn t great and had to close blinds so that rooms adjacent couldn t see in , The room was spacious and cot placed in before arrival Coffee in room was lovely Nice modern rooms Comfy bed and pillows Bathroom very spacious with lots of storage space for clothing Myself partner and 4 month old baby slept brilliantly 
463430,The May Fair Hotel, I booked the hotel for our anniversary specifically because we enjoyed the roof terrace previously but on the day we booked for it was closed for a private function and there was no notification of this until we went to go upstairs to it ,No Positive
463431,The May Fair Hotel, The room was terrible I was moved but the room really was not 5 really needed updating not what I expected Won t stay again until rooms are upgraded Bar restaurant and reception lovely but the delux rooms more like 3 , The bar and the reception manager was fab when I complained about the room
463432,The May Fair Hotel, There was only one large mirror with a plug nearby for hair It meant sitting on the floor to do my hair would have expected a table and chair with a mirror , Location was good we ordered drinks from room service they were very prompt Very clean 
463433,The May Fair Hotel, no thing, i have sent this to the hotel as well Dear Sir Madam i was staying at your reputable hotel for 8 nights in room number 664 first of all allow me to extent my appreciation for the great service you provided me while i was staying at your lovely hotel the hotel was amazing the outlets staff was very polite and smiling all the time i never felt as stranger while i was in the hotel i want to thank every one at the reception and the concierge team Security team Sir and Madam you have got the best security team i guarantee that to you this guys were so professionals and so friendly well done and thanks to them so much Sidi Mohamed thank you very much for making my days better in the Hotel and in whole London you were better than Google for me and for every single guest they were looking for help you are the man every guest wishes other hotels to have copy of you but i know it s impossible because you are only one and because of The May Fair hotel is one of the best hotels so they hire the best staff to work for them and you are one of the best i hope to find you in every hotel i deal with it special thanks to you please send my regards to the staff and thanks to the management team Negm Nasr was in room no 664
463434,The May Fair Hotel, The bed was very old and uncomfortable my wife slept on the couch on our anniversary There were no entertainment options available in the room just local tv I can watch that at home For what you pay to stay here you expect this to be a luxury stay but it was barely average Such an expensive waste of money I m so disappointed , Food room service was good 
463435,The May Fair Hotel, There wasn t anything that we disliked , Staff extremely professional friendly Went out of their way placed cakes in our room for my Mothers birthday Great touch 
463436,The May Fair Hotel, When we checked in we were given a dirty room which for a hotel as premium as this is very poor indeed We then had to wait for a room to be ready , Very comfortable bed and a great location
463437,The May Fair Hotel, Nothing really , Everything Location is fantastic excellent restaurants around the hotel friendly staff very confortable room cool and relaxed atmosphere 
463438,The May Fair Hotel, Just a bath we were only there one night so hard to judge as didn t use many of the facilities, Breakfast room was bright and sunny buffet food very nice all good Our room was upgraded and it was perfectly adequate but personally I prefer a bath to a shower 
463439,The May Fair Hotel, No shelves near the showers for toiletries or towels so have to walk across when you get out of the shower to get a towel My room was directly opposite an office so had to keep my blinds down most of the time for privacy, Breakfast was really good
463440,The May Fair Hotel, no food was available at 10 30pm when I arrived after a long journey save for room service But when I tried to order from room service there was some rubbish excuse about only salad and pizza available Not what I would expect from a Radisson , good size room and comfortable bed Perfect location for my meeting
463441,The May Fair Hotel, Nothing, We liked everything about the Mayfair Hotel The staff were very friendly and helpful It is a bright and modern hotel We got an upgrade to a suite and it was fabulous The breakfast was very good plenty of choice Mayfair area is very smart with lots of upmarket shops I would recommend this hotel and would love to visit again 
463442,The May Fair Hotel, The room had no view and too small window v high So it was dark I felt bad about that I don t like to turn on the light day time , It is an elegant location and nice
463443,The May Fair Hotel, Can not say all good , Lovely room we had junior suite very friendly reception and great door man x great champagne service with strawberries as it was my partners 50th great touch 
463444,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, The breakfast buffet was excellent And the service and friendliness of staff I liked the healthy breakfast option ie Bircher Muesli and green juices 
463445,The May Fair Hotel, The pics on line are deceiving Rooms are basic although iron board umbrella are all provided in the room Reception area out weighs the standard of the actual rooms , The bed was extra comfy upgraded to superking room as the first room was small and shabby And cleanliness was not up to scratch location good plenty night life staff were better than the hotel and very attentive Would use again
463446,The May Fair Hotel, Room was very small We travelled with a group of friends and had all booked the same room at the same time however on arrival they greatly varied in size and facilities despite all paying the same amount , staff were super friendly and helpful 
463447,The May Fair Hotel, The furniture in the rooms were a bit to old fashion Room was dull and the entire bathroom get flooded when having a shower , The bed was indeed like a cloud The location in ideal especially for dinning shopping taxi underground night life etc Execllent staff and customer service When I complained about the distance from my assigned room to the lift I was immediately reassigned and upgraded to a higher idealroom closer to the lift 
463448,The May Fair Hotel, The room was quite basic and lacked finesse such as no trim between the carpet in the room and bathroom tiles with a bit of a gap present and generally just did not feel as luxurious as you would expect I have stayed in many hotels around the capital and abroad and have never had to pay extra to use the spa and fitness facilities which you would expect included in the room rate The amount of money is negligible but you end up feeling like your on a budget flight to Kavos rather than in a luxury central London hotel Disclaimer I have never been on a budget flight to Kavos , Reception area was nice as was the bar for a few drinks in the evening 
463449,The May Fair Hotel, I felt the the decor in the room was tired and a bit shabby The shower leaked and was poorly designed Not what I expected from a Mayfair hotel I was disappointed ,No Positive
463450,The May Fair Hotel, Rooms were poor small beds sparsely furnished cold unwelcoming not great shower expected much more neither modern or old fashioned just didn t like them Spa again the look of it and facilities were disappointing , Location and staff and spa treatments were excellent
463451,The May Fair Hotel, The only fault was not that of the hotel A previous guest had smoked in the room and the smell was present after it had been cleaned and aired The hotel sent a member of staff to re air the room as requested , The room was spacious with the biggest bathroom The bed was so comfy the best nights sleep in a hotel 
463452,The May Fair Hotel, Access to spa wasn t included in price steam room etc had to pay an extra 15 each, Upgraded to a junior suite very spacious and comfortable wish someone had told us about evening housekeeping the maid let herself in while I was standing there in my pants Very fast room service 
463453,The May Fair Hotel, Rooms where tiny and looked dirty because of old carpeting One family room was smaller than a regular room Loud night clubish atmosphere in the hotel together with very poor materials in walls and doors equals absolutely NO sleep One family room bathroom was so tiny and strangely laid out nobody in the family can pass if you are at the single sink area Strange to have such a TINY bathroom for a family room Had to switch The next family room was a tad bigger and had a spacious bathroom where 3 4 people could brush teeth or makeup at the same time Concierge was non responsive before arrival when I tried to book and plan And totally un informative as to the fact that the first restaurant he booked would not serve us dinner if we came 10 minutes late fault of taxi and could happen anybody at anytime So no dinner , Amazing breakfast lots of great items in buff and on meny All included in room price great location for those who party or shop 
463454,The May Fair Hotel, Breakfast was a bit confusing no one came to ask if we wanted hot drinks or explained what we had to do we felt a bit embarrassed and just got up in the end and helped ourselves , Pillows were amazing and quiet room which was great
463455,The May Fair Hotel, Bathroom was very basic not 5 star standard Also the room was very basic I d describe it as something you d rent by the hour not a superior room at all hugely disappointed Mayfair hotel you have some work to do , Bed was comfy
463456,The May Fair Hotel, Price of drinks at the bar One stroppy waitress because I wanted a different table at breakfast but the lady who actually looked after us more than made up for it She was extremely helpful and couldn t do enough even changed cold tea and toast for fresh without us asking , Just perfect From the minute you walk in beautiful smells super stylish really comfy beds wonderful bath and salts most amazing breakfast I ve ever had Make sure you go for inclusive 
463457,The May Fair Hotel, I thought our room was very basic for the price There wasn t a dressing table and if you wanted to get something from the wardrobe it would block the tv if you were watching that at the same time Bad design You could hear people walking up and down the corridor outside Marks on carpet , Thought reception area was nice and breakfast room 
463458,The May Fair Hotel, Difficulty finding a place to relax in the public areas not enough lounges for such a busy place , Wanted an outlook that gave a special London City Feel heritage buildings etc customer services found the perfect room Luxurious and spacious rooms 
463459,The May Fair Hotel, Breakfast staff didnt seem to have a clue what was going on and had to order breakfast twice I felt this stay in this hotel was not a five star experience Long walk to an upgraded room at a cost and felt it was not worth the extra 50 per night that i paid I have stayed at the Radison Blue in Manachester and that was a five star experience I just do not think our two night stay room only was worth 635 00 it was five star cost but not 5 star quality The view from the small window in the room was just over looking over rooms , I liked the comfort of the room I liked the front of house staff very friendly and helpful I liked the location
463460,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, The whole experience was great Although an upmarket hotel you were still made to feel normal and not out of place For us this was a treat for our Anniversary When we booked in we were told that we d been upgraded and when we got to the room there was a bottle of champagne strawberries and chocolate on the table It really made our day The room was big enough comfortable light and airy The bathroom dressing room took our breath away It was huge with his and her sinks a bath with a tv on it which I took full advantage of and plenty of hanging space and drawers for your items The staff at reception were very polite and took their time to explain everything Breakfast options were fab You could choose from a hot menu and also anything at the buffet stations For the money and quality it is worth it The location is great aswell as you are in walking distance of most attractions and shops and also the tube station 
463461,The May Fair Hotel, Security staff on door at night were rude intimidating and just not very nice people We felt slightly threatened when I immediately didn t show my room key Just so unnecessary , Perfect location for shopping and eating out 
463462,The May Fair Hotel, Was not happy with the breakfast the cook breakfast was cold and the both of was really looking forward to it it all look really lovely but was so disappointed considering we paid extra for it,No Positive
463463,The May Fair Hotel, Front of hotel was stunning Shame bedrooms did not live up to the same standerd I was apparently upgraded hate to think how bad my room was then to be honest I think I was paying for location rather than a gorgeous hotel , Carpets in bedroom where old And bed frame was not great either 
463464,The May Fair Hotel, The room I had been given originally was not ready the room was still being cleaned on my entry However this was resolved swiftly by efficient staff a free upgraded room and complementary drinks for 2 at the Mayfair bar given for the inconvenience , The bed and the pillows were very comfortable breakfast fantastic 
463465,The May Fair Hotel, Rooms look out over internal building quadrangle where air conditioning units are installed can hear their constant buzz , Breakfast Plenty of choice hot breakfast cooked to order lovely fresh fruit a really good start to the day Lovely room large for London very clean and comfortable 
463466,The May Fair Hotel, You listed our room as a room with a view with a choice of king or twin beds On arrival we were told that none of the hotel s twin bedded rooms had a view so your description was misleading However the room itself was very comfortable and we we re very comfortable , Locatio style staff food bathtub with tv Wonderful weekend in Lindon
463467,The May Fair Hotel, I could not fault the hotel , The staff in this hotel could not do anymore for you no request was too big They were very helpful and friendly The room was lovely very spacious The bed quilt and pillows were like a dream to sleep in I would love to return to this hotel and I will be recommending it to friends and family 
463468,The May Fair Hotel, Although everything looked perfectly clean the bed did not smell clean could have been the pillows Unfortunately we picked a particularly busy time to go down for breakfast and were shown to a low small table in the window which we found quite uncomfortable , We were generally happy
463469,The May Fair Hotel, At times the elevators would be really slow And the elevator would not let us go to our floor but all teh others we would have to go to the floor above and then go down the stairs , The Hotel is in a prefect location and is wonderfully staffed 
463470,The May Fair Hotel, There was a wet patch in the middle of room that smelt The cooked breakfast was greasy and lacked flavour, The bed was a nice size and the burger I ordered from room service was the best I have ever eaten 
463471,The May Fair Hotel, the view from the bedroom 523 was a dirty white brick wall the dining table in room wobbled there was a rust mark on the wall in the shower the telly changed channels on its own the room was an awkward shape so negotiating the end of the bed in the night resulted in knocked ankles, bed was comfortable and the food was superb
463472,The May Fair Hotel, On 2nd floor with lots of windows and no blinds and therefore had to keep Roman shades down for privacy which was a shame , Location staff very helpful
463473,The May Fair Hotel, The room could have been better, Breakfast was great shame about the room Bed was broken and baby cot looked like it had cigarette burns in it quite disappointed for the price 
463474,The May Fair Hotel, Staff were slow at check in was given the wrong room and then had to wait for 30 minutes for them to correct the error No tea or coffee in the room Limited hot food breakfast and did not have choice of unsmoked food , The room and bathroom was lovely and the breakfast had a lot of cold option choice 
463475,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, The staff where excellent We had traveled 25 hours by plane and arrived very early in the morning Our booked room was still occupied however they gave us a room to use as a base for the morning to freshen up etc no charge Very much appreciated Location is excellent and easy to locate Would definitely stay there again 
463476,The May Fair Hotel, Slightly higher cost from another nearby property very slow lifts walked the stairs to the eighth floor on more than one occasion Very poor service first night in bar restaurant , Location Clean rooms and common areas In most instances helpful staff but exceptions Some poor service in bar caf A few issues free breakfast billing mistakes but these were addressed professionally 
463477,The May Fair Hotel, The windows should be of the reflecting type as if you in the lower levels surrounding office building can see through your room, The atmosphere of the room and the lights distributed nicely
463478,The May Fair Hotel, Breakfast was poor and very rushed we mentioned this to the waiter and he replied it s very busy on a weekend We also made reception aware and they didn t even apologise ,No Positive
463479,The May Fair Hotel, Worst part about this stay was having to go home We booked for two nights stay but wished we has booked at least for another, Fabulous experience Fantastic location for where we wanted to be Within easy walking distance of Buckingham palace and all the west end theatres Great location for shopping and plenty of places nearby to eat should you not choose to eat in the hotel 
463480,The May Fair Hotel, First room offered room 231 overlooked air conditioning unit and Unfortunately you could hear the unit noise while in use Found this unacceptable at the cost of the room ,No Positive
463481,The May Fair Hotel, No plug sockets near mirrors and had to move kettle to a plug socket near the front door and boil it on the floor Very bad for a 5 star hotel The bar was far too expensive too 85 50 for 4 standard alcohol drinks Bathroom facitllities good but could not actually pour the complimentary toilettrys bubble bath into the bath as they were fixed to the wall,No Positive
463482,The May Fair Hotel, Everything was perfect , The customer service was exceptional the location was perfect only 5 10min walk to Buckingham Palace Piccadily Square Highly recommend to anyone travelling to London and want exceptional class 
463483,The May Fair Hotel, The room was a terrible standard 300 a night I was so disappointed Cheap nasty shower barely reaches your head Torn up carpet for blinds Cheap tiling So annoyed, The staff were lovely
463484,The May Fair Hotel, I found no faults, absolutely outstanding hotel Warm cosy rooms Devine beds friendly staff and superb location Excellent recommendations from the concierge for family attractions and the doormen were brilliant for directions 
463485,The May Fair Hotel, TV in the bathroom was not working Couldn t sleep as noise from the street was really loud also room temperature was too hot so we couldn t sleep seems like air con was faulty too , Breakfast 
463486,The May Fair Hotel, Totaly over rated the foyer was poor no couches to sit on We booked for xmas dinner and it was terrible , Not very much the location was the only good thing
463487,The May Fair Hotel, Plug in the washroom only for razor Difficult to do makeup in bathroom as lighting too low, Quiet room with lots of windows Maria Lisa very accommodating as to our room Not sure of spelling of her name
463488,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, Nice comfortable highly finished hotel in the heart of Mayfair Breakfast was fantastic with a massive selection of hot and cold food and fresh exotic fruits and juices 
463489,The May Fair Hotel, Standard rooms have bathroom door smell issues Better rooms are more plush , Location Location Location Lovely breakfast great bar Great service 
463490,The May Fair Hotel, Rooms were very sparse and wardrobe was crammed into the bathroom Nearly missed the minibar as it was a little cupboard in the hallway by the front door Not the best rooms but they were clean and modern ,No Positive
463491,The May Fair Hotel, Nothing to complain about, Room very spacious hotel spotless customer service second to none Breakfast was first class one of the best I have seen with so much on offer Overall the stay was perfect and will defiantly be booking again 
463492,The May Fair Hotel, My husband and I thought the English breakfast plate should be larger to allow for easy access to all the different items on the plate , Very comfortable room Massive bathroom Friendly staff 
463493,The May Fair Hotel, nothing I can think of, this was one of my best holidays ever and this hotel played a big role in making it so the rooms was nice and big the wifi excellent nothing to complaint about I loved my stay
463494,The May Fair Hotel, The bar stopped serving hot drinks at 4 and after shopping I really wanted a coffee The service was slow at breakfast and getting drink top ups were frustrating as there was only 1 staff working on drinks This was New Year s Day My French toast was gorgeous on the first day but on the second it was cold The other frustrating thing was New Year s Day the roads were closed we walked ages in the rain to find a taxi Not good for my heals or my hair , We were greeted at the hotel and it was a pleasant checking in transition staff were friendly and professional and also extremely helpful The hotel was clean and spacey and classy The concierge was helpful and quick which is what I like Service was good and prompt apart from breakfast they seemed a little stretched The hotel smelt gorgeous The bar cocktails were nice The location was perfect as we ate at Nobu across the road a favourite of mine I would stay again 
463495,The May Fair Hotel, Lighting could have been enhanced especially in the bathroom The wifi was erratic and the television didn t work for 2 days and hadn t been fixed by the time we left , Comfortable beds spacious room 
463496,The May Fair Hotel, Nothing to dislike about this hotel will definitely use it again and hopefully soon , Great location being just off Piccadilly but also a relatively quiet area considering this is London Plenty of restaurants near by but the hotel restaurant was fabulous 
463497,The May Fair Hotel, The rooms were not amazing for 450 per night A brand new premier inn room was nicer Maybe upgrading to a suit would be a lot different however they were very expensive I mean don t get me wrong the rooms are obviously to a standard but I expected a little more, The entrance was very nice along with the location The location was perfect
463498,The May Fair Hotel, George on reception was a graduate student and by the time we got shown to our room we knew his whole life story The sheets were dirty We waited at least 20 minutes to get them changed and it was by a guy who wasn t from housekeeping The hot towel rail was not working We got woken up by a message from reception at 7am , Spending quality time with my husband 
463499,The May Fair Hotel, Bed wasn t very cosy the room kept on blowing cold air even though the everything was turned off the junier suite it was abit unpleasant was tossing and turning all night, Good good nice staff
463500,The May Fair Hotel, We had a leak in our room and wasn t offered a room change We was told the leak has been sorted but it wasn t The leak with in the bathroom coming through a light fitting therefore we was frightened to turn the lights on The next morning we went for breakfast which was cold Won t be returning to this hotel I saved up for my boyfriends 30th birthday and we had a bad experience Very disappointed , The bed was comfy and the guy who we checked in with was very friendly 
463501,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic clean rooms staff were lovely we even got an upgrade which was amazing after a very stressful year it was a surprise for my husbands birthday and we can t wait to go return 
463502,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, Not the high end hotel I expected The bathroom was on par with a Prem Inn Soaps attached to the wall like in a cheap airport hotel Mini bar had open food inside was super disappointed shame really its in a great location had a good bed but overall was not great won t rush back 
463503,The May Fair Hotel, The Mayfair Kitchen dining was not to my liking, The hotel location was incredible and the room comfort outstanding The service and cleanliness excellent Nothing not to like 
463504,The May Fair Hotel, Our room being on 4th floor next to Amber Suite had a lot of commotion from children running back forth making noise which was quite unpleasant on Christmas Day , Stayed two nights during Christmas holidays in a king room Room with pleasant warm colour tones designer carpet roman blinds large plasma tv fluffy feather down bedding was comfortable Tea coffee making facility fully stocked mini bar and a double shower area in the bathroom with a warm shower rail Breakfast was served daily in the May Fair kitchen with a selection of some exotic fruits alfresco style with widespread menu to order from till late hours of holiday period which was convenient during Boxing day Breakfast was cheaper if you pre booked during checking in Location was another plus point in the vicinity right next door there s Sainsbury M S within a 5 minutes walk right next to Green park station and Piccadilly circus about 10 min walk with ample buses to from Victoria Station Piccadilly Circus and Knitsbridge Overall we had a pleasant trip to The May Fair Hotel 
463505,The May Fair Hotel, The bar at the ground floor which is the only place in the hotel you can relax and have a coffee was closed on Christmas Day and Boxing Day The hotel does not have 2 or more areas where residents can spend sometime The single location available can NOT be closed as long as the hotel functions normally ,No Positive
463506,The May Fair Hotel, The photos do not represent the actual rooms Some rooms have TINY window facing the building next door Furniture and carpet are old and worn out , Location is excellent 
463507,The May Fair Hotel, Overall the hotel feels old and in need of a spruce up particularly the rooms corridors Robes provided in the room had makeup stains were not changed by housekeeping staff Upon checkout the invoice contained significant errors for mini bar items we did not even use , Great location and the Mayfair Kitchen was delightful Entry staff were very attentive efficient 
463508,The May Fair Hotel, The bar should stay open longer than 1am , The room was exactly as advertised but better So elegant Breakfast was awesome and very quiet despite busy streets Classy 10 10 no complaints 
463509,The May Fair Hotel, The shower was broke , The staff were fantastic they were so friendly and great with my little girl Breakfast was fantastic but at 75 for 2 adults it s not for everyone 
463510,The May Fair Hotel, I was charged 6 50 service charge for a bottle of wine and a bottle of peroni which I felt was extortionate however I did tell reception on checkout and they refunded me however it would make me think twice about having a drink in the bar again , The facilities were fantastic nothing was forgotten
463511,The May Fair Hotel, The trouble with this hotel is that there is really no place to sit down if you just want to relax You can go to the bar but after early evening this is a very noisy place with loud music They have again redecorated the restaurant and made it modern in a way that it is not a cosy place anymore The lobby is too busy crowded with people checking in and out all day and not at all a place to sit down It then leaves you with your room My room this time was rather small with one little chair in the corner and no bedspread When you pay around 300 pounds per night you expect a bedspread or something like it on your bed All in all this is a hotel for younger rich people If you want your hotel in London to be a home from home then this is not the place , The breakfast is very good but if you stay alone you will not get a table for yourself You will be placed in a row along the windows facing the street 
463512,The May Fair Hotel, Nothing I honestly loved everything , Everything The room was nice and spacious as we got upgraded to a room with lots of light and a beautiful view of Berkeley Street The staff were very welcoming and accommodating and I can honestly say we were very spoiled The breakfast was delicious set in the beautiful MayFair Kitchen with lots of variety and healthy options It was truly an exceptional experience and I look forward to coming back in the future 
463513,The May Fair Hotel, Some serving staff didn t seem to know how breakfast worked Was a little confusing but experienced staff were to hand , Comfy bed Good bathroom Good breakfast 
463514,The May Fair Hotel, Not much to improve on Perhaps a gift or snack news shop , Breakfast service was very good staff attentiveness esp Concierge was excellent Great bar fast and included WiFi dinner service was perfect 
463515,The May Fair Hotel, Noise spaciousness for what we paid lack of comfortable high back chair Furniture and decor was trendy but not necessarily functional and welcoming , Location and restaurant
463516,The May Fair Hotel, For the price would have been nice if the room was a little larger but I guess you can t get more in Mayfair , They asked if we were celebrating a special occasion and we told them it was my partner s birthday They were then kind enough to leave us a sweet treat for him Bathroom was gorgeous Very comfortable bed Excellent location We were going to Pollen Street Social for dinner and Brown s for afternoon tea the next day Also close to Green Park 
463517,The May Fair Hotel, Too noisy Too busy Full with drunken Christmas party goers, In principle good breakfeart but much too busy and staff overwhelmed Half of the food in the buffet was gone at 8 30 and was not replenished when we were there
463518,The May Fair Hotel, Thought the room although very clean and fairly large it was a little soul less we were upgraded as it was a special birthday which we appreciated but made me wonder what we would have got , fantastic location great front of house staff Great bathroom Very good breakfast Would stay again 
463519,The May Fair Hotel, To be honest nothing , Friendly welcome clean rooms all facilities and extras explained clearly to me and it was my wife s 30th came back after a great meal to a selection of chocolates left in the room with a birthday message off the hotel really nice touch the bar great and the restaurant did a good breakfast
463520,The May Fair Hotel, We had checked in online and chosen our room But when we arrived we had been swapped to a different room which wasn t up to Par They did eventually sort us out after trapsing around the hotel for 20 mins ,No Positive
463521,The May Fair Hotel, The products in hotel are not great and to little of them the bed linen is not so soft pillows not great robe and towels are ok elevator slow colour scheme in room very dated Water presure in shower is weak did not feel like a five star journey , Location is great good value in terms of size for money 
463522,The May Fair Hotel, When I made the booking I included breakfast when I got there breakfast was not included so it got confusing at check in to find my booking on my emails which I could not find , I always like to enjoy a good breakfast when I stay in a hotel I have stayed at the Mayfair twice now the breakfast is always tip top as were the staff 
463523,The May Fair Hotel, Dissapointed by the interior of the rooms, its very central and you can walk to most of the places Especially bars clubs and restaurants are located close to the Hotel The staff was very friendly and corteouse Fun Hotelbar 
463524,The May Fair Hotel, Bar was expensive the spa facilities could of been much better considering your paying an extra charge on top for it , Bed was extremely comfortable Breakfast was superb Bathrooms were lovely Fantastic location with easy access for transport around London 
463525,The May Fair Hotel, The soap which was provided in all the hotel in overpowering smelling like a man s aftershave and not a good one , The breakfast was great A cold table to choose dairy products musli and some cold cuts Then a menu with a selection of hot plates made for you like for example the italian which was eggs benadict on a bed of bacon served on a bread which was very good Staff very helpful 
463526,The May Fair Hotel, Changed rooms as bed much too small need to provide all King size now new room nice but right on the top so noise of the fans Took 3 efforts to get a fried egg right 1 broken and hard 2 under done and slimey 3 just otherwise excellent , Very comfy bed very clean 
463527,The May Fair Hotel, Don t bother with this hotel they cater to businessmen therefore the rooms are not functional nor conducive to a woman s use The closet and bathroom is one large room with no separation so if someone was using the bathroom than the other person cannot access their clothes luggage without disrupting the person who is using it CONS Not enough lighting No outlets in bathroom none No shelf in shower No place in shower to set personal items No seat in shower No door on shower No water pressure Heated towel bar a 10 foot walking outside the shower Handheld shower heads are placed at waist level way too low on wall in shower and spray right out the glass opening getting the bathroom floor all wet Polished natural stone on bathroom floor creates an extremely slippery floor in bathroom Not safe Clothes hanging in closet portion absorb moisture from shower and orders from toilet use Closet area has black walls and black floor with insufficient lighting we had to use our cell phones light in order to see inside our suitcases No privacy men in the building directly across the way stand in the window and talking on the phone and while they conduct business they stare directly into our room at the same floor level No Nespresso maker they said they would bring one and never did even when we asked a second time No help from the front desk who kept referring us to housekeeping who we had already spoken to and they were also no help Restaurant is extremely over priced They only sell tapas we had 2 each 4 total 1 small salad and 3 15 glasses of wine and it was 152 pounds They automatically include a service fee on your dine in service which is an optional tip only they don t tell you that it s in there or that it s optional We would never stay in this hotel again very poorly designed If you are a businessman and don t need to see in the mirror then it might work for you , Nothing
463528,The May Fair Hotel, The rooms were not the expected quality of a 5 star hotel in Mayfair Also for the price breakfast should have been included , Musthafa on reception provided friendly excellent service
463529,The May Fair Hotel, The view from my room was a brickwall wish my view had been better Also the room looked different from the one we saw on the website at the time of booking , Lovely breakfast especially the eggs benedict 
463530,The May Fair Hotel, N A, Janice the VIP guest relations manager was excellent nothing was a problem Thank you Janice I hope you get this message Juliet and Andy Gray
463531,The May Fair Hotel, Overpriced hotel is getting tired Not very skilled staff many newcomers Not a bad hotell at all but other hotels close by offer much more value for this much money , Great location reception staff very helpfull
463532,The May Fair Hotel, The first room we were booked in had a terrible view a brick wall and fire escape along with a sub par interior in our opinion We had arrived early in the day and perhaps they were trying to get us into a room as soon as possible However they quickly responded to our concern and we were given a very nice room , Staff was very helpful with all of our questions and problems They were always pleasant and appeared to be looking to please It s location afforded us easy choices of transportation to view sights not close to the hotel bus line subway taxis all out front or up the block 
463533,The May Fair Hotel, Rooms were upgraded compliments of the Mayfair as a result of our disappointment at the standard of the original rooms allocated Air conditioning made redicous noise during the night like someone buzzing the bedroom door Very undatisfactory , Location staff and dining experience
463534,The May Fair Hotel, Everything, We got a smoking room even so we asked for a nonesmoking room The housekeeping did not come the whole day Our bed was not made at 6 pm The carpet is old and we did nod like to wale around withour shoes Breakfast coasts 32 Pounds per person I asked to organize us tickets for a concert the prize was more than double of the original prize 
463535,The May Fair Hotel, The room i booked which was a superior king room was awful I have stayed in better premier inn rooms for 3 quarters of the price It was just super plain and boring with nothing to it and the view was just a wall of a car park I managed to upgrade to a studio suite for an extra 100 pounds and this was very luxurious and more like what i imagined i was paying top dollar for , The hotel was great staff were friendly and on point The food was really nice and our room after we upgraded was excellent 
463536,The May Fair Hotel, On arrival room we were given was nothing like the photo Looked very basic and not at all what we were expecting We asked to move and the room we then got was better Prices were very high even for a london , The location was great Bed was comfortable Most staff were very friendly 
463537,The May Fair Hotel, We waited over half an hour to get into our room card wasn t working my partner was shunned away at the front desk so I had to go down and sort it Was moved to a different room that was not like the one we booked with poor sunlight the room was very dark during the day Had numerous calls and knocks at the door as no communication between staff that we had moved rooms so there was confustion , The breakfast was lovely the best part of the stay 
463538,The May Fair Hotel, Very bad sound isolation quite small and poor rooms If you will have problems with your neighborns be prepared that nobody solve them , Location rich TV programme set
463539,The May Fair Hotel, Drinks prices but it is mayfair i guess lol, The bed was amazing and the staff very frenidly and helpful the place has lovely bars and a nice spa but no pool or jacuzi but the steam n relax room made up for it i guess i would also recomend room dining especially breakfast in bed would def use the mayfair again supurb location 
463540,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, Everything The rooms were a good size the beds comfortable and the staff friendly The breakfast buffet was very good A wide variety of food choice 
463541,The May Fair Hotel, Staff on check in didn t seem interested the room I had pre chosen wasn t ready despite them knowing my arrival time They didn t point out where the spa was didn t tell me the wifi password just slapped a 200 holding charge straight on my card The room we chose instead didn t even have carpet it was floor boards so was noisy there was some sort of boiler hot water system close by so there was a constant wirring pump noise going on The phones in the room didn t work so we couldn t ring reception or order room service The 1st night a guy next door was on his phone loudly at midnight then the other side of us a baby started screaming at 2am not the hotels fault I know but we couldn t phone reception Then on the 2nd night there was a massive party going on down the hall from us not hotels fault again but it started at 2ish and we gave up at HALF 6 And went to complain at reception Nothing had been done in 4 hours there was chanting and booming music But as the phone didn t work had to walk down to reception The hotel bar on the 1st night also didn t have a spare seat table at all half of them were empty but just had reserved signs on them Now don t me wrong I m not a moaner but never written a complaint before about anything but I chose the May fair as a base for me to pop the question so paid the extra to do it in style Wish I d saved and stayed in a travel lodge Shame because the Location was excellent breakfast was fab and the place was spotless Won t be staying again , Location was excellent breakfast was nice bed was comfy everything was spotless 
463542,The May Fair Hotel, That payment for rooms is charged to card on arrival and not at check out It is not elegant Common areas very uncomfortable and no good restaurant Hotel has lost its historical soul and feels like any other hotel, Location
463543,The May Fair Hotel, There were no efforts made to make the stay special It was quite a cut and dry behaviour Being a tourist destination the hotel should do something to plan out things to do for guests , Location is prime
463544,The May Fair Hotel, I didn t like that an optional 12 5 service charge was added to your bill and you had to tell them to remove it if you didn t want to pay it then at the end of the bill you could add a gratuity if you chose to everyone paid the service charge but nobody liked the way it was done , The pillows were amazing so soft that I asked if I could buy some 
463545,The May Fair Hotel, I found the mini bar extremely overpriced Seeing how much i paid for the 4 rooms you would expect some free condiments on the side 4 for some pringles is alot of money , The rooms being cleaned every so often was outstanding service and the comfort of the room was amazing 
463546,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is being refurbished I had an upgrade and my room was one of the newly refurbished rooms it was beautiful The staff were so friendly especially the slim waiter at breakfast he was great

463548,The May Fair Hotel, The room was not as displayed in the pictures the pics were the USP for me so felt deceived and very disappointed Room wasn t worth the huge amount I paid for broken mirror hair in the bathroom , Great location close to amenities Staff were lovely Valets were the best thing about the hotel ever so pleasant 
463549,The May Fair Hotel, The furniture was a little bit tired scuff marks on the bedframe worn chairs etc Having stayed at The Bloomsbury similar cost The Mayfair just didn t cut it At 300 a night I expected a better room furnishings Not the experience I had hoped it would be , Great location nice hotel bar Bathroom in our room was amazing

463552,The May Fair Hotel, Wait time to check in Arrived and has to wait to check in only 3 out of 5 checkin desks were available Room was okay though quite basic for 5 in Mayfair Very clean Not much character in the hotel seemed quite cold Mayfair kitchen was amazing and staff very professional and friendly However the ending was extremely disappointing I reported my necklace from my wedding day and my bracelet missing and I m still waiting for a call back It s appalling both extremely sentimental pieces of jewellery and not one member of staff cares or has taken ownership of this and I have spoken to the duty manager house keeping and fitness centre I m extremely upset about this experience and wouldn t expect this level of service from any hotel but certainly not the Mayfair hotel in London Worse of all we were staying there as it was our wedding anniversary and I left without my wedding jewellery , Mayfair kitchen
463553,The May Fair Hotel, The door staff seemed more interested in standing around talking with the drivers waiting outside the hotel The lifts weren t very efficient and a little smelly I ve stayed here a few times and just feel it s gone downhill and would seriously consider another hotel in future at the price you ll pay, The check in staff were welcoming
463554,The May Fair Hotel, Screaming children running up and down the corridor no one did anything about it after we lodged 3 complaints the first at 4pm we gave up at 10pm Why can t guest with children be kept On one floor allowing business people free of noise , The location is excellent 
463555,The May Fair Hotel, The room furniture was a little dusty there was no guidance or instruction in regards to breakfast time I was a first time customer and I was unsure about the set up , The hotel was amazing Staff were very helpful and friendly 
463556,The May Fair Hotel, The picture you advertise next to the price of the room you think you are booking isn t what you actually get False advertising Thinking you are going to get a beautifully furnished room but what you actually get is a step up from a travel lodge The marbel bathroom was more luxurious than the room itself What a disappointing 1 year wedding anniversary stay So much so we considered travelling the 4 hours in the direction we had just come Most upsetting ,No Positive
463557,The May Fair Hotel, The rooms are looking at bit tired Very clean however not really luxurious It s The May Fair Hotel so expected better I would call this a 4 star hotel not a 5 star hotel , Great location in Mayfair within easy walking distance to great shops and restaurants and tourist spots

463561,The May Fair Hotel, The first room we did got a more acceptable room after complaining we were given was rubbish The clothes closet was in the bathroom and you could see into the bathroom from the bedroom The glass bathroom door which had a coating to hamper seeing through it was rubbish and you could still see the shape of your partner on the loo Wretched design for a 300 a night hotel , The food was very good duck eggs for breakfast on the menu 
463562,The May Fair Hotel, Breakfast wasn t included in extremely expensive price Had to wait 50 minutes or more for check in when check in was requested all thought not promised 3 months prior Handy man was in room fixing door when went into the room Then a member of staff came in to check our mini bar a job that should have been completed before hand Husband requested ice from room service and had to wait half an hour our more one occassion This was our honeymoon , Welcomed by staff staff getting and calling appropriate taxi s

463567,The May Fair Hotel, Design of bathroom Glass door lack of privacy Wardrobe inside bathroom leaving clothes exposed to humidity Shower glass too small and does not prevent water from splashing outside Water does not remove soap from skin fully leaving skin feeling sticky and eventually causing itching and sensitivity Price high , Location cleanliness
463568,The May Fair Hotel, Rooms overlooking courtyard were dark We booked three rooms for our family no upgrade given Noisy as there were children running around at 1 a m security did not seem to care in controlling noise from these families staff in reception were indifferent , Location
463569,The May Fair Hotel, I booked a superior twin room but were shown to a beautiful double on arrival After I contacted reception we were moved to a twin which did not compare to the double at all The twin was very small and was overlooking a set of stairs It was the only twin left apparently but it did leave rather a bad taste after seeing the lovely double , Bar and cocktails were fabulous The tapas was exquisite try the lobster ravioli devine 
463570,The May Fair Hotel, Most staff were fine but a couple were very rude and unprofessional Mostly upset because I asked for shirts to be ironed urgently and was told that it will be done within an hour but took over 5 hours which was pointless , Location is perfect and very convinient

463574,The May Fair Hotel, All of it television didn t turn over air con stuck on cold breakfast disgraceful and bedroom sheets had blood on them, Location was nice apart from that the overhaul stay was terrible
463575,The May Fair Hotel, This hotel is tacky and really doesn t compete with other 5 star hotels in London The rooms are basic and plain the bar is like a trashy night club and generally this is not what is expected from a hotel of this class For the money there is better available , Location is good
463576,The May Fair Hotel, It took 35 minutes to check in front of house staff really poor Being given an upgrade only for it to still have a cot in it and someone else s birthday cake, The second room was better

463606,The May Fair Hotel, Poor electronic communications in relation to our request to ensure our 2 bookings for consecutive 1day stays were coordinated resulting with us being locked out of our room on the second day This request was also made to staff when we booked in Having to wait over 10 minutes for the room key because they claimed payment for the stay was out standing despite payment being made at the time of booking in December 2015 The overall experience spoiled what should have been a relaxing stay ,No Positive
463607,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, We spend 4 nights in these wonderful hotel The stuff is very helpful and very kind The situation is perfect 2 minutes by walk to the underground Green Park 5 min to Piccadilly Circus and New Old Bond Street Many cafes and shops are in the neighborhood Our kids 10 and 14 years old loved the Buffet and a la carte breakfast Many fresh fruits and different kind of juices Everything was perfect for us It was the second time we stayed there and we will come back for sure 
463608,The May Fair Hotel, Shower Quality of water in shower Booked a massage and my card wasn t working Spent one hour with the Spa and reception to fix the issue Corridor too loud, Beds
463609,The May Fair Hotel, Over priced, All are excellent except location is good fir high end products expensive ones And its over priced I lived five days in 5 stars hotel in marble srch area before this hotel with 35 less cost 
463610,The May Fair Hotel, Very disappointed with our room it was very dated and needed a revamp Messed up my booking and had to be moved also as I and my elderly grandmother were about to go to sleep a maid came walking in to our room without knocking or warning for no apparent reason after calling down to reception to speak to the manger they told me he would call me back after waiting 30 minutes I called down and said that I was going to sleep In the morning the manager came up and spoke to us Absolutely unacceptable for this caliber of hotel I also left my phone charger behind and didn t realise until i got home I called up and they told me they would have a look and call me back and that was 12 days ago and I m still waiting I will not be coming back , The staff were very helpful and friendly at reception and the front door 
463611,The May Fair Hotel, Carpet Because of the way it lies looks shabby but isn t really Did ask for two rooms together when booked 4 weeks in advance but were on 3rd and 7th floor Spoiled it a little , Very friendly staff Given free late checkout Super location 
463612,The May Fair Hotel, It s great but remarkably expensive , Great Location This was the first time I ve ever been in London Every famous place is close Very friendly staff 
463613,The May Fair Hotel, Booked two twin rooms as ladies traveling together booking com had twins as an option which we selected however these were not available when we checked in and was told there was no alternative to the double rooms after some discussion one twin was found and later that evening another later room was found and we moved with a z bed not ideal as we are all adults and not young but I appreciate they made the effort to accommodate us , Hotel was fab attentive staff and lovely rooms superb breakfast
463614,The May Fair Hotel, The bedroom was very plain I know this doesn t necessarily affect the stay and I don t know what else I expected but this is the only thing that I would say wasn t 10 10 Everything else was everything and more , We had room service and the food was fantastic The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and could not have asked for more 
463615,The May Fair Hotel, Superior queen room quite small in size Also the in room iron was a bit poor quality for such a high end hotel , Staff were amazing Very friendly and always helpful Especially in Mayfair kitchen restaurant Check in and check out very smooth Location of this hotel is perfect Right in the heart of the action Nobu restaurant right across the street Would highly recommend
463616,The May Fair Hotel, Some screws need to be tightened in the bathroom such as a few screws on the towel rack , My third stay in The Mair Fair hotel and they always seem to impress me 
463617,The May Fair Hotel, the room with permanent noise conditioner was poor and noisy also exhausting system on outside wall was heared staff was nice but did not want to help us with that problem in average bad experience , location is good that is Mayfair 
463618,The May Fair Hotel, Our original room was tiny It was not nice at all but we complained and they did move us Our second room was really nice and what I was lead to believe I had originally booked , Bar was great The breakfast was lovely 
463619,The May Fair Hotel, For a supposedly luxury hotel the Deluxe Room at the Mayfair was sorely lacking A very bare minimum in furnishing no separate sitting room very small bathroom with only a small shower tub combination instead of a spacious place to bathe and groom The bathroom was reminiscent of a cheap Motel 6 in the USA The closets are a strange lineup of doors that have to be closed in order to open another etc The view was the wall of another building Did we get a Discount room instead of the Deluxe by mistake Also the upstairs restaurant was being renovated to what looks like an open contemporary space not the rich warm feel of the former space , The reservation and housekeeping staff were delightful and very helpful Stan the Concierge was very helpful and friendly as were the other Concierge staff All requests for drivers from and to airport and to Bray were on time professional and very personable The Lobby and Lounge were nice and well appointed 
463620,The May Fair Hotel, Cooked breakfast in dining room on first day was cold We were unfortunately late and staff were not very hospitable or friendly Room cleaned late afternoon , Reception staff courteous and helpful Room service breakfast hot and most enjoyable 
463621,The May Fair Hotel, The bar was too noisy you have to scream in order to hold a proper conversation I thought it would be a smaller cosier hotel but it is a large establishment Not a huge fan of the posh crowd who are sometimes very rude cause they can and they are legion at the Mayfair , Location location location The tube is literally 2 minutes away and it is a fairly quiet neighborhood 5 minutes away from Regent Street The room was nice and cosy and the bathroom was huge 
463622,The May Fair Hotel, I wish there is a flush tube in the bathroom , Very pleasant stay Enjoyed everything about this hotel Friendly staff Best service Amazing location Nice bed and pillows 
463623,The May Fair Hotel, I thought the toilet seat was too high also thought the hairdryer could be better located The attached mirror in the bathroom was too high You needed to be strong to move he bathroom door Breakfast bread should be improved it was cheap and nasty, The veal chop was excellent The bed and bed linen were lovely The ginger non alcoholic drink was moreish plus Parmesan crisps were good Staff were very professional 
463624,The May Fair Hotel, Really poor photos do not represent the rooms at all poor mismatched furniture worn carpets and a complete lack of warmth in the rooms coupled with the rioting footballers blowing gas canisters and jumping on their beds next door and above us The hotel bar full of wannabes hookers and security guards who look like they ve just returned from the Ukrainian front this place is appalling why I decided to freestyle the booking and not just stick with the Langham or the rosewood I ll never know don t bother , Not a lot 
463625,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, Rooms were good sized clean elegantly appointed and super comfortable The staff was very professional Room service was fast and the food still hot and delicious Also less than a block to the Tube very convenient Would definitely stay here again 
463626,The May Fair Hotel, Too long to wait for the elevators The lobby too noisy The spa is not a real hotel spa you have to pay for everything even sauna and steam room , The bed was comfortable the room spacious
463627,The May Fair Hotel, N A, The hotel was amazing Adriana at front desk was fabulous so friendly and warm Perfect location if you want to head over to Nobu or Novikov for lunch or dinner literally just around the corner Loved my stay room for was exactly as in pictures junior suite and would defo stay again soon 
463628,The May Fair Hotel, Window in room 567 had a gap in the frame wouldn t close managed to pack it with towels to keep the cold out , We have stayed at this hotel on many occasions it s one of our favourites Very pleasant indeed 
463629,The May Fair Hotel, Unwelcoming reception room smell disgusting the layout was horrendous and cheap Wardrobe inside the toilet area Tv on the side wall After complains regarding the smell which they agreed it was very bad they decided to move us but to a cheaper room So we didnt get what we paid for Toiletries are extremely basic The spa is so small is suffocating Overall a horrendous experience all over Won t be returning not sure how did they get a 5 star rating Next time back will stick to the Langham, The bar hot stone massage was superb
463630,The May Fair Hotel, shower in the suite was far too small no heated mirror the bathroom check in was not a smooth process and the discount that comes with the suite was not applied to my actual account, room was great bed was comfortable bathroom was huge room service was great guest services were very helpful they did all I asked great location would certainly stay there again
463631,The May Fair Hotel, The breakfast room seemed a bit cramped in terms of space around the tables , We had one of the recently upgraded rooms very nice with some useful added features We did notice there was no anti slip map in the shower Didn t cause us a problem but might to an older person 
463632,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, Friendly staff very good location great bar with good atmosphere and lovely cocktails very good breakfast great shopping nearby love this hotel for weekend in London
463633,The May Fair Hotel, The room was a bit disappointing Expected larger and more complimentary amenities for the price However the rest of the hotel and the staff were faultless , The staff were amazing Very friendly made you feel like a VIP 
463634,The May Fair Hotel, I think apart from the entrance lobby and bar the hotel looked a bit shabby The rooms and corridors are in need of an update The bed was lovely and big but the linen was not great and the pillows were too full I expected good goose down pillows , I liked the location and the vibrant buzz Friendly staff
463635,The May Fair Hotel, The breakfast was not as good as last time less freshly cooked , The staff who took regard to the fact we had stayed before and made amends for the poor room we had previously It felt as if we were wanted as guests 
463636,The May Fair Hotel, The air conditioning in our room worked intermittently I reported it after our first night but it wasn t fixed shame Didn t detract too much from the overall experience which was very good , The staff were very friendly and helpful The room was spacious and spotless Beds were comfy and the breakfast excellent 
463637,The May Fair Hotel, There was a constant noise of air conditioning all night My wife was unhappy there was no mirror in the bedroom and the TV was oddly located on a side wall Running the gauntlet of young men apparently hanging around outside the hotel at 10 30pm was bad enough for us as a couple it would have been intolerable for a single woman , The location of the hotel is good if you want to spend time in London s West End close to the shops and theatres The hotel staff were plentiful and friendly Our room was adequate if you like drab beige though we were told we d been given an upgrade which makes you wonder how small the standard rooms are 
463638,The May Fair Hotel, Could hear other residents within their rooms late at night so did disrupt our sleep somewhat , Staff are incredibly friendly and helpful and the location is amazing 
463639,The May Fair Hotel, The room was unbearably hot there was no dressing table with a plug to use hair appliances Lack of plug sockets in the room had to boil the kettle on the floor next to the door room 655, Very Stylish hotel
463640,The May Fair Hotel, Expensive At more than 1000 for 2 nights I expected breakfast to be included But I guess these are London rates , The family bedroom is great not all hotels have it Location of the hotel is perfect Concierge gives excellents tips for restaurants and places to go Overall we had a great stay at the May Fair hotel and I will recommend it for sure
463641,The May Fair Hotel, Would suggest the breakfast included in the booking With so many options in london Need the extra push to try the hotel breakfast Would also suggest a hotel guest discount for the spa , Location history staff everything basically 
463642,The May Fair Hotel, The hotel has a bit of a strange feel to it like people go to party or go clubbing in the posh neighborhood Breakfast was average , The beds were very nice and the bathroom was large Staff overall were very nice 
463643,The May Fair Hotel, Very disappointed with the room was a matchbox compared to the pics I seen of the room The room looked very dated beige carpet beige walls looked very depressing was very disappointed with what I received for the price paid , Bed and pillows amazing
463644,The May Fair Hotel, N A, Paid for a double room but Adriana in reception gave us a free suite upgrade Totally unexpected and made our trip to London fantastic Can t thank the hotel enough Would highly recommend
463645,The May Fair Hotel, The breakfast was a bit chaotic with not enough tables for 2 and also having staff and guests queueing at the same place was the best idea as it was in a confined space 2 areas would probably work better However there was a very good selection of food, The room was very good but perhaps the shower needed to be more powerful for a more relaxing shower 
463646,The May Fair Hotel, The Room wasn t ready until 7pm even though we checked in at 11pm the staff were extremely rude the complaint of the room not being ready was dealt with very poorly we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated for breakfast although there where empty tables the service wasn t explained to us and the hot food was cold Then the complimentary breakfast and drinks where charged to our room and had issues trying to remove them from our bill , The bed was comfy 
463647,The May Fair Hotel, The breakfast was terrible and I was really disappointed Asked for toast and eggs It never came No beans for ages so rest of food was freezing and had to wait for 10 mins for a table I was really looking forward to it as well but I would have been better off saving 50 00 and going to a caf Sorry guys , Bed very comfy Lovely curtains
463648,The May Fair Hotel, I would say the bar downstairs was overpriced , beds are extra extra comfortable felt like home Rooms are well designed everything is in order and place and there is everything you need available even an excellent umbrella to shield you from the london weather 
463649,The May Fair Hotel, I had requested two single beds in advance when I got there they didn t have any left They offered us an upgrade and offered to put in an additional bed into this room They then called the room to say that they didn t actually have any spare beds left Also got billed for things in the mini fridge that I did not use this was refunded when I pointed it out , Breakfast was very good room was spacious bed very comfortable Great location for the tube Really good restaurant around the corner from the hotel Novikov
463650,The May Fair Hotel, Asked for uper floor level room for a veiw we got a court yard with air con units and drain pipes and old cupboards wasn t impressed and could here the night club all night next doors as was a one off for use took a lot of saving, Room was really nice lovely restaurant and lobby
463651,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, Location It s in the middle of every thing such as famous restaurants main shopping streets the hyde park the picadilly The property is very good the staff were friendly the breakfast buffet was generous Loved every thing
463652,The May Fair Hotel, room was a bit of a trek but that was my fault as i picked it on the online check in system would advise not using that as you pick without a floorplan, excellent location valet parking and great staff Attached mayfair bar is busy and fun
463653,The May Fair Hotel, Being told to return between 1330 and 1400hrs when our room would be ready and was a priority Returning at 1400hrs to be told that our room wasn t ready but was being cleaned as we spoke Asking at 1430hrs if rooms were ready to be informed that check in wasn t while 1500hrs We were aware of the 1500hrs check in time but having been told that they would be ready for 1400hrs it was a little disappointing , Fabulous Staff who couldn t do enough to help
463654,The May Fair Hotel, I didn t like it wasn t the bedrooms we chose on your booking information we were awoken 2 o clock in the morning by a roadie neighbour who left that day some of the staff we are not very informative as it was the first time I stayed in a hotel like that and was not sure of the procedure Menu could do with accommodating people that do not like beef and fish, I like the overall facilities I like that it was central to London I liked most of the service that we received The breakfast was very nice
463655,The May Fair Hotel, We requested a twin room prior to arrival however there was not one available when we arrived , The staff were very friendly and helpful great location and the hotel was beautifully kept
463656,The May Fair Hotel, 1 Towels were faded from washing bathroom floor towel had coffee stains on it 2 I was served a flat white coffee in the most basic cafeteria cup made by machine with the most basic roast I was charged 4 75 GBP which is outrageous for the quality If you decide to price it 4 75 GBP you shall provide value for it especially if you are a 5 Mayfair Hotel, Excellent key location in Mayfair Lovely helpful and friendly doormen Convenient valet parking 55 GBP per night 
463657,The May Fair Hotel, The location it used to be a quite quiet area very upmarket and exclusive but things have changed in central London and what really frustrated us about this visit was the level of very late night street noise I was woken in the early hours by music from a nearby bar club and then the roar of supercars going up and down the street This hasn t happened before maybe we should be more specific with our room location 752 by the way The bar We got back to the hotel late afternoon and headed to the bar for cocktails 64 for four drinks they were good for that money you would expect it but the experience was slightly tainted by the fact that there were a group of male overseas guests who thought it was the done thing to scream at the top of their voices like they owned the place Maybe they did I don t know There were 3 huge doorman in the bar and on the doors at 4pm in the afternoon this is a five star hotel In Mayfair They were unobtrusive we never felt uncomfortable in any way but It sort of says something about the place that they have to do this That said It didn t ruin the experience in anyway maybe its just how it is in central London hotels these days Maybe our tastes are changing but for the cost of the room it wasn t outstanding its good but not exceptional on this visit There s a lot of choice in London these days and The Mayfair does a lot of things well but for our wedding anniversary trip I just had that feeling it could ve been so much better for the money we spent if we had tried somewhere else , We ve stayed at the Mayfair a few times pre renovation and post so over a fair number of years and the best thing about the hotel is the location still On the plus side the public areas still look great nothing to fault 
463658,The May Fair Hotel, The size of the room and bathroom not enough closets for the clothes Not enough space to move around , The location of the hotel and the cooperation of the whole staff Everybody was respectable and helpful 
463659,The May Fair Hotel, Everything was great there is only one thing to improve which is the elevators there is only 3 and sometimes it takes time to get one Everything else was just amazing, Lovely staff
463660,The May Fair Hotel, I didn t think much of the spa It needs refurbishing and extending It didn t have a swimming pool the photos and advertising I felt was fauls advertisement and the cleanliness was not great in the spa either , The staff were fantastic location is perfect and the food was amazing The bed was very comfy Staying here made our weekend so special and the attention to detail was amazing 
463661,The May Fair Hotel, the only thing that could have been better would have been a nice view Unfortunately our superior room looked out on walls We kept the drapes closed all the time , The bed was super comfortable The staff were friendly and couldn t do enough for you Nice and close to the tube Stylish bar intimate restaurant 
463662,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, All was perfect in the hotel The porters were friendly the receptionist were friendly and fast free apples at the reception a good bar in the hotel breakfast perfect room was convenient wifi worked well and free I am travelling a lot around the world and for this reason I sleep often in hotels Not all the hotels are as good relation price quality as this hotel The situation is convenient lots of shops restaurants and parks are very close to the hotel 
463663,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, The location the venue the staff the opulence the service its endless We just love this place Great bar to spend the everning in And spot to head out into the night for an everning of Debortary This hotel is one of the best for a reason I can t sing its praises enough 7 BALLER standards all the way without the STUFFNESS 21st Centry style 
463664,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, Location breakfast concierge arrange tickets for same day match reserve dinner in a lovely restaurant at Valentine s Day and reserve transfer from to airport room space wi if and comfort 
463665,The May Fair Hotel, I didn t like that the entrance to the bathroom was next to the bed through a glass door and that the wardrobe was also in the bathroom, Location breakfast great selection staff in every department excellent
463666,The May Fair Hotel, No views window facing immediate walls of the next building , Breakfast fruits are fresh n seasonal overall food quality and choices are excellent Very convenient and centralized location Sainsbury just across the road A CBD present surprise 
463667,The May Fair Hotel, Bath and shower were rather slippy a bath shower mat would have been beneficial , Room was large and well appointed as was the bathroom Breakfast was superb so much choice of top quality items Position of hotel is excellent Staff were available and helpful 
463668,The May Fair Hotel, room had no view whatsoever, i thoroughly enjoyed my stay it was absolutely fantastic from the reception staff to the housekeeping really professional cannot fault anything would highly recommend and breakfast was faultless
463669,The May Fair Hotel, rooms very dark staff at breakfast seemed everything was a rush and not very friendly , got upgraded to family room so had a double bed each staff was very friendly bar very good didn t need to go else where great location would definitely stay again 
463670,The May Fair Hotel, Airconditioning didn t work, Modern spacious room tastefully decorated Great bar always pleasantly busy with many outside clients Breakfast great with wxcellent service
463671,The May Fair Hotel, Wardrobe safe was in the bathroom toilet very poor could take it for one night only Chaotic at breakfast little room to serve yourself Forgot my free newspaper and didn t have one when I had to ask, Good bed pillows Good service from staff Free upgrade
463672,The May Fair Hotel, Very disappointed that when we asked whether there was a vegetarian option for the cooked breakfast we were told no There was another couple sitting nearby who were also not able to get an alternative Not good for a hotel of this calibre , The bed was amazing sunk into the luxurious pillows 
463673,The May Fair Hotel, Although my booking was for twin beds when I arrived they told me it s only big King size one I had to pay for an upgrade which wasn t cheap, Beautiful hotel in an amazing location near to most of the places I like Very comfert bed and spacious room
463674,The May Fair Hotel, Room service food was poor did not rate the rooms for a 5 star top hotel Had to move room 3 times to find a room we were satisfied with , Comfy bed great location
463675,The May Fair Hotel, Bedroom could have been better there was a tear in fabric of the bed it needs updating but otherwise was fine , The bathroom was my favourite and the Mayfair kitchen was excellent food was awesome
463676,The May Fair Hotel, the rooms are small and there was no mirror in the bedroom The hairdryer is attached to the wall in the bathroom and the mirrors opposite are in the dark cupboard area I suggest if you are staying here to bring your own hairdryer extension lead as there are no plug sockets either and a large mirror , breakfast was brilliant
463677,The May Fair Hotel, Spa small Once we had our massage we could not got back into the relaxation room as it was full Came home from dinner and water was pouring from the ceiling over my partners clothes , Rooms were very nice and comfy Breakfast was nice Couples massage was nice
463678,The May Fair Hotel, The room was basic position of tv poor partner was unable to watch it while I dried my hair Lighting needs attention Sent e mail ahead of visit it was my husbands birthday 2015 was a BAD year he had a hip replacement then suffered a bilateral pulmonary embolism The hip is still not so good I had hoped as a large hotel you might of acknowledged this No mention from anyone , The position very central The staff were attentive 
463679,The May Fair Hotel, The queue for breakfast in the morning Took 20 minutes to be seated service was a little chaotic Once seated we had to wait for around 10 minutes after I had asked for a drink Photos of superior rooms online were not the same as the room we were given , Very comfortable beds excellent location Staff were very friendly and accommodating 
463680,The May Fair Hotel, Bedrooms are tired and in desperate need of refurbishment Room lighting is out of date and very and very dull compared to many other 5 star hotels across the globe Carpets are will worn Cooked breakfast very poor served on cold plates and by the time you have sat down to eat it it is cold Poor range of breakfast and poor lighting again I had to ask twice for mine to be cooked properly and warmed and by that time I had lost interest I wouldn t stay here again When I checked my credit card I was also charged 59 for 2 breakfasts that were included in my deal and had to claim a refund , location
463681,The May Fair Hotel, Went downstairs for breakfast and a little more attention to detail in regards to breakfast service would be great , Had a lovely stay with my wife Room was clean and staff were friendly and helpful as well Room service was good 
463682,The May Fair Hotel, The room above had a leak into our bathroom which filled my wash bag up maintenance can to our room stuck a dustbin under the leak and left My bag and its contents are ruined , Very clean and well presented 
463683,The May Fair Hotel, Room for the price a little small and tv signal most channels not working 100 , Bed amazingly comfortable and a pleasant hotel Room service and breakfast good 
463684,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, The reception staff were lovely I turned up straight from work and probably didn t look as polished as most guests but my welcome was just the same which was refreshing My husband and I like to treat ourselves and make an effort to have a night together and find that some establishments judge you on appearance but very happy to report this was not the case at the May Fair Thank you we had a lovely stay
463685,The May Fair Hotel, The rooms are extremely basic and small I had an superior room but it certainly didn t feel like that , The location is very good and breakfast quality was pretty good Its just so busy 
463686,The May Fair Hotel, the noisy air con units outside our bedroom window Kept us awake Also no nice miniature toiletries that you would expect from this type of hotel , Breakfast Lovely relaxed atmosphere with good selection of food
463687,The May Fair Hotel, the bed pillows not comfy, The welcoming attitude of the staff members and their willingness to make the stay enjoyable not to mention the location of the hotel to reach most of London s sight seeing areas 
463688,The May Fair Hotel, I for some reason may be my mistake could not control the temperature in the room Need minimal instructions stuck on the wall of how to use the temperature thing , The staff were absolutely amazing When I first checked in to the hotel my debit card was getting declined and it did a few times I opted to pay a certain amount with cash and a certain amount with the card the manager sincerely apologised and was very polite The room was amazing also the bed very comfortable Overall amazing experience 
463689,The May Fair Hotel, That I didn t know that there was going to be a extra charge and I didn t bring enough money and didn t get to use the relaxation rooms, Everything was great I liked everything
463690,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, It was my wive s 40th birthday and booked as a surprise Amazing support in getting the cake and flowers SUPERB service Fantastic hotel great location 
463691,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, Staff were absolutely amazing Very helpful loved every minute of it Had a comfortable sleep and a lovely breakfast Special thanks to Claudia who assisted me during my stay x
463692,The May Fair Hotel, Lobby is always filled at night with spill over from main bar and lots and lots of people mingling in lobby as though you are at a disco, Staff is Excellent Rooms look like Bordello
463693,The May Fair Hotel, Breakfast not matching overall standard of the hotel Back bacon used is too cheap no streaky bacon or no pancakes and syrup just seemed a little slap dash and Mayfair kitchen was far too small to accommodate everyone some people had to wait 15 20 mins to be seated that s not acceptable , The room was first class pillows amazing Room service spot on 
463694,The May Fair Hotel, It was quite late when someone came to clean our room by which point we were trying to get ready to go for a pre theatre dinner so our room was not fully cleaned The fact that a member of staff stayed on after her finishing time to do a turndown when we got back from the theatre made up for this however , The hotel is in a great location close to Green Park tube station but it is also easy to walk to lots of the main tourist attractions from the hotel The staff are also willing to go above and beyond to help you 
463695,The May Fair Hotel, Bit noisy from windows in room at night as we were above the bar I think or some sort of celebration Bit expensive Know it s lovely hotel but could be a bit more reasonably priced , Staff were great really helpful and friendly lots of them too Room was big bed was really comfortable Lovely hotel and really nice breakfast great service 
463696,The May Fair Hotel, Mayfair bar closes at 1am, Lovely lunch at Mayfair kitchen for night life Mayfair hotel is a hotspot of London Enjoyed my stay and would like to come again 
463697,The May Fair Hotel, Nothing everything was great , Fantastic hotel honestly couldn t fault it Location staff and hotel all five We stayed for one evening was meant to check in at 3pm but arrived early about 1ish and it was no problem the room was ready We had to check out at 12pm the next day but was going to see a show in the evening so asked if we could store our bags shopping and travel bags and they did so we could collect them later that evening after the show Will be staying again 
463698,The May Fair Hotel, The room that we had was to close to the motors for the air conditioned so keep us awake most of the night, Hotel was close to all the shops and restaurants and theaters not far to walk
463699,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, From start to finish we had a really pleasant stay and loved the little touches like the sweetie trolley in the reception We ate in the Mayfair Kichen and food was amazing Breakfast was also delicious Bonus having a casino attached to the hotel Would defiantly stay again
463700,The May Fair Hotel, Room was ok bar prices are over the top So are the room fridge prices , Very expensive and not overly impressive Thought the experience would be better 
463701,The May Fair Hotel, Not enough time there , Staff from minute I was dropped off were friendly courteous and helpful Room large bed comfortable bathroom lovely and there was good lightening sadly lacking in hotels these days to do my makeup Breakfast in bed was amazing Best breakfast room service I have had I will be back 
463702,The May Fair Hotel, The room colour of green is disgusting would have preferred red No dressing table with mirror in room it s in the bathroom but that is no good when the other person is using it , The room really needs a dressing table or desk layout difficult when two are staying
463703,The May Fair Hotel, nothing , Round the corner from Green park tube station in the best location everything at hand rooms in the cleanest condition with maids cleaning twice a day 
463704,The May Fair Hotel, The inside of the rooms and corridor were exceptional quiet however there was a lot of noise from outside even though we had modern windows Our room was on the 5th floor overlooking the front of the entrance and we could hear lots of ambient traffic and people noise , Very friendly and professional staff who were polite and attentive all the time The hotel itself and in particular our room was immaculate and clean 
463705,The May Fair Hotel, Rude and unhelpful service at breakfast No comfy armchair in room extra charge for use of a fancy shower and a sauna ridiculous Entrance area does not feel like a 5 star hotel more like an airport , Very friendly and helpful staff especially the Egyptian guys 
463706,The May Fair Hotel, If you need an adaptor you have no choice but to buy their adaptor travel kit which cost redicilosly 22 50 pounds comparing to normal cost of 2 to 2 50 and there is no option to borrow it or return it If you travel from Eutope or America make sure you have your own , This hotel has great location elegant modern decor and very helpful conciarge services We had little issues with collecting the room service tray but that could ve be due to the New Year s Eve celebration and the hight demand Still I m greatful to those that worked during such days so we can have a good stay I would stay again there for sure 
463707,The May Fair Hotel, There is a bar within the hotel also having a separate entrance from the street When i tried to enter the place at New Year s eve using the entrance from within the hotel i had my hand stamped I have never been treated in such a disrespectful manner at any hotel and I am shocked that the management of the hotel tolerates such actions from the staff of their bar Absolutely unacceptable and i consider it as a good reason to avoid this establishment in the future ,No Positive
463708,The May Fair Hotel, The phone and fridge did not function properly in my room and I had to change rooms at 10pm on New Years Eve not good I was not happy about this as I had reported both issues hours before , Friendly staff and great location 
463709,The May Fair Hotel, The breakfast was cold there was no jacuzzi in the spa and they charge 15 pp just for sauna and steam even though you are a guest at the hotel The lifts were slow too this may be because we stayed at New Years Eve , The bathroom and room was very plush The hotel was plush and strawberry mohitos in the bar were amazing 
463710,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, Great staff friendly even their doorman Nuno walked with me to my far to help park it Great location beautiful rooms and bathroom and comfy bed Also great selection of movies on their smart tv s in the room 
463711,The May Fair Hotel, Firstly a drunk woman kept us awake by Banging on our door during part of the night Secondly whilst relaxing myself in the bath and partner asleep a staff member knocked at our door we couldn t answer so I d thought they d understand Well they didn t and they let themselves in with my partner running to door the member of staff kept saying he needed to check what we used in the mini bar otherwise he s charge us I found this totally uncalled for and rude and its sad that little things like this didn t make it as perfect as it Could have been , The staff around the hotel absolutely lovely The cleanliness and turn over service was fantastic 
463712,The May Fair Hotel, It was a shame where our room was located as the view from our one window looked out on to a group of the hotels large ventilation fans We kept the blind down for our whole stay It wasn t so much the unsightliness as it was the continuous humming that was something we would have preferred to do without , The staff behind the welcome desk as well as about the hotel were very approachable and made us feel welcome for the whole of our stay It is a beautiful hotel with great decor seating and lighting We really enjoyed sitting in the stylish bar with our complimentary drinks We were presented with two drinks vouchers as we checked in to celebrate my husbands birthday The breakfast was also very enjoyable with a delicious assortment of options 
463713,The May Fair Hotel, It is a noisy place in the evenings If you want to relax at the hotel then there are better options in this price range Can t understand why check in always takes so much time , Modern and well appointed rooms
463714,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, Great customer service Was able to check in early which was convenient for us Bed very comfortable despite reading some bad reviews High spec room

463716,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, We come here whenever we can and the hotel never disappoints We ve been lucky enough to stay in a lot of top London hotels Claridges The Dorchester etc and we keep coming back to the Mayfair It is fancy without being stuck up It has a very relaxed traditional but also modern feel 
463717,The May Fair Hotel, Underwhelming Staff were generally uninterested run on autopilot script with little attention to detail customer satisfaction Room service breakfast evening meal were delivered cold greasy I booked this hotel a few months ago but couldn t make the dates so thought I d try again but I won t book this hotel again 5 Perhaps but as I stay in 2 5 hotels a month I d place this hotel service wise around a 3 Very disappointing ,No Positive
463718,The May Fair Hotel, The cost is a lot higher than a number of central London Hotels I have stayed in and on a par with all of those which I would perhaps be more inclined to stay at next time as they are just as central but more affordable , When we arrived the front desk asked the nature of the trip we mentioned that it was a birthday visit and were kindly given complimentary drinks at the bar Beautiful Hotel although very similar to a number of Raddison Blu Hotels also in London 
463719,The May Fair Hotel, The room was delayed twice and not ready until very late One drink in the bar was not adequate compensation Then we found the room had not been cleaned very well and there were no windows except roof lights Disappointed to say the least , The breakfast was very good The location was good 
463720,The May Fair Hotel, Rooms were on the small side If you wanted to keep the bathroom light on at night there was not way to block the light from the bathroom into the bedroom Not a large choice of TV channels were offered , The staff from the Concierge to the housekeepers were outstanding Breakfast was excellent and ample 
463721,The May Fair Hotel, Check in was a little chaotic and our room was not ready at 3pm They did upgrade us to a duplex suite but this was very dark and we did not really like the room at all The bed was very low and not very comfy and the bathroom is downstairs There is a fire door from the bedroom into the hall upstairs nor good with a sleepwalking husband had to barricade it to avoid him locking himself out I the hallway I speak from experience , Location is fantastic
463722,The May Fair Hotel, Pump soaps etc It s a bit low end for a hotel of this standard, I ve stayed here many times and it s consistently good While there are many central London hotels that are good The Mayfair is a contemporary hotel which is a cut above the standard fair that you can expect around the world 
463723,The May Fair Hotel,No Negative, Beautiful hotel ideal for a special event such as a birthday Amazing food at the Mayfair restaurant Drinks are on the more expensive side but you get what you pay for I recommend the Mayfair martini

463729,The May Fair Hotel, The suite was smaller than I expected for the money we paid but it was still very nice with a great mini bar choice, Breakfast was superb Best I have ever experienced within a 5 star hotel
463730,The May Fair Hotel, As a single I would enjoy the area because it has good restaurants and bars but for a family the location isn t great because loud music around and prostitutes which doesn t suit a family, Liked the staff very helpful and friendly always smiling which makes you feel around home

463737,The May Fair Hotel, Absolutely nothing Our second time at this hotel and the level of consistency is great , Staff were exceptionally friendly and competent Guests really come first at this establishment Our receptionist took a while to find a room to our exact needs and whilst finding the right room she set us up in the bar with a free drink of our choice This attention to what matters for guests continued right through our stay 
463738,The May Fair Hotel, The door staff seem to be more interested in their own coversations rather than doing their jobs Mini bar is also very very expensive , The size of the room was very generous and spacious something that is hard to find in London The staff inside are helpful always wanting to know if there are other ways they can help you
