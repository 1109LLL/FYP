503075,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Seating in breakfast room a little cramped , The room was super comfortable spacious and quiet Also clean and well maintained The staff were friendly and attentive Had access to executive lounge which was a definite plus The breakfast was good as buffets go Don t be put off by the location Hanger Lane tube station a 2 minute walk away and 25 minutes on the Central Line to central London Highly recommended

503077,Crowne Plaza London Ealing,No Negative, Easy to find Very comfortable beds good working air conditioning Very near to tube Hanger Lane Very quiet in rooms Great value for a London break 
503078,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, That we gave our room number when we had dinner and assumed that the bill would be added on and we would pay when we left We then had a telephone call to our room at 10 30pm asking us to come back to the restaurant to pay This was unacceptable , Location very close to Central line on the underground
503079,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Only UK outlets in the rooms and no available adapter upon request , Central line station Hanger Lane was right in front of the hotel but still more than half an hour commute to the city center zone 1 Also the hotel is close to Heathrow airport Good for a short stay and if you want to visit sights in the outer zones of London 
503080,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Air con was broken asked reception twice for them to fix the came up after chasing and reset it but still ended up broken which meant a very uncomfortable night It was already quite late and we had to be up very early for my husbands surgery so just tried to sleep For 130 I expected more , Comfy beds
503081,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Nothing comes to mind , The staff were extremely helpful and friendly The room was very clean comfortable and well maintained The receptionist made every effort to book us into a suitable room ie on the ground floor at the back of the hotel The public transport links were excellent to Wembley Stadium and to central London I would highly recommend this hotel 
503082,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Extremely soft beds was hard to get a good night s sleep Internet connection good speed no disconnections yet it was annoying having to logon and reconnect every single day of our stay, Excellent breakfast lot s of things to choose from and great service Staff was very helpful and freindly
503083,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Location of hotel long tube journey to concert venue , Friendly staff Warm welcome and excellent service Excellent buffet breakfast and good value bar snacks 
503084,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, See above the worst level of customer service I ve ever experienced in my lifetime Incompetence rudeness contempt and a complete failure in customer relations , An utterly despicable level of customer service Upon arrival we were informed the hotel was full and our room was no longer available After travelling over 400 miles to be informed of this without prior notice was frankly inexcusable We were offered no facilities to freshen up we waited a further 3 hours to be relocated to another hotel subsequently missing part of a concert that we in town to see I will be demanding a full refund A horrible experience staff completely unsympathetic unhelpful and incompetence on a level I ve never witnessed before I will be taking this matter to the highest level such was the utter contempt with which we were treated by the manager of this hotel 
503085,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Signs for the slip road that you take when driving onto the hotel site could be bigger as it was not very obvious of when exactly to turn onto car park Also our mini bar was empty , The bed was very comfortable and the room was a good size spacious 
503086,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Breakfast was a bit hit and miss Got coffee not tea didn t have time to mention it as I was in at 06 00 Sausages were hard on the bottom too , Staff excellent
503087,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, For the second year running when we had booked a twin room we were given a double room and had to insist on having the twin room we had booked after much hassle and seeing one of the managers coming out of a Private room and telling him about our problem he got involved the receptionist wasn t interested she was busy but we were guests staying in the hotel too and she should have finished dealing with us before turning her back on us and helping other people not a pleasant start to our stay They put a put you up bed into a king size bedroom not much room in the bedroom with the extra bed in it as you can imagine it was a bit tight but it wasn t ideal and although the bed was comfortable I didn t sleep very well on it at all The general manager rang us the next morning and apologised to us and offered us free breakfasts and 50 discount off the first night as an apology He had now found us a twin room He was very professional and helpful and if we hadn t had the same problem on the previous stay I would have felt inclined to try the hotel again but the same thing happening on both the occasions we stayed there is too much and I don t think that we will stay there again ,No Positive
503088,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Check out staff very efficient HOWEVER as English is their second language it was slightly difficult to understand what was being said suggest support to help them SLOW DOWN in speech Breakfast staff had cleanliness issues Witnessed a tray of cutlery dropped on the floor only to be placed back on tables Come on Hotel really Had to help self to tea Coffee as staff were elsewhere Other than these Teething issues hotel placed in good outer London location , Check in very good swift and efficient Good room Comfortable excellent quality Bed pillows Food OK Bar good Great car park quiet room even thought right on Hanger Lane roundabout 
503089,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Car parking charges, The staff at this hotel are friendly and helpful They are attentive to ones needs and very pleasant at all levels Well done to management to have got themselves to this standard 
503090,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, The pillows there were 2 each looked really nice until you put your head on them and they became very flat as the night wore on to the point I woke up with an aching neck shoulder I sleep on my side The cost of food and drink was very expensive I remember a burger chips in the bar area was around 14 00 and the breakfast was offered at 27 00 , The hotel was situated within a good distance of Wembley Stadium plus the hotel was very clean and modern 
503091,Crowne Plaza London Ealing,No Negative, Breakfast was expensive We ordered a cab through reception to get to a wedding it didn t arrive we were late While this wasn t the fault of the hotel they weren t helpful at all 
503092,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, The towels and dressing gowns had a few long black hairs on them not ours , Excellent wifi Excellent view of Wembley stadium from rooms at front of hotel Breakfast was very high quality and lots of variety in the lovely restaurant setting Very spacious standard room with a very high class feel to them Absolutely no road noise despite being situated next to a very busy road and roundabout 
503093,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, The mattresses were not comfortable at all and have seen their best days Combined with a wiggly bedframe we didn t have a good night sleep In my experience box spring beds are more or less the standard in 4 star hotels these days Also the continental breakfast section is fairly poor cheap pre baked buns and definitely not worthy of a 4 star rating All in all we were a bit underimpressed by this hotel , When looking on the map the property seems to be relatively far from the center However with a tube station literally just around the corner you find yourself in the center in half an hour Staff is extremely friendly and helpful 
503094,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, The bed was slightly bouncy so partner turning over made the bed move The room was extra hot and dry but there is AC , Despite my reservations about the noise of the traffic it wasn t bad at all The room was clean roomy and staff very good There is a Starbucks on the ground floor didn t try but may be a good alternative to overpriced breakfast 
503095,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Cost of parking Is an unwelcome addition to the bill Cannot park easily in this location other than hotel car park , Excellent friendly attentive and helpful staff especially restaurant Reception staff very polite and conscientious Good location and comfortable beds 
503096,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, The only downside for us was the location We were doing the London tourist thing and the hotel was about a 1 2 hour Tube ride from central London However the cost of the hotel vs the cost of the hotels in central London made the ride worth it for us , The staff was amazingly helpful and friendly We were super early for check in and the representative at the counter went out of her way to find us a room that had been cleaned and checked us in early The restaurant was good breakfast was hot and the staff very attentive The room was large and clean the bed comfortable and nice pillows We had control of the a c and were able to make the room cool at night The hotel is on the Central Line Hanger Lane station for the Tube and the station is right across the street with a tunnel under the street so very convenient 
503097,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, I would appreciate some vegetables for breakfast otherwise the breakfast selection was okay Also bed was quite soft for my taste , The hotel is a very good value for money the rooms and all hotel areas are clean staff is helpful and polite It is located in Zone 3 of London public transport so it takes about 30 minutes to the city center however the hotel is situated directly next to the tube station 
503098,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, There is no direct USB charging possibility on the sockets You can use buy a transformer for the socket or use the USB on the back of the TV but the latter is slow , Friendly and helpful staff clean and cosy room The hotel is situated within 100m of the underground station therefore being in zone3 cannot cause any problem The room was clean and cosy containing mini fridge and hair dryer There is a Hungarian waitress who was very kind to provide information about travelling around sightseeing and other topics 
503099,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Room was good size but three things were wrong on this trip Toilet did not flush easily safe battery had run our and worst of all air conditioning did not work Room just got hotter and hotter Triangle sign stating service Luckily did manage to stop th fan but a very very bad night as it was just too warm in the room , Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful reception and restaurant staff members 
503100,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Several late night disturbances The IHG scheme is quite confusing in regards to earning points on meals etc I don t think reception knew much about it either, Staff were friendly and very helpful The hotel was very clean and the food is lovely I will be returning 
503101,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Reception didn t have the information when I booked the room Like Do I want double room do I want twin or double bed and Do I need breakfast but it s included then finally gave us Room that was not ready ,No Positive
503102,Crowne Plaza London Ealing,No Negative, The tube station is right next to the hotel in 20 25 mins via the Central Line we were in the center Breakfast was ok Iron fridge etc in the room various TV channels it was very ok 
503103,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, My boyfriend was charged 150 as a deposit for some room service and food we had ordered this came to around 68 and was told that he would be refunded the difference when we left However when we checked out we were then charged the 68 again and told the 150 would be back in his bank account within 5 days It has been 2 weeks and there is no sign of the 150 ,No Positive
503104,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Nothing, We had a brilliant stay at this hotel and really recommend it The staff were very friendly especially the ones in the restaurant Hotel also located right beside the tube station within a 2 min walk 
503105,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Air con was a bit noisy , Brilliant views over west London and Wembley Although near the A40 there wasn t really much road noise Room was fabulous especially for the price Parking was easy in our experience 
503106,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, It was quite a way out of the centre but that is why the price is so reasonable By London standards it is probably still pretty close I just have to readjust my thinking , Nothing to fault the actual hotel at all it was really exceptionally close to the tube station and the soundproofing was excellent the hotel is on a main road and you couldn t hear a peep 
503107,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Nothing at all For us it ticked all the boxes , Room was very clean and well presented Breakfast was brilliant so much choice you can not fail to find something you like and if not the staff will endeavour to get it for you Easy to get to on Central Line underground Use subway 4 out of Hanger Lane station and you are right on the hotel So easy 
503108,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, up for the cup final and we lost , arrived early and was able to check in straight away which enabled us to enjoy the whole day out in London Easy access to tube memnbers lounge great too with free coffee on arrival 
503109,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Booked a twin room and got a double Two mates together who aren t in a relationship They couldn t swap so that was a shame , The Bar was excellent and the staff very good 
503110,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, I didn t like how the egg at breakfast as they needed to be cooked more, The bathroom facilities was so good anday very clean and the bed was nice and comfortable
503111,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, uncomfortable bed ridiculous demand for an authorization of a credit card deposit of 100 with the excuse that there are a lot of false credit cards is this even needed when the room had already been paid for in advance or maybe they have had too many unpleasant surprises in the past A bit unfriendly and unaccommodating staff asked for a top floor and better view ended up on floor 1 and a room facing the highway surroundings feel a bit unsafe if one is alone , well cleaned spacious room warm close to tube insonorization
503112,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, The scrambled egg was runny low supply of complimentary toiletries and dressing robes in room Overpriced parking , The hotel was very clean staff helpful and good range of breakfast Good shower and spacious room Modern decor 
503113,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, It s a bit out of the way but easy to access central London on the central line, Good quality hotel next to tube station with a good gym at a good price 
503114,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, The fact that it was my birthday and annniversary I phoned up and they said there would be a surprise in the room but there wasn t Which was extremely disappointing, The beds were really comfy
503115,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, The menu in the restaurant was a bit restricted No choice between sandwiches etc , The bed was probably the best I have ever slept in The room itself was big and nice and warm Great location for Piccadilly and central line 
503116,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, There s was nothing I didn t like, Like the size of the bed size of room was ok full English was 10 10 well cooked and presented staff was very efficient pleasant and friendly great location and would recommend
503117,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Double bed with spring mattress is not really comfortable as any movement of one person causes a lot of movement of the mattress The foam mattress would be waaay better, Location for that money is really good breakfast really nice however the staff in the breakfast area was not the friendliest 
503118,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Beds too soft for our liking but, Great location for people driving to London Tube station on the doorstep which takes approx 20 mins to central London Breakfast good choice 
503119,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Background traffic noise through night as we were overlooking A40 despite double and additional secondary glazing Ergo advise request room at rear of hotel these seem to have even room numbers , Staff breakfast furnishings within a few metres of Tube station on Central Line on site car parking easy access A40 and to M25
503120,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, The food for breakfast was very low standard No chillie sauce Bacon tasted plain and boiled and was soaked in water Scrambled egg was tasteless No variety and not international standard Laundry facility was incredibly expensive Will book air BnB in future or an apartment for similar prices, Convenient to transport Room is clean Room service n maintenance was very swift and efficient
503121,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Charge for parking Complimentary water on first night only Having to ask for coffee cup refills at breakfast, Comfy bed Great bathroom Parking available Close to tube station Friendly staff
503122,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Club class room bed were small The club lounge canap s and breakfast were extremely poor quality and lacked imagination I would not recommend the club lounge access facilities at all In comparison to Crowne Plaza Birmingham this was very disappointing , Laura on reception was effective and efficient Room was clean and bed very comfy Club lounge breakfast staff responded to my request and provided fresh chilled cheese 
503123,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, There was a strong smell of smoke in the rooms and the lobby most of the days they must have some problems with the ventilation in the kitchen , Spacious rooms excellent breakfast and good value for money 
503124,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, The location is a bit far from city center however there s one underground station literally in front of the the hotel , When we arrived the staff were super professional and everything went smoothly Our basin was clogged but that was solved in next day super efficiently we re offered another room or some drinks to apologize which we declined but the gesture was 5 Breakfast is excellent 
503125,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, The location is awful quite difficult to find the entrance which is on a main road on the corner of a roundabout and isn t signposted well I drove around 3 times because I kept missing it , Lovely hotel the staff were friendly and facilities were clean The food in the restaurant was delicious I d recommend the salmon 
503126,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Located on a very busy road intersection Ask for a room at the side with the residential housing , Very comfortable bed Very nice room Very helpful staff Located at Hanger Lane Tube 
503127,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Nightmare to find the opening of the car park at first went round the houses twice When we were getting out of the car we were asked if we sold drugs so I think some CCTV needs to be used since people are buying and selling drugs in the car park , Loved how the tube was across the road big room lovely bathroom Overall lovely stay Would recommend 
503128,Crowne Plaza London Ealing,No Negative, Proximity to the tube station was brilliant can get into central London in 30mins Rooms where quiet spacious and clean Great parking facilities additional cost and easy to get to off the motorway

503134,Crowne Plaza London Ealing,No Negative, This was our second stay 2 nights this time and everything was perfect The Receptionist checking us in was very professional helpful and friendly The room was great and we slept well both nights This time breakfast service appeared to be under much closer management and was far better than on our last visit We would happily return 
503135,Crowne Plaza London Ealing,No Negative, Perfect for Midlanders who can stay right on the A40 and be back to Birmingham area in under two hours Tube is 75 yards away Oxford Circus is 25 minutes away on tube Much better value than staying centrally 
503136,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, The door knob on the bathroom was broke and a warning light was on on the air con which was worrying , Everything was clean and fresh We ve stayed here twice now and loved it both times 
503137,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Bed too soft clunky check in experience staff software Room not as clean as I would have liked coffee residue in cups hair in sink Asked for poached eggs at breakfast got fried eggs about 15mins later , Great breakfast section Lovely entrance and reception lobby area Very clean and neat communal areas Friendly staff Brilliant location

503139,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Only drawback for me was heating is via aircon and I have allergy , Comfortable and quiet and super convenient for central line plus a couple decent restaurants nearby 
503140,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, We changed our room as the first one we were given was on the ground floor with no windows and the room was very stuffy Staff were very rude and discriminatory towards us Felt the need to tell us 3 times about the hotel being non smoking which was rude and implied we had intended to smoke in our room , The cleanliness of the room and set up Bed was comfy
503141,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Expensive room Will look to stay closer to Wembley, Bar and food good Location right by north circular Good bus link to Wembley Not good on return as bus was cancelled

503143,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, bit disappointed in the price increase we booked our room about a month and a half after our friends and instead of the 160 they paid we paid 229 for exactly the same room, the room was great so clean and staff were very helpful

503146,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, There was little staff and it seemed that the staff they did have was running around like headless chickens The food was also poor for the standard of the hotel The breakfast buffet was a joke not enough choice hot things were cold and glasses smelt of stale water Hotel price a rip off for what they can offer , Hotel rooms are lovely and clean and very spacious Great location for Wembley 
503147,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Service at breakfast had to look for things and ask for stuff that should have already been done coffee not the best tasted old, Willing to listen when explaining an issue

503149,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Maybe the carpeting could do with a change, The beds were very very comfortable At reception they are very helpful especially Attiona Hysaj who with her help and concern made us feel at home away from home
503150,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, As summarized above , Closeness to the tube station Price is high judging from zone 3 location Facility is not as new and judging from lounge room standard is average compare to peers like holiday inn
503151,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Beds too soft Air conditioning noisy Asked on checking out if stay had been good and not interested in the above feedback Was no point asking me the question, Majority of staff were nice Restaurant reasonably priced

503169,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Nothing We loved everything just as it was Thank you for a great stay , We stayed here to see Coldplay at Wembley it was in an excellent location for the price the 83 bus runs to the stadium but you need to make sure you leave plenty of time as the route to Wembley gets very congested We gave up on the bus on the way home due to volume of people and managed to get an uber totally understandable though given the number of people attending busy public transport to be expected We loved the hotel staff really friendly very confortable bedroom and great nights sleep Breakfast was fantastic would highly recommend

503180,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, House keeping needs to get their act together I found the hair dryer only 30 min before departure hidden in one of the cupboards The number of cupboards and drawers is a good thing But all tools should be visible Also there was no hair shampoo just liquid body soap Other hotels of this level also offer toothbrush toothpaste comb etc The TV program could be substantially improved There were just standard channels with very old material I did not find an internal movie program , The receptionist carried the label trainee But she was the best receptionist I ever encountered friendly professional efficient Very much to the point Never bothered me with offers I did not need 5 stars The double room had a reasonable size and was comfy

503185,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Over priced breakfast with very poor customer service woman was rude tea and coffee came after we d finished the food and I m still waiting for a teaspoon to stir my cup of tea with , Bed was comfortable and room was clean

503192,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, nothing, Spacious clean room Bed was nice and comfy Bathroom was very clean Breakfast was good as well They offer a little bit of everything and the option to order eggs pancakes of the menu The parking facility at the hotel was great since we came by car at a fair price GBP 13 50 p day The hotel is located a bit far from the centre of London which reflects in the price this is not really a problem though since the underground Hangar Lane is literally in front of the hotel The central line takes you to the city centre in about 20 30 minutes Be prepared for the rush hour though London commuting can be crazy Staff was very friendly Wifi was good used it for Facebook Whatsapp internet browsing Great price value 
503193,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Service at reception and wasn t told to order breakfast night before if we wanted room service, Rang reception and didn t get no answer from for 15 mins Rang from my mobile and got answers straight away Terrible

503198,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, More choices of marmalade and cereal like Weetabix or shredded sheet or grapefruit Also don t understand why you should pay extra for parking , Opportunity to have choices at breakfast location good for train tube rooms good size 
503199,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, 30 00 car park charge which was not made clear at the booking , The restaurant and staff were courteous and attentive Also the rooms were clean and modern 
503200,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Difficult to find entrance to hotel from road A prominent sign on road approaching hotel would be helpful , Cleanliness and extremely peaceful On site parking and tube station outside 
503201,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, noise of the air con fan in the room overnight charging for overnight Sunday parking lack of knowledge of local parking restrictions bathroom door lock, location location location
503202,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Not much to see or do in the area Atmosphere of the hotel is a little sterile but i would blame the guests rather then the hotel on that one , Rooms were spacious clean and comfortable The service was great 
503203,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Bit far out of centre 2tubes 45minswas OK as we were part of a family party but wudnt advise journey back on an evening as a couple Don t have drinks in the bar as we went in one evening after long day in centre small single baileys 5 and we had to wait at bar for service and wasn t busy then wen we looked at bill they had the cheek to add on service charge they had charged each one of our family a charge which totalled 17 I refused to pay it , Clean and spacious rooms
503204,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Unfortunately we were sent to a room that was already occupied but that was sorted swiftly and we were give vouchers for free drinks which we weren t able to use , The overall stay was comfortable Very clean 
503205,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, we could smell smoke as in people had been smoking in the corridors however it did not permeate into the room but strong in the walk towards stairs lift etc, friendly staff clean facilities and lovely meal in the evening
503206,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Nothing all good, A good quality hotel with a comfortable bed The complementary herbal sleep potions were a nice touch A very reasonable price for a good hotel Friendly staff 
503207,Crowne Plaza London Ealing,No Negative, Comfortable beds clean rooms and good value for money Staff are extremely helpful and provide the best customer service I was ordering breakfast to the room and upon mentioning on one day that my food was really cold they apologised but then called back and said that I didn t need to pay service charge for room service to make up for the cold meal I d had Overall you get A LOT more than what you pay for The location isn t fancy but it s tranquil and there are some lovely restaurants nearby Restorante Belvedere is a must visit Amazing customer service and food 
503208,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, No pre warning of 50 per night charge they earmark on a card this left us 100 short for the weekend for food travel etc as we only had one debit card , Parking onsite is good Great location close to tube clean comfortable 
503209,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Possibly another choice of restaurant , Staff were excellent breakfast was great and literally steps away from tube station which is ideal Also parking at the hotel 
503210,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Only one thing is I couldn t believe it was 35 for two full English breakfasts absolute rip off , Staff were absolutely excellent so nice and friendly turned up 3 hours early and they let us check in for free because the room was empty it was an Italian man at the check in desk and he was very nice and polite 
503211,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, the location of the hotel was not ideal there were not many parking spaces and in the room there was no information about breakfast times etc , the room was nice and clean
503212,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, We was told our taxi would be 15 minutes and it was 40 minutes Completely not their fault however would have liked to know how long we would be waiting, The room was a great size Breakfast was lovely and the concierge destination staff were very helpful Will be returning when I m in the area 
503213,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, The staff behind the counter couldnt really understand what was going on had to pay for parking even tho most hotels are free , The bed the location was okay
503214,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Access to the Club Lounge was a nice touch but when you advertise 24 hour snacks I would expect to see some snacks in the room apart from pear drops No snacks at all the coffee was good would have been nice to have soft drinks available as well Also advertised was drinks canapes in the Lounge from 18 00 19 30 when we arrived at 18 15 there we no canapes were finally replenished at about 18 50 We had to ask for glasses for the wine and they ran out of beer No one seemed to come and check the stocks , Lovely room over the back so did not get any traffic noise Large room with separate dressing area Despite the lack of things available in the Club Lounge I would stay again if i was in the area Excellent choice for room service and breakfast 
503215,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, The main receptionist was very rude at check in and check out I had to call down because the bath plug got stuck and she was rude over the phone too , I loved the actual hotel the room was lovely and we definitely had value for money 
503216,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, When we check in asked to pay extra 50 just in case we take drinks from fridge said I wouldn t be told don t worry you ll get it refunded back on my card when I check out I thought this was crap I don t like paying for thing I haven t used don t mind paying for room in advance but drinks plus I m 50 short for rest of my trip until I check out won t be going there again,No Positive

503219,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, The bathroom had a really horrible smell which hit you as soon as you walked into the room like a musty damp bleach smell As I was suffering from pregnancy sickness this did make me vomit Breakfast a bit pricey , Car park right outside the front of the hotel was very handy 
503220,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, I ve come to the conclusion that men suck The hotel was lovely my experience not so much , It was clean but since I spent most of my night crying I didn t get a chance to actually inspect it 
503221,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, The vegetable burger wasn t to the best of standards Starbucks coffee was very burnt as it s such a well known flavour it s important that is correctly made , Very reasonably priced room service and drinks Room was spotless and staff always polite and helpful 
503222,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Bathrooms were a little old fashioned needing a bit of an update Location was hard to find via a car as Satnav takes you behind hotel and the Hanger Lane junction is a nightmare to get around as so very large and very very busy , All staff were friendly Hotel itself spotlessly clean Rooms were quiet Breakfast was really fantastic for choice and quality apart from the coffee Right opposite the underground station In a very nice location with bars and restaurants within a mile walking distance for me 
503223,Crowne Plaza London Ealing,No Negative, Very handy for travel to the hotel and for tube which is across the road Staff very good especially when we got back at 10 15pm from a concert to find food had stopped being served in restaurant Very quickly remedied by a young lady who spoke to chef and food was provided Breakfast very good 
503224,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Not directly attributable to the hotel but taxi they organised for us charged 18 for a 7 minute journey , Easy access from A40 excellent bar restaurant area to suit us a family group of 12 Bar service initially slow but improved when serving drinks to the table with lunch All staff very pleasant 
503225,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, We enjoyed the fitness centre which is well equipped but would have preferred to have been warned in advance that it was temporarily not open between 8 00 and 18 00 because of renovations we altered our plans but it was the cause of a little unnecessary disappointment , Exceptionally friendly staff who really went out of their way to be helpful an excellent breakfast and very good value for what we paid Because of distance from centre position by very busy road I rate position as good rather than excellent but it is very conveniently positioned just outside exit 4 from Hanger Lane subway and tube station directly on the central line 
503226,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Our room Was quiet but my sons room faced main road and very noisy Breakfast very expensive to buy at 17 50 if not booked in advance Booked taxi via hotel only to Ealing centre extortionate charge for short distance, Nice rooms friendly staff Good location for meeting family for a meal Easy access to hotel and near tube for travel into Central London
503227,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, 12 50 additional parking cost and gym facilities closed , Good check in extremely comfy bed decent range quality room service meal and very quiet

503230,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, The noise very noisy as there are works during the day The room was considered club room it is small the club area was closed for repairs, The location is great
503231,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, There was some construction work in the hotel just by our room and it started as 7 30 a m Next to motorway but soundproof is alright Expensive like all hotels in London , Just by the Metro Station and metro line goes directly to central London Parking is available Breakfast is okay Rooms small but clean enough 
503232,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Returned to the room about 3 30 and the housekeeping hadn t been done There was not enough milk in the room and exception were unable to supply more , The staff were friendly and helpful Food was excellent 
503233,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, Food quality was poor both morning and evening A buffet breakfast should not be beyond the ability of a hotel catering team but it seems they managed it two days running Dinner was also below the standard you would expect for a hotel of this calibre , Good location for getting into central London the tube station was 2 minutes walk away Triple glazing reduced traffic noise totally 
503234,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, All good, Left make up bag a purse in room this was passed to main reception for me to pick up later on that day they also said that they would post to my home if I could not call in to pick up myself very good service

503238,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, It was awkward to get to and from using the tube network even though the hotel itself was opposite the station also for a Saturday the bar food closed early even though the ONE member of staff on duty was extremely helpful,No Positive
503239,Crowne Plaza London Ealing,No Negative, Lovely spacious room with all amenities you would expect need from a hotel room A pity the bath shower was disappointing compared to other hotels but the bathroom overall was a good size The staff were helpful and the bar downstairs was a nice surprise 
503240,Crowne Plaza London Ealing, The TV guide was a pain as you couldn t look what to watch You had to put in numbers with no idea on what you were watching , Was very clean and friendly
