103321,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, No negative feedback , New Super clean friendly staff comfortable beds and memory foam pillows For my needs excellent location for city visit needs use of metro but Paris is so big you must count on using the metro anyway Would recommend it to anyone with need to be in or around 12th Arrondissement 
103322,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209,No Negative, Good rooms even though small as all in Paris Nice spacious bathroom with separate toilet Very quiet A C worked well Did not have breakfast at the hotel not included Close to bus station and Metro Walking distance to Accor Hotel Arena 
103323,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, The instructions for parking were not very clear so i wasted alot of time to find the parking and to get out from Accessibility of parking is very strange , Location and personnell very good
103324,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, A tiny bit of trouble with communication as to information regarding parking , Staff very friendly helpful and accommodating Very clean and smart accomadation throughout Excellent location for the purpose of our family adventure to the Accor arena the icing on the cake 
103325,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, But the area is not great with few nice cafes and just not beat area, Room amenities were great Rooms were clean and staff was really friendly Hotel is close to the metro 
103326,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209,No Negative, All the staff we met were good but the receptionist when we arrived and left was utterly charming could not have been more helpful AND spoke excellent English I m only sorry I did not get his name because there was a young man who does credit to the hotel and deserves to go far 
103327,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209,No Negative, The staff were fantastic helpful and really friendly I had quite a lot of things i needed staff to help with such as printing my boarding passes for my trip home and nothing was too much trouble The hotel is 15 min walk from the Accor Hotel Arena and there is a metro stop close by with a direct line to the Eiffel Tower
103328,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, nothing, the staff are really friendly welcoming and speak English on arrival they gave us a map of Paris highlighted where the hotel was The rooms are clean with air conditioning the beds are comfortable The hotel offers a continental buffet breakfast for 14 euros The hotel is next to the metro station and is only 5 minutes walk from the Accord Hotels Arena plenty of caf bars within a few minutes walk 
103329,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, The room could have a better choice of TV channels for foreign guests as we only had BBC world news for British travellers It would also benefit from a mini fridge in room to keep cool small bottles of water or cans of soda We also found it impossible to find ice in or around the hotel to take to our room and enjoy a chilled bottle of champagne on the balcony and therefore had to gulp it down quickly due to the heatwave , The bed was very comfortable We stayed in room 801 which had a view although limited of the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame It was very hot during our stay and the air conditioning worked perfectly We would recommend this hotel to others but as space inside the room is limited we would advise no large suitcase or holdalls 
103330,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, Considering it is rated as 4star disappointed that there wasn t a fridge in the room Hot breakfast didn t look very appetising needs abit more variety , Staff were very helpful friendly nothing was too much trouble 
103331,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209,No Negative, The property is 100m from the Dugommier metro which is great when you re carrying bags There s a lovely bakery around the corner and a Monoprix supermarket across the road so that s very convenient The area right outside the hotel is not the cleanest but it s nothing to complain about We would definitely stay here again The staff were super friendly and accommodating 
103332,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, If you require a big room then this hotel is not for you Our room was very small but it was sufficient for what we needed so it did not bother us that much , Very modern design of the room 
103333,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, The room was really small There was no extra space A couple of hooks by the entrance would have been helpful for hanging coats , The croissants were extra flakey The beds were comfortable The room and bathroom was recently renovated Nice view from the seventh floor Easy access to metro 
103334,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209,No Negative, The hotel was by a metro station with a cafe patisserie supermarket and places to eat a couple of minutes away Staff were brilliant helpful and friendly Room was spotlessly clean and modern beds comfortable and a good nights sleep Absolutely no complaints 
103335,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, I thought the hotel was closer to the Gare Lyon but if one has luggage and is tired it is definitely better to take the number 87 bus from Gare Lyon which will take you right across the street from the hotel There was also some construction going on across the street so this impacted the view but it wasn t too noisy , Great spot for an overnight to recover from a long flight from the US Nice room and lovely bathroom Staff were very helpful 
103336,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, Booking com advertised at the time we booked the hotel that it had free airport shuttle but they didn t they only call you a cab as their shuttle and it cost 54 Flat rate We requested early check in were inform when we arrived at noon that it will cost 40 if we wanted that , Clean and comfortable Very convenient location since it is right by the Dugommier metro station We didn t spend too much time in the hotel but the room had all the amenities we needed They also had free bag storage we took advantage of that when we couldn t check in early 
103337,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, Bedroom was tiny not a lot of room to move about Also very noisy, Nice hotel and brilliant location next to the metro station Staff very friendly and helpful
103338,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, We booked with breakfast but at the end we didn t have it because somehow the reservation was without breakfast very strange Maybe booking fault or the hotel we don t know The location is not that good to justify the price , Very clean and the photos really correspond to the description Staff is nice Next to the metro

103340,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, There was little to dislike about this hotel , A well located hotel very near the Metro and a few stops from the centre of Paris Very useful to exploit the Metro and the hotel is a couple of stops from main stations Excellent service and very friendly and capable staff 
103341,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, Nothing There was a metro station right outside we could not have asked for more Paris map provided on arrival It was much better than we were expecting , Bed was comfy we were on 5th floor and had good views room was like a boutique hotel it gave me that feel good factor when I walked in Staff spoke English and were very helpful and pleasant and caring We would go again

103344,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, The location is not very central although it wasn t a big issue using the metro Just not a very Paris y feel to be so far out Do not spend 14 on breakfast it wasn t very good very plain It s best to go to the bakery next door , Metro station right outside the hotel The room windows open which was really nice to get some fresh air Staff was very accommodating and helpful 
103345,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, Location size if the room were schokingly small Not impressed by the standard of the room Would not visit again, Decor of the room and shower room was nice and the staff
103346,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, Noise very thin walls other residents right next door to us although the hotel didn t have many people in had complained about the noise of our tv it was under the autmatic volume when the tv is turned on coffee machine didn t work telephone broken cup of old cigarettes hadn t been cleaned away from previous residents not much room to put clothes 15 Euros for a small pot of food that was apparently dinner from the menu was awful Was told off twice for high volume in the morning when we were reporting how bad our stay was the woman on the counter raised her voice and gave little advice empathy Not a nice stay this has made us not want to go to this hotel let alone Paris again , The bed was comfortable and gave us extra bits like shampoo shavers etc 
103347,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, The aircon is set for the whole building we would have prefered it to be adjustable as we wanted our room to be cooler , Reception staff very friendly helpful Clean modern bathrooms Excellent location for metro access 
103348,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, Extremely small bedroom I know this is Paris but it is also supposed to be a 4 star hotel Good if you are traveling solo with little luggage though , Cool design comfortable bed room full of light good view from the room 
103349,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, the location not easy to reach upon arrival without a taxi but once you are there the metro is just on the corner and even the bus stop , The Shower everything
103350,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, Rooms are very small but absolutely fine for short break 12 tube stops to Eiffel so a little out of the main attractions but only 13km from airport, Clean rooms big beds nice decor and right near tube station
103351,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209,No Negative, The rooms are quite small but perfectly fine for a short stay The staff are excellent and very helpful and the hotel is almost on top of the Metro so it is very easy to access tourist areas and railway stations There are a number of good restaurants as well as a boulangerie and great cheese shop close by

103357,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, Location is handy for catching trains nearby ie bercy and Gare de Lyon but not ideal location for a holiday , Excellent location to catch an early train from Bercy and 10 minutes in a cab to Bastille Hotel staff really friendly and efficient it is very modern and spotless 
103358,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, Room was on the corner so it was a little small possibly typical Paris though, Newly renovated rooms with good facilities great staff and noise sealed rooms 
103359,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, there is nothing to improve Keep up the great work , My fiance and I could not be happier about our hotel choice Location is fantastic it is a bit away from all the happenings but it is right by a metro station It seriously is only few steps away and Paris metro system is easy to use and gets you anywhere in no time Check in was great I am very sad I cannot remember the receptionist s name as she deserves a bonus for the service she provides She was tall slim young and black and truly terrific She helped us with all of our questions served us drinks after our long day of walking suggested a great restaurant for dinner and smiled whenever we passed by Room was fantastic It was small as any other hotel room in Paris but we did not mind at all The decoration and design made up for the space Beautiful TV comfortable bed FANTASTIC shower lots of storage it was simply great Also my now fiance proposed to me on our first night there so I am sure we shall be back one day Thank you guys for such a fantastic stay 
103360,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, One of the lights flickered in our room 702 but it was not actually a problem as we the day light was enough most of the time We found breakfast a little pricey , Staff were so kind and helpful and beds were so so comfy Just what we needed after full days of sightseeing 
103361,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, The poor soundproofing my neighbours had sex at 4 am and the noise woke me up impossible to go back to sleep after that Not so good for privacy too you better try to make things silently , Very clean and convenient nice room nice bed nice staff and good location

103364,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, Booking com did not actually book the room for us Luckily our room was available Booking Com failed to explain why they did not book it After 3 attempts by me to ask them , The staff were brilliant Very helpful and friendly Made our stay

103368,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, The hotel is not right in the heart of any particular sightseeing area but is close enough to all of them not to put me off going again The Paris metro makes everywhere accessible The hotel is perfect for the AccorArena which is what we needed , The staff here were so friendly and helpful it set us up and gave us extra confidence to roam around the city where we found people to be friendly too Not always the case in Paris The top floor rooms have a small balcony which made it better to look out over the busy streets Nice and quiet in the room though

103371,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, Too much air freshener made it difficult to breathe Naff decor light is the only reality slogan in each room Water pressure in shower not sufficient for washing hair you d have to use the handheld one and use the jet setting It s also really expensive 150 per night and 14 for breakfast , Clean with helpful staff

103375,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, Some rooms are a bit tight but still very good regarding the price performance Advise payments in Paris I did not know that a banknote of Euro 500 or even Euro 200 is a problem in Paris If you need to change the money not even the bank have change Use your credit card to pay or take maximum banknotes of Euro 50 with you , The welcome was warm and friendly We immediately felt at home During our stay the staff did everything to fulfill our needs The beds are very comfortable the shower fantastic and the T V is used as a mirror during daytime It is very clean and there is no noise to hear from the other rooms or from the street The Hotel is at a few steps to the M tro station Dugommier no need to take a cab The location of the Hotel is outstanding because the M tro stop Dugommier green line no 6 takes you directly to the Tour d Eiffel and has very good connections in order to go and see all the sights To sum it up very recommendable Enjoy your stay

103379,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, I was double charged from my credit card by the hotel One part should be used for pre authority however the hotel made it as real charge It takes long time to communicate with hotel via booking com and the problem has still been not solved , Clean and closed to Metro

103381,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, The hotel advertises to have soundproof rooms but in fact they aren t You can hear the TV from the rooms next to you and also the windows are regular which means you cannot shut out the sounds from the streets , The bed was very good the rooms nice and clean and a friendly helpful staff

103387,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, The hotel was very expensive considering it was not in the centre of Paris it was 25 stops on the metro and changing for me to meet my friends I was misinformed as to the location I had to pay 14 euros extra for breakfast which I thought was expensive and I was under the impression that this was included in the price , The staff were very friendly and helpful they helped me to find my way around Paris giving me directions
103388,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, We couldn t control the heating in the room had to have the windows open which resulted in a lot of traffic noise, The location Next door to the metro a short walk to Bercy
103389,Golden Tulip Bercy Gare de Lyon 209, The wifi at the hotel was very slow and I was also expecting the rooms to be a bit bigger than they actually were , I liked the one young greek member of staff at the front desk who upgraded us when we said we were on our honeymoon The location although right next to a metro station was far from any good restaurants and we spent quite a long time trying to find a decent place to eat
