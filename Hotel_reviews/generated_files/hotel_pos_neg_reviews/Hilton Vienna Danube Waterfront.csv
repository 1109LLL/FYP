337902,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront,No Negative, The Location is very nice but far from city center by walk Metro is a very good way to explore the city If you don t get a room with river view its better to get q hotel in the city center Breakfast was good but with limited meat options very comfy bed
337903,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The second day at the hotel was the start of the weekend and the staff were really busy during breakfast and it was hard to get anyone s attention At the time of registration it would be great if the staff gave us some brochures maps about the city as we did not receive any from the receptions staff , Loved the location as it gives easy access to the subway loved the breakfast on the first day and the how the staff would ask you if you would like a latte 
337904,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The in room facilitates namely the refreshment area a coffee machine nespresso or equivalent would be of benefit especially considering the star rating if the hotel , The location and the professionalism of the staff

337909,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, We prefer a walk in shower in stead of a shower in a bath tub , Terrace and pool next to the Danube River is a great experience every time again This time we also tried the bike rental option simply fun and easy Breakfast Among many other delicacies for example just an awesome selection of great bread Staff is very friendly even when extremely busy made us feel welcome every morning 
337910,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Menu a little limited if you need gluten free , Close to Ernst Happel Stadium for the concert we had pre booked Nice Danube waterfront location great for watching the river cruise ships go by visiting beach bars and restaurants on the Danube Island and visiting the Danube Tower TIP Visit the tower after 2pm to visit the cafe without a reservation and watch people bungee off the tower whilst you relax with a white wine spritzer Tea and coffee making facilities in the room Great surf and turf meal in the restaurant Small but adequate pool area which is in complete shade in the afternoon This was great for us as it was very hot during our stay in June Great view from our water view room We chose water view as people had commented on train noise on the city side of the hotel 
337911,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, location was a little far from the city centre but nevertheless it is a superb place to stay who want to relax and be away from the city hustle bustle Via the underground trains city centre is just 10 mins away , Super friendly and helpful staff Room was superb and huge Breakfast was lavish A excellent promenade at the danube waterfront where we walked and had a superb time Enjoyable stay overall 
337912,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, No wifi in rooms It s 10euros a day which is daylight robbery Considering how much the room cost Pool on wrong side of hotel always in shade Poorly designed expensive bar prices , The bed
337913,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Too expensive for what it provided Not that clean , We were in town for just a day for a concert in Ernst Happel Stadium The location was close to the stadium not that close to the center by the metro though

337917,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Staff is generally arrogant not helpful don t want even to think or discuss anything that they were not trained for Also hotel has no concierge People at reception try to do their job but they do a very poor one In fact if u ask them they try to get rid of u asap They make you feel that your inquiry is waisting their time Few times they made me feel not welcome, Location cleanliness
337918,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Wifi drops off frequently Need to be Hilton member to get free wifi That s a joke in today s age Room amenities are spartan for a Hilton hotel Booked this well in advance and asked for connecting or adjacent rooms and best I got was on the same floor a full passage away Room has no view at all looking into a driveway compared to the River view in the pictures Guess you have to pay for an upgrade to one with view , Big rooms Nice breakfast spread Staff allowed u to bring the breakfast to room which was good Good gym Near the metro View along the river was nice Provided u get a river view room 
337919,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The Wi Fi is not free in 21st century Very bad experience surprisingly bad for the Hilton They messed up my reservation they confirmed twice that the breakfast was included The next day while having breakfast they came three times to discuss the confusion that they messed up the night before they gave us again another information which at this point I asked in writing because it was twice that already told me something that it was not true and they redirected me to reception where they gave me a third version I m coming for business to a hotel where I expect that at least staff is professional next time I ll take my business elsewhere , The room was big
337920,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, paid wifi as in all hilton hotels train line next to hotel which might be noise if you get the non river side room , clean rooms comfortable beds good location close to p r and metro

337924,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, no free wifi in the rooms no bathroom slippers either Also we were taking an international flight out of vienna and made a special request for a weighing scale to chk if our bags were within the limit we had to wait a long time to be told that there wasnt one , the breakfast was great and the room was comfortable
337925,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The huge size of the hotel implies a higher standard of the fitness which includes bigger and more fashionable spa facilities I hope you could work on that , The terrace and walking on the riverside 
337926,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, I chose it because of the pool but it was outside not heated and not open Also there was constantly doors banging in the corridor from about 7am every morning , Very comfortable room good food lots of space 
337927,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The internet was bad They advertise they have free internet though it was not Had to pay for it and still it was very bad and slow , The location next to the river is very nice the building is nice and modern and clean Romana at the front desk was super super helpful and really was very nice She helped us plan our day and gave us excellent tourist advice all with a smile 
337928,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The noise coming from the other rooms the cleaning staff didn t vacuum the floor daily , The size of the room and the location is nice for a romantic getaway
337929,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Neighborhood was not great needed subway for everything , Spacious room we paid extra for river view Neighborhood had few dining choices and hotel caf was expensive but decent food Subway a 10 minute walk 
337930,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Breakfast food and area was not up to the level of Hilton , The Location was very good we had a waterfront room and we could see the Donau river The room had a double bed so for our kid was optimum 
337931,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront,No Negative, Large room with large bathroom Perfect view from room window of Danube river and shore Very good breakfast buffet with large assortment Near metro stations and shops Quiet neighborhood Good surroundings 
337932,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, No wifi free at the room They charged the credit card for additional fee but not the room fee at the time we checked in but charged later when we checked out and were going to the the airport It s a waste of time to charge the credit card when checking out ,No Positive
337933,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, First parking is not free as written Second 500 was withdrawn two days after leaving the hotel without giving reasons Third Wi Fi is not free Fourth A room was requested for smokers and was approved and after half an hour of registration we were told that the room is not for smokers and then gave us a smoking violation of 100 euros ,No Positive
337934,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The hotel is not close to any of the famous and good places in Vienna I have been in other hotels and they were better One side of hotel is on the river which is nice The other side to facing the main road and the train Noise I was carrying the bags and my wife was carrying a sleeping daughter while my other daughter were with us as well No one helped us at least carrying the bags There is no place in the world were WIFI is still not free , The hotel has Gym and cafe on the river side 
337935,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, We didn t like that we had only one night , We loved the view of the Danube the breakfast buffet the comfortable beds and fluffy pillows power outlets everywhere free wifi for Hilton Members everything we needed 
337936,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, mattress should be an upscale serta with topper parking was hugely expensive and with no available slots so we got from outside a parking fine during the weekend plus the parking 42 euros the requests in the b com reservation were totally ignored and they ve tried to downgrade us by mistake , location quiet room size
337937,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, It seems to be a little off center location so you need to walk a bit or find public transport to get to the city , Very nice room and great breakfast Nice view over the river 
337938,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, My only negative point was the distance to the city centre Although public transport was fairly nearby , Helpful staff clean and tidy always good views onto the river
337939,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The location is away from the centers of interest in Vienna The location on the Danube was great but the Danube isn t especially pretty at least at this location Public transportation is convenient and got me everywhere I wanted to go quickly and easily It s a modern feeling hotel that could be many places in the world In Vienna that can be a negative as it doesn t give you the feel of the city , I liked everything about the Hotel itself The restaurant was much better than I expected I didn t use the health club but there is one 
337940,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The level of comfort did not correspond with the magnitude of price increase for executive room BESIDES the hotel charges extra for wi fi in a room The extra charge was waived for me only because I fainted at the reception when they informed me , Rich breakfast is served on a bottom floor with nice view of Danube 
337941,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Wifi is not included in the room rate There is an extra charge for it which I was unaware of and it was not mentioned when checking in I m aware that it s free in the lobby and bar but for me it should be included with the room I have no interest in going down and sitting in the lobby just so I can access the hotel wifi , Breakfast is excellent I can not fault it 
337942,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Gym was a little stuffy, Hugh room fantastic breakfast Easy to get to from the airport via the overground train U2 If you like walking the U1 is over 30 mins away 
337943,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, I have been waited more than 40 mins in the restaurant for my dinner I was really starving and I believed that if you have a group of people need to serve before me you should let me know i will decide if i need to stay or not since it s far from city there is no place to eat during the evening time secondly the room is big but cold i would say , Hilton standard room clean and big 
337944,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Please have copies of the mini maps to get to the train station we got lost first time , Breakfast was good as per Hilton standards Staff were very helpful and friendly Loved the local food added to thr breakfast it was really interesting and we would never had tried it otherwise 
337945,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, It was cold in the room heating didnt work We called twice to the reception and they didnt bring any heater Staff was very rude and arrogant We will never stay at Hilton Hotels ,No Positive
337946,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, No Wi fi in hotel rooms only in lobby , Room was clean spacious fixtures to a high standard with large comfy beds lighting gave a nice mood in the room where there was a mini bar fridge and coffee making facilities Bathroom bright and spotless with usual toiletries Our room had river view which was lovely Staff friendly efficient we were given vouchers on arrival for a free drink in the restaurant which was a relaxing place with a good atmosphere excellent food and reasonably priced I would recommend it Arriving at Vienna Airport get the Bus from Stop 9 outside for just over 2 Euro s it s 20 minutes to Stadion this is the circular shopping mall and 5 minutes walk to hotel look out for signposts for Hilton This hotel is a bit out of the centre but the train station is only a 5 minute walk and trains seem to run at 8 minute intervals If going to the Opera or theatre don t stress about getting too dressed up smart casual is fine though jeans and trainers were apparent Overall Vienna was a fabulous experience 
337947,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The bathroom was small and they told me if there s a water in the floor i have to pay so it s a bathroom there has to be water and tge employees are bad they don t smile i hate everything sorry but it was the worst hotel i have ever seen,No Positive
337948,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, You have to pay for wifi which is a bit strange for a business hotel which charges already a lot for a room in my opinion , Good location and nice facilities fitness pool and bar Rooms are very spacious and beds very comfy
337949,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Parking is extra 21e 24h Wifi in the room is extra 10e 24h Breakfast is rather expensive if not included into room price 26e The rest was excellent, Great comfortable hotel with excellent river view and friendly staff
337950,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Sauna working hours would expect to work till midnight Was missing room cleaning on Sunday with new towels Air conditioner was blowing almost cold air when set to maximum 30c , Great hotel close to underground and highway 
337951,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront,No Negative, Very welcoming staff Wonderful breakfast Convenient location for airport via nearby shuttle bus and quick access to the city centre via train Quiet at night 
337952,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, AC cannot be set lower than 19 deg Too hot during the night Restaurant not son good and pretty expensive, Room space room design hotel location Very good breakfast
337953,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The location Quite a walk to the U Bahn especially in the middle of winter and right next to a freight train line though to be fair you could barely hear the train from the room even with the non river view rooms we had No free in room Wi Fi is ridiculous , The room was a good size and well appointed The lounge area which opens onto the Danube was very nice and the courtyard area covered in snow was beautiful 
337954,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, No free wifi in the rooms Parking is very expensive however public parking is at the other side of the street Wellness is very small but nice Overally I had no really bad experiences , Big room modern but still elegant interior Very nice staff and FABULOUS breakfast at the waterfront restaurant Very good price too 
337955,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Coffee Cups in the Bar were too small I didn t like the cream in the bedroom tea coffee facilities as would have preferred milk Much too rich , Loved bar area and the Mulled Wine was great Quick breakfast was good value for money Club Sandwich was excellent Bar staff were friendly and helpful 
337956,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, No free internet on room is bad And the 10 day internet was awful Very bad , Breakfast very good And being close walking distance to a metro and an intarnational bus station in a small shopping is very good 
337957,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The fact that you have to pay 70euro night as a safety deposit and you have to pay for the internet to use it in the room Also you have to pay 21euro for parking even if it s an outdoor parking , We booked a room with a view towards the Danube which was excellent Staff was very kind breakfast was great nice room design general ambiance was very good 
337958,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, A bit far from shopping area No eateries nearby for tourist to taste authentic Austrian fare , Great Breakfast Fantastic view of the danube river Spacious room Good for relaxation after all the tours n shopping in Vienna 
337959,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, No free wifi in the room I cannot believe Hilton Hotel does not provide free internet in the room while in a smallest hostel bar even in the street you can have free wifi , Luxury and spacious room 
337960,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Incidentally my wife who was accompanying me considered the location off putting because of its being located on the outskirts of the main town without any shopping opportunity close at hand , Location beyond imagination 
337961,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront,No Negative, Near public transportation great breakfast rooms are very clean and quiet stuff it s very friendly and they help you with anything you need In our case they told us every Christmas Market in the city where there are how big they are and so on I recommend this hotel if you want to have a pleasant stay in Wien 
337962,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Wi fi did not work even in the public areas Besides this is an outdated concept to have no access in the rooms except for frequent travelers or for extra payment and just two computers in the lobby This is so serious a shortcoming that next time we will consider going elsewhere and we have been coming here for four years , The room was excellent an upgrade to what we usually get Breakfast is perfect staff friendly fast and helpful Location is very good with good parking and public transport connection 
337963,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The WiFi room service not granted diminishes the prestige of such a beautiful hotel To pay more attention to detail becomes important in this context a stupid trifle can drastically affects the liveability of this fantastic hotel, Everything was perfect Best professionalism and courtesy showed by all staff members Warm environment and friendly atmosphere 
337964,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The wifi was extra charge parking places were outside they do not have a garage and the price for it was very big too big They need to improve a lot The price is too high for what they offer Comparing to other hotels in Wien it is not the place to go ,No Positive
337965,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Windows did not provide adequate sound insulation against exterior I found scratched my car in the hotel s private parking I asked to see the room records their answer was only the manager has access to recoreded pictures This was to arrive after 10am ,No Positive
337966,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The only slight negative was the beds were a little too firm for our liking, We find this hotel an excellent base to visit city centre with the underground only 300metres away the staff are very helpful and welcoming food is of a high standard I would reccomend this hotel to anybody looking for either a city break or longer stay
337967,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, the only point is the front desk agents tow agents were really rude the others were really kind but it s still a great service , very nice view big rooms breakfast was great and the bed was super comfort 
337968,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Huge room very cold I had to sleep with my sweater on even though the AC was on 30 degrees and running all night with the noise disturbance and all the inconvenience One of the few hotel where I have ever been and they do not have free wifi I had to pay 25 euro for 24 hours and the connection was dropping every 10 minutes garbage can in the restroom was broken I ordered room service and the soup had so much salt that I could only eat half of it and they charge extra 5 5 euro for room service , Food at dinner and staff being polite
337969,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The room allocated to me was not facing the riverfront which would be fine except it was unbearably noisy in the night due to passing traffic on the road and trains on the tracks next to the road I could not sleep for 2 nights and though I was shifted to a riverfront side room upon request I had to pay 20 Euros night extra If I had known about this problem before I would have chosen either the quieter room upfront or gone elsewhere , Helpful staff eg provided me a power adapter for the duration of stay as I had forgotten mine changed my room a few days into the stay upon my request had a late night service for food etc 
337970,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Its distance from the city center , The location of my room was on the Danube river and it was nice seeing the ships pass by I also liked the everyday walk that I did a long the river side while on the other side I could see the woods on the river island 
337971,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Location is too far from the city Costly breakfast Cleaners started cleaning rooms next door at 7 30am , Bar area is well set out Room was spacious and very clean 
337972,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Our room was facing the street and it was really noisy as the windows weren t good at all We also had water stains all over the roof So this was a really expencive hotel as the room was outdated and not in the status you woul expect from a hilton , The hotel is located right beside the River what gives it a nice touch The bed was good and the extras were nice too 
337973,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Free wifi in the bedroom, The room was very comfortable spacious and clean All the staff were polite friendly and helpful The hotel may not be in the City centre but a station is accessible 10 mins and the walk along the river is interesting and pleasant 
337974,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Nothing it was a really nice hotel very clean oh the one thing was that staying on the second floor the maid arrived to early for our liking, The proximity to the football ground the Ernst Happel stadium
337975,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Sink in bathroom would not empty had to jiggle the handle quite a few times before sink plug would release , Excellent location 5 minute walk to shopping centre Super clean friendly staff
337976,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Didn t like having to pay extra for Wi Fi in the room Nowadays it s a basic facility which should be included in the price I know I could have had it for free if I d signed up to Hilton rewards but I object to getting endless spam from all companies who want your email address It renders email unmanageable , Nice view of the Danube Great breakfast room with terrific breakfast Good bar meals 
337977,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Think our Room was used by a smoker before we got there bad news really For a family with children smelly, Close to football ground lovely view of river a nice Bar too
337978,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, No proper shower only bath tub with shower curtain very old fashion Waiter in the evening had very strong body odor Pasta dish was completely over cooked, Queen side beds Window which opens Location close to ship embarkation
337979,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Had issues with the room air conditioner but the staff couldn t help us except giving us portable AC Breakfast was expensive local breakfast much economic with great variety, Location of the hotel was good 
337980,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, 2 irons and a phone that didn t work and an ineffective air conditioner that was set at 17 degrees and we were still sweating all night It was cooler in the hallway outsid Our room was like an oven Having to pay for Wifi in your room is ludicrous It is obviously another way of ripping off the customer Hilton should be ashamed The location was so far out of town and no shuttle to the city or airport was provided It was also a distance to the bus or train and in the rain uncomfortable There were no restaurants or pubs close by so Hilton have you trapped with their very high prices unless you want to spend lots of money getting taxis We won t be sting at the Hilton again in Vienna , The breakfast was good The seating area beside the river was beautiful and relaxing after a day travelling 
337981,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The staff were a bit rude What we paied for the room was way too expensive for what we got delux double room with river view our room was on the first floor and we can hear the voices of ppl laughing and talking in the morning during breakfast because the view we had was stright on top of the restaurant The gym is very small And the late night food menu was ridiculous We ordered a bean dip they had with tortilla chips and when they brought it to our room the dip was with out the tortillas and when we asked about them the lady said that they ran out of tortillas so she brought the dip alone The menu had almost 4 or 5 dishes total And thats a 5 star hotel , The view was good Not too far from city center a metro station 5 min walking from the hotel 
337982,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Access to the city was a little disappointing I am not keen on travelling by myself on underground trains in the evening in cities new to me A shuttle with several set pick up times would be wonderful More tourist information and brochures would also be helpful , Rooms were excellent staff were helpful 
337983,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The sauna is a joke only 70C no changing rooms There were hairs on my bed and they weren t mine Im the bathroom the front part of the counter had fallen off No free wifi, nice to be on the waterfront
337984,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The jakusi no idea how to spell this was only filled with cold water And it was a bit hard to find things at the breakfast and I thought there could have been more variety , The service the room etc was really nice 
337985,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, I prefer to have freshly baked eggs omelet For 25 EUR I would expect a cook that is making fresh eggs, Large room very convenient office space and a GREAT view 
337986,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront,No Negative, The breakfast was good and so nice people in front desk I would say thank you very much for the one who I did the check in with her for the positive energy and for answering all my questions with happy and smiley face
337987,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, No free Wifi on rooms Expensive car parking place is near the hotel but price is indicated here on booking com site so no actual complain in this matter , Clean huge rooms even from room there was nice view to Doonau It was my second visit to Hilton hotel chain and everything was as expected overall good experience Also very nice to sit and relax outside terrasse with view to Doonau river Overall if traveling by car nice quiet hotel to stay day or two away from city center 
337988,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront,No Negative, The location is excellent and close to train station about 5 Minutes walk the room is very big and bath room is of good size toiletries are of good quality and Breakfast is very lavish

337991,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, That there was no free Wi Fi in the room which is quite the norm these days , Very nice property Being by the River added to its charm It was beautiful and peaceful The staff was friendly and helpful Ms Senela at the front desk who checked us in was just wonderful She was the first interaction we had with the property and her extremely pleasant and smiling demeanour started our trip on just the right note The breakfast buffet was good with a lot of variety Overall a great experience 
337992,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The beds were terribly hard and I had to move to another hotel The price is very cheap but breakfast was not included and was very expensive 26 Euros per person including children Parking at the hotel was extremely expensive and there was nowhere to park nearby, The setting by the Danube is lovely the staff was very kind and helpful
337993,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Bed was very hard Outdoor Pool is completely in the shade in the afternoon and was very chilly despite the hot weather No playground for kids available , Great service and food Complaints are handled professionally and quickly 
337994,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The toilet brush had some brown bits on it on arrival I am very sensitive The bathroom met towel had stains on it though it was clean The cleaning on saturday was more thorough than for friday , The bed extra comfy The safe for my valuables Iron and iron board in place

337998,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, If you don t like the noise of the trains choose Another hotel , This hotel is a couple of minutes outside Vienna city center by subway you pass Pratern on your way with the subway We took the airport train into Wien Mitte and changed to subway Wien Mitte has a shopping center and places to eat Hilton Danube Waterfront is right at edge of Donau It is a large hotel which has a pool outside The pool is not heat at all so it can get cold Gym are inside and you can run along the river We had access to the Lounge on the top floor so we had our breakfast there If I compare the Lounge in Prague to this one the one Prague is so much better This lounge has not so much snacks or drinks I didn t pay this stay at the hotel myself but if I stay here again I will not pay extra for the Lounge it is not worth the money It is a good hotel The subway into the city center is fast Large rooms and you can easily take a walk along the river You can also walk to Pratern or take the subway two stations We had a view into the neighborhood so no river view One thing to hold in mind there is a train track just outside There are trains coming at all times If you have trouble sleeping or don t like any noise at all You should choose another hotel I didn t mind I can sleep anyway Big bed nice with a lot of pillows You can make yourself coffee or tea A small refrigerator is in the room A safety box is in the closet Just across the road over the bridge there is a grocery store Have in mind that many shops are closed on Sundays We preferred to take the other exit from the subway not the one to the stadium The other exit is a bit closer At the subway station there are a big sign to the hotel but then you are going the stadium way So take the other exit the unmarked one There are sign when cross the street Would I stay here again Not if we are only are two persons it suits a large travel company better 
337999,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Breakfast could be more varied as the same most days Also they ran out of some items quite early in service and did not replace some Pool should be heated in a country like Austria and there was no shower or proper change area by the pool , Lovely spot by river Quiet yet close to transport and shopping center Lovely hotel overall and friendly staff 
338000,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, There isn t any FREE Wifi service in the rooms only at public places in the hotel The bed sheet took 3 4 days to be changed out of our 5 days stay Housekeeping of the room is unacceptable Some staff reception were moody and hard to talk to When I asked to remove the mini bar Stuff as it contain some stuff I don t want my children to see such as alcoholic stuff they asked me to pay extra money to only removing the mining bar stuff from the ROOM The air conditioning in the room was crazy as it was sometime hot all of a sudden and some time good although it was the same temperature set We got only one tiny soap bar for the whole stay of 5 days to wash our hands although we were four person with double beds room , The location of the hotel and its proximity to the Airport underground station and the Mall Although they have a small GYM however it is nice with a wonderful view
338001,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Free wifi not available at the room We had to go to downstair lobby for wifi internet connection This we felt was strange for a modern Hilton Hotel Even basic 3 star hotels in Austria had excellent wifi free of charge in rooms Also little bit of walking abt 600 m to closest underground station, Comfortable beds Tea coffe making facility Modern bathromms with toiletteries changed and cleaned every day

338013,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, It would be nice to have Wifi included in the room price The advertised free internet in all public areas did not have a strong enough signal to reach parts of the restaurant and some other areas I would have preferred to access it from my room but the cost was prohibitively high , I loved my stay at this beautifully located hotel on the Danube River As a solo traveller I felt perfectly safe and very welcome The food in both the bar and restaurant was unusually good and I chose to have almost all of my meals there The king sized riverfront room was huge and comfortable A bonus was the enormous window that opened wide so that there was a sense of having a balcony It was interesting to watch all of the river traffic going by including many river cruises I also loved the pool 
338014,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Far away from the city center Breakfast to expensive 26 euro Parking cost 21 euro per day No free wi fi at the room Air condition in lobby did not work, The room size The location on the danube river The price

338023,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The location is kind of out from the main train station but once you figure things out and get your bearings getting around is not difficult , The room was clean spacious and faced the Danube The bathroom facilities and towels were great Staff was very professional and made every effort to make our stay comfortable giving directions and providing other amenities Had they not been full they would have allowed us to check in early however they did store our luggage so we could go out and explore Vienna during the day We ate dinner in the bar that evening but they also have a restaurant on site If I were able to visit Vienna again I would not hesitate to go back Compared to other hotels we stayed at during our trip it was an excellent value for the money 
338024,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Only minus is no free internet in the rooms, Great breakfast friendly polite efficient staff on reception and in the restaurant bar area The location is perfect for town and relaxing after sightseeing 
338025,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Some bee in the outdoor facility during our breakfast bothering us while enjoying breakfast we end up transferring inside to get away from those bees Other than that everything s excellent , Great river view and delicious breakfast our teenagers loved the gym and the swimming pool Very relaxing time in the executive lounge Highly recommended 
338026,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, we didn t have breakfast included and it appeared to be quite costly as well as parking but it s a normal thing for Vienna wifi in the rooms is also only for additional pay , Everything was very comfortable Very big room staff was very welcoming since we were booking few hours before the arrival because of some problems with other location it was a very significant reduction off the initial price Not in the center but U station is nearby with a direct line to Opera 
338027,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, No free WiFi in room which is a bit if a liberty considering the price Location isn t central but taxis are reasonable except the one the receptionist organised that was almost 5 times the amount of all the others we had over the 3 days Staff also very slow to stop other guests standing having loud conversations in the hallway late at night , Majority of staff were friendly and the place is immaculate Beautiful location on the river and great facilities Waterfront rooms were spacious Food was delicious

338031,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The only thing I would have liked was if breakfast was included It was not and it was expensive , My cousin and I arrived at the hotel early in the morning thinking we would have to just leave our bags and wait for check in time until later but when we arrived they told me our room was ready At 9am The staff was friendly Room was big and clean Loved the view from the room When we were checking out we needed a taxi to bring us to the airport I called the front desk and she had a taxi there for us in 5 minutes I would stay here again if I ever get the opportunity to go back to Austria 
338032,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Distance from the underground But if you are not in hurry then I recommend the 30 minute walk to U1 stop Very enjoyable, Very nice location on the waterfront but not practical if the meetings are elsewhere as the closest U line is at 30 minute walk from the hotel Otherwise excellent hotel 
338033,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront,No Negative, What extra can I say about this Hilton Hotel It was superb The rooms tastefully decorated with all the space and storage you could want the bathroom facility beautifully done and so clean the bar and the breakfast dining area just perfect Not located right in the centre of Vienna is within easy access to the underground system that know where is out of reach The bi lingual staff were so friendly and helpful I would hesitate to use the term staff they were more like your best friend The breakfast was quite stunning a massive amount of choice and so beautifully presented Unbeatable Breakfast outside right alongside the Danube on a warm summers morning was something to be experienced I know that in the Hilton hotels you get what you pay for but as far as some Hiltons are concerned this was very affordable and reasonably priced It is hard to imagine somewhere better A footnote to the people who work at this Hilton Thank you for making our stay so comfortable and memorable It didn t go unnoticed
338034,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Free WiFi not available in the bedrooms , The beds are so comfy The breakfast was wonderful never ending and what a gorgeous view whilst eating breakfast over looking the Danube 
338035,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, Maybe the bathroom could have more hooks and or towel bars Otherwise no complaints except that they took too long to release the pre authorized payment from my bankcard when I used a different card to pay at checkout , Staff friendly helpful Breakfast buffet was good value with the variety of choices Location by Danube nice but not convenient in terms of access to center of Vienna Spa service was good

338068,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The informations from the reception about the hotel policies rooms upgrade free internet they were never the same Different people were giving different informations Also the firstt night we had a cold room so they brought us a heater and extra blankets and they ensure us that there was not a problem with the air condition The next day we changed room and there was not any problem , The location was very good close to the metro station only few stops from the central The waterfront rooms have an excellent view to the river The room is very large and the queen beds big enough for 2 persons each The madnesses and the pillows very comfortable 
338069,Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront, The Club Lounge lighting we thought was inadequate With a location on the banks of the Danube getting to the city centre was time consuming however there is a nice little store on the way to the train station and a good sized shopping centre nearby also As our tour left from this hotel we stayed there A more central hotel may have been chosen had we not been going on a tour , A comfortable hotel with nice staff and we got a nice gift of cake and chocolates as it was our wedding anniversary Nice views of the Danube and its traffic
