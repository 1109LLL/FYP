492890,Milan Suite Hotel, It was under renovation and the non renovated rooms were not properly maintained door lock missing shower glass partition unstable Also the dark fire escape stairway and its unsurveiled access to the street in a not so safe area caused concern One night we even had someone trying to get into our room guest worker lost soul Who knows , Very modern Well equipped Location is not too far from center Staff were very helpful Breakfast was very respectable Rooms amd bathrooms were very comfortable Good value gor money
492891,Milan Suite Hotel, The duvet cover does not hold the inner duvet since the cover doesn t have any zippers it keeps its openings So the inner duvet is partly or whole in the end exposed I slept with a duvet without the cover during the night Very bothering , It was very clean and very spacious Staff are very friendly and professional They offer a slipper which make you more comfortable TV is just huge 
492892,Milan Suite Hotel, There were a few rough edges in the room Like chipped paint marks all over the walls Stains on the carpet and dirt surrounding the air con unit The room had a massive smart TV but with no Netflix app And no function to download said app It only became annoying because the only English channels were 24hr News cycles or Asian documentaries , The room size It was massive Pretty much our own little apartment Large private terrace was great too Massive bathroom with a choice of big shower or bath too Microwave in the room plus a fully stocked mini fridge A fantastic addition was the pocket routers they offer so you can use free wifi on the go in the city and avoid roaming charges Plus they offer a whatsapp concierge so if you get lost you can just send them a text All for free Amazing idea 
492893,Milan Suite Hotel, Expensive breakfast better and cheaper available nearby , Very comfortable business style apartments Large rooms with most facilities of a large hotel no swimming pool nor spa Good location with easy travel to Duomo and Brera district Freindly and helpful staff 
492894,Milan Suite Hotel, Bathroom facility maintenance, Both hotel staff and restaurant staff provided helpful friendly and quality service Hotel and room we stayed are nicely designed 
492895,Milan Suite Hotel, It is not problem of hotel it is problem of Milano In the evenings everywhere is full of mosquito Hold some medicine with you for the bites , I spent one week in this hotel for a technical conference in Politechnico di Milano Location of hotel is very good and you can transfer hotel by train from Malpensa airport You should get off from the train in Bovisa station and you can reach hotel by walk only in 20 minutes ticket price is 13 Euro Hotel is very close to bus station metro and tramvay You can buy tickets from hotel In bus station you can still use wireless Staff is very kind and helpful Rooms are quite large and everything you need is in the room even a microwave Breakfast was perfect You can drink freshly squeezed orange juice as much as you want I will visit this hotel if i come to Milano again 
492896,Milan Suite Hotel, really poor WIFI connection all rooms have Samsung TV so if you have Samsung phone you have the facility to mirror your screen but due to bad wifi it never works really bad WIFI No TV channels are in English so your stuck with BBC NEWS NO facility to change Audio, Nice hotel with really nice comfy beds
492897,Milan Suite Hotel,No Negative, This is an excellent hotel Rooms are very comfortable and well appointed Breakfast provides the largest variety of options that I ve experienced at any hotel with a large selection of breads meat cheese eggs fruit Staff are very helpful We are staying here multiple times while in and out of Milan and highly recommend it 
492898,Milan Suite Hotel,No Negative, The room was really comfortable and the bed was amazing It was about a 7 minute walk from the train station and it was super easy to get around the citywith a bus stop a minute from the hotel The receptionist was really friendly she always greeted me with a smile and she was very helpful 
492899,Milan Suite Hotel, It is not far to the city center but you have to take a bus get there , The room was spacious and beautiful The balcony was very charming it was very nice to spend time there The bed was very comfortable Late checkout was no problem The stuff was helpful and polite 
492900,Milan Suite Hotel, WiFi was terrible room hadn t been cleaned completely found used tissues in the microwave Nothing to watch on TV , Room was very big great for the price Bathroom was enormous really nice bath tub Breakfast was wonderful 
492901,Milan Suite Hotel, The location is slightly far away from the center takes about 20mins with a bus , Beautiful rooms amazing staff clean and mesmerizing Me and my partner went just for 1 night we chose the naked room hydromassage shower option That shower just relaxes you beyond my skill set for english Me and my partner are already discussing to go back 
492902,Milan Suite Hotel, It did take some time to check in as they could only process one customer at a time so on the way in and out we had to wait 5 10 mins each time Not a major issue though , Staff were great room was much more spacious and luxurious than we expected for the price I forgot my phone at reception and they dropped it up to my room immediately which we so appreciated Sweets and bottled water at the reception was a nice touch too The rooms all feel very private and the bathrooms are huge 
492903,Milan Suite Hotel, Carpet in the room was stained room was large but an odd layout Breakfast was just ok , Good location secure underground parking and convenient to public transport 
492904,Milan Suite Hotel, Location is shocking far from everything took ages and cost a lot of money to get places in taxis paid for garden room pretty poor only had one sun lounger so meant only one person could sit out so we moved room to get put in a room with two single beds shoved together so ended up moving to another room which had ants, Room was nice and big
492905,Milan Suite Hotel,No Negative, The room we had a junior suite was very spacious for lounging around Breakfast was most enjoyable Staff were very helpful for getting around to things 
492906,Milan Suite Hotel, Location I found this hotel a bit off from the central location , The room we stayed is really big and well equipped They are very generous in offering you ample spaces both in private and public area Parking is safe and very convenient The thing I like most was the breakfast which offered great variety of quality food bread fruits and freshly squeezed orange juice It was so refreshing 
492907,Milan Suite Hotel, Soft mattresses synthetic pillows Strong feeling that all in this hotel made and brought from China Staff was unprofessional not to inform about important events in town As a result we stuck in traffic because of marathon in centre of city , Spacious rooms and quiet place Newly build parking space with high security But need to wait until the gate is open Kind staff 
492908,Milan Suite Hotel, The breakfast was simple but for 20e per head could have been better The cooked items were not great but there was a good selection of fruit and cold meats , This is a very nice clean modern hotel in a quiet neighbourhood L immajine restaurant is a short work away and is ranked 16th in the city The food and service there were the best we had during our stay The bus stops outside and take about 20 mins to get into town 
492909,Milan Suite Hotel, The location of the hotel was far from everything it does say it s only 600m away from the railway station but it s not was much further than that had to take a taxi most of the time to reach Milan Centrale station in order not to miss our trains but there was a bus station nearby was convenient for getting to the duomo And the room we originally booked was the normal junior suite we arrived late to the hotel and were so tired and just wanted to go straight to bed and the surprise was when we pulled the duvet and found a very large stain in the centre of the bed it was horrifying We upgraded our room the very next day although it would ve been a nice gesture if the hotel had offered to do it for us as a courtesy , The staff were really friendly especially the lady at the reception I think her name was Eren not sure The garden view room was really nice as they were new additions to the hotel so it had a nice modern and relaxing atmosphere and the interior was very well thought of Also since the rooms were new they were clean and not worn out We also liked that they offered free portable wifi devices which were very convenient when we were out and about such a good idea 
492910,Milan Suite Hotel,No Negative, Excellent hotel The hotel itself is perfect nice modern big room big tv big bathroom just perfect With one bus that stops in front of the hotel you get right into the centre of Milan We will definitely stay again 
492911,Milan Suite Hotel, The location of the hotel is quite far from everything such as restaurants and train station , The room size is large and comfortable The bathroom is spacious with good facilities 
492912,Milan Suite Hotel, We didn t come across really any shops or restaurants near the hotel but the hotel bar was well priced from what we could see , Free upgrade upon arrival and the room was unbelievable The staff were some of the most helpful and most friendly I ve come across and the late checkout was a welcome addition One bus to the very centre of town right outside the door 
492913,Milan Suite Hotel, Multi channel tv the English channels were very limited and left a bit to be desired But we only stayed in for one night out of the five so not a great issue , Very friendly staff room well appointed and beautifully clean We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would certainly recommend this hotel The bottle of wine and chocolates left by the hotel for my birthday was a lovely surprise thank you 
492914,Milan Suite Hotel, Despite a top floor location our suite could hear traffic noise from the street below , Extremely helpful multilingual staff who gave great advice for travel within Milan Suite was very well organized and equipped and the 57 bus into the city center could be taken from just outside the hotel door 
492915,Milan Suite Hotel, the only thing its far from the duomo and the shopping area if you have a car or you use the subway its the perfect place to stay, everything is amazing soo clean good staff service is amazing and the price is very good
492916,Milan Suite Hotel, Nothing everything was great , Beautiful hotel Very big warm and nice rooms The bathroom is the largest we ve ever had The room we stayed was cleaned every day The staff was very friendly and helpful The bus stop is just outside the hotel and takes about 20 minutes to go to milan center We will stay there again 
492917,Milan Suite Hotel, It is a bit out of town but close enough to everything Bathrooms are a bit cold as the heating is a bit weak when the weather is cold and humid , Very large rooms and great design Asian alike comfort and quality in Milan I have tried a bit all types of rooms on each floor and they are all good

492924,Milan Suite Hotel, WiFi signal was week in the rooms but strong in the lobby The carpet in the rooms was dirty a little bit and needs to be changed The location was in a very quite area No swimming pool , We had one suit room which was large enough 70 m2 very good for family with old kids Also we had one jonior room 40 m2 which was good for family with young kids but extra charges will be paied for an extra bed The bus stop every 10 mins bus 57 is very close which can be used to go to the city center easily within 25 30 mins to Cairoli station You may buy the bus and train tickets from the hotel reception The AC was very good Supermarket was very close Halal Resturants are located 200 to 300 meters from the hotel but with very limited choices 
492925,Milan Suite Hotel,No Negative, It was a pleasure to stay at the Milan Suite Hotel We liked the design of the Hotel our room the staff members Can recommend it to everyone who searches for a hotel in Milano 
492926,Milan Suite Hotel, Many things The hotel need a great work to make it suitable to welcome the guests Our two rooms have stains in floor wall and almost every where From the room to the bathroom through the corridor I asked for extra cover they brought a used dirty one The housekeeper never vacuumed our two rooms in our 4 night stay We cut our stay in the hotel because of the dirty and un clean situation They charged us for cutting our stay one night even though they admitted about our complains , The size of the room

492939,Milan Suite Hotel, There was no view from the windows and if you dont have a car location is not the best that you can find It is only 15 20 min drive from downtown though, We were upgraded to the larger suite and it was absolutely amazing Spacious clean modern it makes you want to stay in the room
