445561,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, Only thing I didn t like that water kept changing temperature in the shower, Staff was really friendly room was clean Location was great very quite 5 min away from Schonbrunn palace and 10 min from city centre with metro 
445562,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, Centre of Vienna a little bit far away Parking 29E a day , Nice cozy and modern rooms Gorgeous breakfast worth the money 20E Easy parking Close to Schoenbrunn 
445563,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, There was no kettle in the room you had to go to the bar to get hot water My room was very noisy it s right next to train station and it felt like I was in a war zone I couldn t have a bath as the bath plug would not close The hotel is in the middle of nowhere it has a park next door No nice restaurants or bars nearby , The room was very comfortable furnishing was first class
445564,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, The hallways were somewhat opressive with the dark ceiling And the golden pattern in the lifts was unspeakable , Location and being surrounded by trees also the rooms were very quiet
445565,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, This hotel does not believe in client satisfaction Upon check in the receptionist gave misleading information that caused me to pay more for parking and for a night against double booking when raised the issue with the management they believed me after two hours of negotiations out of my short trip time A night was refunded against the double booking less Booking com commission 20 ,No Positive
445566,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, the staff in the brakfast service was aggressive and they always keep the window tables reserved for no one And keep us sequesed in the middle, The receiption staff was the most frindly and helpful in the hotel
445567,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, The location wasn t so good We had to walk a lot just to find a coffee shop I think the nearest cafe was 20 minutes away at schonbrunn We had to take the breakfast even if we wanted to drink only a coffee It was good but 20 Euro per person is quite expensive They do not have a la carte menu in the morning and there is nothing nearby The staff was not very helpful I found them not being so friendly with some exceptions of course Last but not least when we got home we realised that the amount we had to pay for the booking was blocked twice by the pos reader so it was like practicly we paid twice , It was clean The breakfast was ok but in that area it was the only possible choice 
445568,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, This a very good property but parking is absolutely unacceptable I was charged 24 5 euros which is 1 3 of the price of one day accommodation and the car stayed in the parking just 12 hours Hotel of this kind must have free parking or parking should not exceed 8 euros per day It would be cheaper if you go to a public parking,No Positive
445569,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna,No Negative, Location hotel were perfect for us although if you want to be in the main city it s about 5 metro stops Not a problem though as a fast effecient service runs

445573,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, The breakfast from my point of view could be cheaper 19 eur per person In the end had to find a place to eat but in there are not a lot of places near the hotel Had to go to the city center , One of the best hotels that I have been to Its a very good combination of price quality The hotel is located near the Sch nbrunn Palace about 10 minute walk and a park A very luxurious and big room 
445574,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, Quality of food feels more like main stream No taste of organic food little variety no hot chocolate , The view of the room and the feeling of staying there was excellent Great balcony terrace Trees all around and scent of flowers on the terrace 
445575,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, Overall great experience I highly recommend and will go back Nevertheless the therapeutic massage was a great disappointment 1 hour late average massage the therapist asked higher price than what was agreed at the reception after finishing the treatment , Great hotel in the 4 star range Excellent restaurant for Austrian standards 
445576,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna,No Negative, The staff was very cordial and helpful Considering we didn t speak German they helped us out on in every way possible Specially Milos from the bar was ever smiling He helped us understand our train tickets too which had everything printed in German

445578,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, Wi fi in the room didnt work No big deal but to reach metro you need to get to the tram first For a short term stay you can get a better deal in Vienna Parking is 25 per day Not included Good proffesional working at the bar However Bruno Mars was great and he was the reason visiting Vienna , Cistota
445579,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, Air conditioning was not working well late Spring Some rooms are close to a train line it can be a bit noisy when larger trains pass by although the sound insulation is good I was able to sleep without difficulty Room service was a bit spartan and inconsistent across the 4 days I stayed there Although well serviced breakfast is a bit expensive at EUR19 unless one eats a lot without alternative places for breakfast nearby , Clean well kept facilities Welcoming helpful staff Comfortable and spacious rooms at a reasonable price The property is close to public transportation ad some 600m from the Sch nbrunn Palace where there is the U4 metro line That can be a nice walk perhaps through the park in good weather 
445580,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna,No Negative, five to 10 minute walk to the u4 line very comfort and big room breakfast is great a lot of different choices of food It s near the Sch nbrunn Palace
445581,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, Lacking of cosyness of the room this room was very business and modern Hotel is too far from the center however woth Public transport this is to overcome in 20 min Metro s trams go every 5 min , Clean openingtimes restaurant bar spa sports facilities Up to date equipment room 
445582,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, Not that I didn t like it but the hotel is far from the city center Yet the accomodations are great enough for you to stay at the bar or restaurant in the evenings , Great installations and sorroundings 
445583,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, I m sad to say this but we were staying here three years ago and we had completely different experience this time Let me start with the staff in the restaurant They re not saying hello goodbye they don t ask in which language they should talk to you and always start with German Only after you ask them for English they switch But that only lasts until they try to talk to you again even if they were speaking to you 10 minutes ago They do not approach your table and ask about anything and I had to shout Excuse me couple of times to not be ignored Now let s talk about breakfast It s true that the choice they give you is impressive What I felt is really below a 4 star hotel is a case where pastries made on Tuesday were given for three consecutive days until they were almost hard as stone Cleanliness of the tables tableware wasn t perfect either I m dissapointed to a degree in which I made a decision to not come back to this hotel again There are better choices in Vienna giving you the same experience for lower price Oh and WiFi is a joke , Location executive lounge 
445584,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, Breakfast is very expensive and they don t serve coffee to go Slippers in the rooms would be a good to have for a hotel of this kind Free wifi is also not working most of the times probably due to many users trying to access it on the same time , Room was clean and comfortable Property is greatly designed and decorated Lovely neighborhood close to Sch nbrunn Palace 
445585,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, The staffs I felt were not friendly they are functional and efficient though The location is a bit isolated from the centre with not many restaurants and cafes around there , I booked 2 rooms for 2 adults and 2 kids 10 13 year old and syayed for 3 nights The rooms are clean tidy well and comforatable enough No complainings to say at all The location is very convenient to visit the palace of Schonbrunn with walking distance or taking a tram by just 1 stop from in fron of the hotel 
445586,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, Hotel seems to misleads booking com users Firstly check out time is 12 00 and not 11 00 as stated here Also they take 50 eur deposit for the minibar This practice is not mentioned in hotel policies on booking com and I would have never booked this hotel if I knew this More importantly perhaps a really bad experience with a receptionist who turned the check in process into a nightmare almost Room isn t ready at 14 00 than after several minutes is ready afterall didn t bother to check with the maintenance even though I insisted suspecting that at 14 00 there is a good chance room is cleaned unpleasantness no interest in doing the work professionaly no smile no saying good day back to guest who just arrived and said good day lost to what to actually do during check in process and how to treat a guest respectfully giving out disinformation that check in time of 14 00 stated on booking com booking com stated check in time was actually correct at 15 00 is not correct and that is a mistake and that I should have checked hotel s website for true information Could keep going but I think overall picture is there , Comfortable room wifi which although unstable connection was breaking up every 10 minutes or so has strong signal closeness to Schonbrunn location inside a park although room was actually noisy overlooking busy road and railway 
445587,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna,No Negative, location was good the staff on the reception desk are wonderful the room was very clean the bathroom was very clean modern the best is that their is an nespresso machine with refilled coffee everyday The wifi was exllent Just 10 min walk to Sch nbrunn Palace It was so good that we cancelled a few days in an other hotel to go back to stay in it again I recommend it and will stay in it next time too 
445588,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, One of the staff lady to be exact was so rude and arrogant I asked her for a balance to weight my luggage before going to the airport she replied fast and before I even finish my talk although another reception woman told me that the hotel indeed has a balance Then when I did a check out she was mad for whatever reason then another guy came to check out and she was all smiley and all and even gave him candy in front of me and I got nothing for checking out this is disrespectful arrogant and unprofessional at all , The cleanness and the space of the room bathroom 
445589,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, The rooms were overpriced for the week we stayed in There were three big events during that week and the hotels although fully booked doubled the price for that week We walked about 1 km from the nearest subway station to the hotel during a very cold morning with luggage , The bathroom is big enough and has separate sections for restroom shower and make up

445718,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, you can only heat your room via aircondition and also in the bathroom is no additional header so you can eather have a cold room or turn on the van on 3 also during the night it totaly sucks the room was incredible cold if i wouldnt bring my own header i couldnt survive the night this hotel is only for summer, Nice clean modern and good location esp you are comming from the highway A1

445726,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, The hotel needs to improve the management of their staff When we check in the staff in the reception told us the room fee includes breakfast Next day morning we go to the restaurant to have a breakfast When we told the staff at the gate of the restaurant he did not inform of us anything unusal But when we started our breakfast a staff told us we need to pay the breakfast separately We told him the inconsistency but he asked us to check by ourselves Poor service quality , A hotel with new decoration

445736,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, Unclean found a bunch of hair on a towel I left the towel on the floor to be changed and I marked it I found the same towel on the towel rail I found a cockroach in the room Too expensive parking rate I waited one week for the amount of money blocked as a guarantee to be put back in my credit card account For the double room there was only one card key given therefore if only one person leaves the room the other person either remains in the dark or the first person cannot get back to the room because the elevator needs the card key to be operated For a double room too there was only one soap bar only one shower cap and only one body milk tube , Quiet environment
445737,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, Breakfast very disappointing for the price getting to town by public transport is a little complicated The neighbourhood quickly goes south a short way from the hotel , Nice setting lots of parks nearby Convenient for Moedling and Neudorf by car 
445738,Austria Trend Hotel Park Royal Palace Vienna, I wish the room service was available until a later time but even then the front desk staff were accommodating enough to allow us to order outside and contact us when the food was delivered , Location was ideal for those who want to visit the Schonbrunn Palace the rooms were very clean and ideal for a romantic getaway or a weekend with a couple friends It was across the street from the streetcars and a short 15 20 min walk to the nearest metro with ease of access to the city center The staff were friendly and polite I would definitely stay here again
