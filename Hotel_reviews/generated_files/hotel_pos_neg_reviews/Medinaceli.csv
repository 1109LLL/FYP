315554,Medinaceli, We did t try the breakfast We thought it to expensive and got a sandwich and takeaway coffee around the corner instead , Excellent location as it is near great restaurants and close to a subway station 
315555,Medinaceli,No Negative, The location was great staff was very helpful and polite room was abit tight and lighting was dim Otherwise had a very comfortable stay Was gutted that tea coffee was not free 
315556,Medinaceli, The breakfast price, The ver was very confortable very spacious room The location was just great and also we were actually in a former palace of the royalty 3minutes from the underground In front of the port at one step Las Ramblas very handy for anything we needed 
315557,Medinaceli,No Negative, Great location in the Gothic Quarter few minutes walk from Marina and Las Ramblas Good cafes and restaurants nearby Great staff and spacious rooms had a great trip 
315558,Medinaceli, Dark room with street noise with windows shut Toilet still had marks from last guest The sink looked like it needed a good scrub Staff weren t very helpful This is not a 4 star hotel very expensive you what you get, Location
315559,Medinaceli, As above, No bar at hotel do not undetstand why suggest they recommend the bar next door the gran tourino and have some agreement with them overall good location should have tea coffee facility in room or a fridge
315560,Medinaceli, Room had no external windows Air conditioner was noisy and ineffective meaning the the room was too hot to sleep , The appearance of the external areas was great and the location was really convenient for seeing the sights
315561,Medinaceli, No shampoo in the room Wifi was very poor Expensive for what we got , Staff were friendly The room was nice and there were no overall issues in regard to any facility 
315562,Medinaceli, Our car broke down so we arrived one day later Although the hotel was informed accordingly the day before our scheduled arrival they refused to cancel one night and we were charged despite our very unlucky situation A bit of understanding would make our already shorter then planned stay more pleasant , Location
315563,Medinaceli, Dear hotel Management As a very dissatisfied customer I registered on Booking com on purpose just to leave this comment on your hotel page I would like to highlight some very important negative points 1 The first and the most important is the breakfast which is literaly DISGUSTING We had the impression that not a single product presented during the breakfast was fresh and of good quality the juices taste like Yuppy and are undrinkable the milk tastes like the one made of powder with some water added in it if you come at around 9 10 AM the buffet is almost empty there are no clean tables you need to wait the food which is supposed to be heated up during the service hours is cold and has no taste the staff is rude doesn t speak English well if you answer their question in English they still reply in Spanish nice and is too slow to assure a good quality of service during breakfast some signs indicating what kind of dish was presented were missing always not enough mugs and plates you have to ask the staff to bring them to you so you wait and for all this you pay 12 euros It is a pure robbery to make people pay for a sh tty breakfast like that On the second and the third days of our stay we had breakfast in the restaurant not far from the beach which was much much better and cheaper 2 The room the AC system was broken when we arrived so it was hot as hell during two days the room was noisy itself but also there was a staff room just next to us where cleaning ladies keep their products and towels sot they felt free to discuss their daily issues very loudly just next to our door early in the morning not caring if someone hears them or not or is sleeping for example the room looks old pretty used and old fashioned the bathroom is not very well cleaned and after the cleaning lady passes by you still see some dust in visible areas 3 The general level of professionalism of the personnel at the reception area leaves much to be , The only plus on the hotel is its location 
315564,Medinaceli, Disappointing that there was no natural daylight in the room Windows opened to inside of the building which wasn t very nice , Great location Very clean 
315565,Medinaceli, Try to avoid the ground level rooms especially room 5 next to the elevator also with four stars I would expect an electric kettle in the room but I am no Barcelona expert maybe that s not standard there , Location is perfect staff is nice rooms are great Especially the bathroom You re right in the middle of everything and you can get there and back again easily from the airport witht he new subway extension Still it is pretty quite around the hotel itself 
315566,Medinaceli, Terrible smell from sewers on ground floor and first floor Bathroom was awful as it seemed to come up through the drains Hairdryer hopeless Supposedly massage shower but didn t work well Rooms ok but definitely not 4 star Room not ready at 16 30 in the afternoon and we left our bags at 11 30 am Not the most helpful or smart of staff , Excellent location
315567,Medinaceli, WiFi was non existent No coffee tea or water in room Definitely not 4 star im afraid Room was nice bed was horrible You get what u pay for , Location
315568,Medinaceli, Paper thin bed sheets pillows and rough tiny towels Air conditioning was loud , Brilliant location with easy access to all that Barcelona has to offer Friendly staff and good sized rooms
315569,Medinaceli, No coffee making facilites in room , The room with a balcony was ideal excellent location had to request a room move the staff were very accomodating 
315570,Medinaceli, We got the ground floor Window was to a noicy street and sidewalk , location location location Near the Rambla and the Port Some nice restaurantes near by 
315571,Medinaceli, we were miss informed regarding the size of the room wich was much smaller than what were told and when we confrount them they replied this was the booking com mistake not ours but at the end they gave us the bigger room but i believe that was the wors room in the hotel regarding cleanness and air conditioning The staff were not honest regarding the problem that we confront them and they weren t freindly ,No Positive
315572,Medinaceli,No Negative, The pictures don t do this hotel justice It s clean stylish and in a great location The staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms are impressive Great hotel would definitely stop again if visiting Barcelona 
315573,Medinaceli, UNFAIR Day 1 9 p m Friday Tired after many hours driving I check in at Medinaceli and get a room on ground zero behind a door just back the concierge desk and once I enter wow I am little kid again back to the seventies I am not particularly fond of antiques and so I report to the young boy at the entrance that this is not the room I saw pictures on Booking booked and already paid for He replied that the Hotel is fully booked and that I ve got a room in the old part of the Hotel just for the record no mention of it on Booking I insist I wish to change the room and he said they re going to try next day Well maybe if I switch on the TV set I ll enjoy last episode of Kojak Day 2 Up for breakfast a smiling man at the desk tells me they succeeded in having finally my room but not earlier than 1 p m So still with suitcase unpacked I go out Come back late at evening get the key for a room on floor 1 and Kojak again Come on what I am on Scherzi a Parte I rush down I don t like to be fooled Again the young boy of Day 1 again the bla bla bla of the fully booked Hotel I want to talk to the manager in charge He replied not available Call him her Not possible He comes tomorrow I asked for a name which I get without surname I asked about surname of the Boss and he pretends he doesn t know it I asked for compensation since the room I ve got is not worth the price they are charging me and above all differs from the pictures they put on Booking Guess what No compensation I am so frustrated and go back upstairs and back to the seventies I call Booking Customer Service in Italy and finally I get assistance from a very gentle person thanks Mr Marco Casarin to whom I explain what is going on and after few minutes he tells me that spoke to Medinaceli and they are going to try to change my room the day after but cannot grant it Today I will have to spend another night with unpacked suitcase and Kojak , Conveniently located 
315574,Medinaceli, Nothing to write here , The staff were extremely welcoming and friendly they were keen to recommend places that were not typical tourist places and were even more helpful when my partner had her things stolen not while at the hotel even after we had checked out of the hotel The location of the hotel was sensational extremely close to Las Rambles the gothic quarter easy Easy to get to and from and close to the beach also 
315575,Medinaceli,No Negative, Fantastic location The heart of the city is right on the doorstep and it s also only a short walk to the beach Good shower and efficient air conditioning 
315576,Medinaceli, Take some ear plugs noisy street life throughout the night as you would expect in a city centre hotel, The location was excellent for exploring the city
315577,Medinaceli,No Negative, Beautiful historic hotel in great location in Gothic district So many shops restaurants and beautiful historic buildings within short walk from hotel 
315578,Medinaceli, The bed sheets weren t really our favourite as my husband was allergic But we managed , Really liked the airco in the room which is really needed at this time of the year Spacious room bathroom clean The location was perfect for us just 2min from Las Ramblas 
315579,Medinaceli, baggage was stored in a made up guest room and staff just walked across the bed to retrieve it in front of us no working aircon in room when told reception they just gave smart answers with no apology sockets hanging from wall when I asked for a bill they would not give one and told us to get one from booking com i don t think they like guests from booking com here the area felt unsafe at night especially the rambla, only the location was good
315580,Medinaceli, staff very young but doesn t know how to deal with clients they may ask you to pay something that is already paid so be careful if you ask for an invoice it is too complicated and it takes hours for them to stamp one invoice internet doesn t work properly so that their system doesn t work so your check in and check out may be without proper documentation and no invoice afterwards they don t try to solve problems they just wait and do when they want , the location 
315581,Medinaceli, The wifi is not working at all , Hotel Medinaceli is absolutely perfect The location is perfect kind and friendly staff clean and big rooms Loved it 
315582,Medinaceli, The rooms need a kettle so we can make a cup of tea Its only a small thing but needing to buy boiling water from a machine which doesn t even properly boil the water doesn t really wok for us Otherwise very happy with the hotel , The staff really went beyond to help us On the day we arrived I lost my credit card in the metro ticket machine at the airport After many phone calls put in to TMB by the staff of this hotel we were able to recover the lost card They also moved us to a different room after we had disturbed sleep due to noisy guests and for the final night upgraded us to a triple room and gave us a free breakfast 
315583,Medinaceli, The fact that every other on line booking agency included free breakfasts for less overall cost than you in Booking Com Who had breakfast as extra The human hair on the pillow first night when I turned down the covers,No Positive
315584,Medinaceli, even if we booked and paid for a parking place in advance they did not have place in the garage and advised to leave the car 1km away from the hotel still paid the same internet doesn t work well as a plus they may ask you the parking cost again in the morning even if it is paid online thru booking , the location was great 
315585,Medinaceli, Air conditioning wasn t working and couldn t be fixed throughout the month of April As a result it was too warm to sleep at night , Fantastic staff Helpful and friendly Great location fabulous restaurants near by

315587,Medinaceli, Bed and pillows very uncomfortable and difficult to sleep Inside room noisy at night with people passing by in corridors , Very good location and clean hotel
315588,Medinaceli, Street noise and reception noise guests going here ant there etc can be annoying in rooms on street level 001 004 located behind reception Breakfast price and choice vs what you can get in Barcelona in any place just behind a corner seems to be very unreasonable to be fair that was a reason I didn t even book it but went down to see what I m loosing , Very polite and helpful staff Great location Good value for money 
315589,Medinaceli,No Negative, Fantastic location We couldn t have asked for better one close to the port close to La Rambla and Gothic District Definitely would recommend it 
315590,Medinaceli, The rooms on all floors are built around a courtyard Anyone on any floor making a lot of noise is heard throughout the building It so happened that some people were arguing in a passageway in the middle of the night which I could hear easily , The staff were helpful and friendly and the location is very central if you want to be in the Gothic quarter near Port Vell 
315591,Medinaceli,No Negative, The staff were most helpful with directions means of transport and general local info They were all friendly and polite and always welcomed us with an Ola whenever we entered Perfect location for the gothic quarter plus it s about 30 seconds walk from the marina which is a lovely place to walk along with some fancy restaurants located along there Cash machine located few feet along from the hotel Hotel was quiet rooms spacious and the shower room was perfect Cannot fault this hotel at all Ideal for a young couple like myself and my girlfriend or just as good for a middle aged couple Two lifts in working order and free wifi with a strong connection High recommend this hotel 
315592,Medinaceli,No Negative, The hotel was in the most perfect location close to the harbour and Las Ramblas but was also away from the noise The room was really clean and big even though we were three people in one room it also had a large bathroom The spare bed was a proper bed and not your usual pull out bed The staff were very friendly and helpful Would definitely recommend people to stay here
