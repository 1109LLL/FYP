504027,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Reception understanding minor problems became major frustrations even after we left It was as if we had a language barrier because even explaining in English became a barrier to understanding , Very Central and safety first close to main transport tube train and bus Walking distance to most popular Sight Scenes 
504028,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Due to lack of natural lighting the room was quite dark and the lighting that was there was a bit night clubbish I also felt that the system for marking names off at breakfast was very inefficient and the staff were a little curt , The room was large and even though it had an internal window it felt very comfortable Also the location was excellent with easy access to the metro 
504029,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Everything was perfect I will get back soon , Great Hotel great stay in London The hotel is located in one of the nices area in London easy to get to and very well connected with all the other areas really close to Metro Stations 6 7 mins walk and Taxis all around The room is spacious and clean the executive lounge is amazing with a fair price you can work and get your meetings in a very nice place with a great view The staff is amazing they know how to make you feel a special guest especially Mrs Ioana from the Executive Lounge she was very careful and polite with me and my guests The chekin checkout were super fast the WiFi is pretty good 
504030,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The lights in the room are a bit different We called maintenance and there is a sequence to follow with turning on the lights in order to have the lights function as we would anticipate It is an energy savings but we were turning the lights off on one another while in the bathroom not a good thing Would love to have the pool to be open later in the evening for a relaxing swim dip after a long day touring London and after having dinner , The location was very convenient to many of the tourist attractions we were visiting The concierge provided great tips on restaurants in the area as well as assisted with making arrangements to get us to the airport for our departure The hotel is very clean and modern 
504031,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing really sticks out, The bath was huge and nice to relax in just take your own bath salts bubble bath and relax in a nice hot bath or if you prefer a shower it was roomy and a nice flow of water but not a power shower The room was spacious with a decent size comfortable bed the fridge is big enough to put in few cans and 1 pint plastic milk carton The food there is pricey but very tasty but no dearer than most other hotels they have a great selection of wines and whisky but not larger or beer or cider if that s what you drink the staff are pleasant and helpful and there is a bus stop right outside the hotel that buses and tour buses stop You are within walking distance of Big Ben the London eye and a few other attractions and about a ten minute walk of Waterloo train station and a 20 30 minute stroll away from Covent Garden Piccadilly Leicester Square or a 3 minute tube ride There is a nice little convenience store about 20 yards away which a wide range of products like a spar a little pricey compared to a supermarket but you are in the centre of London 
504032,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, The staff really do make a difference We received a complimentary upgrade in room and when explaining we d have an early start to travel on leaving Richard at reception without prompting organised a breakfast pack for us Stunning rooms with an iconic view of the London Eye topped off with excellent guest relations Will definitely stay here again
504033,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, There s hardly any daylight in the whole hotel The only bits where you can see daylight are charged at a premium in the executive suite I know it s a big hotel but is it really that hard to uncorporate natural light , Hotel is huge and has a slinky James Bond esque atmosphere to it Bathroom beds facilities everything was there and was excellent Breakfast was amazing and plentiful Staff were helpful 
504034,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, There were quite a few children in the pool on the Sunday morning , The room was great and the swimming pool sauna steam room a great way to start your Sunday morning We got upgraded on arrival and provided with a bottle of Prosecco as well 
504035,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We were a given a disabled room Rooms are not great considering the amount we paid to stay there I feel we paid more for the location then the hotel The lighting was not great and the bathroom seemed like it needed a refurb When you pay that much per night you expect a lot more , The hotel it s self was lovely lobby area was beautiful however very disappointed with the rooms 
504036,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, It would have been better if breakfast was included for the price paid , Welcoming staff Lovely reception area Good room size Comfy bed Large bathroom Great view from the bar Large comfy bar area 
504037,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Breakfast in the overspill room so requested to have breakfast in the restaurant which was not a problem for the staff , Live music in the Primo bar and View from our room 
504038,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Lots of roadworks around and hard to get into hotel but not really their fault Once you are there its beautiful , Stunning hotel and service was faultless Food was beautiful in brasserie as were the cocktails Also lovely spa facilities and kid friendly pool Will definitely be back 
504039,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Poor lighting in the halls Dark elevators Poor housekeeping in that they did not even come to clean the room till almost supper time as we had arrived back after a day of sightseeing and were getting ready for dinner , Excellent location Common areas were spotless 
504040,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Breakfast was crammed no check in for kids as advertised No bed sheets for pull out bed had to order which was completed quickly Problems with lights goi g off and when staying with kids this can be scary Was corrected but again could have been avoided , Location Rooms were well maintained Staff were helpful 
504041,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, The duplex room we stayed it we got via e upgrade at a reduced rate and it had a fantastic view of Big Ben and good facilities Even if we had not got that particular room it would still have been a great base from which to explore central London As you would expect the room was clean and tidy and well maintained whilst we stayed at the hotel 
504042,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The amount of water generated by the shower could be a little bit more But this is personal and certainly not something to advise against this hotel , Not cheap but everything was in perfect order Breakfast is good even when many people want to have breakfast at the same time everything runs smoothly Availability of food was no problem Staff is skilful and polite Room was clean bed was very good and wifi fast Located near Westminster Bridge and near Waterloo station this hotel is easy to get to and a perfect starting point for exploring London 
504043,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The staff at the reception were not very welcoming I had booked two rooms of which the second one was not ready for over an hour and that was quite annoying They seemed inexperienced and were not able to communicate well The hotel was definitely not value for money The breakfast included with the charges had long queues and there was too much waiting before one could eat anything , The breakfast had a lot variety The bathrooms were luxurious 
504044,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, We arrived after an overnight flight and our little boy was ill The staff were great and got us a room ready as soon as they could and well before the usual check in time This was much appreciated 
504045,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, elevators are good but lighting could be more, Excellent hotel near to major sight seeing places bed was very comfortable excellent room services room was big very safe for the families to stay grocery stores near by it will remain our hotel to stay for always in london Staff friendly check out was fast
504046,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Water pressure seemed low room was smelly when first turning on the air con Traffic was not really good due to road works, Good location stylish hotel attentive staff
504047,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The cleaning service was not good Everyday our fresh towels were wet and we had to chase down the maid to get clean dry towels The wine glasses were not washed The bed was uncomfortable The partial view rooms have no view at all There is one very small window in a corner and you can t get to it , Good location close to train station Big Ben London Eye 
504048,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Our view was that of a hospital It wasn t fun to look into what looked like patients rooms So if you d like to avoid that don t accept room 557 There was also a lot of construction going on around the outside of the hotel It took away from the vacation feel We visited the restaurant lounge bar once and it was crowded and the service was quite slow , Location is the reason we chose this hotel It was easy to step outside for a taxi or walk across the bridge to catch the Tube I liked the modern decor of the rooms The living room was a little dark but our daughter was using the sofa bed which she said was fine It served as a second bedroom for us The bathroom lighting was nice and bright but the glass door didn t afford total privacy There was a mini fridge with enough room for small items and there was also a mini bar with a sink which was handy when two of us had to get ready The microwave was also handy for reheating food 
504049,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I requested at the checkin time kindly update my Miles in Lufthansa Miles Card but still I not received the same and not received any msg from there side , They give us handicapped room after complain at reception they changed our room and it has little bit Good view But staff who attend us first I felt that she frustrated 
504050,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Location Rooms without a view made this hotel not a viable option for us Shopping and markets were very few near hotel Also the massive construction happening out front made it very dangerous on foot , Staff and rooms were excellent
504051,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nightdress of my wife disappeared after the first room cleaning I called that day to the Room Service and on the reception desk But nobody managed to find it And looks like nobody really tried hard to find one At the day of check out I repeat my complain and asked to look through the nightdress again The staff just told me that neither they nor cleaning company found anything in the linens It was a present so this incident upset my wife a lot , Location is great 
504052,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The hotel is very big and there was happening a lot of events at the time we were there For us this was ok but some people could feel descomfortable with so many people entering and leaving the property , The room was really big and there was a sink a microwave and a mini bar It was very comfortable and clean 
504053,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The concierge staff were less than helpful allowing us to struggle up to our room without any offer offer assistance The room although well appointed was very dark It would be great to be remembered that the access to lighting switches should be intuitive and the machinations of a designer or engineer It unfortunately didn t add to a positive experience , The location was absolutely perfect The Primo restaurant music lounge was a great venue 
504054,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, They do not empty the trash cans in the room so after few days it becomes smelly Also some of the staff in the concierge are not so friendly if you ask more than 2 questions , Great location Good facilities Very comfortable Warmly recommended 
504055,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Front desk was understaffed and extremely slow at check in and throughout visit Confusion over our reservation was disturbing asked for upgrades online and desk staff didn t appear to understand , Special accommodations of sleep sofa were well done for grandchild Room division worked well for separate sleeping 
504056,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, When I compare with other luxury hotels breakfast was good but it wasnt included omlette or pancake as free Maybe it is easy to control the demand from the customers but this hotel deserves more variety in breakfast because it is not cheap and less quality , Fully english breakfast was really good and staffs were so friendly Room service was incredibly good Cleaning service was perfect Honestly there is nothing to say as negative Dont think about my words at the above as I didnt like I just wanted to write different sections to make them more clear 
504057,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We had difficulties with house keeping They didnt restock the minibar daily which as we found out later meant we were charged for additional drinks we didn t consume Unfortunately the staff cleaning the room didn t speak English and as per the supervisors explanation this was a problem across the floor , The room was very spacious and the hotel ideally located In room dining highly recommended The food was quality and well priced great for a easy meal after a day of sight seeing The bar was great and family friendly 
504058,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Room 304 was like a dungeon with no natural lighting whatsoever you could not tell night from day I have stayed at this hotel before always had a decent room however this one should only be used as a storage cupboard , Location food plentiful 
504059,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Only negative is for price breakfast should be included , Lovely hotel in a great location hotel itself very modern upmarket Studio room good size with area to sit relax staff really friendly 
504060,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Staff not helpful did not recommend upgrade after confusing us with another party that they offered upgrade Was not helpful to find or figure out plug for medial issue they recommended to unplug phone by bed to have access to plug Could not provide change in requested denomination for 50 pounds , Location
504061,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, View from room was directly opposite other bedrooms internal Lighting needs to be brighter in communal areas Choice of Food heavy middle eastern influence TV remote needs updating Very sparse tea making ingredients, Spacious room Bed Linens Comfortable bed Elemis toiletries
504062,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Reception Staff were unable to fully understand English conversation I would also be nice if Booking com could actually show images of the room that s being booked rather than images of any room that fits Mini Fridge not cold enough as wanted to store own bottles of water due to diet requirements, Location for Exhibition Also a very nice Hotel to stay in 
504063,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Buffet breakfast bacon Tea from a flask at breakfast Cocktails very expensive Pool not very relaxing , The beds were very comfy Treatments at the spa and staff superb Staff at the hotel so thoughtful and helpful 
504064,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Everything was excellent , The staff and location were excellent They tended to our needs when we inquired with professionalism The hotel is very concerned about security and making sure the guests are comfortable and safe at all times We appreciated that and their resolve for perfection is quite good All their services provided were top notch I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to see the sights and sounds of London 
504065,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, 1 Queues to the reception desk at ANY time People stay in the line 10 15 minutes always When we said it to the staff they replied You are staying here there is no queue near our desk 2 They use cheapest magnetic keys so they do not work after 1 day and you need to change them continuously Reception girl says Do not put in your wallet near phone but I always place here my credit cards with magnetic stripe and they work fine And each time for unknown reasons the replacement of the key took about 20 minutes that is we could not get to our room about 40 minutes every day The same applied to any question Whether it is information or a request to open a mini bar which you can not just use There was a feeling that everything was being done to complicate the lives of clients although it should be vice versa 3 Communication occurred on the verge of rudeness There was no professional friendly attitude 4 The order of dinner in the room was demanded to be paid in cash although usually you can pay when cheking out and by credit card 3 You cannot open windows even with small gap so no fresh air in the room and bathroom Only AC or Warmer ON without option fresh air Despite the fact that the room was expensive the windows overlooked railroad tracks and depressive buildings 5 Do not expect cool pool it s situated on 4 yes MINUS FOUR floor small bad ventilated 6 and that s really CRAZY they gave us final receipt printed on the back of A4 paper with the list of names of guests in other rooms in this hotel it seems that staff do not hear about privacy they re use office paper but they do not care that they give you someone s personal information name surname amount room number date of arrival 7 They sell family room for 4 equipped with only ONE SMALL wardrobe and toilet without lock Second bed is placed right near the door so you cannot open it fully , Tasty food which we ordered in the room and the location
504066,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The reception area is a shambles when you go in there s just people standing about you don t know if they are next or you are next or what which was very overwhelming as you h e just arrived the stay was lovely apart from the aircon didn t really work and the room was very warm plus you couldn t open the windows which was understandable however checking out completely ruined my weekend I was not able to do the express check out as I had paid the 50 deposit in cash so I had to get this back again there was no que and seemed to be very under staffed there was guests trying to check in as well as check out so again people standing everywhere in no kind of order After about 10 minutes some of us guests who were standing about formed a que ourselves however others were then just going up to the guests clearly skipping the que and going before us other people who had been standing there for about 20 minutes when I did eventually get seen to I had to then wait another ten minutes as there was only one person behind the check in desks that either knew how to give the deposit back or was allowed however this person was nowhere to be seen I eventually did get my deposit back however when I expressed that I was annoyed as I had just waited the best part of 45 minutes to check out the two girls behind the desks have me the dirtiest look and just replied with well that can t be helped you can see we are busy what an absolute joke The location of the hotel is great which is why I would consider coming back but will not be anytime in the near future , On arrival the original room I had booked was not ready as I was a few hours early but they gave me the options to upgrade to a better room that was ready for a small fee of 25 which I liked and the location is brilliant 
504067,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, There were some roadworks outside the hotel when we stayed You couldn t hear them from the hotel at all but it did mean that if you arrive at the hotel by car you get caught in some traffic around the hotel , The rooms were very clean and modern The bathroom was large and the bed very comfortable 
504068,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The hotel seem very sterile when you walked in too much construction going on outside the hotel it s not right in the heart of Center City hard to get a taxi outside the front door because of large buses blocking the driveway It felt like a big convention hotel not a boutique hotel ,No Positive
504069,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Basin drainage in bathroom very poor Waiting time at reception long Slow revolving doors on entry No guest lounge Not informed that daily newspapers were available from concierge Needed more cupboard space and fridge space Suggest remove all fridge contents that are touch sensitive and only fill if requested by guests , Location close to 2 tube stations Paid extra for Bridge view but was wonderful to see it daily and brightened the room 19 yr old son could have his own area and TV in King Studio room Excellent reservation department especially Sara Very comfortable room Felt part of London 
504070,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, Highly recommend this hotel So convenient to everything The suite was perfect for our family of four since our daughters are still small enough to share the sofa bed in the living room They loved the spa pool which is dark and dramatically lit My husband and I really enojoyed the lobby lounge for drinks dinner and live music in the evenings The food was great Honestly there is nothing negative I can say about our stay at this hotel We usuallly stay at Hiltons and this was on par with our experiences there if that helps give you a reference 
504071,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I loved everything, The staff were excellent and polite and did all they could to accommodate my requests I celebrated a special birthday and had a beautiful cake waiting in my room and we were given access to the Executive lounge free of charge which made our stay even more amazing I would definitely stay here again 
504072,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, The staff were extremely accommodating to the fact that it was our honeymoon making our stay extra special The breakfast buffet was delicious and overall our experience was fantastic Would definitely stay here again 
504073,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Reception staff attitude and their whole behaviour and their command of english was very poor When checked out we were charged for items from the bar when we didn t consume anything , Location and a lot of the tourist attractions being close by 
504074,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Theres nothing that I didn t like , Very comfortable place to stay View wasn t great but could upgrade the view if wanted Breakfast was great too 
504075,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The hotel was dark even though it was full of windows The area had a lot of construction happening so sidewalks and roads were closed in certain areas We didn t care for the restaurants in and around the hotel , The location was good We were close to the Thames River Queen s Walk Parliament Westminster Abbey and two Metros There were also several tour bus pickups nearby The staff was friendly and provided a birthday treat for my big day 
504076,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, This was the first time in all my travels that we were given two single beds with no possibility of joining the beds Change of room was provided on the second night but the room was very close to the lifts and all night long you could her the recorded voice in the lift Breakfast average with limited choice Escalators lead to the main lobby not to my liking ,No Positive
504077,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We had a problem with TV in our room We reported it Saturday had to report it again on the Monday then it was fixed Bit of a bummer though as we were leaving next day , The room was excellent Loved the view of Big Ben from outside hotel 
504078,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Scrambled eggs were the worst I have ever eaten Other breakfast items good , Fresh modern Great location Did not hear noisey street traffic on third floor 
504079,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The reception area is often crowded The traffic around the hotel is too busy due to big construction , Facilities in the hotel is good Nice Japanese restaurant in the hotel Room is clean and comfortable Convenient downtown location 
504080,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Our sink in the bathroom kept blocking up and the lights we kept turning each others lights on of by mistake couldn t work them out was funny though, All of it
504081,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Pillows too flat Broken glass in outdoor restaurant area, Room was nice and dark food in restaurant breakfast lunch and dinner was exceptional wifi very fast beautiful views excellent reception staff
504082,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I didn t like all the construction around the building I did t like that the room had an interior view , I liked the location ans the coffee shop 
504083,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, Very spacious clean room with excellent views over London skyline Staff advised us to wait at check in so that we could secure a room with a skyline view rather than an internal room with no skyline view Great pool family friendly and excellent clean changing facilities Very good facilities within the room tea coffee hot chocolate sachets and milk Best location Close to the Eye and right on Westminster bridge Bus stop close by too Would stay here again without hesitation 
504084,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Bar staff very unfriendly not helpful no smiling faces on anybof them no interaction with the customer One of them had an attitude problem Asked him about food at 2335hrs he replied the food had finished when there was certain things available 24hrs Found this totally unacceptable especially when paying 408 to stay on the Sat night , Very good location Clean and very quiet room Reception staff very friendly 
504085,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The coffe machine is not that good and not on all the breakfast areas there is a coffe machine sometimes you have to walk from one area to the other to get a cappuccino The best cappuccino you will get at the hotel though is at illy cafe at the entrance of the hotel and you have to pay for it , Fantastic hotel 2 minutes walking frim westmenstir bridge we ordered Studio room with Big Ben view Great breakfast gym and pool The Sushi restaurant inside the hotel offers great dishes Lobby is nicely decorated Staff is helpful and nice The hotel sent me cake as bithday wish 
504086,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Having stayed at this hotel a few times I felt standards had slipped a little Check in took much longer than it should Service in the bar was particularly slow although I appreciate this will be dependent on how busy they are Little things like no tea bags in the room should have been easily resolved but they sent a handful of peppermint tea rather than breakfast tea which was requested I feel there are a number of hotels in the area that offer as much but at a lower price , Great location 
504087,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, A porter put our luggage onto a trolley outside the hotel whilst Valet took our car Our luggage was then left outside unattended for over 30 minutes as the porter forgot to bring it in and hadn t put a label on the bags so other porters didn t know if it was luggage to be checked in or checked out , Children given a goody bag on arrival
504088,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing , It was all we could have wanted and more the room was fantastic and equipped with anything we wished to make our stay more comfortable The beds were v comfy and the bathroom stocked with lovely toiletries Even ice machines on each floor were provided which was very welcome in the heat of London A home from home would recommend 
504089,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing not to like , The location is extremely convenient We walked everywhere that we wanted to go eg to the Strand to see a show The staff in the lounge bar restaurants housekeeping and concierge were attentive helpful friendly and professional The food in the French restaurant was fabulous 
504090,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Escalators to reception Would have rathered reception on ground floor , Location was excellent for travelling around central London and close to the underground 
504091,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, The buffet breakfast was great and the location to some major key tourist spots Also my daughter felt sick from the taxi ride so one of the bell hops made sure the manager got us a room for her to rest in even though we were early 
504092,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We were annoyed in that our booking specified that we were due to arrive at the hotel between 4 and 5pm We arrived at 5pm and the check in staff informed us that our room wasn t ready Unacceptable especially considering we had travelled all the way from South Africa Furthermore we booked a family suite as our 14 year old daughter was to be staying with us When we arrived in our room I requested that the sofa bed be made up for her while we were out for dinner WE returned from dinner at about 11pm and this had not been done I had to phone housekeeping at this late hour and insist that someone attend to this urgently , Beautifully comfortable beds and the hotel is very conveniently situated 
504093,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, the hotel was very dark and our bedroom was so dark we had to keep lights on all the time it was beautiful sunny weekend in London but sadly we didn t see much while at the hotel as was in darkness the whole time Our room wasn t cleaned till after 4pm, the location was very good in middle of London
504094,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Awful room had not been cleaned properly Blood on pillow from previous occupant and rubbish left in the room Management were dismissive and said that as I could not prove it wasn t mine they could do little about it Won t be staying here again , Location very central
504095,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I had a room which overlooked an inside lobby The view didn t bother me but the window placement was in the corner so most of the time it felt like I was in a room without a window , The location was amazing and the staff was very helpful 
504096,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Staff was little bit slow with their service and a lot of small mistakes After one month checking out from the hotel my credit card has still over 1800 pounds pre authorization even though I have paid in full when checking out This is because they forgot to cancel it when I was checking out Nobody seems to know how to cancel the pre authorization All they can say is that they are sorry Not really professional , Great view 
504097,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Check in took over 30 mins in a Thursday evening Everyone was hit and tired and just wanted to get into their rooms There was provision for at least 6 check in receptionists but only 3 on duty while another sat in the VIP check in doing nothing the queue grow to 15 deep Similar happened when checking out as I wished to pay in cash and only one desk could accept it Room wasn t offered to be cleaned until 4pm which was too late in the day , Great location for us using the hotel as a base while my son was having an operation in the Evelina Children s Hospital The suite was a great size for a family of 3 4
504098,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I would have expected a bottle of water in our room I found that rather disappointing No robes for the pool in our room or at the pool itself, Really lovely breakfast most staff so nice and helpful but there were a few grumpy and the waitress in the bar at night wasn t nice at all
504099,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Thought we had been overcharged as we weren t told a holding deposit would remain on on credit card for 5 10 day after our stay , The one bedroom suite was just fantastic After travelling for 6 weeks we enjoyed all the luxuries super comfy bed and pillows bathroom had a show and separate bath kitchen for cooking our own breakfast and a coffee machine dining table and lounge room There was even a loofa razer shaving cream as well as all the usual shampoo etc We just had so much room to spread out after a lot of small rooms through Europe It was very close to Westminster Bridge Westminster Abbey the London Eye being in walking distance The room was expensive though 
504100,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, No big supermarket arround , The area has a good public transport network Very close to Big Ben London Eye Westminster Abby walk to the Buckingham Palace arround 30mins And we re all love walk along with the River Thames under the sunshine 
504101,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The hotel style is very dull and poorly maintained There was a kettle in the room but No complimentary water or coffee tea given for the price you pay for the room Staff not professional take very long to process simple check in info Hotel is located in a good tourist attraction area but this could have a negative attraction if u have a flight to catch as the traffic could get unbearable and you can miss ur flight is you were not careful with the timing Plus the rooms have internal dull and boring windows that not suitable for guests paying a lot of money , The hotel is near important tourist attractions however this could be risky for those with tight time or flights to catch as the area is very congested with traffic and tourists it makes the place over crowded 
504102,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We did have a room with a view however the windows were very dirty on the outside You had to make reservations to swim in the pool and were on only allowed 30 min There were no hangers in the closet , Great location Ease of access to many sites and the Tube at Waterloo Station Accommodations were nice We had a studio King and used the pull out couch as another bed We weren t in the room very much but it was clean and comfortable I would stay there again 
504103,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing, I loved the fact that I was given a free upgrade therefore had a view Also although there was lots of traffic outside the room was fully sound proofed 
504104,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Accountant office and receptionists at check in and check out are absolute disaster they cut money from credit card sometimes double price and sometimes few hundreds more than they should and after dozens of emails and phonecalls they give back all extra that happend twice with me But I still love this hotel with its good location and all the rest friendly staff , Special thanks to breakfast manager Salome She is a very kind person cares about every single customer and does her best to please all guests 
504105,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Got reservation wrong but sorted room with sofa bed although no one came with bedding as promised Lack of hotel information in rooms , Kids loved the pool Breakfast was excellent Room service food also excellent
504106,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Having to make reservations for pool At 5pm room hadn t been cleaned Shower had mold Breakfast buffet was a bit pricey stick to cafe in hotel , Staff very helpful and approachable Was given a room upgrade with view of Big Ben and London eye 
504107,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Travelling with a child in a pram and luggage having to navigate the breakfast area between the lifts and reception is major design flaw As we arrived at the hotel before check in time we were promised a SMS when the room was ready We never received it , Amazing location Room was a very generous size Enjoyed the enclosed balcony with seating Room service was prompt issue with the TV in the lounge room was fixed immediately It s not a cheap hotel however I felt the price we paid was excellent value for money 
504108,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The spa really dis organised and low quality service and certainly not value for money , The view is good but extra expensive to have a room with a view Your basically sold a room that shows an image of a good view Then when you check in you clearly don t have a view and are offered 80 100 on top per night for a room with a view
504109,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Unfortunately the view from the room s window was on the inner patio that caused the room to be quite dark even on sunny day , The most important adventage of this hotel is its location just in front of Westminister Bridge The staff is polite and proffessional We came with our child that had a fever and we got the room very fast earlier than it was fixed 
504110,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The hotel could have a notice on their website that the entire sidewalk around the hotel is torn up and there is a lot of road construction and stuff as well Arriving and leaving the property was a nightmare each time especially when one person in the group is in a wheelchair Tv channel selection was awful , The hotel staff was very nice Room was beautifully done and spacious
504111,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Dirty sheets Dust Worn down furniture Couldn t even crack a window to air the room it felt like a bunker Power socket was hanging out of the wall No natural light coming in We actually left a day early because my sister couldn t cope with the dust because of her allergies , Room service Friendly staff

504113,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, At breakfast the first day we was not told correctly about what was on offer regarding food We had to find out ourselves meaning we all had something we didn t want first day of our 2 day stay You also only get breakfast with the Big Ben view if you upgrade to exec lounge, location is superb The view from the lobby is spot on
504114,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, I booked an internal room and it was listed as such but it didn t properly describe how close the next rooms were outside the window There was literally no space and as my wife is slightly claustrophobic she didn t get a lot of sleep For a 220 hotel room I don t feel that it was value for money at all Everything else was very nice though

504117,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, A little pricey for what you get but probably standard for London vacations Also the underground Metro station entrance is currently under construction so the the alternate is about a 1 2 mile walk Not a huge deal for those used to walking in a city but a little inconvenient for families with small children and or strollers , This place was an excellent place to stay while in London Easy walk to the London eye Westminster Abbey and Big Ben but not so close as to be surrounded by crowds Facilities were excellent staff was friendly the whole ambiance was very high end

504122,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Checking in out was painfully slow slower than any I ve experienced before After a long journey it would have been nice to have some bottled water in the fridge or a biscuit to have with tea but none of these small luxuries despite the room cost Oh and a lock on the bathroom door would be great it wouldn t shut properly as would batteries in the remote control , The location of this hotel is great Two minutes to Westminster Bridge The room was clean and comfortable with a fridge safe and small kitchen area Plenty of space

504159,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The breakfast was awful and when I advised the staff that it was unsatisfactory as we d paid extra for the complete English breakfast they couldn t have cared less suggesting in fact that since we d booked through Booking com that we d opted for the cheap route and therefore couldn t expect much and weren t entitled to anything We were just wondering if there was somewhere else within the property that we could eat they suggested the coffee bar downstairs our dime or Starbucks They did say that we could have room service that this was different food but really I ve never enjoyed eating in my bedroom and why would the quality of the food be better for room service than it is for the people who pay extra for breakfast the charge for the full English breakfast is noted to be 21 50 pounds it was worth 5 pounds It was fine if you wanted cereal and juice but again we paid for the Full English Breakfast and in that sense it was horrid My sister put her hand through the sheet on the last night of a 4 night stay the towels were old Again I think that the quality of the room reflected the fact that we d booked through Booking com The waste container in the bathroom was all dinged up and was barely large enough for the bag they had in it what s the point The desk was dusty when we arrived I was able to write in the dust They have a card in your room that they put on your bed each night asking you to consider foregoing cleaning services in return for a small donation to a charity obviously several people before us had opted for this as the room was not clean They do not however offer you the opportunity to have your room cleaned but forego the daily cleaning of your towels replenishment of soaps etc It was either cleaning or no cleaning , The Primo Bar was excellent service was very good staff friendly and the lobster rolls soup salad burgers selection of wines etc were all very good we enjoyed our first late night meal there so much we ate there 3 times in total The only down side of this restaurant bar they charged my sister 17 pound 50 for a Harvey Wallbanger essentially Vodka Galliano and orange juice wow

504162,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Asked for a nice view but got the view of the other side of hotel windows couldn t open the windows Didn t know there wouldn t be a smoking area on the 11th floor as my friend smokes she was a bit annoyed that she had to keep going to the bottom floor and outside Got checked in by a trainee and any questions we asked he couldn t answer properly which was okay as we understand he only started but maybe there should have been someone near, Staff Gregory the porter was very friendly and helpful Room service food lovely aminiety cake was left for my friend in our room which was lovely and unexpected Spa was lovely

504168,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, inside facing rooms are very dark and dull they look out onto the atrium Was offered an outward facing room for an increased charge but decided against it Get an outward facing room if you can just so some natural light gets into your room, Great location to base yourself in right on Westminster Bridge
504169,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Time allotted for use of pool only 30 mins This was ridiculous and not enough time to use facilities, Great Hotel Restaurants are good and the location is great 
504170,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, They tried to charge us for the free upgrade , All staff members we met were lovely but a special mention to the trainee receptionist that dealt with us during our stay We we re upgraded for free due to a birthday Big effort made for the birthday celebration thank you

504175,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The sofa beds in the rooms are comfortable for kids but I would not recommend them for adults There is a concierge but a little hidden downstairs , There was a great selection in the food and beverage for breakfast The lobby bar also had a good bar menu and great service 
504176,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Aside from the coffee cups a minor issue the stay was great nothing to complain about , Lovely clean hotel in a great location No complaints about the facilities the only tiny issue was that we had three people staying in the room and every day when the room was cleaned they only left us two coffee cups A quick call to reception fixed that as I said a very minor complaint 
504177,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing everything was fine from check in to check out and even after that the man outside hailing us a taxi , Really enjoyed the room upgrade and the magnificent view of Big Ben and the houses of parliament Thanks for that it made for a very enjoyable last night of our holiday 
504178,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, 2 or 3 members of house keeping did enter our room without first knocking which we found a little unnerving yes we could have bolted the door which we did do at night but a courteous knock wouldn t have gone amiss Although this was the first day so can maybe be forgiven thinking it was unoccupied , We upgraded to a room looking down Westminster bridge to the Houses of Parliament Westminster abbbey It was a mesmerising view We insisted on having breakfast in our room sat looking at this wonderment It made the stay a little pricey but it was well worth dipping into our pockets a little deeper 
504179,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Little over price Even for London Restaurant with few options , Location is awesome Close to major attractions Concierge is very nice and helped us getting around The view of Big Ben from the room is something The bar with live music is very good 
504180,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The room was dark, We had a family room and the main bed was very comfortable we just had to add an extra blanket on the mattress of the sofa bed but then it was fine The room was pleasant although a little dark during the day as there was no direct daylight which is good to sleep in in the morning though Excellent location it is so easy and quick to get anywhere Also really appreciated the gesture of the delicious birthday cake delivered to the room for the little boy s 10th birthday it made his day The pool was very nice too The reception staff was lovely we had a Catalan lady checking us in who was really lovely and personal in fact all the staff was very nice and friendly 
504181,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The receptionist was rude and provided us no information we had to ask where breakfast was and what time when was check out etc basic welcome information that you would supply to anyone checking in , Great location and most of the staff were lovely and helpful and I was comfortable staying there with children 
504182,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Cost an extra 40 for a room with a nice view One night for 2 adults two children was 320 bit pricey , Location is great The view from the room straight down Westminster bridge was a highlight for me 
504183,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Room was not clean and was very worn Could do with an update That being said it still felt like value for money given its location , Amazing location and well rounded facilities
504184,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, Stayed at the hotel for two nights and thought it was excellent Pricey as you would expect for London but with a deal the price compares very well with other hotels nearby and the facilities are much better Rooms are well appointed and comfortable and the hotel location is excellent for exploring London being close to Waterloo main line and underground stations as well as buses to various parts of central London The London Eye and the river are only a couple of minutes walk away Looking forward to staying there again later in the year 
504185,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, there was nothing we could fault this hotel on amazing from start to finish, Fantastic hotel with great little extras like the lovely refreshments while waiting to check in and also upgrading our room when the found out it was our mothers birthday and no telling us till we got into room was such lovely touch
504186,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The only negative I have is that if you feel claustrophobic the internal rooms have no direct natural light it is filtered through the hotels roof If I need to book again I would request an outside room If you re not bothered then you shouldn t have any worries , We wanted a location that was central and close to River Thames Everyone was very welcoming and seemed to know what they should be doing The room was very clean and easily accessible from the 8 lifts located in the lobby The bar located on the same level as the lobby was spacious and well attended offering afternoon tea and cakes as well as soft drinks and alcoholic beverages Breakfast was included in our booking which had a variety of cold hot food english and continental Would definitely use this hotel again 
504187,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Housekeeping is a bit hit and miss There were 4 of us in the room so we needed 4 mugs etc etc We were reduced to sharing a breakfast tea bag as they only gave us 2 At one point we ended up with 43 different flavoured bags and beverages except the ones we wanted We tried very hard to explain what we wanted but eventually gave up Having to book swimming pool times was awkward especially as information given at check in did not match information given from pool Did not like being sent to the basement for breakfast , Spacious rooms good check in out times good facilities very good family hotel great location 
504188,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Value 239 for two nights and no breakfast Phones to work in bedroom , Not value for money Stayed in cheaper hotels in London better value No phones worked in bedrooms Everyday breakfast in a different location Would not recommend 
504189,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, The bedroom was very comfortable and spacious and lovely clean hotel staff were helpful and friendly enough The location is also great and quite reasonably priced considering it s right in the City of London 
504190,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The check in and check out process was painful the staff looked quite confused at almost everything we said and we had to speak to managers a few times to make sure that the rooms were settled correctly and check in and check out took a very long time , The breakfast was lovely although a shame they could find us a big enough table for our group of 11 we had to split across several tables The rooms were absolutely lovely and especially the one bedroom suites they had superb views across Westminster Bridge 
504191,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing, Located near major train center easy walk to sights and quiet We had a one bedroom suite with kitchenette for 5 days It was perfect for having breakfast in and light meals if we chose and gave us space to relax after walking all day 
504192,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, At first a little disappointed as I booked a room with a view hoping for view of Westminster bridge but the view was of road works and Waterloo station terminus However on balance the room upgrade more than made up for it , Fast efficient check in and upgraded room
504193,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Having to leave to come home, Everything From check in to check out there were no problems Nothing was a hassle for any of the staff and they were all friendly and helpful The view over Westminster Bridge Houses of Parliament and Big Ben from the room was amazing I loved staying here 
504194,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, As above, Was good but was put in wrong room booked room with reviews and shared bed instead we got two single beds no view only of inside of building and was no high up in the building like requested Staff happily Changed our room but tried to charge us a fee to change rooms to a double bed and views 
504195,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Dark corridors but not really an issue just and observation Check in was quite slow but again not an issue , Perfect location for most major attractions London eye and big Ben on door step Buckingham palace 30 min walk 30 min walk in other direction to tower bridge Free upgrade on room to outside view of London eye and complimentary cake to celebrate our honeymoon 
504196,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Avoid Joel restaurant confused menu and spectacularly over priced 130 for 4 burgers and 2 glasses of wine Completely incompatible menu for clientele of the hotel , Good rooms clean modern and quiet 
504197,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Lighting , Bed really comfy Lighting was confusing in room on entry switching light on only the bathroom light came on so had to stumble in the half darkness to the light switch beside the bed to put the room lights on
504198,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, sometimes you have to ask or put a sign on the door in order to have the room cleaned Previous times there were some biscuits in the room and chocolate in the day of arrival This time there were not , Nice hotel Facilities are quite new and beautifully decorated Rooms for family are good studio king 
504199,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The accessible rooms are amazing but the bathroom doors need a second look the gap at the bottom means when or if you take a shower the carpet in the room ends up very wet too I could not shower on the final morning of my stay because I did not want to leave a soaking wet room behind , The property is close to everything and I do mean everything it s not expensive for a weekend and I have never met more helpful staff they couldn t do enough They acted promptly and quietly at check in when I was reviewing my emergency evacuation plan When I needed to change my room the service was prompt and very helpful And even before I had left Ireland when I phoned the hotel to ask would they be able to find me an emergency dentist the gentleman I spoke to was very kind and called me back promptly to give me the number of the dental surgery Not something I d ever expected to do on a trip but there you go I am very grateful for their help all throughout my stay and the concierge Dean deserves a special mention he s a whizz at getting cabs The staff in the bar were amazing and the food was wonderful Dragos makes a mean pi a colada And if you want good coffee go down to the little coffee bar on the ground floor opposite the cloakroom and get an espresso Greco and a waffle Worth it 
504200,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, The location of the hotel was excellent Close to two underground stations and central to main attractions It is a modern hotel with very pleasant and helpful staff The rooms are very spacious and comfortable I would definitely stay again 
504201,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing We loved our stay , The staff was excellent giving us a free upgrade so we had a little extra space with the baby was so thoughtfull Coffee was excellent Swimmingpool small but nice for a short dip 
504202,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Worst hotel ever not worthy for its 4 star price for its level of services and cleanliness After all my friend and I have been through I decide to take a few minutes to share my personal experience with this PARK PLAZA WESTMINSTER BRIDGE LONDON My friends and I got bitten from the night we stayed in seems to be by flea because the bites are always next to each other and couldn t sleep well in the middle of the night The highlight of our stay is that I found a dead bug in our room on our last night I raised it up to the customers service about its room cleanliness and the feedback we got from staff is they need to do the investigation first They sent me the pest control report later the day after we checked out basically saying they couldn t identify any precencse of hugs in our room But the thing is they got our bedding completely changed the night we found the bug and examed our room after we checked out and issued this report which basically trying to say those are not their problems How can we believe that The night when we called the customer service the staff said their manager will speak to us but so far after 2 days no one has called me but just one email with that unconvinced report attached from an customer relations officer from that hotel Still they didn t make an explanation about where this bug comes from No solution no whatsoever Some other concerning details including careless housekeeping staff didn t clean up the mirror forgot to replace the hand towels left cups unwashed for 2 days even though we put beside the sink the bed sheet also have dirty spots I m not using the luxury hotel standard to measure this hotel but I expected some basic cleanliness which this hotel seems to have a long way to go Also the professionalism and attitude in that hotel handling that issue needs better training too I can go on putting more details here but decided save more of my time on this terrible hotel ,No Positive
504203,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The view was not desirable as it was a window was closely parallel to a wall Even though the room booked was described to have interior view I did not imagine it would be this closed off The description of the room also included soundproofing but I felt this was not so as I heard people coughing in the corridor and people walking by I would advise the hotel to update these descriptions to not lead on their customers, The design of the room was modern had a spacious bathroom comfortable bedroom space and was kept clean The location of the hotel was well worth the price of the room as it was easily accessible to public transport and tourist attractions
504204,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The pillows on the bed were disappointing and not very comfortable to use Each one was different and rather lumpy is the best description When accessing the hotel by wheelchair please note the reception is up one level there are no signs to show this well none that I saw at wheelchair height We therefore spent some time circling round inside to ascertain where to go , The location was excellent and accessibility was good for me being an electric wheelchair user Receptionist we noted was a trainee and did an excellent job of making us feel very welcome and explaining where everything was within the hotel We popped down to see the pool and spa area although we ran out of time to be able to use maybe next time The disabled friendly bathroom was very good for my needs 
504205,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Being asked to move downstairs to have breakfast Asked to stay in restaurant and we were then allocated one of the many empty tables Therefore why is it necessary to seat people downstairs , Location excellent Staff great Have stayed here before and would do again Concierge service very good 
504206,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Pool and surrounding area bit scruffy floor no added extras like water and pool small very busy long queues for checking in and out, Really comfy bed fantastic breakfast choice and beautiful restaurant staff are amazing our waiter was anyway
504207,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Our bathroom kept flooding every time we used the shower Missed a restaurant reservation as we had to wait an hour for an engineer to fix the problem and have our bathroom cleaned,No Positive
504208,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The idea of instantly being charged for picking up anything from the mini bar even when you really haven t consumed it only makes it scary to even open and check for what is there on offer i had gone through this thus a bit cautious Also unable to use services like youtube over the TV set even though the option was available , My 2nd time in park plaza Westminster and opted for a twin sharing room and i was excited with what was offered and really happy once again Bravo Park Plaza team and i wish to see you all again soon 
504209,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The view we had the size of the room and the cleaning of the room bad service staff weren t helpful at all when I asked for a different view as I was facing a building they put me on hold for 20 mins phoned bk and the same happened again would have gone to reception my I had an appointment to catch had to shower and basically get a cab plus they could smile more, I liked the location and the sushi restaurant decor
504210,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, In the morning we made our way to the restaurant for breakfast purposefully waiting until after 10 00am so that it was less busy Upon arriving at the restaurant which was only half full we were directed downstairs to a half empty conference room with tables and chairs dispersed around the room for our breakfast I was intrigued by the large amount of young families and foreign tourists that had been sent downstairs as well as us with no similar groupings in the restaurant upstairs I had noticed that the restaurant was full of many people in suits having breakfast I found this extremely disappointing and this was not the experience that I had hoped for I or anyone else that stays at the Park Plaza should not expect to be treated any differently because of how we are dressed and I am dismayed to feel that if I had been in my business attire on Friday or this following Tuesday morning that I would have been seated in the restaurant I chose the Park Plaza because it is conveniently located extremely close to my work and I have only ever received recommendations from people to stay there However after this experience I will be seeking alternative accommodation for when I need to stay overnight in Westminster , The room was fantastic very clean and spacious Check in and out was very smooth and quick 
504211,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing we did not like about this hotel, The best nights sleep I have ever had in a hotel Room facilities were fantastic Reception staff kindly upgraded us from a superier room to a studio which made our anniversary trip extra special Could not fault our stay at all
504212,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I ve had the buffet breakfast before and I wasn t hugely impressed mainly because it was very busy noisy and difficult to get around to the food and back to the table again , We always stay at the Park Plaza Westminster every time we visit London whether I m there for business or leisure Staff are always helpful and friendly the location is excellent and the rooms are comfortable We love it 
504213,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The room is not isolated well annoying sound comes from the corridor at the morning The price became very expensive if you want good with you bar decoration and seats are old, friendly staff good location good gym cleanliness of room

504223,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The hotel was particularly busy on this occasion which meant a long wait to check in which is a little frustrating when all you want to do is get to your room after a long business day It is nobody s fault but I am surprised that express check in technology that you see in airports and some hotels premier Inn for example as not yet been adopted We make our reservations remotely now so the information is there , I often use the Park Plaza when I stay in London It is the combination of location and standards that make it ideal for me I find the rooms spacious and comfortable but more importantly clean The staff are professional and courteous and the facilities are excellent 
504224,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, Convenient to Waterloo and Westminster underground stations one block from the Westminster Bridge and a walk across the bridge to Big Ben and Parliament The London Eye is a short walk as well

504232,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The telephone in the room was not working seemingly because cleaning staff had not reconnected it correctly The wash basin plug was faulty and could not be repaired because relevant staff were not on duty on Sunday This defect was obvious and must have been there when the previous occupant of the room was there The plates for hot breakfast were cold because so I was told the heater was not working The person to whom I addressed my concern was unable unwilling to procure a hot plate from another source ,No Positive

504241,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, During the last night the cleaner of the riom forgot to refill the minibar with coffee and tea The ref mini bar was missing a cashew nut when we arrived so i hope it won t be charged to me as I reported it to them The coldness of the staff upon checking out after all the money I poured in the hotel Wasn t given extra hour to leave but this was okay When I checked in the warmth of the staff was definitely felt , A place where traveling to London is perfect Room service was fantastic Commendable for the supervisor who made sure we get the best of everything although I didn t get her name all who served us are the best 
504242,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The breakfast was repetitious always the same things We would have liked having a pancake or waffles for a change but we would have had to pay additional all hotels will have been to would not have an extra charge for this After spending 10 days The food had become very blah Always the scramble eggs which usually were cool and not tasty sausage and ham were very greasy The pastries were the only good choice , The second best was not very comfortable 
504243,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The staff was poor the room was not what we asked for The manner of the team was just so impolite There was works happening just outside that woke us up at 8am every morning This was not advertised at all anywhere When we asked to change room we was told no Will not go back here again , Like the fact it s close to attractions except that not allot else
504244,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Sofa bed was not as comfy as the mattresss was slightly thin , Very convenient location and close to bus stops and train stations Walking distance to local attractions London Eye Westminster Abbey Big Ben and plenty of restaurants in the vicinity Loved the daily buffet breakfast It was full of variety The staff were very helpful at all times and room service was very prompt Towels changed daily and room cleaned to perfection

504256,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Only 2 portions of coffee with 4 little milks Lighting was extremely poor Downlights spotlights strip lights but no combination was enough to do a lady s make up properly This low level lighting started in the foyer it was like entering a cave Not a good feeling , Bed comfy lovely pillows 
504257,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Everything to start nobody greets you at the entrance Talking about bags me and my wife had to carry our bags to the superior room on the 14th floor because staff could care less The receptionist was so rude I start questioning who maybe someone with no degree and any experience in hiring hired those people I can only guess what decision making process was behind the selection process The barman from third world country was so friendly to me that at some point it felt that I was his little bro as he called me or even better I was the servant not him Bathroom in the room was falling apart Awful Many other negative thing including no waiter in mini bar on the next business day I just wish I had never stayed in that awful hotel It actually more a Hostel for wealthy people than a 5 star Hotel , Nothing unfortunately Staff and especially senior management are rude to the point you want to change the hotel straight away I have never been treated by a senior manager with such a disgrace I wish I never stayed there 
504258,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Waiting at reception they brought us apple juice which was nice but I have no idea why it took so long to deal with a small number of people why did they decide to steam clean the bar at midnight when there were still many people in there enjoying a drink it was very noisy The bars and restaurants do not use the fabulous view instead you have to pay extra to get that privilege which is very annoying Pool looks great but its the whole spa is hardly relaxing when you have 20 kids screaming and jumping in the pool Surely kids should be allowed into the pool at set times rather than from 8am to 8pm when adults might actually want to enjoy a relaxing time at the spa, Location is excellent and the style of the hotel is interesting and modern Staff were very friendly although some could do with at least some local knowledge of the area 
504259,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Very expensive for a night but that is London Very limited tea coffee in room Would have expected more from the breakfast which was buffet style and not hot enough Staff communication poor , Fairly local to our job

504263,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I booked a room that was actually a room for people with disabilities I was not told that when I went to check in The hotel clerk only mentioned that there was no bath tub in the room which I sai d it was fine But to my surprise the room was not what I needed at all I quickly called reception and they told me that they could switch my room to one which had an external view for an extra 25 pounds I told me them that on booking com there were other rooms available for the same price I had paid The receptionist told me that booking com had not updated their system I was not able to take a shower and use the bathroom properly I am extremely disappointed in their lack of professionalism in dealing with this situation I would not recommend this hotel ,No Positive

504267,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, It wasn t the best value for money in hindsight and I had booked a breakfast room for two on booking com as well as added it to the special requirements to assure this but upon arrival I was told I had only paid for breakfast for 1 the breakfast was only decent definitely not worth the 15 The room temperature control wasn t very good normal was too hot and airconditioning was freezing would ve been better if we could actually open the windows , The room was lovely along with ensuite bathroom Decent breakfast and facilities 
504268,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I am visually impaired Although after a couple of days I could figure out the layout the halls seem to have been designed by M C Escher My room did not have a window but rather a glazed panel and elicits feelings of claustrophobia without natural light , The location the friendliness and kindness of the staff 
504269,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, This is a huge hotel in an area off Westminster Bridge which is packed with tourists If you want to be in the middle of Times Square this is the place for you The pool was only adults only in very early evening or morning so that was a drag This hotel was too big too busy to suit our tastes We also had so called security enter our room without knocking during the middle of the day claiming they were checking on the lock or some other nonsense , The property had a swimming pool the main reason for booking

504366,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Half of their service staff is either rude or clueless The other half service oriented ones resolving the mess creates by the former Staff in the restaurants and guest services are quite accustomed to respond by saying sorry for every service downtime and their response to the situation ends there , Location and property facilities are fine

504576,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Customer service was quite poor Delayed check in as room not ready Although I had booked a family suite there was no bed for my son and was expected to share They only had a booking for two adults and not a child until i showed them the booking confimation They did offer us a complementary drink and promised there would be a bed fory son On return back to hotel room at 10 30 there was no bed and on ringing down was told we had only booked for two adults and wanted me to go back down to reception I explained that I had gone through this at check in and all I wanted was some bedding Housekeeping eventually came to sort out It seems that the reception staff did not know what they were doing , Location of hotel and hotel room
504577,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, We have stayed here before and have always found the staff facilities and location very good A little mix up with our room on arrival but apart from that this could not be any better 
504578,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We did the breakfast buffet each day for a week and the servers were very slow to bring coffee and tea Also we stored our bags on the check out day and it took 15 minutes standing at the counter later that day for someone to stop chatting with their co worker and retrieve my bags Throughout our stay our sink was backed up and had water stains under the basin , Very comfortable bed and plenty of closet space Dinner at Brassiere Joel was great on Christmas with excellent service Work out room was clean and had the equipment we wanted Also there was excellent live music in the bar each night This was the perfect location for us Westminster and Waterloo tube stations were very close and was walking distance to The Eye Westminster Abbey Big Ben etc from the front door 
504579,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, To start there was a large queue to check in We had to wait about 15 min before even getting to a desk I noticed this was also the same each day The biggest issue I have is that we reserved a King Family Room It said it was 35M square but I can assure you it was around 30M only The room layout was terrible as the bed which was only a little larger than a double bed and definitely not a King sized bed was squeezed in a 13x13M area with very little room on each size In addition there was a hallway with a bathroom in the middle and also small and another small room maybe 10x10 with a sofa bed The sofa bed was only slightly larger than a single bed and not comfortable for two people I complained and asked for a larger room or a room that could accommodate maybe another bed or room with space for someone to sleep on the floor After discussions over 24 hours they said they were full and had not other options They did finally offer a room with the same layout and only slightly larger maybe 1 2 meters but it was not ready and they would not let me see it as it was not clean Meaning since I was going out for the evening I would have to move the family around 10 30pm As it was essentially the same room we decided not to move They did say I could have two adjoining rooms with no windows but that would cost me 400 pounds more They have no rollaway beds to put in any rooms If you have a family with two children you should get a two bedroom suite or stay elsewhere I did not ask nor they they offer a discount and even the staff members I talked to admitted that it was not a King Bed and the room was smaller than stated Also the hotel only had the room set up for two people even thought I signed up for 4 I then had to ask them to come and make up the sofa bed and then had to ask for more towels as only 2 towels were in the room , Our room was on the 9th floor and had an excellent view of the London Eye There is an indoor pool and fitness room These are located on a floor 4 however the location of these seem to be a missing opportunity to not put them in an area with a view The pool is small for the hotel size but nice and there is a sauna and a steam room The fitness room is nice with various cardio machines and weights One of the better fitness rooms in Europe The hotel was clean and had great ambiance in the lobby at Christmas with a nice sleigh for kids to sit and get pictures In addition the hotel is secure and at night they make sure only guests enter the hotel The temperature is easy to control in the room which makes it easy to regulate and adjust There are also various restaurants in the hotel and a coffee shop The hotel is 2 min walk from Starbucks and a nice Italian restaurant The Waterloo Tube and Train station is a 8 min walk and the walk to the Westminster Tube station which is next to Big Ben is also around 8 min Waterloo is not the best area but OK if you just head West and not East

504632,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, For a four star hotel I would have expected it to be a bit cleaner There were stains on the carpet and the curtains in our room the remote was a bit sticky and I don t want to know where the white spots on the backrest of the bed came from Also when we booked we expected the spa area to be freely accessible for guests but apparently that s not the case , The location of the hotel is excellent less than 5 minutes walking distance from Big Ben and London Eye The bed was very spacious and comfortable and although it s such a huge hotel it was very quiet at night The bathrobes were very fluffy not the worn out hard ones you usually get We got a free room upgrade from no window to window facing inner yard because there were no more rooms of the category we had booked available Staff was nice but service at the hotel bar was a bit slow

504638,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Going to the basement for breakfast was disappointing as there was no view or windows and upgrading our room as this view was very restricted and limiting Only seeing the top section of the London Eye Sauna was out of order and we would of loved to experience that relaxation As we chose this hotel for the spa facilities , Friendly staff and very helpful Fantastic location and venue Christmas decorations were fantastic 
504639,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The bedroom was so dark All black decor with hardly any lights Could not make tea as no light in that area The furniture was black gloss with a black kettle and black tray No biscuits and you had to pay about 3 50 for bottled water Would have expected that for a four star hotel The room was overlooking an internal area but it looked just like a prison Did mention lighting to staff at reception on our departure Great location shame about the black room, Hotel location could not have been better Within walking distance of all the attractions

504647,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, No value for money It is expensive but it was my choice but I expected more quality services Poor breakfast They have three places for breakfast and only the one has a little more variety Also very expensive without any reason Staff not polite not very rude they simply did not care I never felt as a customer It was like they did me a favor Glass door for the bathroom When we arrive they blocked the whole amount of my stay plus 50 pounds per day as guarantee and so far no problem But when they charged my credit card with the final amount they did not unblock the initial amount affecting the use of my card It was a like a double charge for a week I will never go again it left me a very bad feeling although I adore this city , Nice location nice room in general bed view

504659,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, 12 5 service charge for the drinks in the hotel is a lot and I was appalled to hear from a number of the staff that they don t receive any of this money I asked for the service charge to be removed so that I could give them cash was advised that they couldn t do this This policy gives a very poor impression of the ethos of the hotel and it s owners and will certainly be reflected in the feedback I give to others , We were there for an evening event and the waiters and waitresses did an excellent job I d particularly like to thank Cristina Ungur for being so attentive pro active and professional

504699,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, All aspects of breakfast were very poor in terms of management location in a conference centre due to overcrowding which was untrue food was dreadful management wandering around too few waiting staff who were under enormous pressure The worst breakfast experience that I have encountered When I articulated my views to the Breakfast Manager I was met with rudeness need I say more If this is a reflection of management training it leaves a lot to be desired , Restaurant food excluding breakfast

504710,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We booked the room for 3 people and only had 2 cups and 2 lots of shower gels Aldo on my return I checked my bank and 2 lots of 50 pound have been taken from my account The trainee receptionist didn t ask me if this was ok Why I only expected my card to be debited for anything g I purchased , Location excellent dry clean

504717,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Went down to the pool to relax However since it is a small area and lots of kids it was very loud and frustrating I understand this is out of your hands so maybe implementing a kids hour or two would make the pool area a little more peaceful , The view in our room was the best I ve ever had Big Ben and the view of the bridge were amazing 
504718,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, No enough seating area at night to enjoy a drink in the bar before bed , Great view of London Eye from the room Great Room The bed was really spacious and comfortable Bathroom had a bath and separate shower Pool and spa were lovely The break was meant to be a pre Christmas treat and it definitely was I felt welcome and they allowed us to check in early no hassle Breakfast was nice There were queues to get into the breakfast section but staff worked fast to get a table The location was excellent Walked past Big Ben and London eye from the tube station to get to our hotel About 10 15 minute walk from Westminter tube station you can actually see it from the bridge Would love to visit again Just need to save my pennies

504725,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The first room that was allocated which was what was advertised But it was very suppressive with only an internal outlook which is ok for a one night business stay but in my opinion totally unsuitable for longer after two nights we were upgraded at a cost but to a much better facility the breakfast is both expensive and very ordinary , Generally good efficient service and the room was very clean The lounge bar offered a good service and was pleasant to sit in The location is ideal for all central London sight seeing 
504726,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, there was nothing we didn t like , we got an upgrade with a perfect view of big ben also a beautiful cake brought up to our room for my wife s birthday none of which was expected all a very nice touch rooms were very modern and clean overall a brilliant hotel

504728,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, No shampoo conditioner in the spa shower But literally only negative, Location was perfect The pool and spa facilities were top notch and the evening entertainment perfected our day in the big city
504729,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I felt that the charge of 45 for parking was crazy and would never have driven if you would have made this clear It said on my booking that there was parking I presumed it was included Also it was advertised as a spa when we arrived we had to book it and was only allowed 30 mins This should have been highlighted we were very disappointed , The room was great View was great and overall experience 
504730,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We did not have time to go in the SPA Next time , Everything Pietro was very nice at the reception Breakfast was delicious Room was great Location was excellent 
504731,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Breakfast service was a bit slow at times and not efficient enough Had to keep asking for hot chocolate from different members of staff It did eventually arrive but abit too late Swimming pool attendant found her mobile phone and nails more important than actually supervising children in pool A potentially disastrous situation ,No Positive
504732,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Staff were SO disinterested there was one lovely young chap in concierge but apart from him we found we were barked into a better position in the check in line as we clearly weren t queuing tidily enough it just seems very cold and the staff seem so used to dealing with copious amounts of guests that they can t seem to be bothered even smiling on passing anymore We had a loud knock on the door at 9 30am on check out day to remind us to check out is this really necessary it s quite un nerving oh and the usual if you try to pay with a debit card they will ask if you have a credit card if I wanted to pay with a credit card that s what I would have presented then tell you because you have paid with debit card you have to pay as you go and cannot charge items to the room which instantly makes you feel like they don t trust you The lifts are a joke and the queues for them seem unrelenting they didn t work the day we left Clean comfy bed but the wardrobe doors were covered in finger prints the ledge of the wardrobe was covered in dust and the bedside table also had noticeable dust This was our second stay in London last time we stayed at the Apex and our stay was so much more enjoyable there as we felt welcomed and looked after and not an inconvenience , Modern building with good location Comfortable bed spacious room
504733,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Cleanliness poor in allocated first room Complained moved rooms in this second room the mini bar wouldn t open and phone wouldn t work so yet another trip to reception Upgraded to better room Staff overall indifferent attitude Also breakfast staff didn t know what a lemon fruit was and even though there was still 45 minutes till breakfast ended Items were running out , Bed was very comfortable Great location 
504734,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The location and room were fine However the water feed in to the room became black When I mentioned this to reception the response was well we ve had a few problems like that this morning In other words tough When I ordered a glass of red wine from the bar I was told the price was 12 50 I know this is London but I know when I am bring ripped off When I told the bar tender that rather than pay cash I will have it put on my room tab and take it up with the reception when I come to settle my bill within about 15 seconds the price dropped to 10 50 Coincidence , Location
504735,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, Upon check in the staff were all so polite and welcoming to stepping through the doors We were served by Shady who really polite and friendly and let us know about the other amazing little perks about staying here to the love music on the evening and spa treatments also Always had bad experiences with hotels just but staying here has just been above and beyond anything we stayed the 1 night and I ve never been amazed as soon as I walked into our hotel room as I did here The room was spotless and bathroom was fantastic with a separate shower and a superb bath which I loved Everything is so easy to get too and within walking distance from either Embankment or Waterloo station couldn t fault anything Celebrating my boyfriends birthday before he is deployed for a while this was our last little trip together till next year and arriving back in our hotel there was a lovely little note and an AMAZING CHEESECAKE left for us reading Happy Birthday and to enjoy our stay from Celeste Sullivan Guest relations manager I was certainly not expecting anything so kind and for that I m beyond grateful Breakfast in the morning was just brilliant the staff were soo efficient and quick and still so friendly the choice of food was brilliant even for the picky eaters like my self and winner of Peanut Butter Checking out was a breeze and we were then served by the lovely Nicole who made sure our stay went well and was really friendly the kind of service you expect to get from any hotels you tend to stay at and I will never stay anywhere other than here in the future Thank you Park Plaza for the most amazing experience here at your wonderful hotel me and my partner were amazed by your service and can t wait to come back again next year HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and family friendly too you won t be disappointed x X x 
504736,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, I liked the view that u could see Big Ben I also loved the location and the hotel room was amazing and we got upgraded for free for it being our first time
504737,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, No shopping malls nearby though that was not a major problem, Great location for visits to Westminster house of parliament and London Eye restaurants served great food 5 minutes taxi ride 10 minutes walk from Waterloo underground station
504738,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I was at the breast Cancer care do which was great then we went to the disco in the other room where it was in full swing then the music stopped dead on 12 30 I think you missed a trick on how much money you would of made at the bar , All of the food was excellent The checking in and out was very fast The room was very clean 
504739,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Breakfast arrangements were rather chaotic too many guests for the number of tables with some guests having to sit on low level sofas in the bar area not ideal Long wait of 20 minutes for hot water on the buffet for teas coffee to be replenished One small not very efficient toaster for all those people really not enough , Excellent central London location with helpful friendly staff Clean well equipped and very comfortable room 
504740,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The staff were rude and unhelpful They had no portable fans or at least not that they could find service was slow was waiting 30 mins at 1am for a charger and when rang down on several occasions as wanted to go to bed was told he 2 mins after waiting ages for anyone to answer phone No empathy on check in when obviously v tired as just finished work at midnight but had me waiting for ages to check in no apology just kept doing something on computer then when I clearly wanted to be quick tried to get to join loyalty scheme at gone midnight , Comfy bed location
504741,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The arrangements for breakfast could have been more efficient and the quality of the hot breakfast buffet was a little disappointing , The hotel was very comfortable with a wonderful front on view across Westminster Bridge to Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament 
504742,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Buffet breakfast was monotonous and tasteless Scrambled eggs tasted like out of a bag and mixed with water Cereal selection was poor recommend adding muesli Items ordered from breakfast menu were no better We ended up skipping breakfast even though it was included in room rate Maid service was inconsistent half the 7 days we were there the maid did not replace wash cloths , Room service was excellent
504743,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Stayed a few days later again for business Ate in the room and the food was really not very good at all a very cardboard like pizza Breakfast was also pretty tasteless Some staff were OK but others were brusque and did not lift the spirit at all This hotel has such a throughput it looks somewhat worn out Aircon also fairly noisy both times , Only the location really 
504744,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Although the shower was good there was a leak from the door had we been staying longer this would have been reported Late night drinks in the bar would have been better if accompanied by a few nibbles or even the odd peanut But that s nit picking , Very comfy bed and pillows given a quiet room as requested and the staff were able to allow an early check in on the day very helpful to us as we were attending both an afternoon and evening function at the hotel The gluten free options at breakfast were excellent overall an excellent stay in a good location Good value for money too 
504745,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The room was very dark which was probably due to the fact it was an internal room I wouldn t choose this room again due to this The wifi was poor in the room we couldn t get a signal, The location is excellent
504746,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The house keeping knocked at 8am and 845am even though we were only staying one night and had not vacated the room There should be a system where they know when the key has been returned and they should definitely not knock twice after been turned away once Rooms near the lifts can hear the lifts going up and down all night, The blackout curtains were fab and the free upgrade a bonus Room was a great size and nice elemis freebies 
504747,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Wi for was very unstable but I think that is the only thing we could criticise , Great location amazingly busy lobby good bar friendly helpful staff Room was very comfortable and we loved the mood lighting 
504748,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Too crowded You have to queue for everything from beakfats to the swimming pool And remember you will not be able to use the pool more then 30 minutes because every half hour they have the new shift of people willing to bathe I say bathe not swimming because there are always too many people all togheter Last day after five nigths I have asked for a late check out form 12 to 2pm No way to get it because they were already fully booked For the same price you can get really much better in London , The view with the Big Ben just ahead The scramble eggs at breakfast 
504749,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Breakfast was unfortunately a bit less No bread rolls no croissants no sandwich bread etc all empty Had to ask3 times after half an hour I asked the responsable and then we were served within 5 minutes There was enough staff to guarantee a complete buffet I know it was very busy with the family holidays but this is no reason to leave the buffet with empty baskets and plates The quality of the bread and croissants was excellent Pancakes were with surcharge I think this should be included in the price , Very nice room excellent with children Hotel near Big Ben excellent location Staff all very friendly and helpfull We will certainly go back 
504750,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The lighting system in the rooms is poorly designed For example turning the lights off in the bedroom turns the lights off in the whole suite Bathroom lights are outside of the bathroom It s awkward , Location and rooms were great The full breakfast was fresh and plentiful Staff was very friendly 
504751,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, Central location at Westminster Bridge with a Big Ben view Modern comfortable and well appointed rooms Responsive housekeeping extra Nespresso no worries Easy access to transportation hubs and tour bus pick up For business work room was set up well and accommodating of multiple laptops

504873,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Although I enjoyed my stay and thought the breakfast was enjoyable I I thought it was completely overpriced especially as its buffet style that would be my only negative about the hotel if I was to stay here again I would have breakfast elsewhere there was no price list next to the breakfast so we didn t know how much it was before we sat down , I thought the hotel looked stunning it was amazing to walk into and lovely and clean the room was lovely too beds were so comfy the bathroom was very impressive the staff were friendly and helpful the location was excellent only a very short walk away from Waterloo station I loved how as soon as you walked out of the hotel Big Ben was right in front of you and the London eye was very close also I liked the feel of the hotel made you feel like you were on holiday and we were only there for one night overall we had a lovely time at a very impressive hotel

504877,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, This is not a complaint just something that grand hotels and small B Bs all over the world don t get right the combination of a flat surface mirror and plug socket preferably in good light means that a person can style their hair and put their make up on without rearranging the room and taking a personal extension lead and mirror The bathroom is usually too steamy and the other person s usually using it Just a tip , Excellent location over the bridge from the Houses of Parliament on South Bank round the corner from London Eye Tate Modern Festival Theatre Lambeth Palace etc Great dinner at hotel good value too Short walk over Westminster bridge from tube Stayed one night Great staff Breakfast 14 50 but good cafe in lobby a hot breakfast muffin with sausage egg and THREE slices of back bacon was 3 50 Illy coffee too A great stay

504883,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Front desk is handled by trainee she was not able to allocate room every time you ask for anything she will go inside the staff room and come back after 4 mins , Location
504884,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, To be absolutely blunt two words The staff For the level of hotel it is obvious that they don t invest in good staff or customer focused staff training The staff are all non uk nationals which is a shame for visitors to the heart of London They really DO NOT CARE if you enjoy your stay I would guess that as most are tourists they bank on never seeing you again so don t care what you think of their level of service The check in out dear is woefully understaffed at all times and it takes 15 minutes for them to deal which each person in front of you And this was at quiet times Once checked in don t plan on going to the bar or the restaurant without CASH as they refuse to serve you regardless of room grade I have NEVER experienced this anywhere in the world they treat their guests as untrustworthy from the start And they don t won t take contactless payments either It is the most UN customer focused hotel I have ever stayed in in London Everything is too much trouble Regardless of how normal it is elsewhere , The view of Big Ben at breakfast

504886,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The staff on the doors were very friendly and helpful as was the young concierge who got us a taxi when we were going back to the airport They suggest you only ask for clean towels if you absolutely need them This would work if they supplied adequate towel rails to hang up the wet towels after use The lighting was complex and difficult to understand There were no beside lights so that I could read during the night when I couldn t sleep There are only 2 restaurants one French whose food my husband doesn t like and the other Japanese and I don t like The only edible food for us was from the room service menu There was no information in the room such as wifi passwords how to work the lighting etc It was all supposed to be accessed through the TV but that was useless There were lots of silly little cards dotted about telling you that this is the telephone etc We had booked in for 2 nights and the although the beds were made after the first night the high gloss table tops were not and they looked extremely grubby We were checked in by a trainee with no obvious supervision Because I am disabled I had to fill in what turned out to be a complex document Whilst I was doing that she was talking to me She had a very heavy French accent and eventually I had to tell her that I could either listen to her or I could complete the form I couldn t do both Thankfully she stopped talking until I was finished However her accent was very difficult to understand , I was visiting the Westminster Parliament so location was excellent 
504887,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Having stayed here several times before this was the first time we had to be horded into a massive reception room in the basement for breakfast on 3 consecutive mornings Granted it was during the busy summer season but the stark contrast with the more cosy friendly atmosphere in the restaurant which we had become used to did detract from our expectations and experience , The courteous helpful service received from Shady at the Club Carlson Reception counter

504923,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Hi I have recently come back from one of your hotel at park plaza Westminster As a loyal customer I like to mention that I was not happy with a few things which I encounted during my stay Firstly I would like to mention that as I arrived to the hotel our luggage was not offered to be taken into my room In camparison on my previous visit the doorman offered to take my luggage to the room Secondly as I entered to check in I mentioned clearly to the receptionist that I have booked 2 rooms for myself and my family however as I entered my room i realised they gave us the wrong room which was smaller in camparison to what I ordered Another issue which arose was that the lifts were not working and this had not been looked at Finally I would like to add that I had to ask 3 4 times to get a robe and slippers to my room , The cleaness
504924,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Shower didn t work properly it was only a trickle Only one tea bag so had to call for more Scrambled eggs tasted like powdered eggs , Convenient location 
504925,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Check in was a little slow but should not detract from overall excellent standard, Considering it is LONDON and the fantastic location of the hotel and the standard of facilities on offer this hotel is great value for money and in my opinion hard to beat I will return and recommend The breakfast was superb for such a large hotel
504926,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, the reception area was extremely noisy and busy Expected the room to be noisy but it wasn t, The room was a very good size and surprisingly quiet The bed was comfortable and the bathroom excellent as it had a bath and separate shower

504931,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Hotel doesn t have car parking so this can be quite expensive given the area , The studio room was a decent size and the small kitchenette was nice The indoor pool was great for the kids but remember to check if you need to book a slot especially during busier periods 
504932,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We turned up to a room that had dirty bed sheets bed wasn t even made and dirty wet towels In a heap on the floor a bottle of water poured all over the floor smell of wet paint half used shower gels shampoo conditioner milk sachets Felt so uncomfortable I Phoned reception from the room to inform them and house keeping came after half an hour with 2 clean towels and were very rude I decided to go down to reception myself and spoke to a manger who changed us to another room which had broken glass around the tea stained sink area it was very dusty After finding there was only one bath robe I was told I d need to go back to the old room to collect a second bath robe where I was told to go home by staff Perfect location in London shame about the staff that really let it down Never felt so uncomfortable in a hotel absolutely disgusted with the lack of care when I spent around 180 for this hotel stay which was a surprise on the day of my partners birthday to take him away after recent devastating stress within the family , Location

504935,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, There seems to be some kind of rule where you can t use the swimming pool more than 30 mins in the period between 4pm and 8 pm Although this was not strictly reinforced it s definitely not what we expected from a hotel that advertises it s swimming pool and spa facilities The level of service is ok and the staff is professional but no more than that Breakfast could have more fresh ingredients i e not only canned fruits and paying extra for items such as pancakes or eggs benedict is definitely a no , During our stay the hotel was extra busy but we didn t have to wait a lot either for check in or breakfast Our bedroom studio was ideal to stay with children as it had an almost separate living area where they could sleep For the price in London I doubt we could ve gotten much better 
504936,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, rooms needed better attention on cleaning there was food left over from previous people that stayed very dusty , great central place right in the heart of london

504944,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing really to note but breakfast in the ball room was a bit odd too vast size rooom to be really relaxing cosy and generally not in keeping with rest of our experience , Great location great staff and great facilities Family suite perfect for our needs and really enjoyed being able to have a swim with family 
504945,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Having to leave , Fabulous hotel in great location Staff couldn t have been more helpful or polite and the service top rate I paid the extra for a room with a view of big Ben and it was well worth it 10 10 from us 
504946,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Was amazing i cant really find a fault , We were greated very nicely and we was instantly upgraded to a top floor room The room was amazing and lovely and clean The pool sauna and steam rooms were a very pleasent free adition to hotel guests Overall would live here if i could 
504947,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The reception person wasn t too polite and didn t speak good English The room was dirty and smelly We asked to change and have been waiting for 15min for a colleague to come and help us to move Obviously no one showed up and we had to move ourselves The public spaces are tired , This is used to be a great hotel for the great price Not anymore 
504948,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Bizarre light switches in room V confusing Obviously can t see the switches if wake up in the night Really needed a bedside lamp, Coffee shop and bar lunch both lovely 
504949,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We could only get wifi if you had breakfast included , Hotel was Excellent we had a family room beds were comfy and good customer service nothing too much trouble Location was the best 
504950,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The spa and swimming pool area were poor Stated no children after 8pm and we went in at 8 30 and there were still quite a few present dirty towels all over the changing room floor and no clean towels for us to use Dissapointing, Bed was very comfy and views from the 15th floor were great
504951,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Despite having requested a family room for 2 adults and a 1 year old we had to pay an extra 14 on checking in as we were told we had only booked for one person which was wrong we booked for our family Had to ask 3 times for a cot for my daughter which was finally brought to the room after 9pm despite being requested initially in booking and on checking in at 6 and the 2 further calls after Using the stairs with pram and cases as the lifts became faulty was less than ideal For the location and look of the hotel it was a disappointment Very overrated , Location
504952,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Very strange non standard a c controller with no way to set a temp small rooms even smaller bathrooms shower didn t have closed area so whole bathroom floor got wet room carpets very old and dirty , Great location busy lobby with a nice cafe bar taxis at the front very secure
504953,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Poor wifi not up to standard , The room is big enough to put one king size bed and a sofa bed cos I was staying with 2 kids When I checked out with my 2 big luggages Michael was kind enough to help me sending the luggages to car while my family was waiting for me there
504954,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, For the price lack of amenities bathroom in particular was spartan by comparison to other hotels in the price range Get a room with a view rooms without views have frosted out glass which do not allow any natural light in at all giving the room utterly bizarre ambience during the day , Good location next to Westminster Underground station Rooms were comfortable and clean large by London standards too Breakfast was excellent large choice and staff were the best in the whole hotel 
504955,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing, Fabulous suite upgraded in check in to include a view of London Eye Spotlessly clean and excellent staff Fantastic location for exploring South Bank surrounding area 
504956,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, the interior rooms are very dark even with all the lights on and it s kind of basement like Only one chair in the room and a confusing lighting system , The location simply can t be beat close to just about everything you want to see in London Very helpful staff
504957,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The staff always incredibly rude Ignored you and always in groups chatting Coffee not replaced dirty and ripped sheets on the bed , The size of the room
504958,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The scrambled egg was disgusting not quite sure what was in it but it tasted more like cottage cheese but there was loads of other choice This is the only negative thing I can think of and it didn t affect our stay at all , This was a little pricey for us so we were only staying 1 night but it was worth every penny We had a king studio room the kids had a sofa bed in the living area which was already made up ready for us we had a slight view of the London eye to the left if we had been a little higher up the view would have been amazing although we were more than happy Lovely modern bathroom and the kitchen facilities were a great bonus The breakfast had a massive choice and was mostly very good We were downstairs in the second room and it was packed but the food was hot and service fab The small children play area in the corner was a genius idea The Location was perfect for exploring London Pretty much as close to Westminster bridge as you can get and 1 min walk to the embankment with all the entertainment and bars restaurants and less than 5 mins to the underground The whole hotel was spotless very modern and fancy A real treat 
504959,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The staff had a hardtime understanding English and also had great difficulty explaining things to us Also the price we were quoted on a English website didn t tell us that they meant in Pounds when we were thinking the price was in dollars, Location was perfect
504960,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, My only criticism was that housekeeping arrived late in the day to make up my room generally around 4 00 or 4 30pm I was normally out of the hotel most of the day since my trip was primarily business but I arrived back at the hotel around 3 30 4 00 a time when I really needed access to the room 4th floor It was for me an inconvenient time for housekeeping to make up the room Not a major issue and I would strongly recommend the hotel , The hotel is an exceptional contemporary design with an iconic view of Westminster Bridge and the Houses of Parliament It is modern and comfortable with a highly professional staff It has several good restaurants Service in general was top notch 
504961,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Couple of things that need improvement 1 We can t comment on the first breakfast we paid for because we missed it due to sleeping in But the second one was a big disappointment because the makeshift set up in the conference hall was not up to standard and the coffee was too strong solution given to us was adding water to it We understand this was on a weekend and the hotel was probably fully booked The breakfasts afterwards served in their proper restaurant were all good despite limited choices 2 The staff were by no means rude but they indeed came across as a bit cold Our ranking would be higher if the staff were more friendly We noticed that quite a number of their staff members housekeeping maids restaurant servers have difficulty communicating in English , The hotel s location is perfect We have no problem staying here again Our family of 4 2 adults with two young children paid 500 Canadian per night with breakfast Next time we ll come here in shoulder season if such a thing exists for London

504967,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The room systems lights didn t work the queue at check in was unacceptable , Good location good facilities comfortable beds quiet good value for London

504969,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The lighting system in the rooms was very confusing and you could never get all the lights on in both rooms at the same time , Well laid out rooms and great location 
504970,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, They could have supplied sheets and blankets as required They could have explained how I could sleep with the bathroom light on all night or told me how to turn it off The hotel could not be in the middle of a very busy traffic round about with headlights shinning in the window all night and for 200 quid the staff could have been pleasant,No Positive
504971,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Please see above , We had a lovely time But the only thing that messed it up was The lack of communication between the front desk and the spa I had emailed the treatment details over twice in a fortnight but once we got there nothing was sorted or booked this was extremely disappointing as the treatment was meant to be a surprise for my wife We finally had to go directly to the spa take the last available slot on the Saturday completely rearrange our dinner reservations evening plans 
504972,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Hard to take a shower because water is pouring to the floor , Excellent location close to all London attractions Also very quiet despite being close to one of the busiest bridges in London 
504973,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The reception area reminded me of checking in at an airport terminal The room was very dark and one couldn t get a mobile phone signal from the room, The interior design of the bedroom Great location

504983,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, A bookable taxi service one that you can easily book on line or by phone is 50 of the fare costs if we were to use the hotels car service to LHR we would have preferred to use the hotels own services even at a small premium but not at double the regular costs , Location is perfect for seeing the sights easy access to many things by walking and by bus train taxi if going further afield Great concierge services and advice Easy and quick check in and out services Great insulation from traffic noise Microwave small fridge kettle etc all good for breakfasts in the room which is nice with kids in tow 
504984,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, House keeping staff though very nice and polite will skip things when doing your room Cleaning is so so room is dusty with smudgy glass surfaces Terrace has lots of spider webs and once we saw a big one that can harm small children if they are bitten Last three days they skipped shampoo and soap and tea replinishement Once we left to breakfast and kept dont disturbe on as our personal belongings and valuables were not arranged yet We came back to find a house keeping staff inside our room with door closed If you get the 13 to 15 floors and you have a baby trolly yiu cannot use G to L escalators and its annoying that you need to switch elevators from G to L then from L to your floor as elevantors are very busy and the only elevator that goes directly from G to 13 is the one shared with Spa at 4 and is very hard to get Breakfast is very good but lacks variety and change as we spent 9 days eating the same breakfast every day but it wasnt big deal Sofa bed they offer in the living room is not comfy , The location is superb and near most of main london attractions You can walk to London eye shrek adventure sealife big ben and access most of other locations through bus 453 and 148 Make sure you get the oyster card Supermarket cafes and some nice casual and fine dining restaurants are also a walking distance Rivers Thames cruises are also 5 minutes away Conceirge is very helpful and will get you what you want in a quick and professional way Special thanks to Recardo Staff are very helpful polite neat and welcoming Guest relations are keen to solve any issue you have Check in and check out process is very smooth Free Wifi is very fast and reliable Belke from reservations made our stay great and gave us a nice suite with terrace overlooking big ben Dailia from breakfast was a great help and very professional with a nice smile Taxis availability at the door Big thanks to Park Plaza well done Kids club and events are v good 
504985,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, Very convenient location two tube stations to choose from Room was quiet and clean Bed was very comfortable Free WLAN Staff was very helpful and friendly We also had breakfast at the hotel two mornings and were pleasantly surprised that we did not have to pay for the child 
504986,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Two main points that dented the hotel in my opinion 1 Checking in was not great A queue of people waiting only two staff for checking in and then when she finished ignored the waiting people and disappeared had to speak to the remaining staff member to ask where everyone went 2 Major let down was the WI FI KIds had their IPads and they couldn t use them like they wanted , Wi fi was not great very little reception both in internal room and studio King room we had The location is great Walking distance from Southbank Executive breakfast was great Breakfast in the main area was nice however the overflow to the ballroom was it good felt like a production line I would recommend and would come back again 
504987,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Prhibitively expensive for a family of four For a 4 star City hotel having to ask for the room to be turned down for the evening was disappointing It was not cleaned on one day Communication regarding disability was confusing and having to inform the desk on leaving and returning was frustrating due to the desk not being manned on occasion we were then told it was not necessary to do this The pool is not ideal for smaller children as it is out of their depth It might be helpful to make this clearer , Great location Some helpful and friendly staff 
504988,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Felt irritated at check in we were asked to pay an upgrade fee to secure a double room with a bath which is what I requested when booking The room was wam and the aircon was noisy , Bed was very comfortable and very large All staff were charming 
504989,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The pool area was small and not very relaxing due to it being school holidays and lots of kids being there I suspect during school term time it will be OK for a quick dip , The room was clean and modern and equipped with everything we needed Shower was very powerful The location was perfect for our trip We were able to walk to all the major attractions Buckingham Palace theatre China Town etc without needing to use the underground or taxis We also used the clipper boat taxi service to get to and from the O2 arena It was quick and efficient and with a jetty at the London eye was less than 5 minutes walk to the hotel 
504990,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, That we never came across this great Hotel sooner , The Hotel was awersome from the minute you walked in to leaving fantastic location great views We had a complaint with a light it was delt with straight away and we were upgraded staff very polite A big thankyou X 
504991,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We could hear the elevators go up and down all night The Wi Fi connection was very poor and when we call the front desk their tech support people could not help us By the way we were in room 503 , The proximity of Big Ben and Westminster Abbey 
504992,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I think for the price a small breakfast could have been included , The room was great we loved the big window The bathroom was great too We loved the lobby and especially loved the location Walking out and seeing Big Ben every morning Close to a lot of the things we wanted to see on our trip 
504993,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The hotel lacks a lounge area, large rooms with excellent facilities Superb location of the hotel super efficient and attentive staff Wide choice of breakfast menu

504996,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, More seating areas that were not part of the bar or restaurant Also would like to have been offered the premium lounge on checkin I would have used this had I known about it , Closeness to things and sights Enjoyed Primo and the entertainment
504997,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The spa is full with children they are loud so you can t really relax they have a non children time but just the first and the last hours so you have to be really early bird or the last person in the spa to enjoy the quiet hour The bathroom s light switch decided not to work after few switch whole night the light was ON in the bathroom which is very annoying when you just wanna rest not impressed oh and when you book Booking com deal price in this hotel they give you a room designed for disabled people which is a bit depressing when you are not disabled this is in the small letter part so far as the receptionist told us not happy i don t think i will go back , Location is great and it is a nice quality feels hotel at first see my Cons
504998,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I found the room lighting difficult We had a problem with the bathroom light on all night, Spacious room for 3 people Staff considerate and attentive Executive lounge offered a good space to relax

505002,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Breakfast was poor and disorganized It didn t really match the quality of the hotel and its services , Location is perfect Close enough to many interesting places to visit yet in a quiet place 
505003,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The swimming pool was not watched by employees and due to this some children were quite rough There was also a time slot of only 30 mins for my children to use it There is also not enough seating for a parent to watch when all the swimmers place their towels on the beds , Great breakfast nice employees and wonderfully central Also modern and very clean 
505004,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing to mention, Great location just near Westminster bridge London eye and Waterloo station Spacious Clean comfy room excellent bed and bath facilities
505005,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Initial check in took forever No conversation Very methodical Trainee Management Staff crossing the lobby from one side to the other Focus on guests , Staff in F B very friendly and apparently happy at what they do 
505006,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Many upsetting events that made this hotel stay a nightmare My fiancee and I booked several rooms for us and our family as we were holding our wedding in London I do not recommend you to stay there 1 Very unprofessional welcome Porter stood there watching us as we exited our taxi with tons of luggage without any offer from help from any of the staff from arrival till we reached the lobby 2 We entered our room to discover it barely had any window This was made more horrendous as we told the lobbyist we were staying at the hotel as we were getting married in London that weekend The person at the lobby didn t even care The only thing we could do is pay an extra 90GBP per night to get a decent room with decent lighting 3 Our room was supposed to be cancellable modifiable up to 24h in advance We had tried to modify our booking a week before arriving as we had to shorten our stay from 4 nights to 3 nights Instead of cancelling one night for free as they advertised the online booking wouldn t cancel one night under the excuse that there is no space available which makes no sense since I was just cancelling a night under the booking that I HAD They made us rebook the entire stay so 3 nights at a much higher price around 40 more expensive Multiply that by 4 4 rooms and the bill goes up significantly 4 The cleaner came in while we were in the room and instead of properly cleaning changing the drinking glasses in the room she just wiped them with a cloth with no washing God knows how many people have had a drink from that glass There was also hair in almost every towel in the bathroom 5 The hotel mistakenly cancelled the room of a family member and we had to waste 30 min for them to find the booking again CONCLUSION DO NOT STAY THERE IT S OVERPRICED and the level of service is worthy of a 2 star hotel on top of the rip off with the booking modification ,No Positive
505007,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing , Studio room was great for family Really spacious for London Fantastic location Great bathroom and toiletries Small swimming pool was perfect for a little swim at the end of the day for the kids Will stay here again next year probably 
505008,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, There is no sound proof sometimes notice a noisy, The site is not working it was very nice I LIKE the hotel all over I would rate the staff the room the location 10over10
505009,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Room kind of small even though I up gread to biger one room need to have more closets and drowers house keeping need to do better job, Loocation is great
505010,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Lighting in room was so dark couldn t see anything Quite depressing Not unique to this city hotel but breakfast pricing was ridiculous , Great location for some of London s attractions Good facilities in room and comfortable bed Staff in business centre very friendly and helpful when we had a wifi connection problem 
505011,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Internet is pathetic Staff doesn t pays attention Rooms are sad and need repair especially for basics like sink and all, Nothing except location
505012,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Having informed Park Plaza that we should be arriving at the hotel between 1300 and 1400hrs we actually arrrived at 13 25hrs we were dismayed to find our room was not ready come 1400hrs At 1430 the room was still not ready at which time I was informed by Reception that it it would take a further 40 minutes At this point a senoir member of staff was summoned who satisfactorily resolved the matter Breakfast time some food items in short supply , Twin bed studio pleasantly relaxing

505017,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The sofa bed for the kids was awkward to put in and out Couldn t leave it out as floor space was limited also the sheet on the sofa bed was dirty when we arrived , Room service was so quick and ordering was flawless and tasty 
505018,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The bed in the room was very uncomfortable and not very happy given the price paid I was also disappointed at how much cheaper the room appeared to be on offer for at the time of my stay, Rooms were excellent other than the bed Swimming pool was good and enjoyed the food in the restaurant
505019,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Housekeeping kept forgetting to leave towels Concierge gave inaccurate information regarding Buckinghma Palace Baggage storage was painful when collecting , Rooms was great size and clean Fantastic location to Big Ben

505021,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We weren t very keen on our interior room We found the lack of natural light unsettling and felt rather claustrophobic Added to this not having individual bedside lights was a draw back Also we were surprised by the lack of drawer storage and the relatively small wardrobe In fact the room was rather small What if you could prioritise interior rooms for those staying only one night , The staff were FANTASTIC Always helpful cheerful and attentive They took time to talk to us while carrying out their duties professionally We also enjoyed the interior design and ambience of the public spaces in the hotel 
505022,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Room still being cleaned at 4pm one day and didn t seem throughly clean dirty cup not changed , Great location beautiful design Beds were very comfortable
505023,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Extremely expensive in view of being opposite the Houses of Parliament with no view of them whatsoever Staff kept entering the room to ensure we would meet the 12 o clock checkout deadline which we would have and did anyway , Spacious and comfortable room Well equipped 
505024,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Lovely facilities however when using the spa our relaxation was stopped by children jumping in and out of the pool splashing people screaming and not respecting the facilities Maybe having the pool for adults only for longer times not just 6 8am and 8 10pm 6 10am would be perfect and longer in the evening would be nice , We arrived at the hotel at 9 30am and we wanted to drop our bags so we can go and explore the attractions nearby Our room was already available so we got straight in unpacked and on our way Such a lovely start of our trip Brill location for attractions by foot and tube station is only 5 mins away Choice of restaurants In the hotel and they are not too expensive and taste amazing Clean and modern rooms will definitely return 
505025,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, One staff member we contacted didn t speak terribly good English but we still managed to make ourselves understood so it was fine in the end If you are sensitive to traffic noise it might be worth asking for a room further away from the road , Fantastic location for London sightseeing The room was big enough for three of us and would have been fine for a family of two adults and two children too and had excellent blackout curtains The pool area was nice and not crowded when we went down Staff were friendly and helpful despite the size of the hotel and large number of guests 
505026,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Bottled still and sparkling water in the room would have been nice Sofa bed could have been more comfortable, Lovely spacious family suite Incredibly comfortable bed 
505027,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Breakfast is a disaster tones of people some are sent impolitely to basement Crowded everywhere lobby lifts restaurants Staff not willing to help not professional and impolite Price not worth to stay in such environment and services Tones of customers but the hotel does not have enough staff and space to handle Selling Executive Lounge everywhere feel like we didn t pay enough for the services , Location
505028,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Pool too little for the number of hotel guests Breakfast option of 21 pounds is not competitive with the pubs in London , Superb location for tourists Luxurious studio rooms Very sound proof for outside noise Good coffee bar also for quick breakfast and lunch

505032,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Very poor customer service The room was dirty and the sofa bed was not made up ready for the stay The staff were average to say the least and I would never stay at this hotel again Very disappointing considering the reviews I had read , Good location and valet parking a good service 
505033,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The toilet roll holders weren t in a easy to use location A designated kids play zone with toys interactive toys to play with would be a good idea Supervision would be good , We liked assistance from the Business Centre and Carlton Club although the points weren t accrued because my wife booked through Booking com this wasn t explained 
505034,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Standard lamp reading light very tired showing signs of age very cracked shade , Excellent position location Very comfortable room with brilliant bathroom 
505035,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Trouble with wi fi in room wasn t solved despite visit by engineers 2 pleasant men Breakfast is good but no more than that Fruit is mainly tinned and bread is very high street or even supermarket variety no real brown wholemeal bread Tea and coffee are poor , All aspects of location staff etc are top class Room bed bathroom etc also Proximity to tube station a big plus 
505036,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Value for money Unclean room Lack of visible staff The room was tiny despite being a two room suite kind of thing , Bed and bathroom Location Not a lot more 
505037,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, My only slight criticism is that during breakfast which I accept was very busy the staff were quite slow to take our used plates and so we were often eating surrounded by dirty plates and bowls , The hotel was in a brilliant location the rooms were clean and very spacious and all the staff extremely helpful We ate in the hotel every night mostly having room service and the food was lovely 
505038,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Not much room in the bar lounge at any time of day The air con in the room was a bit temperamental The sofa bed was a little uncomfortable in the studio room , We love the location of the hotel we ve stayed 3 times now The rooms are modern and clean The studio room was great for the 3 of us Great for business or pleasure

505074,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, I m sure people have said already I just wanted to briefly say this is really a remarkable hotel and really cannot be flawed I would stay frequently if I wasn t a student 
505075,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I have stayed here many times before however on this occasion we were given an accessible room which was not to the standard I d had previously No front sitting area no microwave and sink area and no bath Breakfast was served in the bar where the table only comes up to your shins which made eating rather awkward especially when you re 6 5 Lots to choose from though and very fresh and tasty , Had a great nights sleep and breakfast was fresh and tasty with lots to choose from staff very polite Hotel amenities excellent

505079,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, All but one staff member we encountered was very hospitable It was unfortunate because she really gave a negative impression on such a nice hotel I would return for the service we received from the other staff ,No Positive
505080,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The drinks are what we didn t like The coffee at breakfast was not too good but the others from the self service were even worse The biggest let down of all was the cocktails and bar staff Every cocktail we ordered was a poor concoction or imitation and the bar staff stood idly around while we tried to get their attention The only time we got served was when you actually went to the bar and to add insult to injury they added a service charge to the bill What service , The rooms are good in size and of a high spec while being value for money and centrally located The staff are very courteous and helpful with nothing being too much trouble We arrived at 11am while check in was not till 2pm but we were greeted with smiles at all times and the staff still gave us a room as one was available Food was good especially the sushi Breakfast was of a large variety to cater for all tastes so there was plenty of choice too 
505081,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Breakfast was disappointing 1st day as it was so busy we had to eat in the basement area when we would have preferred to be seated upstairs Breakfast in bed following day was nice but struggled with access to room with sofa bed and other furniture, Pool was beautiful staff were really friendly at check in

505084,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We stayed six nights in a junior suite The first room we stayed in the wifi did not work at all in the bedroom and only in areas of the sitting room Whenever you wanted to connect you needed to forget the network and reconnect We complained about it from the first evening again on the next day and only after 2 days did they say there was a router issue on our floor Rather than fix the issue they moved us to another room 1047 the wifi worked great there and the views were still fantastic However there was a marked difference in housekeeping standards the toilet and bathrooms were not restocked each day only limited offerings and any dirty glasses were not collected or washed This second suite also only had one phone not two and no laundry bags or luggage rack At this level of hotel you expect attention to these small details and a consistent experience across all rooms It being a large hotel expect to queue for reception and front office guest support and advice On another note since our last stay at this property two lanes of the Westminster bridge have been closed to taxis or cars The traffic getting north of the river is therefore awful and can add another 10 minutes to taxi rides just to cross the river Given the season the bridge was also crowded 24 7 which makes it hard to get to Westminster tube station , Location If you face Westminster you get great views of Big Ben parliament London eye Rooms are large for that location ACs worked well Staff generally very friendly though some cleaners struggled with basic English Beds are very comfortable The cleaner in our first room 523 was amazing restocking the bathroom every day and washing dirty glasses etc Lots to do and explore in the area and easy to walk to most major London attractions Lots of restaurants nearby

505090,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, A certain lack of attention to details for example we had to ask for slippers as they were not provided Also some light switches by the bed were not working , Position is great just across the river from Westminster and the Big Ben 
505091,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Booked a superior room via booking Were provided with a shoebox with no external walls and a very small window that overlooked the lobby Hotel eventually found us a replacement room but we were made to pay an extra 50 for the privilege of natural light We were in a hurry to get to the theatre so very reluctantly accepted though the following morning requested a refund which the hotel agreed to The breakfast experience was also not good The website shows photos of a spacious restaurant overlooking Westminster Bridge Unfortunately the reality is that this hotel is so large 1000 rooms that the restaurant is unable to cope with demand and therefore the majority of breakfast guests are unceremoniously diverted down to a huge conference area in the basement also with no natural daylight Unlikely we ll stay here again , Room we were eventually provided with was comfortable Nice bar 
505092,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Staff at reception were extremely rude and unhelpful They also lost our bags Our room wasn t ready at check in time and they never rang us when it was ready Rooms weren t cleaned until after 4pm most days , Concierge were only staff that were helpful and apologetic during our 4 day stay 
505093,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Internet in the room is extremely poor the lights were half off and the switches did not work right The cleaning of my room was awful specially the bathroom and after they cleaned it the first day a bad smell remained in the room, Location and facilities like bar restaurant and coffee shop in the hotel
505094,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, My first room smelled of cigarette smoke Had it changed The table surfaces had ring stains from the previous visitor The room was superficially cleaned Breakfast was lovely but had to ask three times for tea The staff was s bit overwhelmed , Room had a nice view Excellent location

505096,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Checking in was a chore the receptionist struggled with the system printer and I struggled with her level of English There was mood lighting everywhere to the point where you needed a torch in the lifts and the room lighting made it hard to check that you looked half decent before venturing out The room looked out onto an internal atrium so you could not see what the weather was doing Also there was zero network or data coverage in the room but this was negated by the free wifi which was full strength No hi def TV channels , Comfortable bed with a choice of 4 different comfort ratings of pillows Great bathroom with a large tub and standalone shower Quiet rooms

505099,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, 1 The waiting time for check in was too long Each time that I approach the check in desk took me long to get my request solved For the check out there was an extra charge of several items from the mini bar that we did not consumed I explained around 9am to the person in the desk that this was because we requested the room service to remove some items as my daughter has nuts allergy and we did not want to have them in the room As I noticed that the response time was long I said I will come back later to give the desk clerk time to find out about the situation When I come back at midday It was not still cleared and I was told that not all the items were removed etc I had the impression that I was expected to pay for them or to keep waiting to get that cleared At the end I was a bit upset and had to be unkind to get rid of the situation as I only had 4 more hours to enjoy the city before departing and did not want to invest time on the reception desk of the hotel 2 shower of the fitness area were a bit disgusting dirty and the floor of the swimming pool was also dirty I could feel some things in my feet in at least two different spots I tried not to think about that and enjoy but I have been in better swimming pools from 4 stars hotels , 1 The personnel in the restaurant especially I guess it was the supervisor of the area was extremely kind and gentile offering solutions to avoid my daugther any contact with nuts 2 Wonderful location 3 Nice bedroom

505129,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, I ve stayed here regularly for the past 6 years at least three times a year I go back as it s one of the best hotels that I ve stayed at in London value location staff it has it all 
505130,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The description says room with inside view Well the window was dimmed and people was going just behind it day and night Funny experience but for sure it should cost less , Location
505131,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Disappointed that on more than one occasion the bar staff drowned our gin with tonic from the pump rather than serving a bottle along the side You should always allow the customer to decide how much mixer they would like Minor point but it seemed a shame as everything else in the hotel was great , Staff at reception were excellent Very efficient check in and check out Rooms lovely with all the amenities you could need having a separate fridge as well as a mini bar is very useful 
505132,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, My daughter was in hospital nearby having major surgery requested twice to have good telephone signal but we had to stand by window or go downstairs to use it No wi fi either Room smelly because of drain in sink ,No Positive
505133,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Room booked for 3 people but only set up for 2 people so had to make my own bed Service charge for bringing drink to table but was asked to sit down and be served Breakfast we were taken to a low table and chairs and was rather abrupt with us when we asked for normal set up I ve stayed at the hotel before and was disappointed at this stay , great location lovely feel to the hotel 
505134,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The funky zone mood light switches in the rooms are a bit too 21st Century for me and time outs sometimes switch them all off , Superbly appointed modern clean and spacious rooms Plenty of plug sockets including native US and EU ones for international travellers Comfy bed quiet great bathroom and particularly a reliable shower Everything is provided including decent hairdryer iron and board and enough wardrobe space hangers for a long stay Food is good as well judged by what we were served in the conference centre rather than the hotel restaurant and the bar lounge area is comfortable with good attentive service 
505135,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, Staff was very helpful Room had a great view and beds were comfortable location was easy for 2 different tube train stations and also convenient area for walking to many great sites

505137,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The hash browns were over cooked on the breakfast there was a lot of young childern running around the hotel as well which made it feel a lot lower class than it was , The staff were extremely friendly the beds and room where very tidy and clean 
505138,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The catering staff let the hotel down Having arrived later than expected to the hotel we ate in the Primo bar and all chose to have a cheeseburger with chips Granted it was later on at night that we were eating and we had a limited choice to what to have but we waited an hour for our food When my dad complained about the wait time the woman told us that there was only one chef on and that someone had to go out to get some ingredients When the food arrived the chips tasted exactly like MacDonalds fries Knowing that someone went out to get ingredients and there is a MacDonald round the corner I am convinced they served us their burgers with MacDonalds fries , The location was excellent and the hotel was lovely modern and clean I would stay here again and recommend to friends and family 
505139,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Check in was dreadful I was late for my client dinner as I had to queue for so long I also have changed my email address so I can t access my club carlson details I asked the lady to check wrote down all of my information Nobody came back to me as promised and when I checked out it wasn t found noted anywhere so very disappointing , I have stayed at this hotel many time the location is fantastic Staff are friendly and the rooms even the internal facing ones are nice comfortable and with plenty of space 
505140,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Booking com room was an interior disabled room No view at all a dimly lit room Very disappointed in value of room , great location and hotel good breakfast with many choices
505141,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The breakfast was slightly disappointing as the sausages hash browns and tomatoes were cold , Room was very spacious wasn t very keen on the lights as you have to go to the bed side to turn them on after entering the room Fact you don t have to check out until mid day was lovely Fab location near to Waterloo The bed was very comfy 
505142,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Swimming pool change room very untidy no towels available, Good location comfortable beds fab breakfast good customer service would highly recommend
505143,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Windows cannot open room ventilation feels insufficient room cooling bit noisy lighting of rooms in insufficient, Location design modernity staff wifi
505144,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, During our first night the room we stayed in had a rather gloomy view of train tracks and the building at the back of the hotel , We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite and I d say it s worth the price The location was excellent as it s near the London Eye and the Big Ben as well as underground train stations and many restaurants and supermarkets Breakfast was good as compared to other hotels we stayed in Europe in terms of variety and quality Service was fast and the staff were friendly 
505145,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Was not informed about closure of swimming pool and we are from the countryside so children were very disappointed, The welcoming staff and some of the restaurant staff were very friendly 
505146,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Of course it s not a cheap place to stay in London but considering it s qualities , The location is fantastic And this time we ve got an up grade for a suite with a wonderful view of the Thames River and London Eye The cleanness the attention at Check in the restaurants Everything was perfect It s the 4th time we stayed there and I have no doubt to recommend and please reserve a place at Joel Brasserie for a memorable dinner 
505147,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I was rushed out of the breakfast area by staff who wanted to shut down that room I would have preferred to eat a little more slowly , It was very convenient to get from Heathrow to Westminster via public transit Minimal walking outside really just across the bridge The room was very modern and the view was Instagram worthy I was especially grateful for the soaking tub and comfortable bed after a long flight 
505148,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Was very disappointed that the swimming was closed I booked this hotel for this facility as my mother had done a big bike ride for charity I thought it would have been nice to have a bit of relaxation with the use of the pool Not a happy bunny , Room was lovely and the food was good
505149,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Breakfast was a bit disorganised we were told breakfast was between 7 11am we turned up at 10 and were shown to an room in the basement not the restaurant we sat down and within 15min about 10 20 they cleared the food away and started packing up the tables and chairs around us although not asked we were made to fell rushed and breakfast lasted about 15 min ,No Positive
505150,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The room which I requested was given to someone else otherwise would of Mark this hotel excellent all the way through , The views the bar has a band playing most nights wish is great if you don t want to leave the hotel The Thai green curry was yummy 
505151,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Im not sure about the lighting in the rooms complicated switch system Not really a complaint however , Excellent location beds comfy breakfast excellent although not in the usual dining room 
505152,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, If room is booked for 3 people then put in 3 of everything cups glasses etc If an adult is staying then provide a proper bed not a pull out , Noisy lift caused poor nights sleep The room was for 3 adults so a poor sofa substitute wasn t really good enough 
505153,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Our room wasn t set up for the 4 of us so we had to get them to come sort that out not an issue as such just an oversight The staff are fine if a little functional cold, Great location The Studio King room was lovely The pool was great The hotel is well kept and maintained and was a great base for a weekend in london

505157,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing Everything was great Well except perhaps for the naked bike parade that went past the hotel Saturday afternoon Didn t expect that , Bed was very comfortable Nice and quiet Liked the separate room for watching tv Ate in the French restaurant food and service was excellent and the price was reasonable too 
505158,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The hotel was so dark and I can only presume that this led to the staff feeling oppressed leading to rudeness particularly at reception Check in took half an hour , The location 
505159,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, For CHF400 for one night I would have expected better quality linen and better breakfast service , The room was very well appointed and the facilities around the hotel were very good We were disappointed with the quality of ben linen provided for our son to use the sofa bed The breakfast was also served in a meeting room which was very lacking in atmosphere 
505160,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The parking situation is horrible and a scam To park overnight we had to pay 65 for the valet because there is no parking anywhere near the hotel Parking in London is horrible If you want to retrieve your vehicle between midnight and 0600 for any reason going for a drive you have to give them an hour notice to retrieve your vehicle , The location is great and easy to walk to any of the attractions and pleasant area to walk 
505161,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, There were no bath robes no slippers from toiletries only one shower gel and one shampoo There were hairs on bathtub when first time entering toilet Interior is done so that you think there are a lot of shelves but there is only one small wardrobe the other shelves are just for decoration Rooms are dark when you close the curtains and turn all the lights on the light is not enough The safe was too small even 11 inch ultra thin laptop did not fit inside The staff always made mistakes We paid for the breakfast during check in the next day our names were not in breakfast list and we were not allowed to go to restaurant for breakfast We were forced to go to reception to check by ourselves go back to restaurant to ask them to check from reception Finally they found what was the problem and we were allowed to have breakfast Lot of inconvenience waste of time for about 30 minutes Telephone handset is connected to base with remote control and never worked I had to talk by speaker on the base Waiters are untidy always spill coffee or tea on the table Should improve the service the service is not as you expect when entering the hotel The hotel is very beautiful from outside but when you live there even one day you ll get disappointed , The location the building 
505162,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, When my husband and I checked in the staff give us a room with no windows no telephone signal inside the room very cornered location in 2rd floor and just seperated from a big lounge by a sealed glass wall That is all i got after paying 152 per night We came from Asia and I believe they will not give any European people that kind of room in that price When I back to reception ask to change another room because I need to use my telephone in the room the staff who with no apology argued with me said That could be the problem with my telecom company until I show her my phone got signal right in the lobby I d rather not saying this but this hotel is totally rubbish , basically only the location 
505163,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Slow check in One member of staff took a break whilst I was waiting , In the end good value for money given amazing location facilities modernity comfort and staff 
505164,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, No thing , Excellent as usual Although there was miss understanding for the check out date this was solved quickly and smoothly Special thanks to Antonella again for the great hospitality Will definitely come back 
505165,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I didn t like that there were no windows to the outside in the room , I liked the room it was comfortable and felt quite glamorous I also liked the pool 
505166,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I did not like the fact that the pool sauna and hammam area was full of kids despite the late hour regulation against kids at that hour It ruined the spa part of the trip for me and my girlfriend I did not like that i had to ask for a toothbrush touthpaste dental kit for the room I did not like that there was only 1 bathroab in the bathroom so i had to ask for that too , The hotel was amazing I loved the bed and slept like a baby I love the on site restaurants and bar the prices are more than acceptable My time there was great The consierg will gladly fix any problems with your room immediately Such as needing a bathroab and dental kit 
505167,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The staff was not very pleasant neither provided enough information when was asked There was no tea or coffee bag was provided, The room facility was good there was a hot water maker The location was good
505168,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, As hotel was busy had to have breakfast in overspill room Would have liked to have eaten in restaurant on one of the days, Room fantastic Staff were brilliant Cake in room as surprise for husbands birthday was lovely
505169,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, we did have one problem which was that when we checked out someone put a breakfast on our bill which we did not have this took at least 10 mins to sort out and turned out to be an accident , the room was clean and tidy nothing to complain about 
505170,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, No real complaints , Great location Room was clean well appointed and comfortable Staff made an effort to ensure we were happy The room was also very quiet and the WiFi was free and fast enough to use for streaming video and work

505172,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing really I don t want to pick faults when there are none, Staff were extremely friendly and helpful rooms were amazing Very clean and spacious and the breakfast was the best fry up I ve us in a long time 
505173,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Obviously you don t get the view they show on the website Breakfast was cheap and nasty and we were shunted into an overfill ballroom which felt sub par Room very expensive with far cheaper options in the same location Staff were invisible virtually , The hotel room suite itself was great The view of the railway station was interesting albeit not the great views they advertise 
505174,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing at all, The location was perfect facilities were brilliant it had everything we wanted and more What a great hotel It was my wife s birthday which we told in conversation with the receptionist when we got to the room there was a bottle of champagne waiting for us Would definitely recommend 
505175,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Very noisy people in the adjoining room knocking on doors and noise till after 2am Not something you can control easily , The efficient and welcoming staff The leisure facilities Good breakfast 
505176,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, Even though it is a very big hotel ALL the staff were really really friendly Felt so welcome When booking the room I had mentioned it was our 30th anniversary On arrival we were upgraded there was a card from the management in our room and a chocolate cake delivered that evening Amazing 
505177,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The TVs in the rooms accumulates a lot of dust which is never cleaned by housekeeping My advice is for them to check dust on TVs and on the desks below the TVs Actually never wiped at all , Everything was OK 
505178,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I have no complaints about this hotel Only one silly little thing was the lights were weird to operate and a little dark hard to see in the mirror , Room was perfect very clean and the Air con worked Breakfast was brilliant so much choice and very tasty Location could not be better Will stay here again 
505179,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Delay during check in apparently no rooms available they then tried to upgrade us to a studio room along with the price tag or give us the last disabled access room to my suprise behind us at check in was a disabled guest I was firm and said I ll wait for our original booking to be available 1 hour later still no room so I sent my girlfriend to ask another member of staff and suprise suprise the room was immediately available This and the breakfast eggs tasted odd to me This ruined what otherwise was a perfect score , The view friendly concierge 
505180,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The location was perfect I mean we were like 5 minutes walking distance to the London eye and Big Ben which is perfect however there were no local shops around just to by simple drinks in well there was one but it was so overpriced and the food seemed to on the cupboards for months it was all wrinkly etc , So it was my boyfriends 19th birthday and I surprised him by booking a trip to London When booking online I was asked what the purpose of my trip was and I mentioned my boyfriends birthday but I wasn t expecting them to make anything out of it or anything like that Once we got into the hotel there was cake waiting for us to eat It was so good and we would like to thank the hotel staff for that other than that our room was lovely 12th floor view amazing temperature control available in the room and generally everything is amazing Thank you 
505181,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, Excellent and fast service professional and friendly attitude good security that make you feel safe tasty food great location and excellent value for money It will be my first choice in London if I decided to visit it again 
505182,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Upon arriving our bathroom had not been cleaned I went to use the restroom and there was dried urine and hair all over toilet Made me uneasy about staying there , Location is fantastic 
505183,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, As on my four previous visits the room lighting could be better At least one decent light mirror not in the bathroom would be useful , Room spa location
505184,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Breakfast was not included , Staff was very helpful and pleasant I would recommend this hotel to all that is planning on visiting London UK They offered valet parking which was awesome 
505185,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, When we arrived back at the hotel on friday evening at 11 30 we were disappointed that the entertainment had finished as we were told it was on until midnight but this didn t deter from our enjoyment of the bar areas The drinks are not cheap beware , Almost everything all the staff especially shady who helped us in our choice of room We ended up in a studio with an excellent view of Big Ben and the river In room dining was tasty and service prompt 
505186,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Although WiFi is free the service in the room is shotty and unreliable I could get two bars at the doorway but nothing if I walked one foot into the room To make matters worse there was it was a dead zone for any cell signal , Excellent location rooms were clean and comfortable 
505187,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I do not like the staff behaviour specially the food and bar section Also we can t order food from out the hotel as the staff sayid the delivery cannot inter u need to collect your self The staff need to be more polite and nicier rather than that every thing was great , I like every thing such as the facilities
505188,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The room that houses the breakfast is something that I would expect to find in Pontins or Butlins , Entertainment in the evening at the bar was excellent Quality professional entertainment 
505189,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, This really is a great hotel in the perfect location Staff was really friendly and helpful rooms were clean and the breakfast buffet was satisfying 
505190,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Lighting controls in room were bizarre difficult to get the lighting right so ended up clambering in around in the dark when had to get up in the night as didn t want to wake anyone Drinks in the bar were very pricy 3 94 for a small coke is excessive even for central London , Booked a studio room so ample room for our son and ourselves Very helpful staff 
505191,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Bar snacks too expensive and breakfast was poor Waffles and pancakes should be included in the Buffett selection not extra cost and the bacon and sausage wasn t nice, Rooms were nice and clean and spacious
505192,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The night staff were aweful i went out for a cigarette and came back in i was in my pjamas and had gone past him to go out he was damanding paper proof that i was staying in the hotel which I obviously dixnt have i only had the hotel pass Also day time staff were all about sales and bumping up the price of the room , Bed was really comfy great ambiance 
505193,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Not possible to use internet connection in the evenings not that it was slow I kept being disconnected Lack of toilet brush in the bathroom , Great breakfast Awesome location Friendly staff
505194,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The toilets are without any latch doors are of glass bit uncomfortable with family the rooms are smaller then what they project and breakfast is basic and too crowded at times, The hotel is located very close to Waterloo and Westminster station Giving one easy access to trains
505195,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The staff where all amazing but slightly hard to understand some of their accents , Beautiful modern with an elegant touch Very clean and efficient I would come back 10x over 
505196,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We had a room with no natural light which was horrible the hotel was fully booked so couldn t change it They had artificial lights turned on day in day out Really horrible , I ve stayed here before and the reason is always simple the location of the hotel and not much else
505197,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Breakfast had a good cooked selection but the quality let it down and the breakfast staff were not that helpful friendly , Room service and front desk staff were extremely helpful The swimming pool Wi fi and room were the highlights
505198,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The prices of the items in the fridge should be at normal shop prices There is no reason for charging so much as they are just sitting there not requiring ant staff time etc , Loved the room and its layout The view was great and the location of the Hotel 
505199,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The room I had on this visit was a dark un inviting internal room not up to standard for the room rate charged by the Plaza , I frequently stay in the Plaza Westminster as I do a lot of business in the area and I find the hotel very convenient The staff are friendly and efficient but it s a very big hotel and frequently very busy at check in breakfast etc 
505200,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Staff were rude unhelpful Hidden charges were popping up all over the place on my bills Almost charged THREE TIMES for a room upgrade Room service breakfast was a fiasco that almost cost me 117 Shan t be staying here again , Restaurant served nice food and the hotel location couldn t be better for national rail links and underground 
505201,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, There is everything not to like about a stay here thanks to the really terrible abnoxcious rude and mean staff that work there Everyone from the duty manager to the check in staff to guest relations officers and the room service people had one attitude an that was bad If you want to be treated like a inmate Ina Jail book there They take your money and think they are doing you a favor , The only thing good about this hotel is its location 
505202,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, The location is the best I ve ever stayed in London Bar food was excellent and good value We upgraded to a suite and had amazing views over Westminster bridge to Big Ben and the houses of parliament and could see the London eye too The room was really comfy and spacious for 3 of us I can t wait to stay here again 
505203,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, All areas spotlessly clean with very attentive staff who were easy to find to ask questions The bedroom was large and well furnished with comfortable bed and good sized bathroom with nice toiletries 
505204,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I did book this hotel specifically because it had a swimming pool however on getting up early to go swimming we were told it was closed for maintenance This wasn t mentioned at any point to us before As we only stayed one night we weren t able to enjoy the pool at all , Bed extremely comfy Staff excellent Location outstanding Everything was modern and well maintained 
505205,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, nothing, the room was amazing spotlessly clean staff so help full and friendly location perfect loved everything about the hotel would definitely go back there again
505206,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Elevators are a complete mess If your room not at the high floor the minimal waitning time to get down to the lobby is 5 minutes can easily be 10 Breakfast place is also far too busy and almost no room between the tables makes you feel at the train station rather than at the high quality hotel , Location is great
505207,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, There was nothing I didn t like , I liked everything about this hotel the staff were amazing and helpful the room was spotless and the location was perfect 
505208,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Unfortunately when we arrived we were told the swimming pool was closed for maintenance which was one of the reasons we paid extra and booked this hotel Also would be nice to have a bottle of water in rooms x, Staff very helpful friendly and polite Rooms comfortable and clean Excellent hotel xx
505209,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Pool had been booked prior to our stay we were not advised that the pool would not be available The purpose was for my husband children to access the pool whilst I used the spa It was awfully embarrassing for us to be told as we arrived to the spa reception this could have been avoided We of course engaged our children with a different activity to managed their disappointment , Professional manner of the hotel staff 
505210,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, Hotel was fantastic but on arrival was told that the spa facilities would not be available for my stay very disappointed as that was a major reason for booking this hotel 
505211,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Noise from street was high but to be considered that the location is a crowded area But the noise from the corridor and from the neighbours was surprisingly hearable , Location is excellent room size and equipment is very good staff is experienced and kind speed of services is good breakfast corner is very good even the breakfast or launch can be replaced 
505212,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Sauna and pool weren t working Breakfast was good but pricey , The location was fantastic Central to everything Within walking distance to many attractions Very modern looking and awesome views We enjoyed the breakfast 
505213,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Better lighting in public areas Breakfast staff a little hap hazard with service , The room was clean comfortable but for me personally the public areas were too dark
505214,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, When i made the booking i was under the impression it was for a double room however as we checked in i was told that only a twin room was available I asked if this could be changed as i was staying with my husband for our anniversary but i was refused The only option i was given was to pay for an upgrade so i did I asked for the upgrade to be a room with a view of either the Big Ben or the river but again i was told that would be at a further cost No help or consideration whatsoever After a four hour car journey this was the last thing we needed Great start it was Then in the morning as the house keeper was making her house keeping rounds she entered our room without permission totally unacceptable Again another awful start to the morning seems like the Park Plaza staff were keeping to the theme Lovely hotel and location not sure sure about the staff Completely spoiled the start of our celebration ,No Positive
505215,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Everything was perfect except one little thing staff which are cleaning rooms might also take dirty glasses and mugs did not always do that , Location beds very comfy cleaness staff 
505216,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, I couldn t fault the service or quality of the hotel in general I booked this for my wife s 30th and the member of staff on check in sang a full rendition of Happy Birthday to her much to my young sons amusement Our son is 3 and daughter less than a year but not once did they feel anything other than welcome by the staff Even TV put on in a special kids area for breakfast if you wanted to use it Extra perk was if you had already booked breakfast with your stay you can have it in your room at no extra cost Turned up on a trolley which then was erected by the staff into a full table in our room Dine in style and comfort from your own bedroom Ideal after a night out 
505217,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Was only told on check in that the spa and pool were closed Would not have stayed if known this in advance They had no idea when facilities would reopen Dirty dishes and bottle outside room even though staff were walking past the door Too few milks and tea bags supplied for two people Sofa had been made into a double bed not sure why , Great location Excellent size suite 
505218,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Your employee andrei at executive lunch is racist He does not deserve to your hotel staff as he is damaging the high reputation of your hotel, All foods n accomodation

505220,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing to dislike , Bed was very comfortable Room insulated from street noise Staff were very friendly and helpful from bell station to check in and concierge Hope to stay longer in future
505221,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Only unpleasant staff was when wee weere picking our luggage after sight seeing The guy at the desk where we picked up our bags just seemed like he couldn t be bothered Other then that great staff , Great staff all around 
505222,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, If it were not for this I would have given you a 10 The person on the desk at the spa could have been more sympathetic apologetic about the lack of pool spa steam room She was not overtly rude However she was brusque and dismissive I chose your hotel because I needed those resources after the long flight from Australia A regular shuttle to and from Heathrow would be welcome even if it resulted in a fee , With only one exception the staff were absolutely great from the reception desk to breakfast staff the concierge desk and the doormen All went out of their way to be helpful and they were obviously keen to give good service The staff in the Japanese restaurant couldn t have been kinder to our unexpected young guests who had a two year old child The breakfast service despite huge demand was impressive in its cheerful but brisk management The location of your hotel would be hard to beat with easy access to Westminster Bridge the Thames Westminster Downing St Waterloo Station 2 underground stations and plenty of bus stops 
505223,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The doona was too hot The sheets were too small No lighter doona or blankets until asked for And then just left in our room not made up , The pool and spa areas were luxurious 
505224,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, the food was bad the hotel was expensive in comparison with the services offered the room was not clean and smelly not comfortable the staff was rude and do not understand everything we were asking for poor layout of the rooms, location
505225,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I didnt like the fact that on check in we got pushed for an upgrade for 210 GBP using pictures of the disabled room and the fact that the normal not disabled room which we wanted to change to were without windows , location

505228,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I booked myself and my son age 13 for two nights in a twin room including b fast via booking com The confirmation only printed one adult so I rung the hotel to inform them and they said that this was typical of booking com not to include the child on the booking as it normally only states 2 adults They would rectify it At check in I got an arrogant male receptionist who insisted that my booking was for one adult and therefore my son would have to pay for b fast I explained I had called the hotel and they said they would rectify this He wanted to know what day and what time and who did I speak to He insisted that children over 12 pay for bfast as per their website I explained I did not book via their website but on booking com which included b fast in the rate To cut a long storey short I reluctantly agreed to pay as it was10pm and after a flight and six hours of travel it was not the time or place for an argument It was all very upsetting made more so when my son over hearing the conversation said he would do without bfast A final word from the receptionist was to direct me to Guest Services Shame he did not say this initially instead of having the argument with me When I spoke to Guest Services I dealt with a person who listened understood how booking com works and removed the bfast cost I feel the hotel needs to train its receptionists to use common sense not to argue with a guest checking in late with a child and not to argue about the particulars of a booking when they are not involved in reservations It was unnecessary and upset my son and initially spoilt the first impressions of this hotel which is otherwise wonderful in every other way and in a perfect location for seeing London , Guest Services excellent

505314,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We really did not appreciate the loud rapping on our hotel room door at 8 00 a m by the maid followed immediately by her accessing the room using her pass key Clearly a woman with only one thing on her mind to clean the room No regard for the time and certainly no regard for the fact that she had not been invited in No regard for the fact that we had paid for the room and it was still ours for at least another couple of hours more We had deliberately stayed in this hotel to enjoy the entertainment 2 female singers who were terrific by the way So this unscheduled rude awakening after a late night really took the shine off our whole stay Having been woken up we then felt obliged to set off in search of a sensibly priced breakfast The Plaza charges 25 per person for a basic English breakfast Outrageous even by London standards 50 for a few eggs and bacon etc What a shocker ,No Positive

505324,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Pool staff was far too rude on telling me off about my 5 6 years old jumping into my hands I don t think he understands that the children are so excited to be there in London and also in the hotel and pool They get excited and it takes a couple of times for them to understand that this is not allowed On the second time he told me off I tried explaining to him that they will stop but i don t particularly want to shout at my children How ever they did stop but never the less he attitude is bad, The young girl who served me and my children drinks in the bar She was excellent and very attentive to my children Also the lady on top of the stairs who attended my child when she walked into the glass partition in the stairs and she had cut her head and had a bleeding nose I think the glass should ve decorated some how to stop further children doing this
505325,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Super overcrowded The very nice pool is an unbearable kindergarten There is no european plug for appliances straighten iron so I asked for an adaptor for just 10 minutes at the reception and the don t lend them you can only get it for the convenient price of 12 That was not very service oriented , The hotel is very well located and close to metro Pretty modern and well design Very comfortable and luxurious

505346,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, 1 The room is much smaller than I expected The aisle between the TV and the relaxing bed could not even let the breakfast table pass 2 It was preposterous that for two consecutive mornings the housekeeping lady knocked my door around 8 00 A M asking if she could come in making up the room what kind of hotel does housekeeping at 8 00 A M Especially when I would stay for more than one night And in the first morning she just came in directly without receiving my response which rudely woke me up and I sat up at once topless although I am male I don t consider it very courteous Eventually she folded her eyes with her hands and escaped immediately which was super awkward Did I have to hang a do not disturb sign to remind people there might be somebody sleeping in the room at 8 00 in the morning , The view from the Big Ben Studio Room is perfect Besides room service was brilliant

505424,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, was placed in a wheelchair room was asked by friendly professional staff if that was ok didnt really mind the idea at first but later when i went to the room it felt a little uncomfortable the extra equipment made it feel less like a hotel room felt too i didnt get value for money and that the hotel didnt have a suitable room for me I slept with ear plugs given low intensity hum of lifts nearby A hotel for the unfussy Unlikely to go back, quite impressive modern bulding with professional staff and crisp public areas Sounded like plenty facilities but only had flying visit
505425,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Breakfast on morning 1 was in what appeared to be a conference room on floor 1 not impressive location for breakfast , This hotel is superb the staff location facilities its just got everything going for it 
505426,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Sat in the bar during the day with very mediocre service It was slow and staff were not particularly polite The staff on the desk are not all polite Tried to charge me for a phone call to the states when I left Explained I didn t make the call etc Made of point of telling me in an overly firm manner that it will be investigated Came across rude Also had problems booking the room through booking com and the front desk staff yet again very unhelpful , Great location and the hotel looks decent enough 
505427,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Checking in could be slightly quicker but it wasn t a really long wait A selection of biscuits alongside the tea and coffee would have been welcomed , The pool and spa are beautifully cared for and the water temperature was just right The room was spacious very comfortable and amazingly well equipped Fridge microwave tea and coffee making facilities all helped to make it a lovely experience The location is superb and very easily accessible from the tube as it is just a short walk over Westminster Bridge to Westminster underground 
505428,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The facilities in the so called accessible room were not of the expected standard extremely small wet room unable to turn wheelchair into the shower area no vertical grab rails on the shower wall similarly impossible to transfer from wheelchair onto toilet due to cramped space We had to use disabled toilet in the public area of hotel on ground floor , The staff were wonderful especially the concierges Breakfasts very good 
505429,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Bizarre decor trying too hard Giant print of Japanese girl on wardrobe door was unsettling Poor use of space included dark lounge area with no view which we just didn t use Prefer your sister hotel at County Hall where we were upgraded ,No Positive
505430,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The rooms are very dark they should really improve their lighting system The heating system is super loud breakfast is disappointing they don t have fresh vegetabes just some cut iceberg salad Checking in took 1 hour the staff is not very well trained as they are most trainees , The location is perfect the beds are comfortable the staff at all their restaurants is nice and fast

505432,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I wish the room designers would actually try out the rooms themselves sometimes Why have lighting you can t operate without a torch to see which switch to use or a shelf in the shower you can t stand your tiny bottles up on Style over practicality , Great central location and views 
505433,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Pool area too small and therefore hotel had to restrict guests time using the facility not ideal if a pool is one of your reasons for selecting this hotel, Great rooms good lay out for families Friendly and helpful staff Amazing location perfect for attractions such as London Eye Sea Life and London Dungeon plus easy access to Thames Clippers to get to O2 or Tower of London 
505434,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Pool time limited to 1 2 hours after 5pm and having to book a time slot internal view rooms were dark but to expected, Close to station and London eye
505435,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The shower was just a trickle of water so not very impressed when it took 20 minutes just to rinse my hair, Everything was perfect Excellent view comfy bed spacious room with great interior design I love the fact we had a bath We were blown away from stepping inside the doors to leaving and being asked if we wanted to leave our bags and explore the city
505436,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, It s all pretty good really , Lovely hotel great location nice bar and superb facilities not tried spa but it looks great Terrific value for what you get and the internal view rooms are totally fine for business travel

505438,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, There was a pair of dirty socks from the previous occupants of the room which was disgusting The breakfast was only average , A fabulous location A really well appointed room 
505439,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We booked a kingsize room but got upgraded to a studio but it had a double bed It was ok but I booked a kingsize room as I wanted a kingsize bed, I really liked the view 
505440,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Staff arguing in corridor and in spa clearly there were staff issues these shouldn t be discussed in public places , Great location nice room and facilities
505441,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, There was a broken glassware on the floor next to the bed near the window with it stood up very sharp bits scattered everywhere around it so we put it on the back wall behind the tap in the sink , The view was spectacular Amazing staff Beautiful room
505442,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Breakfast was not very good somewhat cold to tepid selection not very good and only 1 toast machine which meant breakfast got even colder queuing to make toast, Excellent staff very helpful

505444,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, My stay was too short , The room was soothing and inspiring The health club was great and the staff very hospitable Let alone the fantastic location 
505445,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The staff could bring in a bit more warmth , The hotel is very modern and feels almost cutting edge The facilities amenities and location gets a big thumbs up 
505446,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Fresh milk rather than UHT in the room And drinkable water that was not 3 50 a bottle Otherwise fine, Excellent location Staff at desk very helpful Modern and clean
505447,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Spa was a little like a zoo with all the children which we didn t expect from a 4 5 star hotel on Valentine s weekend The coffee restaurant at the hotel could be better stocked with breakfast options , Comfortable bed big room and extremely helpful and polite staff 
505448,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing wrong with this hotel , Great location very close to Waterloo station Very easy to get to all major attractions Great breakfast and plenty of it Room and bathroom was clean and tidy and the bed was lovely and comfortable I would definitely stay in this hotel again 
505449,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Staff were a little snooty wouldn t let my husband check in because I had done the booking I was still at work even though he had a paper copy of the booking confirmation Then the doorman asked to see our room keys when we came back in late at night as didn t seem to trust that we were staying there Made us feel rather unwelcome , Great location and very comfortable beds
505450,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, This hotel is shocking the staff can t speak a word of English and when order room service last night they sent me up cold chilli without no rice after waiting over a 1 hour and then spoke to the duty manager John who said he would refund me the full amount of 10 24 which was find but when I check this morning the hotel not given me a refund they have taken out 17 50 what a jock I want a full refund for the 17 50 please the stay off 199 00 because the service was shocking, Never like anything at all about the hotel
505451,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Breakfast was chaotic Food wasn t getting topped up quickly enough Private function not enough bar staff causing long wait for drinks , Public areas and room was amazing 
505452,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The soap dish in the shower of Room 359 was loose and my toiletries kept falling on the shower floor This was a minor issue , An impressive hotel in a fabulous location The room and bathroom were fabulous spacious and very comfortable 
505453,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, As you walk in unhappy looking door men stand as u walk in very intimating as it s a hotel and you shouldn t feel that as you enter keep them to the side,No Positive
505454,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Showers are small and the room lighting was tricky We couldn t have the living room bathroom light on at the same time as the bedroom area Not a big deal and would stay at this hotel again , The beds were comfortable the hotel bar entertainment was excellent and the hotel was clean 
505455,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The cleaners not always on time and did very poor cleaning Also being offered a discount not to call for cleaning services was offensive to me , The location and fantastic staff The breakfast was exquisite The hotel reception area is very family friendly and lively 
505456,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Hotel was very hot A little disappointed in having to pay extra to have a view when we had already paid for a studio and when enquired about position room was told it would have a view which was why booked this type of room , Good welcome very good position 
505457,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Ridiculous wine prices in the bar that seemed to change according to which barman served you , Great location right across the bridge from Big Ben A modern hotel with all mod cons and good spa facilities 
505458,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We were there over New Years and the staff was overwhelmed We had to change to a smaller room due to elevator noise We also had a false alarm fire evacuation at 2 A M , The location is wonderful especially over New Years Modern decor and fairly large rooms for London
505459,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Lighting in our suite was over contrived and difficult to control Bar prices were excessive and service below par Noisy work being carried out in the room above not at all considerate , All staff we encountered were excellent 
505460,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Arrived in the dark and couldn t find the clever light switches boxes so had to stumble around a bit first , The location the room with a separate living area modern facilities in the room 
505461,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I requested no feather bedding but instead of the room being made up without feather bedding I had to leave the room after check in to have the bed re dressed as it was feather We had a problem with the mini bar when looking for items we wanted we didn t replace the one in front correctly and were charged for it on the express check out bill I phoned to have it removed from the bill and someone had to come to the room to check we weren t lying which they did while I was getting dressed I then went to settle the bill for the items I had used from the mini bar and the item was still on the bill even though someone had been to the room to check it so be careful to replace any items you have moved in the minibar to the place where they were as it works on a pressure sensor and charges you if you don t put it back correctly causing problems when getting dressed and delay at check out , It s a nice hotel in a good location Rooms are a good size nice and very clean the bathrooms are nice with a separate bath and shower Beds are comfortable The staff were friendly and tried their best to be helpful but a little forward planning would have made things easier 
505462,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, Fantastic hotel in a great location close to tube stations Staff were incredibly helpful decor of the hotel was really fresh and modern The breakfast buffet was amazing with great choice and always fresh Couldn t fault this hotel at all 
505463,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Sadly despite the points mentioned in my likes I won t book to stay in this hotel again Please read on The visit was to celebrate a significant birthday the Birthday cake and Preseco ordered to be in the room on arrival as a birthday surprise where not there very disappointing thirty minutes after a discreet phone call reminder to reception and the surprise was eventually delivered But the moment was lost The birthday cake fiasco was just bad luck I hear you say but the following issues are in a hotel charging premium prices absolutely unacceptable The Tumbler glasses in the rooms kitchen where both dirty one having a white powder residue deposited up the inside The cutlery supplied in the kitchen draw was sticky to the touch and had clearly not been washed for sometime One of the cushions on the bed had a large dark stain on it Disgusting But the biggest disappointment was breakfast we arrived at the restaurant at 9 30am but where ushered to the lift by a member of staff who told us to select the basement on arrival we entered a large multipurpose room which had been setup as an overflow dining room The room was soulless and more reminiscent of a school canteen than a hotel dining room We where led to a table next to a large flatscreen TV set up for the benefit of the younger guests The Disney film playing was so loud that we had to raise our voices to be heard by the waiter serving the tea and coffee My wife and I wandered over to the buffet table to be greeted by a junior guest playing sand castles with the cereals nuts and dry fruit , The location was excellent and our studio room was well designed with cool touches like compact kitchen with sink and microwave mood lighting large tiled Geisha mural overlooking the bed but the most notable feature was the view of the London Eye well the top half anyway room 888 Before you choose to book this hotel please read my dislikes 
505464,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing to criticise , Perfect location Very smart hotel Good sized bedrooms and bathrooms Exceptionally clean and smart Efficient and helpful staff 
505465,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Drinks in the bar were expensive, The hotel was in a good location close to the river and the sights we went to very well kept and high standard facilities we were upgraded to a larger room and given a birthday cake for my partners birthday nice touch
505466,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We had a night cap on one of our nights there and we re a little shocked at the prices for our drinks , This was our first time at the Westminster plaza ando we were overwhelmed to be upgraded to a suite Beautiful clean hotel with vertical wecoming staff

505470,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Rooms were slightly smaller than expected but were still comfortable , Excellent and very clean rooms with the perfect location Can be visited many special areas on foot Staff was very welcoming and helpful I would stay here again based on this booking experience 
505471,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Slow check in Some staff a bit grumpy , Room and location fabulous Highest spec throughout room amazing blackout curtains very comfortable bed and breakfast brought to room for no extra cost 
505472,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The drinks at the bar were very expensive and when l checked my receipts l was over charged 3 times , Bed was very comfortable and enjoyed the training room 
505473,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Ian from guest services was patronising and rude especially when they lost my in room breakfast card which left me waiting ages only to find they couldn t find my order card Ended up having to go downstairs and my whole planned day was ruined , The location was amazing Studio was really nice and bed was comfy Was clean and the in room amenities were a plenty 
505474,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Insufficient toiletries provided for 2 people Unable to find a seat in the bar after dinner one evening and lifts so busy we d often to wait for several trips before we could be accommodated , Reception and concierge staff particularly helpful though the concierge did give us incorrect information about the boat trip we booked 
505475,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The staff kept trying to up sell in everything from the moment we arrived Would you like to add breakfast Would you like to upgrade to a bigger room We also booked a family room which was billed as a superior room but when I got there I was informed that it was too small for a crib despite my booking I had to fight to get a crib brought up I was very annoyed Don t be fooled by the words superior or executive when you book the room will be small Also we really wanted to use the pool but were told it was closed for maintenance and weren t offered any type of compensation as apparently all booking are subject to change , You cannot beat the location You walk outside and can see the London Eye and Big Ben Really quite spectacular The bed was super large and comfortable The mattress was clean and looked new The food choices were also fabulous if a little pricey We enjoyed every bite 
505476,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Smell of smoke in our room when we arrived but it past or we got used to it, Wonderful location with excellent service from start to finish Attention to detail was excellent
505477,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Greeting was poor my room had been oversold left standing at reception with no explanation for delay Supervisor s response to error was poor Room number not written on key card so had to call reception to find number, Proximity to Waterloo Peace and quiet Size and quality of the room Nice bathroom
505478,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The fact that irrespective of how much you were paying and how wonderful the staff were and the niceties afforded by the hotel if you happened to be one of those poor people still hooked on smoking you had to stand outside in the rain and wind feeling like a tramp a couple of tables and chairs would not go amiss maybe a heater or two and some sort of wind break , Its location and staff 
505479,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, There was nothing negative at all we had a great stay and would fully recommend this hotel , All the family really loved this hotel The location is superb and the interior beautiful The rooms were excellent also and very clean 
505480,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, We had a really lovely stay in the Park Plaza Westminster Bridge The rooms were loverly the staff friendly and the location really fantastic We will definitely be back 
505481,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I went with my partner and son and we got 2 single beds and a sofa bed at the front of the room it wasn t set out for a family stay , We loved the location very central and perfect for sightseeing The hotel was lovely and the staff very helpful
505482,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, Amazing location and beautiful property with great service from the staff Would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London especially if they re planning to sightsee 
505483,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Technology needs updating Long queue at check in Very large hotel more geared up to large parties and conferences so very soulless Rooms amenities not in line with the price, Efficient staff large room size lovely bathroom
505484,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, Great area around attractions across from Big Ben madam tusauds London eye sea life centre and loads more Straight out the tube across the bridge and straight into the hotel Hotel is lush worth the money 
505485,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We booked this hotel because of the location and the Spa facilities this was a big factor in choosing this hotel when we arrived we were told this was closed and not in use was deeply disappointed as we would have book another hotel slightly cheaper because there was no Spa we had no phone call or email to say this was the case and there was no information on their website to say this was closed Also out room was really dusty if your going to have so much glass then it really does need to be kept in good condition i would stay again but would not pay that price with no Spa in action , The modern feel was nice and easy to get to from the tube station we could see Big Ben from our window so that was also nice the staff could not have been more helpful and were always polite 
505486,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The fact that I book this hotel because it had a swimming pool But when we arrived it was out of order and o wasn t told till check in , Rooms are amazing and the veiws are great
505487,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The pool was closed not a big fault but I didn t get any info beforehand , The hotel has a great location in the centre of London close to all interesting places not far from shopping streets Great views if you got room on the good side of the building Excellent staff friendly and helping good restaurant 
505488,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Spa wasn t completely open , Everything Location Comfort Staff Hotel was booked and they still made extra effort to give me a late check out Dining entertainment area was classy Friendly people Live band Would be great for business s also 
505489,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The staff were rude especially the door staff I m not very wealthy and had saved up for a long time to stay in a high end hotel I wasn t offered any help staff were stood in groups talking to each other When I returned after getting wet in the rain I was laughed at by a member of door staff Last time I visited London I stayed in a very cheap hotel and the service there was phenomenal , The location was excellent if you walk around London no so good if you drive 
505490,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Sadly the pool was closed and no one advised me the first I knew was when I arrived at the Spa ready to have a swim and it was closed , Everything I always have a great time at this hotel
505491,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The pool and spa were closed the week I stayed which was not indicated when I booked and was a big reason I chose the hotel There was maintenance in some rooms so it was incredibly noisy with banging and sanding floors or something happening all around me The interior rooms are stuffy with bad air flow and the lighting is very dark , I ve stayed here before and the big rooms with windows are beautiful and the pool and spa are great to relax This time I had a different experience 
505492,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Staff overcharged me 70 for clothes cleaning instead of 17 Mangers were very unhelpful I kept complaining as nothing was done to compensate me for the inconvenience Very rude and patronising especially young white male manager Then a tall Asian manager was helpful after all the trouble I have stayed there a few times in the past this occasion made me never want to return They had also overcharged a couple that was standing next to me checking out charged them twice for room rate , Very nice room with nice view
505493,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We had been given a room we did not like due to a mix up with the booking company when requesting another room the response we received was unsympathetic and unfriendly Our request was a simple and straightforward request so I find it difficult to understand why we had received such an unpleasant tone by the staff I strongly suggest your staff working on their customer service skills , The atmosphere was enjoyable and the door men were very helpful 
505494,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, Great location Views of big ben from the hotel Staff very pleasant There was no remote in the room rang down to reception and it was sorted within 5minutes and then the reception telephone to ensure we had received the remote We have already booked for this year A really nice hotel and the rooms are very spacious with all amenties and it is really quiet Really nice breakfast
505495,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I found the room very hot even with the air conditioning and would have preferred a thinner quilt but obviously that s just personal preference , The food staff and facilities were all amazing This is the second time we have stayed and the hotel is amazing 
505496,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I would have to say William the front office manager was my worst experience When I called about the bill he was not able to explain and proceeded to use words like your card was declined if you paid It was not declined I changed the card being used for better rate and I had a credit on the account that he didn t explain The front office staff handled the matter much better than him New manager needed , We liked the design of the hotel 
505497,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing, Beautiful and comfortable hotel Quiet great beds staff excellent and food excellent had a sore neck and asked if it was possible to have another pillow I was given a choice Nothing is too much trouble for anyone Love staying here 
505498,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, There s something wrong with the check in process Many of the desks seem stalled with out of process requests It seems to be getting increasingly clogged over my many visits here Management should have done a deep process review by now and fixed it People are left waiting to check in and then they complain and that s another desk clogged Spa and gym still shut Not mentioned till we checked in , The location with a view to the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Bridge is spectacular One of my favorite places 
505499,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Service at the Sushi restaurant We waited for at least 15 minutes before getting service Then one girl came up and asked if we were ready after those 15 min and we said yes and she told us she had to get the other server to take our order We waited 5 more minutes and just left and ate at the bar which was fantastic and affordable For a hotel like this the service should be much better like at the bar Our server was amazing , We loved almost everything at this hotel The location is perfect You can walk to a lot of places and if you need to take the metro or bus they are less than 5 minutes away We upgraded to Suite with city view and had a partial view of the London Eye the upgrade was very much worth it compared to the room with an internal view Everything was clean and comfortable Totally recommend 
505500,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Only one room was ready on arrival so we had to wait for the other Over all price for the rooms were way to expensive , Location Location Location Breakfast was outstanding and offered great choice 
505501,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Not very organised at breakfast but breakfast was very nice Cheaper at 14 if you book on arrival rather than 21 , We were upgraded to a suite Lovely room clean and very comfortable 
505502,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I was very dissapointed we weren t told about the closeure of the spa pool area I booked this hotel for this 1 reason It was closed for maintenance very unhappy , The rooms were lovely breakfast was yummy overall a good experience 
505503,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, Location was fantastic 20 to 40 minute walk to most places we wanted to go Ferry a minutes walk away Bus service across the road Trains underground close by Small caf handy for morning afternoon tea Plenty of food options close by Good size room for R and R when all the sight seeing was done Multiple television channel choices all important for travelling with teenagers 
505504,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Couldn t book breakfast for the discount price unless I booked both mornings only wanted one morning Wifi didn t work at night No phone signal in room Main reason for booking this hotel was the location and the pool Pool was closed for maintenance Rooms were dark poor lightly , The location was good In the heart of town If you want a base and nothing fancy then it will do 
505505,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, Room size Location Staff very helpful The view facing Big Ben was perfect new year 2016 ev With free access to Westminster bridge for the fire works show 
505506,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Odd bath arrangement as the sink worktop went over the top of the end of the bath so could not sit in it , Upgraded to a suite on the executive floors FOC upon arrival Great as I was working day and night so lots of space Will definitely stay here again
505507,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Air con not very good in internal rooms Restaurant could be more interesting , Location and rooms are excellent though internal view rooms are a little claustrophobic
505508,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The room was unclean the furnishings were tatty torn scuffed Moved room 3 times every room was a varying degree of poor Staff did their best to resolve the issue but couldn t do much about the bodily looking stains on the carpet head board Wouldn t stay there again which is a real shame Spoilt a special weekend if planned for months , The staff were friendly helpful welcoming 
505509,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Was a little disappointed with no milk sachets for a hot drink in the morning The bathroom had a funny smell to it Spent a lot of money for a night away with my partner that doesn t happen much and expected a little more for the price ,No Positive
505510,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I was not happy to have it pointed out to me at check in that the hotel does not usually let its rooms for so little I felt I was being told I did not belong if it offers cheaper deals it should respect the customers who buy them the wi fi was very complicated to access as was the lighting in the room , comfortable room perfect location
505511,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The cleanliness was not i expected for the price that has hotel , The room was large view very beautiful brekfast very rich and the staff very polite 
505512,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, As I made different reservations it took me a while to explain all of that at check in but I was reassured all was fine However every single day I was locked out of my room had to explain all over again etc A letter of complaint and a complaint at guest relations remained unanswered Breakfast is overcrowded and appears to be a but chaotic, Good location if you have business to attend in Westminster but no bars restaurants around Very nicely decorated rooms good room service all very comfortable 
505513,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Room lighting was very dim but the room itself was quite nice Check in and out was very inefficient and took a very long time Not the most welcoming staff Service at the cocktail lounge was very slow and inattentive Our bags were loaded into the wrong hired car to the airport by the concierge valet We found our correct car on our own due to little concern from the valet All that said I will give big kudos to the Illy coffee shop inside the hotel Great food great service and an amazing view of Big Ben Very cozy spot We ate our breakfast there every morning , The location is incredible The building is designed so that you can see Big Ben from most angles The London Eye and waterfront action is just a block away You can catch the On and Off bus almost directly across the street We could walk or take a bus or Tube to just about anywhere in the city 
505514,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Road closures during Xmas and New Year season pose great challenges to travel plans, Room size is excellent for rooms with separate living room which can double up as separate sleeping area The kitchenette with microwave oven makes it convenient to Prepare simple food if one does not wish to eat out Value for money relative to hotels in central London Close proximity to Waterloo underground station is a great plus point 
505515,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Fire alarm went off one night had to evacuate in the cold London weather at 2 00 a m No light above the kitchenette , Location was excellent especially during NYE Staff very friendly and accommodating for early check in Loved the studio facing the London eye
505516,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The free upgrade was amazing however I would of been super happy with the perfect London view from our room instead Just me been awkward , Beautiful hotel and location was perfect It was my 1st year anniversary and we were upgraded to an apartment free of charge 
505517,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I forgot to get a receipt as I did fast check out Despite several emails I didn t receive a correct emailed one until January As I left my employer on the 31 12 I am now unable to claim this back and am 270 out of pocket poor after service , I often stay in Plaza hotels and I received an upgrade this time which was appreciated
505518,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Nothing , Everything was great amazing breakfast fantastic pool well equipped fitness centre and very close to Waterloo Station which makes the travelling experience very easy 
505519,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Staff unpleasant not helpful at all and very rude Food was disgusting and overpriced They could never seem to get a single order right Drink prices were outrageous and the bartenders had no idea what they were doing Entire hotel was unorganized and we didn t feel safe at all we were evacuated the day before NYE at 3 00am from our rooms and all staff were on the street outside instead of inside the building helping guests find their way out It was caiotic We left a day early because we could not take the unpleasantness any longer , Great location
505520,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Cleanliness was not as good as it could be On entering the room the toilet had not been cleaned thoroughly so not a good first impression Good size room studio however very fiddly light switches with too many options made it difficult to use the various lighting options Give me a basic on off switch Twin beds in the room had a camp bed feel and were not very comfortable with plastic under sheets which didn t make for the best night s sleep Overall layout of the hotel is a bit disorganised with reception and check in on the first floor which is ridiculous when you have a lot of luggage and small children Overall style over function Would not stay here again , Good location and little traffic noise

505622,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The majority of the staff we met did not have English as their mother tongue and although we managed without problems it seemed a bit strange to speak better English as a foreigner in a British hotel It seems that all the money has been splashed on a very expensive room interior but then there is no budget for maintenance The curtains were not properly attached to their rails and doors were hanging tilted in their hinges It was also frustrating to come back after a day in the city at 17 00 and not find our room cleaned yet They were about to start but we were exhausted and wanted to take a shower I expect this to be done at the end of the afternoon And then there is the overall feel of the place They want to create an elitish feel to the whole place which meant that I didn t really feel welcome in my jeans t shirt The beautiful dining room they boast about in the pictures is only for executives or if you pay 50 pounds extra , The locations is great right at the end of Westminster Bridge Right between Westminster Underground station and Waterloo station The room looked modern and well furnished We were upgraded to a studio which meant some extra living space When you include breakfast you can choose to have it in the breakfast room or have it delivered for free to your room felt very luxurious

505656,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, We did have a minor issue with a drink we bought in the bar We wanted to take it to the room however we were stopped and told they had to take it for health and safety which on its own was not a problem However it arrived at our room quite a bit later as it had ice in it that had now melted and being a single malt whiskey the drink was now ruined That being said they did rectify and replace with a fresh drink You did occasionally feel like you were been lead by some staff into a choice you didn t want to make the example being when we required a taxi we approached a gentleman who was very helpful and offered assistance with our many bags We asked whether we could hire a car rather than catch a taxi from the rank as we wanted something a little more comfortable and generally they are a bit cheaper over a long distance He enquired with a colleague who quite unreasonably said if we wanted cheaper to get the tube baring in mind we had a lot of luggage and forcefully suggested we catch one from the rank he obviously gets some kind of kick back from the taxis at the rank As we were in no mood to argue we went along with it the first gentleman enquired with the taxi driver and again helped with our bags Suffice to say this was reflected in the fact that we only tipped the first gentleman , Location and views were excellent generally staff were very helpfully and Friendly The whole place had a nice atmosphere A bit of advice be prepared with cash of all denominations as you ll want to give tips where you have had good service but for excellent service you may want to give a little more 
505657,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The facilities at the hotel was very good but poorly managed The staff were inexperienced and some had poor attitude I asked to promote for higher category room did not pay much but found out the room was smelling like damp it clearly was closed for some time and not been attended to There in room dining service was quick but the food was not so great for the price The shower had no water pressure but was enough and if two people were using the toilet one only gets hot water , The location was excellent very close to main attractions and easy to reach by tube They have an excellent spa

505659,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The fact that one of the best view from the hotel to the bridge is restricted or you have to pay some cash to be able to stay there is something I don t fancy , The location of the hotel is very close to most of the London side attractions

505671,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Location is perfect Rooms in general are great but bathroom for the disabled is terrible for the normal people Why it was room with accessible room Because Booking com did not let me PROPERLY know about Even Microsoft Windows asks are you sure you want to delete it The accessible room can not be a default room at booking time it should be specifically requested However both Booking com and Park Plaza Westminster Bridge hotel think more about profit rather than happy customers As result we were suffering 3 days in the room with defective bathroom speepery flow b c it for the wheelchair not for human feet low sink tub no hooks on the wall alarm ropes everywhere etc was tremendously inconvenient , When I complained about to Customer desk manager Hajer she was not nice to say the least blamed me in such booking sure I liked accessible room new about and and booked it myself When I asked a piece of paper and pen to write down her name she rejected and started to cover her badge by hands just outrageous behavior However I still managed to see remember her name Anyway I paid about 330 per night to suffer 3 night in this hotel Great hotel for accessible room type I would sudgest to everyone who still trust and use Booking com to carfully check the detail of their booking and to not rely on the normal default room type Really bad experience overall

505673,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I would upgrade to a room with an outside view because there s limited natural light and you can t tell what the weather is doing otherwise Important when deciding what clothes to wear for a day out If you re not bothered by this and it s just a place to sleep perfect , Fantastic location 5mins stroll to Waterloo underground Staff all very polite and visibly working very hard Breakfast was lovely with lots of choice Rooms are well equipped with a safe and fridge love the bath and shower Ice machine on communal corridor is a great idea

505675,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The only slight negative was that breakfast was a bit of a rush with staff quick to clear plates away Lovely food though , Great location Very comfortable room
505676,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Hotel was a lot bigger and busier than I d envisaged So many American tour group making check in queue too long Not good in a hotel at this price Also our 1 bed suite felt over designed I e too much pointless oversized furniture glass coffee table but not enough storage Ridiculously small wardrobe And as for the lighting come on guys over complicated too dark and nobody needs a red night light in the bathroom , Location is incredible and felt really lucky to be in such a great position but it didn t come cheap of course Liked the size of our 1 bed suite The porters were great in their city gent outfits
505677,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The staff was a little rude and kept knocking on our door at 8 30am every morning Think they must have got the wrong room Little annoying as it woke us up , I liked the style of the hotel very moden And great location

505680,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Poor lighting in the lifts and corridors, We were greeted as soon as we entered the building directed to the check in desks by a lovely gentleman There was a error on our booking reagarding the number of guests but this was dealt with straight away with no trouble When we arrived in our room my daughter was thrilled to see a card a very large piece of cake was left for her Birthday they had even gone to the trouble of leaving plates knives napkins The room had everything we required more Very clean good quality refreshments toiletries We will definitely be visiting again we have already recommended this hotel to friends 
505681,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Burger was cooked wrong and when it came back it had been put under a grill to cook more but the cheese had burnt on top giving the burger a bad taste, Location
505682,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, A lack of focus from a staff member when I checked out could have costed me a double charge This lack of check out attention was out of sync with everything else which was of a very high standard , The hotel is very well located very close to Westminster bridge Very close to the tube station Hotel is professional in all respects and exactly what I would expect from this standard of hotel Room was also excellent and room service very good

505688,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The washroom was too dark for make up Occasional shortfalls in service Examples 1 When I asked room service to send someone in and pick up the heavy meal tray I was asked to put the tray outside the door of my room instead As a result the glass of unfinished fine dropped out of the tray and left a mark on the carpet 2 I had an issue with one item on the bill when I checked out Instead of sending someone from concierge up to talk to me the front desk officer asked me to go down one floor to speak with concierge and then go up again to settle the bill when I had 2 pieces of heavy luggages with me Not thoughtful at all Don t go to the Japanese restaurant in the hotel The sashimi wasn t fresh and was overpriced for that quality , Location of the hotel just 5 minutes walk to Waterloo station Comfort level of the room It was spacious Staff members were generally friendly and helpful with restaurant reservations tourist information and directions Preparation of room service meals was efficient The spa had a nice ambience and Asian decor After massage the therapist offered one beautiful sound of a Tibetan singing bowl to bring my mind back to the present moment 
505689,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, A little on the expensive side for work as I don t get the whole amount re imbursed I still choose to stay here as the quality is consistently excellent , Clean friendly and efficient
505690,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I did not get the wifi in the room , We love almost everything about this hotel It is located directly in front of Big Ben London eye is also very near by close to a tube station so it was very easy to get around town Right in front of the hotel you also find a bus stop so getting around London from this location is very easy The room is really nice it has high quality finish in everything Simply put a superb hotel

505696,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Pullout sofa bed was very uncomfortable Only supported the top half of body even though only one 120 pound person slept on it With two TVs we expected a door between the bedroom and the sitting area or better acoustics , The location 
505697,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Towels do not appear clean On our third day of stay we went down at 10 to take breakfast Many items were already missing and when we asked for things like cheese we were told sorry no more We find this unacceptable , The location 
505698,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Lighting and decor in the rooms and hotel is a bit too dark and moody Too many small spotlights too much dark wood Breakfast was not good The boiled eggs were like rubber balls and the scrambled eggs were sloppy Mould on the shower ceiling No extractor fan had been installed For the price I expected better , Great location and the hotel makes a very grand impression Free room upgrade was appreciated 
505699,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, breakfast buffet very poor We arrived at just after opening at 6 30 Scrambled egg was cold tomatoes were cold bacon was not properly cooked sausage was cold Suggesting this was not freshly cooked food Checkin checkout lines unacceptably long and procedures could be better if you have a confirmed reservation it should be a simple matter of giving CC and going to room as it is in the US and elsewhere At gbp 380 for 1 night London is just getting outrageously expensive , modern good location nice bathroom We paid upgrade of 70 gbp for a 1 bed suite which was very nicely appointed Staff courteous We asked for pot of tea at breakfast which was served promptly
505700,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Minor but noticeable reduction in cleanliness from previous visit two years ago and some visible wear and tear in the room , Fantastic location and helpful staff 
505701,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Waiting to check in we up graded our room then they didn t have the room In the end we got a suit with a little bit of a view of the London eye , A lovely break away in London close to attractions and quiet Staff are friendly and the room was lovely Concierge is very accommodating 
505702,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The room layout was awful light switch was inside the room near the far wall bed was not comfortable at all Queued for 25 minutes just to get checked in not worth the money at all, The location in London was good
505703,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, It maybe an age thing but I found the dim mood lighting in the bedroom very off putting just glad I didn t drop anything on the floor , We chose the hotel due to its proximity to Waterloo to get back from the rugby at Twickenham location was spot on only issue with our visit was the train problems that eve not at all related to the hotel Rooms very clean breakfast was excellent Cocktails were excellent too 
505704,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Breakfast venue was slightly disappointing compared to the rest of the hotel A nicer breakfast venue was available for VIP guests There was a discrepancy with our mini bar bill which took a couple of hours to get sorted even though we were waiting to check out The guy at customer services was very helpful but the mini bar team responsible for checking weren t available and didn t appreciate any sense of urgency apologise for any convenience A sensor driven system is great we hadn t drunk anything but my niece had moved a bottle in the fridge but when a discrepancy is raised it would be useful if it could be sorted quickly particularly as we were only on a one night trip to London and so were keen to get out and explore , The studio room we had was fantastic and the fact you can see Big Ben from the foyer and every time you get out the lift to walk towards the room was amazing Brilliant location 
505705,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I didn t like the size of the room for how much I paid I thought I would be getting a bit more really, The room was nice I booked a studio although was expecting living room to be a bit bigger from the description but was very nice Night life in the hotel was great and staff are very welcoming always there when you need something

505717,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, It is expensive Absence of car park, Very centrally located Rooms spacious clean with nice decor Good access to gym and swimming pool bars and restaurant
505718,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Long wait to check in Having to pay extra to sit in a lounge with a view Having to pay extra to use the pool EVERY surface was very dark and the lift was like the inside of a 70 s disco I am told this is the fashion now but I found it very dark and dismal and if you have poor eyesight it was very difficult to see , The location 
505719,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, We told the hotel it was our 1st wedding anniversary and we got upgraded from a superior room to a suite with big ben view and a cake in the room Great location couldn t be any better with an amazing view 
505720,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, selling room upgrades at checkin instead of upgrading for good will breakfast was poorly organised due to loads of customers hot food was poor quality , room was excellent with 12th floor view over the London Eye bar was reasonably priced with good music Hotel just lacked friendliness 
505721,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Asked for upgrade on booking Later the hotel offered an upgrade at less than half the at time of booking price but still charged the original price on check out If you want to upgrade wait a while , Location View of Big Ben from superior room was brilliant Excellent breakfast and no extra cost to have it in bed 
505722,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Room not cleaned or replenished one day Offered a knife covered in baked beans to use as a bread knife he couldnt be bothered to get a clean one my daughter had to wipe it with a serviette Taken into sushi room for breakfast before we had finished 20mins we were told we had 5mins to leave , The decor very artistic 
505723,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The check in receptionist was utterly rude when she was arguing that my booking had been cancelled when it had not She refused to accept this and was so derogatory towards me by turning the screen round and tapping it to say it is cancelled I insisted on speaking to the manager who confirmed my booking as per the booking reference and I checked in all ok The receptionist however never apologised once Clearly she needs training to do her job and in basic manners Avoid Oana when you check in or out ,No Positive
505724,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Worst check in I have had 30 mins and then after paying for our family s three rooms my son attempted to check in to be told we need payment so back to reception again service in bar at night very poor the lighting in our room was not great and the controls seem to have a mind of their own, Good location rooms a good size we had a studio room so plenty of space
505725,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The free wifi wasn t particularly great however you can pay for a better service , The staff was very friendly always smiling and helpful as well 
505726,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The check in was a pain as there is no proper queuing system and the officers are not paying enough attention to whom next to be serviced I was waiting for 30 minutes to check in and really frustrated The free WiFi is NOT working properly and it gets worse during the night They had to move my room to a diff floor in order to get the WiFi but despite of the fact still not working and I eventually gave up , The Hotel is in a prime location just 5 min away from London eye and Big Ben and I found it value for money
505727,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The spa treatments were disappointingly expensive , We chose this hotel specifically to visit the London Eye and the location couldn t have been better The staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were of a good size The pool was an added bonus and the kids made full use of it Great trip and would definitely recommend it 
505728,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, The only thing I didn t like was the tea and coffee served out of flasks at breakfast obviously coffee had been in the tea flask before and the same with the coffee For a hotel of this standard you would expect a pot of tea of coffee for each table , This was an excellent hotel in an excellent location had room service for our evening meal waiter came and set the table up made us feel really special 
505729,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Breakfast should be included with the price, The hotel was just fabulous location couldn t be better it was spotless beautiful rooms Even the internal view wasn t bad Staff were very helpful and nice on checking in the member of staff took us to the lifts personally which was really nice as they were tucked away Staff can tend to be impersonal in big places like this but they really weren t here Every member of staff said hello to us 
505730,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,No Negative, Great efficient and friendly staff who gave my friend and I a free upgrade to a superior suit 24 hour open door policy which was great for me as I can t sleep very well and like to go out in the small hours and explore Very nice place to stay

505770,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, I have been so extremely upset and utterly amazed about how horrible of an experience my partner and I actually had in your hotel I guess I ll begin where the first red flag was As we were checking in a lady came up to another attendant behind your front desk counter and said I just checked out and I need help with something The female attendant said there was nothing she could do to help her since she had already checked out of your facility I should of known then this was NOT going to be a pleasurable experience Then we stepped into your bar area and spent over 100 pounds eating and having a couple drinks We realized at that moment all we had in our wallets were all 50 and needed some change We asked the bartender if he could give us change He said no he couldn t because he couldn t open the till WHICH I UNDERSTAND But seconds later we were still sitting there and someone came up and paid for a drink with cash he opened the register and then closed it again Full well knowing we were still sitting there and was hoping for change of some sort We then were of to see a show on the West End We returned at around 9 30 We were looking for some sort of dessert place or ice cream I went to the desk of the Customer Relations and a gentleman was VERY rude to me and said he was NOT the concierge I had no idea what his title was But instead of guiding me to the concierge he just went on with his discussion with another employee leaving me standing there Then we went downstairs and found the concierge counter They also were no help to me not knowing where we could find desserts or ice cream I find that baffling that in London at 9 30 there s NO WHERE to go We walk out of your hotel and now it s after 10 15pm and we find two places not even a block away but because it was now after 10 00 they were closing and not accepting any new customers ,No Positive
