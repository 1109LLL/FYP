270891,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Fewer restaurants around as quieter area, Staff very friendly and helpful Quiet area to stay Easy to travel to centre of town Very pretty terrace at hotel 
270892,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Location a little too far out but then it was quiet So you can t have it all , Quiet area Had balcony room at rear so views of courtyard Breakfast was
270893,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Paying more for a extra night in a down graded room n that really wasnt a king size bed , The guy on reception very helpfull late early hrs off the morning
270894,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Room ok but en suite toilet bathroom was often poorly ventilated and smelly suggest it needs re modernization , Quiet location and reasonable level of room comfort
270895,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Very tight room Had issues with the safe but finally new batteries solved the problems , Very nicely decorated easy walk to the Tram Nice breakfast Very helpful staff Quiet room 
270896,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, The only complaint we had was the noise of the air conditioner in our room which I m assuming would apply to only one room in the hotel and could perhaps be dealt with , The hotel was in a quiet area of the city easily reached by public transportation It had bicycles to rent which made a day at the park a great experience and left us feeling like true members of Amsterdam The staff was very helpful and the breakfast was great in a setting that brought you back to an era long past 
270897,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Taxi to hotel from Centraal Station expensive and driver took the long way round 36 euros typical tourist rip off Tram took less time and cheap , Extensive breakfast in charming room well furnished with attentive staff Bedrooms comfortable and well appointed Art deco style building with club style library bar Quiet location in residential area Travel to city centre easy by tram services located nearby 
270898,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, The hotel is kind of far from city center so you need to take tram or bike The hotel is in the middle of residential neighborhood The neighborhood is quiet nice though When we arrived the napkins box was left empty In the toilet there was hair from after shave from the people before us and it wasn t cleaned The next day when we left the room we came back and we found that the room was only organized but nothing was cleaned The hair was still on the floor and the dirty towels were hanged again though we made sure we put them on the floor We told this to the reception and the hotel manager when we checked out They apologized and they offered us free coffee The price is not worth the value you get , The staff are super friendly They explained to us how to get to places and they helped us with the luggage We liked the hotel style as it s very cozy The AC is perfect They have a terrace outdoor We had a car and it was easy to find parking on the street just in front of the hotel 
270899,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, The lift is TINY barely accommodates two with luggage Don t plan on the stairs with your bags as an alternate option they are extremely steep The bathroom towel bar was so high I could barely reach it to get towels and the room could use more hooks for towels robes etc Wifi was a little slow at times These annoyances are not enough to wave me off from staying again if in the area Loved the location and friendly staff , Very nice and friendly staff they were able to provide our room to us early morning which was a great bonus Loved the location away from the busy central area but a quick tram ride to most anywhere A local neighborhood feel Outstanding breakfast buffet 
270900,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Character hotel with charming decor and friendly staff Located in quiet leafy suburb and within easy reach of museums and an effortless commute to tourist attractions We were celebrating a milestone birthday and the hotel upgraded our room Highly recommended if you want to avoid the crowds and experience another side of Amsterdam

270903,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, There was a good choice of cold and cooked food but the cooked food had obviously been cooked some time earlier , The location with easy access to central Amsterdam beautiful local environment and helpful staff 
270904,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, First night we had to endure in a TINY room and the staff didn t even warn us about it Bike rentals at the hotel very convenient but pricey , Good spot for a hotel fairly quiet in the rooms at the back Breakfast not included so we cycled into town for that 
270905,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, I can t think of anything negative to say except the staircase is a little steep , We enjoyed everything I can t think of a negative thing to say The breakfast was included in our room price and there was lots to choose from The beds were comfortable most of the European hotels we ve stayed have two single mattresses pushed together which is fine with us as it s a lot bigger than a double The hotel is down a residential street so it was quiet with a large grassed area with plenty of trees outside

270915,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Serivice was poor cost nearly 200 for one night when we told this to the manager about the ridiculous noise levels he offered us a free breakfast which came frezzing cold and was poor then when confronted when we left he could only produce a poor apology with a stupid smirk on his face shrugging his shoulders feel completely ripped off would recommend anyone that s thinking about staying here not to bother wasting your money, Nothing

270922,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, When I went to check out there was a lot pf confusion about what had and hadn t been paid I was almost charged for a room I had cancelled and was charged for breakfast twice The lady at the desk was very sweet about it but I had to check everything thoroughly , This is a lovely hotel decorated in an old world style The rooms are comfy Its a little far out of the centre but its a nice area and transport links are good The staff were lovely Inwas in town for a special event and they left a bottle prosecco and a personal congratulations in my room while I was out

270971,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, It was a little far from most of the action of the city We got in around 9pm our first night and there weren t many people around and most restaurants were closed The positive side is that it was really quiet at night However it was hard for us to find a place to eat without being too familiar with the city , The beds were really comfy and the breakfast was phenomenal The bathroom was clean and the room was bright

270990,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Everything was good, We were upgraded on arrival and the room was spacious bed very comfy room was quiet with windows open Staff were really friendly and helpful Lovely selection for breakfast and good coffee 
270991,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Renew the tea coffee without being asked Vacuum under the bed The lift is idiosyncratic and the TV too smart for older folk , All the staff were friendly and helpful at any time of day or night and the hotel is really beautifully decorated in a splendid neighbourhood We loved the bar and breakfast room and the fact we could walk to the museum area or catch the trams 
270992,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Unfortunately there was some very noisy drilling going on behind our bathroom wall on the last morning which we were woken up by and had to call the reception to ask them to stop Although they were apologetic stopped it and even gave us a slight discount because of it I felt they should have been better organized and not scheduled maintenance work next to a room that was occupied , The breakfast was great the room a little small but comfortable and the service faultless 
270993,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Tea and coffee making facilities in the room would have been nice , Excellent breakfast choice friendly helpful staff nothing was too much trouble Really crisp and clean bed linen and towels Really lovely homely hotel
270994,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, The hotel was a little far from the main part of town too far to walk but easy to get to on the tram It was worth the tram ride for a nice hotel, The bed was very comfy and the room was a nice temperature The free toiletries were nice and the room was immaculate Very old hotel which had kept its original charm 
270995,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Nothing , The rooms were warm and welcoming tastefully furnished comfortable beds with crisp white linen safe and fridge in the room A good size bathroom with toiletries and hairdryer Everywhere spotlessly clean A pleasure to stay and I would love to go back again Thank you so much

270997,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Nothing , Pleasantly surprised for a last minute choice Very nice hotel excellent staff nice breakfast and perfect location There is a tram stop within 5 minutes walking that takes you to all the sights and downtown The tram is a far better way to travel vice a taxi in Amsterdam Inexpensive and convenient Really nice bar and theatre in the hotel as an added bonus 
270998,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Would be nice to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room Although there was always a complimentary bottle of normal and sparkling water on each occasion we drank them The room we stayed in had a tiny bath so if you like to soak away you would have to tuck your knees up The shower was a hose attachment to the bath taps not really powerful But as long as it worked and cleaned you who cares its only for a couple of days and we shower rather than bath so the size of bath didn t bother us Not sure if all the rooms have the same size baths , The bed was extremely comfortable They were two large single beds pushed together so they were not actually double beds but no complaints about that The hotel was very quiet and is located in the suburbs of Oud Zuid Old South it is approx 30min walk slow pace quicker if you walk faster to reach right into the Centrum There are many trams lines and the two which are closest to the hotel are No 5 and 24 and these take you right through the center and up to central station So in summery the hotel is away from the hustle and bustle of the city but just a short hop skip and jump from every thing including the major museums and Vondlepark which is just a 15 minute gentle stroll The staff are very helpful and courteous we did not have breakfast at the hotel as there was a nice cafe not far away that served an excellent breakfast variety The hotel also has a 55 seater theater but there was no performances during our stay The reception and lounge is decorated in a past gone by with chandeliers leather chairs and book cases if you want a modern looking hotel go elsewhere We stayed in one of the superior suites and it was nice and spacious There is a fridge in the room that you can use to keep you beer wine or chocolate cool I wouldn t say cold but cool We had a lovely time and apart from some very minor things we would recommend this hotel especially for the mature person not so sure it would suit young persons 
270999,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, The shower head curtains didn t fully block out light no tea coffee making facilities although advertised, Very comfy bed clean smart tv wonderful staff
271000,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Rather noisy intermittently plumbing problem when I told staff on my departure they were unaware of the problem and thanked me for pointing it out and would investigate , Generally clean comfortable and convenient with friendly helpful staff Good shower and lovely toiletries Hotel has a small theatre unfortunately nothing playing during my stay 
271001,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Nothing , Wonderful and beautiful boutique hotel in great area Staff is beyond helpful and service minded great breakfast too To be highly recommended 
271002,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, The Windows were single glazed so could hear the traffic whiz past Luckily it is not a very busy road so you you dont get too disturbed The walls are thin so the ringing phone next door awoke me from deep sleep And no provision for hot water or tea coffee Guess it s a European thing , Excellent decor Comfortable stay Courteous and friendly staff Good location 
271003,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Friendly helpful staff at the reception Really nice quiet location I have really liked the backyard we sat there for an afternoon coffee and enjoyed the sunshine 
271004,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, At 230 euros for a night it was at the more expensive end It is also quite a walk from centre but by tram 5 it s a quick trip , The breakfast is amazing and the staff are very helpful Would recommend this to people wanting to treat themselves 
271005,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Two tiny things in the bathroom There should be some hooks for cloth and there could be a larger shield between shower and the rest of the bathroom, The staff was very friendly helpful and competent The hotel situated near to important places of the town

271008,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Everything was perfect It was room service every day What can we wait more , We ve liked everything We were for the first time in Amsterdam and everything we want it to know we found out from the hotel staff They were very nice and helpfull Everything was just perfect It s a hotel where we will come back for sure 
271009,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, No tea coffee facilities No dressing gown and slippers No double bed Paid for an upgrade but room felt basic Not a 4star no way a b b Booked this for my partners birthday and let the hotel know in advance that I wanted to make it special for her It was not, Location was nice

271012,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Asked for a standard double but got two twin beds pushed together Building work going on which I guess is the reason the hotel had a discount on Wouldn t say full price would be good value , Nice hotel Comfortable sized rooms Good to stay in if you want to be out of the centre but within walking distance still and also tram round the corner If you didn t want to walk Really close to Vondelpark Breakfast was delicious with a great choice little pricey but not if you make the most of it Free use of umbrella 
271013,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Window leaked in our room No 64 Lift is tiny also not self contained No bathmat so having a shower was dodgy to keep your footing , The beds were indeed very comfy Bathroom though small was still quite good All furnishings well in keeping with the style of the place Nice little bar Oh also 20 25 seat theater who would have thought Staff so good so helpful 
271014,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, I feel breakfast was too expensive 15pp every morning was a complete no no for our budget , We were very lucky to be upgraded to a suite for valentines weekend due to me being on crutches The staff were very helpful and friendly 
271015,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, A do not disturb sign would be great The walls are quite thin so whenever there is noise in the corridor or the next room it s quite loud , Great location for museums and concert hall Very comfortable bed and room Would definitely stay again Also the street noise is minimal 
271016,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, The room was facing a road so there was a fair bit of traffic noise Also very little sound proofing between rooms , Location is really good close to a tram stop to go into central or 20mins walk from the De Pijp area which has lots of really nice bars and restaurants

271024,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Obviously they are in train of renovating I still had one of the old rooms Which was completely outdated and especially the room carpet floor was not clean at all The bathroom was better In a new room it might be different but still cleaning should be improved , Staff is extremely friendly and helpful breakfast is extensive

271031,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Since there was no shower curtain a piece of glass was there to partially prevent water poured out to the bathroom when taking shower I would suggest creating a sign or a plate for Do Not Disturb , Great location very near the tram station The reception staff was helpful even I arrived very late in the night The room was very kozy and not much noise from other rooms during my stay 
271032,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Only suggestion would be it would be nice to have climate control the room the children were in was very hot even when we turned off the heating , Hotel was in a great position staff really friendly and helpful breakfast good Hired bikes from the hotel too

271036,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, For the price I paid for one night I stayed for 3 nights and paid 500 euros with no complimentary coffee and tea that s just not acceptable If I wanted to get complimentary coffee I had to get down from third floor so not really good when first thing you wake up craving some caffeine Garden didn t look like it was maintained properly definitely didn t look like the pictures And from the garden you could still some constructions that had been there for a while , Staff were all friendly and very pleasing to talk to Location is quiet from the hustle bustle of the city flocked with tourists so it s a bonus 
271037,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, I had hoped for more given the very high price nearly 500 Aust per night Had hoped there may have been a restaurant so I could eat there in the evenings I saw tables and chairs in the garden in the picture and had hoped this would be the case , Close to Rai convention centre Easy walk to good restaurants and shopping in Beethoven Straat Close to centre of town and museums Had a tiny balcony where I sat in the sun and read on the day I arrived which was nice and windows that opened Staff very pleasant and helpful

271041,Apollofirst Boutique Hotel, Whilst it did not impact on our experience in anyway to make us have a bad trip their fridge did not seem to get cold enough to keep drinks cool and the TV seemed to have an issue with the colours however neither of these things really bothered us that much , Staff were very friendly and helpful location was a little out of the city but it was nice and quiet with easy access to public transport It was a very lovely hotel in a lovely area with shops close by too
