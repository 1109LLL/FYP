515413,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Initial receptionist very functional told us off for looking near her computer Hotel undergoing renovation no prior knowledge of this other than told entrance moved had to walk through redecorating area to access room no fitness available on site , Most staff very helpful Air con and internet good
515414,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, That the reciption is very small and connected to bar which made us confuse when we reached and we did not know where to check in Other than that everything was perfect best of luck , Everything was good and breakfast was so delicious This hotel is recommended
515415,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, I expected To have a kettle and coffee tea in the room as we normally always have in the rooms The second bed was not comfortable too low postured , The room is very nice and clean We had a balcony in the room and it was nice 
515416,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The hallway was shocking Construction everywhere Two elevators took us to a second building which was connected with the hotel The hallway in this part was old and did not match the style of the entrance at all The room was old scratches everywhere The Airconditioning was old and very loud but not working properly Unfortunately their was no button to witch it of because the regulation was broken , The staff seemed to be students working at the hotel they first impression of the enterance hall was good Modern style
515417,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, We had booked two different rooms and specified few weeks in advance that we wanted the rooms next to each other but still got rooms far from each other No shampoo or other stuff in the bathrooms Old and almost molding hotel rooms Nowhere to sit apart from your bed when you have visitors Poor AC stank very badly and was almost broken , A shoppingcenter right around the corner 
515418,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Bad chose vor value money Around ight clubs low rates Too far to center by walk Lasy staff on reseption Poor furniture My rate of this place is 3 , Good linen on bed Conditioner 
515419,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, we arrived late at night and needed some food the area where the hotel was situated wasn t the nicest we ate at a nearby shopping centre which wasn t very nice I am glad I was with my husband as well as my mother in law as the area and the locals made me feel intimidated , the staff were very helpful before I arrived I contacted them as I needed reassuring that the guest bed would be made on our arrival as I had an 83 year old lady travelling with us your staff reassured me all would be good and it was the bed and pillows were very comfortable and the room was very clean although the room was small it didn t feel cluttered good experience overall 
515420,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Unfortunately there was big building works going on in the hotel and started early in morning with what sounded like pneumatic dills and hammers bit picky but there wasn t much shelf space in bathroom to put cosmetic items The garden view as described was a courtyard that had a glass roof of the shopping centre in the centre with a small width between the roof and hotel walls , Good access to local transport staff very helpful and understood English well and rooms kept clean daily 
515421,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The hotel is undergoing refurbishment of the restaurant and arrangements were made to have breakfast in a nearby restaurant on our first morning The refurbished restaurant was declared ready for the next day this wasn t quite right because the lighting was not yes finished which made the place very dark and gloomy the very opposite condition for a bright start to a new day I understand perfectly that refurbishment is necessary and needs to be done with as little disruption to occupancy levels but due consideration must be given to the inconvenience to guests a mere apology is mean Good customer relations are paramount and a convincing gesture of regret is always better supporte with a discount of sorts When will hotels ever learn that repeat business is the key , Staff at reception very helpful with local knowledge and transport facilities 
515422,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, It does not really get to 4 star marking if you have heavy bags there is a problem getting down the stairs to the reception The charge of 14 euros per breakfast is really too much for the offered variety , Convenient location for business travels as close to the Westbahnhof station The premises are not new all is clean the rooms are nice Recommended for short trips absolutely 
515423,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Nothing at all , The bed was comfortable the rooms were well made There is ample paid underground parking and metro station nearby The building also has a mall attached to it to get lunch dinner 
515424,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Breakfast is 14 per person and is not particularly good Air conditioning was broken for the full duration of our stay 4 nights and the only blankets available were heavy We asked for lighter sheets but never got them, Staff is friendly
515425,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, It is not as central as it sounded and the hotel itself is very oddly structured so you can be quite a distance away from the elevators or the desk for assistance My hope was that would make it more quiet but really the noise just echoes through the long hallways The bed was two twin beds pushed together which separated a couple of times during the night so my husband just about fell through I just checked my card and there has been an additional charge that I didn t sign for nor was there anything used at the hotel or in the room ,No Positive
515426,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, It s not really the comfort of a 4 star hotel I booked here because it had a discount 59 per night otherwise the price was 150 per night The hotel is not worth 150 night , The locatiin was good there was a parking place nearby 15 per day The staff was very nice 
515427,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, No tea or coffee making facilities but as there was no kettle as stated it didn t really matter nor were there any slippers as stated TV did not work on whole floor for 2 days phone did not work at all which we reported Poor selection mini bar and expensive Bathroom only included fixed squeezy soap containers for shower and basin and no flannel no hair shampoo No English breakfast tea in restaurant only herbal or Earl Grey so had to have coffee Location for us a bit to far from City centre although underground across the road cheap ticket and 1 change gets you there in 10 12 mins Noisy air conditioning had to turn off at night For these reasons would not class it 4 star , Fairly spacious room and reasonably comfortable bed and adequate wardrobe space 
515428,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Perhaps the location was a little far out of the city but the underground was nearby and easy to use The bus was also a very short distance from the hotel We don t mind walking so it didn t present a problem for us 20 30 minutes walk into the heart of Vienna depending on personal walking speed , Excellent breakfast I m a non meat eater and my partner eats meat so we were both happy with the choice and quality of the breakfast The staff in the hotel were excellent and very helpful Overall very good value for money 
515429,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The overall room amenities were more for a 3 star hotel room at top floor was very small furniture was old very little space for clothes painting on the walls was dirty in some places probably form other tourists trying to accommodate the luggage in such a small room No kettle coffee or tea facilities like in other 4 star hotels we ve been Although the cleaning lady visited our room every day to change the towels the wooden floor was always dirty full of dust , Staff at the reception was helpful and breakfast was fine fresh and various food available Also the hotel is very close to the subway station 
515430,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The reception staff were efficient but not very friendly unlike the cleaning lady on our floor I was concerned about security as the reception was down steps from entrance and staff did not always sit at desk The door and access to all floors was easily accessible from the road this is presumably why a voucher system operated for breakfast We had no problems though The cable tv only worked on two days , The room was a reasonable size and clean with large en suite and large storage area Despite being next to shopping complex and busy Road hotel was quiet Breakfast was good served in pleasant room It is close to U bahn one stop from Westbahnhof 
515431,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The location for breakfast was a bit inconvenient a walk through the side door into the shopping centre where an outside firm provided breakfasts to guests and the general public The breakfast wasn t great particularly the look of the fried eggs the word cremated springs to mind This may be a temporary measure while the hotel is getting its own breakfast room refurbished because we spotted a room with a Breakfast sign on it that was closed up , It was near enough for us to walk into the centre 
515432,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, It s more 3 star city hotel breakfast was terrible you should go outside the hotel for breakfast very noisy outside not worth of that money , Staff were very kind hotel is near shopping center clean and comfortable room good conection to the city center 8
515433,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Room temperature was very very high without any possibility to adjust it , The hotel is near to the metro and the staff were friendly Breakfast was very good and the room was clean 
515434,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, We were in an annexe of the main hotel and had to walk out into the main road and back into the reception area The receptionists description of how to use the public underground car park was misleading and caused an hour of frustration The lift was swipe access from the road but inside the public car park anyone could travel to our floor The road outside was a bit shady after dark , The room was comfortable and the TV was good The bathroom was nice and the shower worked well and we felt safe It was nice to have access to a fridge We used it to cool our beers Once we were used to where the car was parked it was easy to get things from the car The breakfast was too expensive to bother with but it did look nice Close to the Vienna tram system and the main road into old Vienna 
515435,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, the parking is easy and safe but rather expensive , very good position next to the shopping center with gastro area and subway very good breakfast clean nice hotel staff 
515436,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, a second chair in the room there was plenty of room would have been nice, When we first pulled up outside the hotel my wife expressed a little disappointment there were a number of homeless in the area but in fact the hotel was ideal The receptionist spoke excellent English as did other reception staff and was very helpful Our room 426 was on the top floor and some way from the lift but the room itself was fine and looked out over a central courtyard above a shopping centre which was planted with trees We bought tea coffee from the hotel bar each morning but didn t use any of the other facilities The hotel is some way from the centre about 1 5km but is only 50m from a Metro station so everywhere is easy to reach on the very efficient system
515437,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The bathroom is a little bit small Noise from restaurant reconstruction, Close to metro station Friendly staff Comfortable beds Next to a shopping mall You can park your car in the shopping center 40 Euro for 7 days 
515438,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Hotel was a bit noisy Rate changed to more expensive when I extended the stay by one night , Close to U6 train line Close to hospital which was purpose of visit Friendly staff 
515439,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Our original room which was booked as a superior room with garden view was small we struggled to see any garden We asked for a larger room paid extra for this Hotel corridors were lengthy narrow not a 4 star impression , Our upgraded room was very spacious had a balcony unfortunately it overlooked other parts of the hotel 
515440,Atlantis Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The room was spacious for two people and the hotel even provided the sewing kits in the room The location is also good as it is only 8 minute walk from Westbahnhof station and around 3 minute walk to Burggasse Stadthalle tram station
515441,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Just the substitute breakfast arrangement but it was not a big deal Plenty of neighborhood alternatives , The restaurant was closed for renovations The substitute arrangement was not very appealing 
515442,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Parking is possible at the underground parking of the shopping center and is 15 euro day a little bit expensive , Hotel is near the city center aprox 2km We had a room in another building 40 meters from the main building and it was very relaxing The possibility to come with the dog was great Bed was comfortable 
515443,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Very rude gentlemen at reception was just aiming to kick out people Hotel is close to a mall at nights things turn shady around the mall Bunch of youngsters create trouble , The youngsters at reception were very helpful
515444,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Very very unhappy experience The location is bad because it is a little far from center and the block gave us a uncomfortable feeling And the staff told us the air conditioner can not be used at the second night but we can use it the first day The breakfast is 16 euro one person but it is unworthy and the bed sheet is dirty and makes us feel very itching So we feel really angry ,No Positive
515445,Atlantis Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Really lovely clean hotel Great family room Perfect for our needs Good value for money Excellent breakfast with a large choice and great quality Whilst the hotel is a little out of the centre it is really easily reached as right next to tram bus and underground stops and only a 20 minute walk Staff were friendly and helpful 
515446,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, We recently stayed at this property Eventhough it was March it was very hot in the room and the air conditioning was not working when enquired with the reception reply was to keep the windows open and sleep and the AC cannot be switched on for some reason Could not sleep the whole night due to sound from outside with the windows open some nearby construction happening at night When checked next day morning with the Manager available at the reception he gave some unacceptable excuses like this is a city hotel and not a one in the woods which basically meant that we have to suffer some noise levels and started arguing that there was no noise at night etc Finally provided a Fan for the next night Thank God we stayed only for 2 nights ,No Positive
515447,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The room we got and the room that was pictured on the website was NOT the same We just had a basic room with a futon set up like a bed for the kids There was no water boiler in the room for the advertised free coffee tea and hot chocolate I went to the front desk and was given a boiler with team only Of the staff I interacted with most were friendly , Overall the stay was just OK I looked at the pictures online of the FAMILY Rooms and booked based on the photos Nothing special about the place or the hotel facilities Close to the metro stop and a shopping mall but not so close to the other interesting tourist activities 
515448,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, room was little bit dark no ceiling light and overlooked by a restaurant bar so we preferred not ot open the shuttles of the windows However it was absolutely OK for the purpose of our stay and even it feels cosy so no problems generally , everything was nice breakfast was fabulous staff was very friendly room was tidy every day great location clean and nice hotel highly recommended overall 
515449,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The room was a bit more stark than I had anticipated We were given a room in the newer part of the hotel which was separate from the main entrance would have been more of an issue if we were staying there for breakfast , Great location if attending the Stadthalle as we were literally around the corner Excellent access to underground into the main areas of the city 
515450,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Internet was not always working queen sized bed is in reality two one person beds put together very warm in the room clima device was set on warm air ,No Positive
515451,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, We had a standard room the covering of the floor and walls looks slightly outdated but clean Perhaps the rooms of a higher category have a more modern finishing In general we really enjoyed staying at the hotel , Close to metro station courteous friendly and efficient staff modern bathroom comfortable mattresses on the beds varied and tasty breakfast quiet room with windows facing the courtyard The management of the hotel is interested in guests comments about the hotel in order to improve the conditions 
515452,Atlantis Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Food selections in the restaurant preparation presentation and staff were excellent not to mention the added convenience of the restaurant being on site 
515453,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, cigarette smocking although it was not done inside the hotel somehow my room gets a lot of smoke from outside every time i opened my window , everything was nice especially breakfast and wonderful people in the restaurant area The ladies were very very nice and courteous 
515454,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Woken every morning early by the cleaners talking to each other down the corridors very loudly no consideration for the hotel guests slamming doors etc Very warm in hotel all the time hard to sleep even with the heating off , Good location near metro and loads of places to eat 
515455,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The carpets in the rooms they should exchange it with better quality or remove them they cause a lot of dust alergie, Nice hotel lovely view on rooftop rooms nice staff
515456,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, we were a couple and had requested a double bed however the hotel only had two separate beds, breakfast was very good the support staff was cheerful and paid attention to the customers requirements 
515457,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Everything was fine , The location was excellent just as much as the helpful staff The girls at the breakfast buffet we really pretty and the breakfast itself was more than enough to start the day off with I am gonna book again for June sine I come to Vienna veey often 
515458,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Getting there on car is not convenient as they do not have parking of their own I had to park the car at one of ride Park station and get train back to hotel which takes around 15 mins But you can park in Lunger City parking beneath hotel for 2 hours for free , The customer service I like the most 
515459,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, No shower curtain in bath Also no tea or coffee making facilities in room We had asked for twin beds sofa but we were given 3 beds However the room had 2 armchairs so that was not an issue for us, Staff were friendly if you needed something they responded immediately About 2 min walk from the underground system so easy to get around Also just around corner from Wiener Stadthalle which was ideal for us as we were going to a concert there
515460,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Booked a Superior Room for extra facilities such as mini bar coffee and kettle bath robes Sky TV garden view vase of fresh flowers etc Our room did not have any of the these When we spoke to the manager he said these facilities were not available in the hotel as all the rooms were standard On their website however they clearly advertise Superior Rooms at an extra cost A cost which we paid for When showing the manager the website of a Superior Room I was told that this was only for advertising No refund was offered but instead was told by the manager that if we want a kettle to pick it up from the bar If we want a drink in the room to go down four flights of stairs to the bar The garden view was a street of scaffolding with the hotel situated in the red light district They advertised the Superior Rooms with extra large double beds Our room had two single beds pushed together along with two single duvets Overall our room was tired in appearance bedside lamps did not work and what we paid extra for did not exist Atlantis Hotel is clearly under breach of false advertising Beware , The shower

515466,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, They did not give me what they have promised Instead charged me for it , The construction which was going on was really an awful distraction And they promised not to charge me with the room that I requested but they did I paid 15eur for literally a terrace with no garden view at all 
515467,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, They did not have a double bed available and therefore ended up with 2 twin beds next to each other even though we had specifically asked for a double bed They insisted that 2 beds next to each other is equivalent to a double bed, The staff were helpful wherever they could and were always eager to answer our questions The hotel is very close to an underground station and is situated right next to a shopping mall and yet still very quiet 
515468,Atlantis Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Everything was fine Hotel offers room for luggage if you are before check in time Also if the room is ready you can check in before 14 00 Staff was good and answered all our questions Metro station is very near this hotel so there is no problem to get to other places in city

515481,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Rooms are nowhere near soundproof there was noise from the hall street and other rooms the property completely ignored the 2 hour early Genius check in and for the location and price I would at least expect the breakfast to be included, The staff were reasonably helpful wifi was fist and the room had an empty mini fridge which was nice
515482,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The breakfast it was very expensive so we didn t take it , Location is great 3 minute walk from Stadthalle and 3 minute walk to public transport Park garage is under the hotel and cost 15 24hours Shopping center is in the same building We were in four and we took a family room and it was very cosy we could stay in five people in too withot problem Very kind and polite staff 
515483,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Not safe position next to a U6 stop at night it was not nice coming back to the hotel room sharing a wall with the breakfast room very noisy when I had asked for a quite room even though I had a double bed they only provided me with one single duvet there was a big gap between the door and the floor allowing a lot of light to enter the room even at night , Clean rooms kind staff excellent breakfast wifi

515485,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Room was in other part of the hotel different building with its own entry kind of weird Bathroom floor around the shower cabin would be flooded after the showering probably the cabin was leaking somewhere In the morning it was very noisy due to the construction work in the building in which our room was situated Would start around 7 with the noise and drilling , Very friendly and nice staff clean rooms big bathroom Good connection to city center Tram and subway stop are around the corner of the hotel

515487,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Checkin was very slow and had to pay in advance Too expensive for what it has to offer but correct for Vienna , Simple and clean with all needed facilities Staff correct but not specially helpful Close to Stadthalle and very close to Lugner City so a lot of restaurants and cafes you can choose from Also some basic shopping possible 2 min from the metro station Big bathroom with basic toiletries Parking garage nearby with 15 eur 24 hours Decoration really basic facilities really basic 
515488,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The heating could have been at a higher temperature in the bathroom as it is now November and a bit colder in the mornings , Very spacious room clean and with lots of light It is easy to reach with public transport and the hotel is near a shopping center and a concert venue 
515489,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Check in receptionist lady Cost of parking Dirty walls on corridors Hospital feeling in staircase People on the streets of the neighborhood , Check out receptionist Viktor Breakfast and breakfast staff Proximity to Stadthalle Info letter received in email prior to our visit 
515490,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, This is not in any way by any stretch a 4 star hotel It is misleading to those booking it to claim that it is a 4 star it s like an old travel lodge which is totally fine if you know what you are getting but the rating description and pictures are not reflective of the quality of the hotel , Great location if there for an event at the stadthalle The room was exceptionally good value 
515491,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The parking garage isn t connected to the hotel and was around a ton of constructions It was freezing and whenever we needed to go to the car lobby we had to exit the hotel and walk down the street Extremely inconvenient, Staff was very accomadating and the check out time was perfect Very close to the concert venue we needed
515492,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The breakfast was very good and comprehensive but if you wanted a light breakfast you could find better value at the supermarket next door We missed having a kettle in our room for a quick cuppa , We were very pleased with the location even though it was out of the CBD The Metro was excellent for travel on a 4 day pass the Westbahnhof was one stop from the hotel 10 15 minutes walk and the airport bus went direct from outside the Mercure across the road from the station The room was fine and developments in the area didn t disturb us 
515493,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Getting into the room is a nightmare you have to carry you luggage through multiple sets of stairs and for sure with no help from the hotel staff Then walk through multiple series of corridors for quieter a long distance Other than the rooms everything else is below three starts quality Including staff , The rooms are clean and renovated
515494,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, I cannot see why this hotel can be rated with four stars The room was very average and the beds were separated in the middle It was a very average room and not at all what I expected I only slept over night however do not go here thinking it is a four star hotel The lobby is very small and I did not like the smell it smelled stale and maybe like smoke I would not reccomend this place due to the fact is is not a four star hotel maybe a three star ,No Positive

515496,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Staff did not know how to give directions to parking and second site which is not connected to main site because of construction We wandered the garage bumping into other people wandering the garage Very frustrating In the end we could not get our car out of the garage without getting staff to come to us Street blocked by construction Avoid until construction done and staff training updated , Our room was modern and clean 
515497,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The staff was slow and not really friendly , Comfortable bed great water pressure Very clean and has a good wi fi Has a convinient location not far from a subway station and a Park Ride 
515498,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Superior room didnt look somehow special I have awaited a bit more space and especially kings bed that wouldnt be just a fusion of two normal beds which kept moving apart that was bit dissapointing , Everything was clean and we did not have any major problems during our stay Hotel was well located 
515499,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, There were noise of constriction They didn t provide us with hotel slipper The bed was twin beds connected to each other where i asked for queen bed , Good room sevice

515501,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Expensive breakfast but there is a very good bakery at the mall that I recommend Away from the center , Clean and comfortable room Very close to a mall 
515502,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, I had to wait for 20 minuts in the lobby to be served I came late night around 11 pm It was dirty in the room glasses walls bathtube One of the beds what a simple mattress lying on the floor Lots of corridors with damaged dirty or missing lining For the price we have paid I would expect MUCH more , Easy access to public communication Underground parking
515503,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Hallways look institutional Breakfast is way over priced but with the mall right there other options that are better and more affordable are easily accessible , Located in a shopping mall close to transit options to easy get to the old town area and central train station The room was big had a balcony with a table and chairs A western style bathroom with a proper shower Great for families 
515504,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The hotel was a little further out of the cit centre then we anticipated but the transport connections made up for it , The beds were comfortable The staff we met were friendly and helpfull
515505,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Nothing in particular Last day the elevator did not work for some hours but it sure can happen it was nobody s fault in particular so I won t blame anyone at the hotel for this little problem , The breakfast was very good Everyone in the hotel staff was very professional but also very kind and polite They all spoke perfectly English so that if I did not know some German words etc there was never any problem in understanding each other obtaining information etc I was very satisfied with the people who work in the hotel they treat you very well

515508,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Vacuum cleaning started too early in the morning in the apartment above us so we couldn t sleep 7 00 am is way too early for that Although our stay was comfortable and enjoyable we wouldn t rate the hotel as 4 stars unfortunately Also we couldn t get onto our balcony as it was impossible to open the shutters to gain the access we spent some time figuring it out but gave up in the end , Our room was cleaned properly and the towels were changed every day What a nice welcome after a busy day of sightseeing Furthermore the room size was very generous and perfect for a family of four On the other hand the sofa bed was too small for our 13 and 16 year olds to share although we required to have a room with two single beds and a double bed when the booking was made our wishes were ignored When we complained reception staff informed us that all the rooms in the hotel were like this one we found that hard to believe 
515509,Atlantis Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The rooms were very clean and the beds comfortable We had all the necessary accessories in the room The location was perfect close to most of the public transportation A shopping center is just around the corner 
515510,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, I ordered two double rooms standard B B When we arrived at the hotel we were asked to pay before entering the room that which seemed to me curious so I asked to see the room first We received two relatively small rooms near the hall serving breakfast From these rooms can feel good smells from the kitchen and hall mese In these conditions have asked us to provide other rooms after a little consultation we received two receptionists between rooms to another floor away from the dining room but had to pay an additional price I did not know this at the time when I ordered room on the internet When I asked where the parking lot I received explanations where is the entrance to the parking lot but looked to specify the parking area allocated to hotel guests parking is common with a large commercial complex that it has determined to seek about 15 minutes the area was reserved for hotel guests , breachfast very good
515511,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, outside of the hotel and halls are not very representative, Location was very good 5 min walk to Stadthalle 5 min walk to U Bahn U6 2 min walk to smaller shopping center 
515512,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The entrance door was similar to an office and we had not a good impression on entry The user s guide of safe box was not apparently compatible with the safe box And a sentence on it that hotel accepts responsibility of safe box contents only up to Euros 500 forced us not to put our documents in there As they are more important for us compared with Euros 500 A gentleman in reception was not aware of our situation and our request for late checkout and disabled our keys at noon Although he politely fixed this , After staying there we felt really better Now we think that it is a good place to stay The ladies in the reception were quite helpful and really polite Our room was spacious The toilet were clean The breakfast was good 
515513,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The parking is in the mall area and you can really get confused while reaching out to the hotel , Perfect spot located in shopping mall very near to a metro station Clean and perfect rooms friendly staff 
515514,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Did think the breakfast was a little expensive Lift was small and slow , Very spacious comfortable room with a great refreshing shower Excellent choice of breakfast 
515515,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The neighborhood is really not a nice area We had a triple room which was sold as a room with double bed and a single bed At the end the single bed was a few sofa cushions on a wood board The long corridors at the 4th floor gave me the feeling of being in a hospital Definitely not worth 4 stars , The room surface is big enough for 3 persons 
515516,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, AC was not initially working at all After the staff worked on it it only partially worked for the remainder of our stay , Close to shopping restaurants and tram station 
515517,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Bored staff loud and non controllable air condition room temperature controller out of order it was not 4 hotel it is only a 2 , Near to the Stadthalle
515518,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Well at the breakfast situation was chaotic not enough waiters so too many dirty plates on the tables not enough food on the buffet table no clean plates all the time Only one waitress is not enough Only one elevator , The short distance from Wienerstadthalle is superb 5 minutes to the concert Even the rain was not the problem 
515519,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Quality of the bed is terrible We asked for a queen bed and got two twins Not good if you are a couple Definetly not a 4 stars hotel max 3 , Good breakfast perfect location close to the West Train station and well conected to the public transport 
515520,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, No room service no tea making facilities in room, Very comfortable beds spacious rooms Great location near metro and tram stop Small shopping mall next door Free wifi
515521,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Parking garage is a little confusing , Booked quad room it was great One room with a bedroom and separate living room with sofa bed all made up for the kids hallway tons of closet space Refrigerator in the room ok tech it is a mini bar but you can use the space left 
515522,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The hotel doesn t have a parking the one next to it is a private one which costs 15 euro day not included in the room price The minibar fridge was empty , the staff was very nice and welcoming the room tiny but very clean Close to a lot of interest points in Vienna 10 15 min by car almost everywhere Also the metro station is very close 
515523,Atlantis Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Well located Just 5 minutes walk from the nearest underground station and one minute s walk from the nearest shopping mall Very quiet at night The hotel seems to be quite new and the room is clean comfortable and reasonably large 
515524,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, very close to the subway but it is not the best area to stay if you want to feel the Vienna old town overall room is clean and more business hotel I would say , it s quiet in the room
515525,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, a There was no restaurant inside the hotel So you could not have a lunch or a dinner inside the hotel except the breakfast b The main problem is that the area where the hotel is located is in the 15th district which is the worst one in Vienna Unfortunately we discovered this issue after having booked the hotel The hotel is located close to the West Train Station where at night time is dangerous I would not visit the hotel again only for the reason of the area where it is located c The wi fi was poor at the 3rd floor where we stayed, a The hotel was comfortable but it is more a 3 star hotel than 4 based on what I have seen 
515526,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, For a one night stay there was nothing I didn t like except for the fact the part of the hotel we stayed in we had to walk up the street through road works with our luggage But I know you are in the middle of renovating and so really that is totally forgivable , I m sorry I can t remember the lovely girl s name at the front reception but she was always so friendly and helpful Right down to the last minute we were leaving and waiting for a taxi as I jumped up to leave and was on my way to the taxi she came up with my personal phone I had accidently left on the table Thankyou so much it was appreciated Anne Perth Western Australia 
515527,Atlantis Hotel Vienna,No Negative, It is really convenient location there is shopping centre near by for food and near to station as well Besides the room with air cond gave me a nice sleep during summer time 
515528,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, We were kept down the road in another building The reception was far away as was the dining room The air conditioner didn t work the first night and it took the receptionist 2 hours to vine to our room that too at midnight when we were dog tired The room was really tiny but this is Europe so I guess we can t expect much We had to plead for a kettle which was given very grudgingly An adapter to charge our phones was given very reluctantly too There were no glasses provided in the room to drink water Don t recommend this to any one 4 star they call themselves They re not more than 2 stars , Just the location
515529,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, When we checked in we found out that the air conditioning wasn t working We asked for the staff to fix it and they told us they would get it done in 2 days max The next time they came they toldus they weren t able to fix it They told us that we have a great room and that they didn t know why we were complaining It was rude and uncalled for even when we tried to explain that we simply expected what was written on their summary They then questioned critiqued us with where was this written ,No Positive
515530,Atlantis Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Staff were really helpful Location for concert at Stadhalle was great Stayed with our grandson and they were really helpful with his German speaking Hotel was very comfortable breakfast was very good
515531,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, We were a little concerned when we arrived as the area around the hotel didn t look great but if you turn right out of the hotel front door there is a small park area a few hundred yards along the road, Staff were very helpful at all times The Hotel is very close to the tube station and the tram and is actually within walking distance of the town centre and there is a large indoor shopping centre right next door with food court We didn t use it as we didn t realise it was there until the day we were leaving and we prefer to be outside anyway 
515532,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, No advice about the hotel offres for the tour or the cruse The reception is far from the room location i have to walk on the street crossing construction i ask to get a taxi the receptiensit ask me to get one over the corner just to save the call staff said I ask for iron they said could we send it after half an hour i waited for 1 hour then i called again to get it, Very quite place
515533,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Expensive and crowded parking Look of corridors and elevator Some stairs you have to lift luggage over Neigbourhood is not giving the feeling of security strange faces hang around in groups , Proximity to Stadthalle Design and comfort of room Staff at reception and in breakfast room Breakfast 
515534,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, First impressions Are that the area is a little shabby don t let that put you off as the area is very safe to walk around, This Hotel is ideally suited for concerts and also short walking distance to the museum quarter of the city Next door there is a large shopping centre for local shopping
515535,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Mattress were a little bit too soft but I understand it s a subjective judgment , Breakfast was fantastic excellent choice for both sweet and savory Very good position not too central though not too far from the main turistic destinations We could keep the key of our room and hotel is open 24h so we were completely indipendent Wi Fi is available everywhere and free of charge

515538,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, We stayed in a building that was outside the hotel In the middle of the two buildings they are building the last part of the hotel so to go either for breakfast or reception we had to go outside Also the triple room that we booked was not the room that was given it was much smaller and after explaining the situation the staff gave us another double room , The staff was very friendly and tried to solve the situation 
515539,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, It is not that close to the old town but it is close to the metro , Close to the metro so getting around is easy Also the staff are very friendly and helpful 
515540,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, Location is not that good for tourist to go around the city such as visiting Schonbrunn and churches in city center but public transport can connect not a big deal, Overall is good The breakfast was fantastic so varied and we were really full
515541,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The room was dirty even if I pay10 more because mine was not ready at my early arrival and receptionist proposed me to change it with a superior allready ready I forgot to tell them it was not cleaned well this one too, Night receptionist was a good person
515542,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, The only fault if we were being very very picky is that there are no tea coffee making facilities in the room , The hotel was prefect for our requirements We were heading to a concert in the Stadhalle which is only around the corner from the hotel The hotel was friendly clean and an excellent location 
515543,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, No facilities for evening meals at hotel, Really friendly and helpful staff Excellent buffet breakfast Really close to underground station Excellent shopping centre next door to hotel

515547,Atlantis Hotel Vienna, No free parking Overpriced breakfast Not convinient bus connection on the way back from the city centre pretty long walk in an ugly and dangerous area not pleasent in the evenings Very inconvinient design of the hotel huge labyrinth of endless corridors very inconvenient if you bring a dog with you There was hardly bearable odour from the canalisation in our room we were offered to change the room for the next night only as the hotel was fully booked for our first night there we were offered an air freshener tho Very limited english speaking tv channels offer Only one and very small elevator long waiting time as an alternative to carry your suitcases to and from 4th floor Lack of light blocking curtains Dirty and not safe neighbourhood , Pet friendly Free WiFi Helpful staff
