206921,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was too small my husband found it claustrophobic but I was happy it would suit 1 person better There was a large crack in the basin so I reported this as I did not think it was hygienic and the staff apologized, We only stayed 1 night but thoroughly enjoyed the evening 
206922,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Building works going on both on their restaurant and on the street , Upgrade to a Junior Suite was sensational Room was huuuggee and awesome Bathroom was perfect living area sensational bedroom brilliant no view though 
206923,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, We arrived having booked a family room for ourselves and our teenage daughter and checked in around 6pm only to be told by the receptionist that our room was not available and they would transfer us to one of their sister hotels about half an hour s drive away Apparently the reason for this was that they were undergoing some renovation which meant that family rooms were not available This alternative was not acceptable to us as we had deliberately selected the location close to a restaurant where we were having a family get together We had to stand our ground and be extremely firm before being grudgingly offered a double room and a single room in lieu of the family room we had booked The receptionist was extremely unhelpful , Good shower in the bathroom Receptionist we met in the morning was very pleasant and understanding of our difficulties the previous day 
206924,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, My colleague was very happy with the hotel service facilities etc His only complaint was that for the business he had scheduled the location was not ideal This was not directed at the hotel just an observation Overall he was quite happy with everything ,No Positive
206925,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Our twin rooms werent available even though i had rang the hotel direct to check and they confirmed We ended up sharing small double beds which wasnt to our liking We were offered a free cancellation hardly great when you have already travelled And we got a free breakfast, Breakfast was freshly cooked and had a good choice 
206926,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was a little bit small but it is common among hotels in London particularly for those located at a great place, fab breakfast and friendly staff
206927,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Rooms are very small and the noise from the street throughout the night does prohibit a good nights sleep investment in secondary glazing would be good short of that buy some ear plugs Corridors are noisy too , Location was excellent for Hyde Park and surrounding area
206928,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Size of room and bed view scaffolding or similar , Clean not a huge breakfast but was tasty need a rolling toaster tho friendly staff nice little garden out front proximatey to park reason we were there modern bathroom
206929,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, This is my favourite stay in London probably fourth by now I don t like changes when accommodation suits me and hotel staff is most helpful here I ll come again 
206930,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I m not sure why they couldn t find my booking when I tried to check in and so I waited Room feels kinda small Price was kinda expensive as well , The staffs were friendly and offered me a drink while I tried to find my booking code The resting area outside the hotel was amazing whereby you can just relax with a certain degree of privacy 
206931,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The single deluxe room is too small to even put your suitcase anywhere but I was kindly upgraded , The reception staff really went out of their way to help me Thank you Chan 
206932,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, When my colleague got to the accommodation there was a renovation being done so my colleague was booked in a shabby room somewhere in the basement and when he demanded another room because the room was all filthy he got another filthy room He was not pleased and we will NOT be booking here again , Nothing
206933,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was pretty small but cozy to stay in, Excellent location easy access to plenty of restaurants grocery stores and the station Staff extremely friendly and helpful
206934,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, If you don t mind sleeping in a shoebox and you don t mind not being able to walk around the bed it s fine If you d like to move freely and have somewhere to put your suitcase down it s a disaster , Our room was upgraded for the second night after we complained about the size 
206935,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, We were in room 001 very noisy next door to some kind of back Packers kept us up until 2 am in the morning that was Thursday Friday and Saturday As for the room above us it would wake us up when they flushed the toilet or ran the water The room was also for a disabled person which I never requested When I was shown to my room when checking in I asked don t you have double beds So all in all we were not happy you need to paint the ceiling where you had a water leak not nice looking up at that at night Also no bedside lamps every time you got into bed you need to get out to put the lights off , Breakfast was nice 
206936,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The luxury room we stayed in the cost 176 per night without breakfast was no bigger than 7ft square it was absolutely ridiculous We had continuous buzzing noise all night and the towel rail was hanging off It was a total rip off , Decorating was the only nice part of the room
206937,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Size of the room is really small for family stay Photos posted in Booking com are really deceiving , Very good customer service by reception team Especially by Ms Chen
206938,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The Double Club room was very small one full bed and no room for the luggage , I realky enjoyed the sitting area outside secluded from the sidewalk by greenery 
206939,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Only thing really was when I left I had the reception order me a cab and it ended up being a private car which I think was more expensive than a cabb So, Location was perfect right near tube and train staff were friendly with changing bookings helping me with my air ticket etc room was comfortable and had aircon Would definitely stay again
206940,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Wasn t sure if drinks etc left in the room were complimentary which was a same if it was as we did not use these A sign explaining this would have been helpful Need to change the curtains as well these did not meet in the middle or cover the sides so there was a lot of sunlight first thing , lovely staff and rooms We had a room by the lift but this was not a problem and didn t effect us noise wise Air con was great and location fab Get the tube to Queensway as it much easier Lovely restaurants etc around the corner and a quiet area off the main street 
206941,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, The location is absolutely fantastic you can see the trees of Hyde park down the street when you step out the front door The hotel was cute and very clean rooms small but that s London Staff were extremely friendly and super helpful great experience overall I will definitely come back for my next trip to London 
206942,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, the hotel moved us to other property in other part of the town at 21 pm due to maintenance problem refused to show that the room is not re booked by other never checked if we re ok in the exile hotel Didn t inform us that the problem was fixed and perhaps it s time to return to the hotel that we ordered horrible attitude , good location
206943,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I did not like the fact that the hotel uses an exchange rate comfortably in advance of the standard daily exchange rates as advertised on the XE site on line Clearly the hotel s bank appears to be charging a much higher rate in favour of the hotel Hence when paying by credit card click on British pounds and NOT on your home currency Your own bank can then determine the exchange , The proximity to Bayswater Tube station 2 mins walk 
206944,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The double deluxe room they gave me was the size of shoe box Nothing like advertised in the pictures The true designation would ve been Extra Small Single Room It also reeked of cheap perfume that they used to cover up bad smells sewage smells in the room and also in the hallway It was such a strong smell that not even 5 hours of air conditioning ventilation helped it fade away The mattress on the bed was also very poor quality like it was 10 years old Why would you pay 120 a night for a fake 4 star hotel which in reality is a dated 2 1 2 star hotel When you can stay at hotels like Premier Inn or Holiday Inn which are 3 star but look much better than this one and have far more spacious rooms extremely comfortable beds and great locations all throughout London Don t be stupid use your money wisely I would never come back to this hotel or recommend it to anyone it s a ripoff , The only thing I liked was the front staff desk who were helpful and polite and refunded me for my room 
206945,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room size non soundproofing room, Love everything about this place Helpful friendly crew As a solo traveler room isn t a big problem for me but think twice for couples 
206946,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The first room we were given was such a disappointment It was even smaller than a single room There was no way we could fit into that We could not even open our medium size suitcase We immediately requested an upgrade and the next morning we were transferred into a Club room which was not much bigger but at least we could open our suitcase All rooms are small apparently In future we can not come back to this hotel with our toddler because of the rooms size , The location was perfect near the busy Quensway and Hyde Park The staff was amazing they accommodated our request to change into a bigger room 
206947,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Rooms are very very small and things are cramped That is only negative, Staff was very efficient and friendly Very clean room and facilities Well maintained Great shower Convenient location near 2 tube stops and close to Paddington station Bays water is a nice area with good restaurants convenience shops and shopping mall all within 3 4 minutes walk
206948,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room rather small like in all central London affordable hotels but well equipped comfortable and clean , Every single member of staff we encountered was excellent Welcoming helpful and efficient They were the best 
206949,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Deco in room was poor torn wall paper discoloured plaster paint in corner ceiling by window foisty smell in room and ensuit , Comfortable room air conditioning super shower
206950,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Single rooms in London are invariably problematic But nil desperandum you do your best , The proximity to the tube is excellent Bayswater on the District Circle line is 2 3 mins walk Queensway on the Central line is about 5 6mins walk There s also a bus stop virtually at the door Cleanliness of the room was good Bathroom quite small but in excellent condition Some good restaurants in the near vicinity Paddington station is certainly walking distance probably 20 mins if alone But I would not recommend it if towing your luggage 
206951,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room is respectively small and outside was very noisy in the morning not sure if because of being close to club lounge of the hotel , The location is very convenient to travel around no doubt And within walking distance to Hyde park 
206952,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The safe deposit box in the room had no operating instructions and didn t appear to function properly so we didn t use it at all , Didn t have breakfast at the hotel but our experience otherwise was entirely positive 
206953,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was very small indeed Also the maid did not clean the bath on the second day , The staff were very helpful and friendly The breakfast is excellent 
206954,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was really tiny as they often are in London As it was really hot week we never managed to get the room temperature low enough Breakfast was ok but not worth neraly 12 pounds pre booked price , Location of the hotel is excellent 2 underground stations in walking distance Lot of shops restaurants etc just behind the corner Friendly staff clean room and nice bathroom 
206955,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, The hotel s location was excellent with multiple cafes and restaurants just around the corner During some mornings we took breakfast to go and went to enjoy it in sunny Hyde Park One more pleasent surprise was the free portable hotel phone which was a life saver whilst navigating in the streets of london 
206956,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was a little bit hot and the air condition took for ever to cool down the room, Location is perfect staff super friendly Room small but ok for two nights It has everything you need I really like the idea of the mobile phone There is a mobile phone that you can used to use internet or make calls
206957,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I had a single room and whilst it was big enough the tiles on the bathroon are problematic A place looking for an accident Tiles VERY slippery wet or dry , Proximity to underground 5 mins walk and a bus 1 min walk A couple of very restaurants nearby mot restaurants nearby are quite basic 
206958,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The cleaning of the room could have been better done Nothing unpleasant though , Every member of staff was very professional and pleasant I d visit again and again for that alone 
206959,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The noise on top of us There was also the door banging that was annoying , The breakfast was excellent The staff were very courteous and helpful The bed was very comfortable The room would have been perfect if it is a little bit bigger It was easy access to Bayswater underground station 
206960,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, When arriving we were told my deposit was not allowed to be used as part payments so good job I had my credit card with me because they would not accept my debit card because there was not enough funds in there because they kept what I already had paid and reimbursed me when I got home if I hadn t had my credit card we would not have had enough money to pay the hotel and have nowhere to stay,No Positive
206961,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Small room Bathroom is extremely small A shower instead of a bath would have been better , Frienfly helpful staff Good location close to Hyde Park Bayswater has a lot of restaurants 
206962,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Nothing, It was so nice of you to get us a special honeymoon arrangement in the room Room is also comfy neat and complete The welcoming chocolate is super delicious 
206963,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, Location was amazing directly next to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park Subway station around the corner Hotel room was small but cozy bed was delightful Would come again 
206964,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, If not a club room rooms are a bit small but comfortable and clean , The service was excellent Me and my husband were on our honeymoon plus celebrating my birthday and the staff made sure to make our stay as comfortable as possible The staff were courteous and nice special thanks to Alba Definitely would return Small but cosy rooms Very close to Bayswater and Queensway stations 
206965,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was very small and the pillows were rock hard breakfast included in the price would have been nice , Great location on a nice street it was clean and modern
206966,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room and bed were a bit small for two people but comfortable We still believe it was value for money considering its situated in central London , The staff were excellent accommodating and very professional The hotel is literally a few minutes walk from very convenient bus stops and underground stations Bayswater and Queens Way which give you easy access to London s central hot spots Hyde Park is practically your back yard so go enjoy a stroll there Oh and make sure to take advantage of the discount and special offer coupons located next to the elevators great savings and ideas for things to do there 
206967,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Noisy room Bath plug not working room 202 Poor quality complimentary chocolate , The mobile device was an excellent addition as was the fruit bowl at reception 
206968,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The view outside the window was nasty and it says it s a deluxe room but just an ordinary single room I guess And even with all the lights on it wasn t bright enough in my opinion Apart from those things the staying wasn t really bad , The location was fine and the surroundings were also good The staffs were just kind the room was quite clean especially liked the bathroom though there wasn t a hot tub Well maybe the best thing was that the hotel was very close to the tube Bayswater station Queensway station because honestly I could go anywhere in London with the circle line and the central line 
206969,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Nothing, The staff truly make this place what it is and that is EXCELLENT Truly enjoyed my stay Clean hotel good location but just the best most prompt most respectful most cheerful staff

206971,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room is quite small not really the impression from the pictures We stayed 4 days there and two days have been upgraded yet the size of the upgraded room is just a slightly bit bigger i think Anyway the stay is pleasant , The location very convenient The most bonus point is that we could walk to Hyde Park in minutes everybody loves Hyde Park The staff is polite and nice The area around is quiet Good stay 
206972,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Size of the room we had two large cases and had little room to move Probably just bearable , The wi fi was great the best we have had in hundreds of hotels stays The staff were very friendly and helpful Highly recommend the breakfast Great location for access to everywhere in Central London especially Hyde Park Multiple restaurants of every type within a few minutes walk Pleasant outside seating area perfect for smokers 
206973,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, The staff were amazing so friendly and helpful I loved that I was given a fruit juice at check in after a huge long haul flight and that I was able to check in right away it was early morning The room was small but perfectly adequate for a solo traveller and there were so many extras fruit biscuits truffles a small bottle of wine bottled water This is a feel good hotel they really know how to look after their guests 
206974,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room which we were allocated was quite small It was clean but didn t quite meet our expectations , Extremely friendly staff exceptional service Drinks on arrival were very welcoming The birthday treat upon return to our room was wonderful 
206975,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The concierge did struggle to provide a recommendation on where to eat in the area and a bit more local knowledge could help visitors in making a choice , The location is excellent with the tube less than 50m away The building and street are both beautiful and very well kept and the entire area feels safe at all times Staff were friendly and helpful 
206976,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Unfortunately I can back to my room to find it unlocked The front desk had the lock fixed the next day and left a fruit tray as an apology but it was very unsettling after working away all day to come back to an obviously open door anyone could have seen and entered ,No Positive
206977,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Very rude treatment at check in been put in a single room for a deluxe double room and then having to argue with the same member of staff as at check in to change room , The concierge was most helpful and extremely nice 
206978,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, nothing it was perfect, As I use this hotel a lot when I fly into London I was pleasantly surprised with a personalised welcome card welcoming me back to the hotel on my bed and the staff remembering my name They are attentive and always smiling a big recommendation for me
206979,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, The staff was very friendly and always made sure that everything was ok with our stay The small details such as a birthday treat and bottled water in the room on arrival made all our experience even better Even though the room wasn t very big it had enough space for 2 people to spend the night The bed was comfortable and both the room and bathroom were clean and airy 
206980,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, the receptionist was extremely kind and since the hotel had a flood accident and our room was flooded he put us into another hotel and gave us complimentary breakfast
206981,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, It was really windy when we stayed there so the room being small and close to the window it was a little bit cold on the side of the bed closer to the window But the AC turned on warm temperature was really good to make it cozy , The bed was super comfy Warm room Clean bathroom 
206982,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Don t know if it s something you have influence on but the air in the room felt a bit dry if you closed the windows Not sure if it was AC fault tried turning it off and on during different nights , The room was very cosy and the staff was more than helpful If I m going to be back in London I ll definitely choose this hotel Also the Handy smartphone with unlimited Internet access was a superb addition to the room and made the whole stay much easier

206984,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, There was nothing that I didn t like as such but a larger room would be nice , Location is great Room was quite small but comfortable and met our needs for a few nights in London Breakfast was good too 
206985,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The porch couldn t be open the door can only open a few cm to let air in but this is due to security reasons so it s understandable , The room is as expected not big but enough with a normal double bed closet a bigger then normal hotel flat TV and a big toilet and shower room The hotel s location is SUPERB 150m from Kensington Gardens Hyde Park and about 30m from bayswater underground 100m from queensway underground they both are on different lines so more travel options for you Also the hotel is in a neighberhood which is lively at night the restaurants shops are open after the average closing time in london which can be nice when you come back after a long day looking for something to eat 
206986,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room for two people is a bit too small There isn t really any place to sit I hade to use my computer either on the bed or sitting on the floor , The location is great It s just a few minutes away from the beautiful Hyde park The Bayswater underground station is almost just outside The queensway station is not faraway either We walked through Hyde Park towards the Oxford street one sunny afternoon It was just perfekt Notting Hill is close by also walking distance Very very nice area The street where the hotel is is very quiet with elegant white houses but just turn around the corner and get into the next street you can find all kinds of restaurant and shop The staff is great giving you a very pleasant feeling The room is clean and comfortable

206991,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I booked an offer on your site for an upgraded room for 168 and when we were given our room we were allocated a club room which was very small and feel a bit let down by booking com for offering rooms on there site which seem a good deal and then only getting the basic room will have to make sure in future if using your site to get a proper confirmation of what we booked apart from the let down with the room a great hotel, The staff are fantastic

207001,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The deluxe double room is far from it don t be impressed by the pictures It s okay for one person but not for two people The bed is too small for two people It s more like a good size single bed or a very narrow double The carpet is not so clean needs replacement We first had a room in the ground floor and got some reasons a huge bright orange industrial dehumidifier was in the middle of the room We laughted and wanted it romoved but got offered another room The second room room was so small that the very small bed needed to be against the side wall and window blocking the curtains The shower is on the small side too my boyfriend could barely fit inside We asked for another room No other room available si we were offered to go back in the first room and they removed to deshumidifyer This room was a tiny bit larger the bed wasn t against the wall and had a bedside table so it was an improvement The carpet was wet though In total we had wasted 50min between the moment we checked in to the montent we settled It was almost 1am We didn t have luggage just 1 bag but just so you know Wardobe is okay for a suit and two coats but do not expect to have the space and the practicality to store what s in your suitcase , The staff is very helpful and arranging

207022,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Small room barely had place to move and only one side of bed had space to get up Bed was too close to the window and we could feel the cold from window we were in winter even with the heater on The hairdryer is in a drawer outside the bathroom but it s too big to fit so you have a resistance each time you want to use it And of course it cannot be unplugged outside the drawer Only one person at a time on guest wifi, Location close to 3 key tube lines Clean You can take tea hot chocolate in your room For those who like it TV had many channels including one with known movies 
207023,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, The first room I booked was very small but when I explained that I was 6 2 and quite well built and the bed was just a 3 4 Bed they moved us to another larger room immediately absolutely superb staff management will definitely stay again thank you 
207024,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room on the small side and that was with a free upgrade to a Club Room We were right by the lift so now and then you heard it come and go and outside there were some guys doing some building work It wasn t really loud just noticeable, Room was spotless and the bed clean and comfortable Hotel ideally located for Bayswater and Queensway tube eateries and bars 
207025,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The bed could have been bigger and a better newer matrass , Near metrostation Bayswater and queensway Good an quiet hotel near busy street With all facilities 
207026,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Rude dim receptionist staff That s not to say everyone we encountered was like this most of them were smiley and kind Rooms were small and cold the window seals were non existent Breakfast was NOT included when booking through a 3rd party site even though their website prides itself on a free breakfast with everybooking , Proximity to the city centre 
207027,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, All out of the sweet menu Absolutely nothing But they did offer me complimentary chocolates and biscuits but sometimes only a cake or pudding will do, The location Staff and Breakfast were excellent
207028,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I really don t expect this from a 4 hotel Front road facing room a little noisy with traffics sirens of police car honks people talking from next door Please consider to double glaze your window or work on sound proof , Nice comfort hotel good location to Tube stations restaurants convenience stores banks Money changer etc Excellent service front office staff housekeeping concierge Will come back again when I am in London 
207029,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Scanning of passport on check in I was not asked for permission and it was simply handed over to another staff member who took it into another room This is was unexpected and an invasion of privacy , The bed was comfortable with multiple pillows of different kind so I could use the one that was the right size for me 
207030,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Arrived on a January evening and the window was open must have been open since morning cleaning as it was an ice box Also difficult to sleep in The room has a little green emergency light by the door but because the room is so small this light illuminates the whole room Rang reception and advice given was to just cover it It was on the roof Covering it wasn t possible unless you happen to have some velcro with you , Location was convenient 
207031,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room we had deluxe room it was incredibly small we could not open our suitcases on the floor because there was so little space the bed was very small it was terrible to sleep together in the bed we were two We were disappointed the pictures that we saw of the room was very nice on booking com but we were shocked when we arrived because this should be a 4 star hotel We complained after one night in the room we were in and got a slightly larger room with a slightly larger bed BUT I am 177cm in lenght and my feet were off the bed it was better then the first room but not as good as They say on booking com We were on this trip to relax and have a good time at the hotel but we were disappointed by the rooms we slept not well and it was a bad smell upwards shower I would not recommend to go to this hotel to relax this is a great hotel for one to go where the beds are very little for 2 people And I found on the floor a pill when we arrived but I throw it away it was nasty I will not go on this Hotel again I ve been in London before and been in 2 star hotel near Oxford Streete and there were larger space and much better rooms and beds This Hotel should NOT be 4 star Hotel the only thing they should get a star for is the Staff and the internet I am wery disappointed of the stay there , The staff was WERY NICE 
207032,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was very small wouldn t want to spend longer than a couple of nights Don t bring lots of luggage no space The breakfast which one has to pay extra for was not special enough to spend 10 pp , The location was perfect for visiting museums galleries and going out in the evenings Lots of choice of restaurants in the area Also choice of two underground stations approx 3min walk away 
207033,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was very small which I expected However I had asked for a twin and was told none were available when I arrived A twin would have given a little more space Double bed was a very small double , Location was perfect Close to two tube stations and the park Near Church St High St Ken Staff were lovely Room was clean and nicely done but small 
207034,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, It included breakfast and was significantly cheaper if you booked through through its own site instead of booking com Oh well , Its location was great The wifi was awesome 
207035,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, the room was very small and no draws for clothing so only the possibility to hang them I was there on bussiness and looked for a room with a desk but as it was very small in order to work needed to move the coffee machine tray and there was little space to put it on the floor, Very clean and very friendly staff and very good value for money even though the room was very small
207036,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Nothing, Super puper friendly staff Great location 1 minute walk from Bayswater station Hyde Park just around the corner Tasty breakfast Fresh flowers in the room and in halls Beautiful place High recommended
207037,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I had a very small double room big enough for me alone but I would not have wanted to have two people in it Worth paying a little more for a larger room, The room was very well appointed with everything that you might need including free scarpe telephone and internet service 
207038,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The rooms were way too tight it was actually crazy how small they were I had a double room and we were stepping over one another to get in out of bed and to the bathroom bed was up against the window and in winter there was a draft shower was very small you would not want to be above average size no room for storage or luggage tiny closest that was not even big enough for one person let alone two , Staff were so lovely and helpful Great location just hop on the bus down the road and it brings you straight to oxford street there is no getting lost Hyde park is across the road and they have the underground station near us which was great lovely places to eat and local pubs in the surrounding area 
207039,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room very small for two people with suitcases etc no floor space couldn t open wardrobe doors bathroom doors etc without moving bags etc out of the way first and almost tripping over things as a result But that s just being picky and it is London after all where space at a premium very clean and functional nonetheless less Would definitely stay again, Helpful friendly staff Went out of their way to help Very good service Very clean and comfortable hotel

207045,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Lots of street noise understandable in London but maybe double glazing , Didn t have breakfast so can t comment When the staff found out it was my birthday they decorated our room with banner balloons wine and chocolates special shout out to Diana on reception and Alan in maintenance 
207046,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, perhaps only the view onto the construction site , The interior of the hotel is divinely beautiful and adds up to a rather prestigious experience The staff were very lovely and friendly the single room was perfect and comfortable for a solo traveller and the breakfast was seriously delicious

207051,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The smell of drains in the bathroom The mould in the shower The shoebox size room The double bed which could only be described as a single The green exit light which had to be covered up to get to sleep You could hear next door guests going to the toilet Located next to hostels down a side street giving an unsafe vibe, Nothing
207052,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, Initially checking in we were not happy with the room as deluxe double was a small double bed right against the window which had condensation on the inside I had just had brain surgery to remove a tumour so was vulnerable and this was a Christmas present but one call to reception and it was sorted Being new years eve they had no other rooms that night but the next day we were upgraded and to a club room and on the first night we received a complimentary bottle of wine so excellent time had

207058,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Upgraded to club room not a good room felt like we where in the store cupboard so small Bed hard pillows hard furniture dark and chiped pealing carpet had a ball of hair on it on arrival and crumbs on floor toilet roll should be quilted not cheap thin paper Window might as well be left open as can hear every bit of noise outside room is right opposite the lift like two feet away so got very little sleep with people coming and going all night talking out side of bedroom door , Staff where lovley shower great bathroom clean as an upgrade had fridge which was great
207059,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was very small My partner had to climb over bed to get to bathroom during the night as there wasn t enough room to walk round bed This was suppose to be a double deluxe , Very friendly helpful staff on reception

207065,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was a four star it was very small there was hardly any wardrobe space just as well we were not staying for long no where to sit except on the bed no chair no fridge bar I ve had better rooms at a premier inn , The staff were very friendly we were given free breakfast as it was our 30th wedding anniversary a bottle of wine It was very clean the bed was comfortable

207067,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Smallest room ever Only just room for a small double bed jammed up against the window If we d paid any more I d have complained It definitely wasn t a superior double Worth paying more for a larger room , Cleanliness Helpful and very courteous staff Convenient location close to Underground and local shops cafes etc

207070,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The only minor fault is the rooms are small but this in no way detracts from the quality of the stay, The staff were the most helpful I have come across Room and extras provided were superb
207071,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The hotel took a swipe of card on an old machine so just waiting to see if they charge me again for the room as already paid with booking com not sure this was necessary The rooms have very thins walls and heard everything from the room next door which kept us awake all night, The shower was powerful and nice fluffy towels

207076,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, We actually were moved to the Grande Royale across the road from the Shaftesbury There was construction work in the hotel so 2 of the rooms had to be accessed by stairs from the floor above as they were blocked off from the rest of the hotel One of the rooms was tiny but the staff did move my friend to another room at her request , The location was excellent
207077,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Drinks and biscuits and were not topped up daily Furnishings were dark Lobby was tiled gave it a cheap budget hotel look The rooms were noisy we could hear traffic and street conversations we could hear neighbouring rooms Rooms were small , Microwave in the room Welcome chocolates Free drinks were topped up on daily basis only for 1 of 2 rooms booked Location was excellent
207078,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Been transferred on arrival to a hotel at the end of the street apparently same company room was either too hot or too cold Air con didn t seem to work properly On the day of check out was asked to check out earlier by housekeeping staff rude and incompetent , Location nice breakfast and staff serving it 
207079,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I could hardly move freely in the bedroom and bathroom Not to mention no proper place to put my luggage Wardrobe was a such a disappointment cant even hang my clothes properly , Convenient location to 2 tube stations food and supermarkets were just less than 5mins away
207080,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I left my kindle in the room and realised 20 mins later but they said it was not there when I phoned up I know I left it on the bed Very dishonest of them, Average
207081,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I was asked for late check out they refuse more than 1pm and book for 1 night because my flight late they surprised me they say it s ok to keep the same room no need to trf to other room I asked them before if I can pay for extra nigh and they refuse strange way , I booked without meal because in my previous visits one time I found long blonde hair in my pancake and in another visit I open boild egg and it was expaird 
207082,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, It was SO noisy at night couldn t sleep a wink Plus pillows bed very uncomfortable Also no iron in room had to ask and a very grumpy man brought one up Some very strange unappetising fruit with cling film on was in the room too , Staff in reception on arrival were ok and location is good for the tube
207083,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I actually took a taxi arranged by Shaftesbury staff to Grand Hotel Paddington Everything was fine except room size too small room man Just too small Okay for one night but not beyond, Neat and clean room 
207084,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I was told that the booking system went wrong and was taken to a sister hotel late night when I try to check in but the hotel I was transferred to is pretty good except for the very small room I got in compensation the complimentary breakfast , location was good in a quiet and nice street
207085,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The space of room is so small that even I lived in there by myself I also feel the space is not enough On the other hands the standard of housekeeper need to be improved and keep in a level , Location and service is good 
207086,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Having to agree to a 50 up front against any extras The room was very small and the as a result could only get into bed from one side Bed too close to the window , The staff were very welcoming 
207087,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, Location absolutely perfect Near Queensway tube station and in the surroundings there are a huge number of different restaurants and pubs Amazing staff very kind and available at any time Someone talks about the dimension of the room but I found it perfect surely it is not big but it is clean and has all the necessary for a weekend in London 
207088,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room would be rather claustrophobic for a longer stay , Very friendly excellent value and fabulous breakfast Our room was rather bijou but had everything including tea coffee and biscuits Would definitely stay again very convenient for west end etc
207089,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Very small room and a bit noisy You could hear the lift going up and down our room was next to the lift and the steps from the upper floor , Very good location close to 2 subway stations The staff is friendly and very helpful The breakfast is very good The portable telephone provided in the room allowing free local calls and internet is an excellent facility 
207090,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The location of my room 314 was horrible next to the service stairs and any noise woke me up the walls are soooo thin i could hear my neighbors all the time no mini fridge in the room and tiny room and closet the Halloween decor cheapened the over all feel of the hotel, The bathroom was very nice and comfortable and the bed was also comfortable The bellboy was very polite and helpful and extremely professional i think he deserves a promotion 
207091,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, the noise from the outside was unbearable the window was very old and you could hear everything that is unacceptable for 4 star hotel, bed was comfortable
207092,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was extremely small From the photo we saw on the website is very deceiving There is only one stool with the dressing table and most of the time we have to sit on the bed You can hardly have any space on the dressing table as they put the tea making facilities there One thing that worries us the most was the room we occupied has a bath tub and it is very dangerous when you want to get out for it The rail was at one side and there is no hand rail when we want to get out of it Either of us has to be there to hold our hands to help one out I don t think I will come again , The only good point attracted us was the location 
207093,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was smaller then expected On the other side there was a microwave But this got overheated And in our room was a refridgerator that didn t cool , Quiet location near Supermarket and metro Clean 
207094,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room wasn t very big and the bed was small almost not big enough for two persons Also 1ply toilet paper common , The staff was very friendly and helpful and the location was great with 3 tube lines in 5 minutes walking distance 
207095,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Very small room as to be expected in London Infant cribs available but the rooms are too small to fit them Not family friendly due to very small size of room , Comfortable bed Clean and modern Great location Bus and Tube easily accessible as are many restaurants and shops Hyde Park is a 2 minute walk Fresh fruit biscuits and soft drinks complimentary 
207096,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Bed too short Multiple credit card imprints and deposits needed at check in, Quiet room Better than average bathroom Effective air conditioning Excellent location
207097,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The a c was controled from the reception but we weren t told that I got sick the first night because it was realy cold We thought the a c was broken but they just turned it off , The location It was near two tube stations just a few minutes away from the main sites 
207098,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Although I was upgraded to a Club Room the bed was very small and the room very cramped If we had been travellers with suitcases there would have been no space to put them We only had an overnight bag , Staff were very welcoming and helpful finding us a secure parking place 
207099,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Check in was slow and painful Pillows were awful walls thin so could hear every noise from corridor and adjoining rooms , Bed was comfortable and room was immaculate 
207100,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Had a very noisy room the pipes made a horrible noise at night The guests above our room sounded like they were going to come through the ceiling in the early hours of the morning We changed rooms but it was no better , Location
207101,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, While I didn t really expect it it would have been nice if the hotel had a public hot tub where we could soak some of the sore muscles away from a long day of walking , The hotel is a short walk to two different underground stops and the Kensington Gardens portion of Hyde Park With simple access to the Bayswater Circle line underground stop we had the rest of London within easy reach The staff were quite friendly and went out of their way to make us feel welcome and comfortable The room was very well appointed and the bed was comfortable Compared to American hotels the room was very tiny 151 sq ft 14 sq m but on par with some of the other hotels we ve stayed in London Paris and Amsterdam At the small coffee valet they had a UK plug EU plug and US plug in the wall and they provided a single universal power adapter to use near the bed if desired This was a nice touch 
207102,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Unbelievable 4 stars and ridiculously high price How this hotel can be 4 stars Room is very narrow bed is small no refrigerator narrow bathroom You cannot move your body in shower booth because it s too narrow , Location is near to subway 
207103,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, The staff was VERY accomodating friendly and helpful The hotel was beautifully clean and perfectly priced and situated for what myself and my partner needed Really pleasant stay and definitely would like to come back 
207104,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Noisy small room uncomfortable bed uncomfortable pillows small towels not enough towels , Breakfast but crammed too many tables chairs in to one room couldn t move past 
207105,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, A small room When I leave my luggage in the hotel I told the staff that there was a bag having glasses inside The staff leaves the bag on a chair When I collect my stuffs the bag was not there Poor management I got my bag back from the storage The lucky thing is that my glass was not broken , Location Within 5 minutes walk to two tube stations restaurant and Park 
207106,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Nothing, Good location bayswater tube station 1 min walk The hotel clean and safe The staff is very helpfull and very nice The little terrace front of the hotel is so good for a morning coffe 
207107,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I think it s fair to assume London hotels will have tiny rooms unless you spend a fortune however the decor made the room feel claustrophobic Dark wood panels in a room of that size made it feel a bit like a coffin not that I ve ever been in a coffin but you know , Very good central location There were maintenance issues with this hotel so we were given a taxi to the sister hotel just down the road which I think was identical Complimentary breakfast was offered by way of compensation Hotel was clean and functional 
207108,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Rooms are on the small side however good use of space so we didn t feel too squashed in , Fabulous bed excellent facilities great location lovely staff felt really luxurious

207110,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Rooms on the small side but unless you spend a lot of time in your room which I suspect most people don t when they re in London then I would recommend, Very friendly start with a welcome drink and comfy sofa to sit on instead of having to stand while waiting to check in Help with bags to the room Good attention to detail free wi fi welcome fruit basket and bottled water Very comfortable stay and close to two tube stations
207111,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The desk was too small to actually work with a laptop The room was as small as expected but well organized and so cozy so it was not an issue even with 2 medium suitcases , Excellent location in a quiet street yet only 3 min to Bayswater and Queensway underground and a few minutes to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park Most helpful and friendly staff Top cleanliness and lovely room with very comfortable bed new bathroom with great towels floor heating Grohe appliances and proper shower pressure plus nice toiletries Compl tea and coffee with cookies in room Great breakfast with a la minute dishes very friendly service 
207112,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room we were originally checked in to was cramped very uncomfortable bed and creaky air conditioning unit I queried the check in staff about the room provided and we were changed to the next room size which included a small study room next to the bedroom which we were happy with , Lovely location close to cafes and restaurants tube station and Hyde Park 
207113,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was very small like in the size of that queen size bed when i asked them why they answerd that is the value of what i have paid for the rate , The location was ok

207118,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, Lovely hotel in a great position next to Hyde Park and a short taxi ride from the West End Friendly welcome The triple room 3 proper single beds was very useful as opposed to the double and fold out that a lot of hotels offer for families 
207119,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, Location is excellent so close to Hyde Park tube etc Staff were very friendly and nothing was a problem for them Room was a good size for London and we would certainly return 
207120,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Had 2 different rooms both very small Barely enough room to move around and have luggage lying around For 200 pounds a night I expected more comfort Refrigerators in both rooms did really keep things cold Had to throw away a couple of milk cartons because of that , Staff is extremely nice Clean rooms Wifi and wired internet is good Cant tell about the food as havent used the restaurant Areas is very good very close to 2 tube stations and 3 different bus stops Parallel road has loads of different places to eat 
207121,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was absolutely tiny Fire alarm test went off at 8am On arrival I was asked if anyone had called me to let me know they were moving guests to a sister hotel as some of their rooms were out of use I had received no call or email and I booked the room a month ago Having travelled a long way with lots of bags we didn t want to be taxied somewhere else I had picked that hotel because I wanted to stay in it Suddenly a room was available I don t know if we got a particularly small room or if they are all that size , Good location clean 
207122,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Single Delux room is horrible Just one small bed you can hardly open your door The room is big as grave No air No comfort It is ok for 5 year child Very very disappointed And this for 160 euros Never go there, Location clean rooms
207123,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Although the money for the price of the hotel was cashed by the hotel more than one month before through my credit card I had to show it to them and they copied my credit card at the arrival otherwise they told me I would not have got the room I showed them the statement of the bank on my name that the money had already been cashed but they insisted they wanted my card , Location very convenient I had some meetings in that area Inside the rooms are renewed 
207124,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Only being able to use an elevator to get to the room I ll be honest the room was tiny But that is just London for you We had everything we needed , The location the staff the water pressure Over all I loved the vibe of the hotel The staff were all really lovely too 
207125,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, No free breakfast, Very well located close to 2 main metro lines Lots of restaurants around Bathroom which is s real one with a good size at least on the ground floor Good value for money 
207126,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Bed very hard and although the bathroom was clean there was cap ends missing off bathroom fittings and a very large crack in the sink, Location air con and the staff were lovely Breakfast was very good too 
207127,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was smallest I have been in Bed pushed up against the wall so had to get on and off from the bottom Bathroom also tiny Tiny wardrobe and no draws , Very friendly clean and tidy 
207128,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, double delux was a 3 4 bed one side squashed against the window so NOT adequate for 2 adults Fold up luggage rack provided bedroom too small to actually put it up Not enough space for toiletries in bathroom Misleading pictures for hotel do not show how small most of the rooms are VERY poor value for money , Cleanliness
207129,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Bed can be more comfortable Pillows are very hard We had 2 different rooms both Club rooms and in both cases the refrigerator wasnt really working , Location is nice and easy for public transport Staff is friendly and helpful Wired and wifi internet are good 
207130,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Small cramped room on top floor hot room even whith AC running bathroom tiny no where to place your things as shelf was broken shower was not draining properly so had to stand in ankle deep water when showering Room very hard to get to with bags Not recommend at all Value for money very pore ,No Positive
207131,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Rooms were comfortable but compact , Great location Excellent staff Lots of little nice touches eg fruit in room upon arrival chocolates on bed each evening Excellent breakfast 
207132,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, the rooms are admittedly small but efficient Good for 1 not sure about 2 , Great location excellent Brexit pricing good staff clean and quant room 
207133,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, rooms are really small Hall carpets dirty No response to email complaints Tv broken and not fixed on request Over priced I stayed in the park plaza the following week 100 times better at the same price , location
207134,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room lighting was a little bit to dark , The staff was extremely friendly and helpfull the location was perfect and the rooms although small was very clean and quiet Our room was fitted with a safety deposit box a fridge and tea and coffee making facilities also a microwave and tv 
207135,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The only issue was that the shower and bath did not have a shower curtain so showers would result in a wet and slippery floor However this was soon resolved with the use of the many towels provided , The Shaftesbury was undergoing maintenance work so we were upgraded to the Grand Royal Hotel across the road which was beautiful with its wooden beams and stained glass windows in the foyer and also given free breakfast for the entirety of our stay The room was great It has everything we needed the bed was lovely and comfy and the room had air conditioning and a heated bathroom floor 
207136,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The breakfast range was very limited for a four star hotel and if you arrived for breakfast at 9am this was not replenished accordingly Was disappointed as recently stayed at the Hilton and their breakfast was excellent A guest staying at the hotel appeared at breakfast in his pyjamas the management should have spoken to this guest who made many families feel uncomfortable , Staff were excellent and extremely courteous 
207137,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The double bed mattress was very hard and if one person moved the other would bounce The bedroom was not easy to negotiate for a disabled person as it had steps The 3rd person in the room could not see the tv a small one next to bed would have been great Some kind of curtain to pull across for privacy from the single bed to double The draws in the room were difficult to open No view whatsoever from the window even if it was just some flower pots would have been lovely , Perfect location near to tube station The room was well set out great lighting lovely bathroom and crisp white bedding and towels The breakfast was fantastic and well worth the money The staff were so helpful and you had a lovely cool drink on arrival Great air conditioner in the room 
207138,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room is too small although its a club room you can hardly move inside it , loved the location as it is very near to the park restaurants and coffee shops markets and to the underground station Its good to have an air conditioning in the room as it was hot summer And they have good room service 
207139,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, TV had no signal and poor sound, Room 204 is very small hard to move around in when there are 2 adults Should be a single room But the room was very clean fresh Would go back 
207140,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Bath would t drain following the shower I had , The room was hot but had excellent Air conditioning unit It was a well equipped room with over and above what was needed for a one nite stay Excellent service One issue was the bath plug wouldn t drain it was a little faulty but would not mark the review down over this Would definitely stay here again
207141,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, could not open windows so had to use air conditioning which would not have been our preference that said it was not noisy , Very friendly helpful staff Beds comfortable and everything clean Rooms are very small but well equiped we would stay again 
207142,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Nothing Everything was as expected , Hotel was excellent was a birthday weekend stay and they made it perfect Room was clean tidy and elegant Location adjacent to Bayswater Tube 2 min walk Will definitely stay again staff made it that extra bit special 
207143,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Pillows were a tad too firm , Staff couldn t do enough for you Room was decorated with fresh flowers for birthday celebration Also wine chocolates given 
207144,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The cleanliness are not good and disturbing the residents even when the red signal was on and the rooms are very small in spit of that i enjoyed staying at your hotels, I enjoyed staying in Shaftesbury hotels the staff specially in the reciption and food services were smile safety and location are good decoraton of hotel show a royal heritage decorated
207145,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was small and smelly The bathroom was tooooo small they don t tide the room or clean it well also the bathroom It was a terrible experience I will never go there again, Nothing was good in this hotel T
207146,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was very small With a double and a single bed club room you could hardly move around Breakfast was not included It was pricy 12 pounds person and not very exciting, Really good location
207147,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, N A, The front staff Claudia and Anton fantastic customer service hard working guys Best answer to all of my quations and taking crest care of me 
207148,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I didn t like that when we checked in for two rooms we didn t get two rooms close to each other we have three kids and needed to move to a closer room after two days , We like the staff that was really nice and helpful 
207149,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room is way too small for a four star hotel I had to clear the shaky table so that I could place my suitcase on top No fridge and not enough space for anything , Very clean toilet and excellent shower cubicle Clean soft and comfy bed A quiet and safe neighbourhood with lots of tourists in the streets nearby A couple of supermarkets and Underground station one block away A number of tourist attractions within walking distance e g Royal Albert Hall Natural History Museum Science Museum Victoria and Albert Museum Portobello Market at Nottingham Gate and Harrods at Knightbridge 
207150,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Couldn t get ITV1 and there was interference on ITV 1 a guide to the TV channels would have been helpful Our room cards were temperamental as well, Loved the welcome drinks and fruit and gorgeous hot showers Friendly helpful staff Really appreciated your giving us 2 rooms for the same price as the triple which was out of use
207151,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, We stayed in a standard double room which we knew was going to be small but didn t realise how small The bed although stated as a double was not a standard double as it was much shorter in length as my fianc s legs dangled of the end Another downfall if that our room was in the basement so our view from the window was of the stairs This also meant that at 5am I was woken to what I presume to be a delivery with noise of people and items moving up and down those stairs , When we arrived at the hotel we were sent to their sister hotel as our room was under going maintance work Due to the inconvenience of this we were given free breakfasts for both morning The breakfast was delicious with a wide range of options including cooked and continental breakfasts with lots of sweet pastries to choose from 
207152,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was fine but could do with redecoration , The hotel was in a perfect location we were upgraded and the bed was lovely and comfortable lovely flowers wine and chocolate for my husbands birthday 
207153,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Apparently the hotel had a maintenance issue the night before our arrival which forced them to cancel our reservation We did not get their message until we arrived at the hotel They told us they had made arrangements to stay at their sister hotel and that our room would be ready when we arrived there To their credit they offered to pay the cost of the taxi to the other hotel and also include breakfast the next day However when we got to the other hotel about 40 minutes later our room was not ready And the Shaftesbury had not called them to let them know we were on the way This resulted in another 30 minute wait until we could get into our room This does not sound like a big deal but since we only had one night in London we lost more than an hour of the time we had ,No Positive
207154,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room I booked the Delux double room but didn t feel the delux part and the bed are very small But I guess that s what you paid for in Westminster summer time , The front desk is really helpful The breakfast is good and worth the money in the summer it is 9 95 GBP 
207155,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Tiny room couldn t get out of bed in the night to use the bathroom without crawling over my husband Could get ready in the room with two people as it was so small we kept bumping each other , Lovely welcome Great location 
207156,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Air con unit noisey through the night , This is the 2nd time I have stayed here and once again very enjoyable Set in Bayswater you are only a few steps to the Tube with Queensway just a bit further Lots of bars and restaurant choices Local Tesco express and Sainsburys Hyde park is just on the High Street Very enjoyable stay and staff very helpful We stayed in a Double Delux this gave us a fridge microwave with crockery and cutlery Also the standard tea coffee making facilities Air con also in room I would stay again 
207157,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Nothing much The rooms are a bit small but if you want just a place to sleep then fine , Excellent friendly staff Good location near to Tube stations parks Good cosmopolitan range of nearby restaurants 
207158,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, It was s good location close to tube stations a variety of different styles of restaurants shopsetc The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to help 
207159,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The actual room space is very small and cramped for 2 adults , Couldn t fault the attentiveness of staff All very helpful Breakfasts to a very high standard
207160,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, They did not include in the booking that they were having issues and would have to transfer us to their other hotel across the street But they did pay for the cab there and upgraded our room , Favulous room Upgraded our room due to mechanical issues and gave us free breakfast for the trouble 
207161,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was not very clean especially the carpet and the bathroom The room was a bit too small for two people I had a double room supposed to be for two people , The bed was comfortable even if the room was very small It was quiet in general Also they had plugs next to the bed which is always useful It s location is great as you can easily get buses the tube or even walk to main attractions areas in London The wifi worked perfectly 
207162,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I was bitten really badly whilst staying there i have ended up with huge bites all over my body so i was not happy they investigated said they couldn t find anything 3 days later I m still in great discomfort they kindly offered me 100 refund of my total booking but i still feel they should have refunded my 100 ,No Positive
207163,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room is very neat and has everything you need except space I knew from the other reviews that it would be small but didn t expect it to be so cramped We had 3 pieces of luggage and used every surface space of the room The bed was also smaller than usual not more than 160cm wide The bathroom size is ok We didn t use breakfast price was too high and more fun to eat out , Location Near 2 subway lines which makes it easy to go anywhere in London by tube Many eating options within 5 min walking distance Close to Hyde Park Overall style of the room is cosy and classy Room with window to quiet inner courtyard Tea and biscuits and shower necessities were replenished daily 
207164,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, We didn t actually book this hotel but were transferred here and still unsure of the reason why as we were never told , Good location for Queensway tube station
207165,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, The hotel was very clean and the staff helpful It was useful to be able to check in and leave the luggage in the morning and then return in the evening collect the bags and go straight to the room The fresh flowers around the hotel were also appreciated and the ones on the breakfast table filled my girlfriend s heart with joy Unfortunately the cost of the breakfast did not have the same effect on mine but this was the only slight downside to a very enjoyable experience 
207166,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, 1 I reserved a deluxe single single room so i was expecting a larger room actually 2 The room has only one small window with a terrible view the wall of the opposite building 3 The setting of the room is not quite effecient to allow me enjoy fresh air from the window and i was forced to use the air condition most of the time , 1 The staff was very friendly and open for questions and requests 2 They were kind enough to keep my luggage and recieve parcells for me after checking out 3 The area was very quiet anf well served grocerry stores restaurants coffee shops and two accessible tube stations 
207167,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Very tiny claustrophobic room no place to move no place to put my luggage For the price i paid i expected way more , clean nice hotel close to tube stations and the park
207168,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, the reception although was not very friendly helpful ans the room pretty small for 3 beds, great location furniture was okay good value for money
207169,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, 1 Being on ground floor there were noises heard of doors banging water flushing down pipes can be a bit annoying if you are a light sleeper 2 The TV is outdated with very limited channels 3 The room hotel feels a bit old needs some refurbishment 4 The AC works fine but was a ceiling mounted split unit , 1 The location is very close to shops restaurants and Bayswater tube station 2 Clean room even though feels a bit old nice bathroom with toiletries good shower with a handheld hose 3 Kettle with selection of teas and coffees milk sugar and biscuits are provided 4 The double room on ground floor was adequately spacious
207170,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The decor in our room was very tied the wall paper coming off the wall under the window The bed mattress was lumpy and the pillow was rock hard so didn t sleep very well, Air con was a welcome as it was the hottest day of the year
207171,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, rooms small didnt get the twin room we booked had to take a double instead made complaint but manager never followed up every time passed by reception there was more people looking for room changes, location
207172,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Everything They tried to send us to another hotel we also heard them say this to three other people However because we made a fuss they miraculously found a room It was tiny bashed about the air conditioning didn t work bed was 4ft not double my husband had to climb over me to get out of bed the shower leaked and TV had terrible signal We were moved the next day to a club room which was adequate We paid for a deluxe room it wasn t even the club room was basic The bedrooms need a complete makeover and generally better customer service the staff don t acknowledge you when you walk through the reception We never complain but feel that the hotel s poor standards put a real damper on our weekend away and people may like to know that they could try to move you to a different hotel if possible we think it may be in case of footfall bookings , Location was good 
207173,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, My room was very small as was the bed I don t know about the other room , The room was very quiet and the staff were friendly Location is excellent this all makes it worth paying for As we arrived late and didn t have breakfast I can t comment on anything more 
207174,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The air con in the corridor outside my room was on from about 11pm to 7 30am It was like trying to sleep inside an engine Hardly slept at all as I am a light sleeper , The staff and cleanliness 
207175,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Wooden floor with carpet on top could hear neighbours walking around, Friendly staff excellent location tiny but cosy rooms equipped with everything you ll need for your layover great breakfast
207176,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room wasn t ready as we arrived early no problem as we dropped our bags at reception and came back later to check in My daughter and I were allocated room 407 which was the size of a postage stamp even though we booked a deluxe double I phoned reception who moved us to room 4 which was slightly bigger but the shower was incredibly small My daughter is a size 12 and struggled to get in and out Couldn t swing s cat springs to mind , The location and initial welcome 
207177,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was so small I am a size 10 and I struggled to get dressed I had to ask my partner to lay on the bed so I had room to move It was very hot on the fourth floor and the air con wouldn t go below 19 It was stifling in such a confined space , Location was great for our needs 
207178,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room too small if staying for a week , Greeted with a welcome drink and smiles always appreciated Room was compact but very clean Great shower Only stayed one night as we were down for a Hyde Park gig but good location and would use again 
207179,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was a little small and the bath shower a bit awkward to get in and out of , We went to Hyde park concert location was fab staff great didn t really spend much time in the hotel as busy busy 
207180,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I didn t really like anything about this place other than location for concert Rooms are tiny and claustrophobic Service is awful so many complaints made by other guests while we stayed there and reception staff couldn t have cared less Price is way to high for standard your getting , Location was the only thing somewhat appealing about this hotel 
207181,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The deluxe double bedroom was tiny you couldn t swing a cat in it and the staff couldn t be bothered in making much of a change Also with three people on the desk only one person could deal with any sort of complaint or room change Very unprofessional and ridiculous to charge that money for the size of the room , Location suited as it was close to Hyde park for the concert 
207182,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Check in could have gone a bit smoother Need a better bar area that s more comfy as you are sitting in reception area , Hotel was lovely and clean and very good location for Hyde Park Greeted with drink on arrival 
207183,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was small and it was really hard to move in it especially with the luggages , Very good location quite close to the Hude Park and also the Bayswater tube station Nice and neat facilities within a peaceful street The prices were fine considering the London rates 
207184,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was tiny to open the window you had to lie on the bed and opening the wardrobe meant you obscured the TV Many travellers have said this before so be warned The air conditioner was symbolic it made a noise but did no cooling It being early summer the top floor room overlooking a courtyard had very little airflow which meant getting a night s sleep was a very difficult , Comfortable bed Clean Very central location with easy access to two Tube stations Lots of local shops and restaurants For the price considering it s Central London you would be hard pressed to find cheaper Prompt and courteous service from the staff 
207185,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, The staff were very friendly welcoming and efficient The room was lovely modern bathroom The staff provided fruit wine and chocolates for my partner s 60th birthday They made it a special occasion the hotel was in a good location and easy to find Room was spotless
207186,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Happy with everything after initial issue was resolved , Original room far too small despite supposedly being deluxe double However we were moved to a more suitable room which we were very happy with Close to Hyde Park and public transport Breakfast excellent 
207187,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was at the back of the hotel on ground floor lots of banging doors and staff chatting outside window , The staff were very helpful the room was very clean Nice ensuite with new shower and facilities Even a bowl of fruit in room The corridors and restaurant were also clean and fresh food was good 
207188,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Limited tv channels, Breakfast worth the price comfy bed nice extra touches like free fruit basket tea coffee tray and free drinks in fridge plus microwave in addition to room service Easy walk to three underground stations shops and restaurants 
207189,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The check in experience was really poor and I thought that I wasn t going to get the room I d booked and they d confirmed The servicing of the room also left a bit to be desired on the first day the milk was off on the second day they didn t leave any The locale is also noisy if you have a room at the front of the property The room was smaller than average for the 4 hotels I ve stayed in when I ve visited London , Checking out was very easy 
207190,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was a little small we managed as We only had small cases, Everything you needed to make stay good was in room bathroom great power showerso good roo
207191,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was rather on the small side but pretty comfortable for two Also we did not order breakfast it was quite expensive , Location perfect Very quiet residential area Two tube lines and Hyde Park in a two minute walk Small and large shops restaurants next street a shopping mall and the Portobello market nearby Staff were very kind and receptive Room bathroom clean tidy no issues at all Room service did a great job 
207192,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The breakfast was low of options , The staff was very helpful and well trained The room very clean and quiet It is a great hotel for a short stay The tube is practically across the street and there are lots of shops around
207193,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Nothing It was great , The staff must be congratulated on their service and friendliness the breakfast was the best I had in my month away My visit was most enjoyable Thankyou 
207194,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, It s not a 4 hotel as advertised Check in was a little confusing I d already paid on booking but was asked to sign the receipt and show photo ID which I didn t have I wasn t told I d need it either when booking so I was asked for the card I d used when booking This was then swiped by one of those awful old machines Nothing strange there you think it s commonly requested for extras such as bar mini bar only to discover later there s neither I was asked if we d like to book breakfast so I had to get my card out again to pay for it in a chip and pin machine so I m really not sure why it needed to be swiped Breakfast experience was awful No one there to greet seat us so we just sat A young woman came over with a pad in her hand and asked for our room number then pushed it in front of me saying sign here then disappeared She didn t ask if we d had breakfast there before or ask if we needed anything In fact I don t even recall her saying hello We just found plates cutlery etc for ourselves Tea and coffee is out of a machine as too is juice It s reconstituted and far too watered down it was like orange squash There was a chalkboard offering an Asian breakfast which sounded delicious and another offering crepes porridge etc but nobody came anywhere near us so if we d wanted it we couldn t have had it Absolutely terrible , The bed was comfortable 
207195,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, We were moved from our original choice in Bayswater to Paddington and the location is not one we would have chosen We had spent many weeks deciding on the area we wanted to base ourselves in and could have opted for other hotels but chose Shaftesbury The room was far too small could not open the wardrobe door properly as it was so close to the bed , The staff very very helpful nothing was a problem for them Always smiling and offering assistance 
207196,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room quite small if have big suitcases but it is London , Excellent hotel Staff go far beyond what s required I left my kindle in the room and they have kindly posted it on to my UK address 
207197,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, We were given a free upgrade upon arrival from the deluxe to club room However it was very small and dark which made getting ready for our ball in the evening rather difficult The road in the morning was also very noisy from around 7am considering it was a Sunday , The location was very good close to the station and local shops 
207198,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Ground floor noise from tube trains underground Floors above no problem , For London hard to beat this chain quality of rooms and helpfulness of staff 
207199,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was so small for the money very basic not comfortable at all Whole hotel could do with being completely refurbished really didn t enjoy our stay at all considering for a extra 30 pound a night you can stay in a Hilton hotel which are much better won t be staying here ever again , Nothing 
207200,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The 109 room was a small size for 3 of us but we fitted in the outside air conditioning unit was annoying with noise all night heard water from room above through pipes and it sounded like elephants above when staff cleaning , Staff very approachable breakfast was ok but the room was very small as they obviously don t get many having the breakfast Chocolates fruit and wine in room on arrival was a lovely surprise 
207201,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, That we were first sent to another hotel due to problems then another one in a broom cupboard the next in a room with a blocked sink finally back to original hotel where hairdryer caught fire Breakfast in the cellar was accompanied by a flooded kitchen from the main drain Oh well , The staff tried very hard to compensate for the disasters Free bottles of wine complementary breakfast free parking and part refund So good for them Thank you 
207202,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, Location convenient to two train station and easy to airport although I got to stay at grand royale due to some problem to this hotel I book they have complimentary breakfast and room is clean and comfortable with some compromise on the space overall good for single traveler 
207203,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The heater in my room is broken The room is really cold Room is really small I could not believe it was a four star hotel , The location is convenient The lobby looks nice 
207204,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The price of the breakfast was a bit too expensive , Friendly staff and perfect location Orange juice served on arrival which was a nice welcome And the bed was so comfortable 
207205,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Our first room was extremely small so we asked for another The one we were given was slightly bigger It was on the ground floor and we could hear the trains on the tube The bathroom was tiny and the wardrobe was only really fit for one person an ironing board was provided but not really enough room to use it , Very close to Batswater Tube Station Staff were very friendly when we asked to change rooms upon arrival this was done without question The room and bathroom was very clean we stayed 3 nights and the room was cleaned each day
207206,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I didn t like the layout of the room There wasn t much space to squeeze round the double bed to get to the cupboards There wasn t a lot of space for a couple to sit and have a drink together ,No Positive
207207,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, bed was not comfy at all bedroom very small no room to swing a cat and the noise from the place next door shaftsburyinn at all hours of the night disturbed a very restless nights sleep, nice and clean
207208,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Although the rooms were excellent they were a little small , Staff were really friendly Room was very clean and beautifully decorated Excellent location for trains underground and food 
207209,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The rooms were far too small On the door this is advertised as a 4 hotel which it most certainly is not It s a B B at best No bar no evening catering poor television coverage and poor picture Confused booking arrangements Pokey bathroom and the shower curtain collapsed The staff did their best but not good enough , It was reasonable convenient
207210,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room is a little tiny as most of the hotels in London , Cause the rooms were out of order this hotel arranged us to another branch in the same group nearby with free breakfast The branch was clean and the breakfast was good The hotel is near the Kensington and Hyde park The staff is very nice 
207211,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, We have booked with you before but this will be the last time on arrival st hotel we were told work was being done so we would have to go to a different hotel the Paddington park you couldn t move the bed was a double but you could only get in from one side Pathetic the bathroom was very small and further from where we booked to stay, Nothing but gave us a taxi to the hotel they moved us to and gave us free breakfast crap
207212,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, rooms a little small, very friendly and smiley staff very clean clean and confy bathrooms good variety of breakfast great location great value for money 
207213,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Rooms a little bigger would be nice Narrow stairs to breakfast was not ideal , Breakfast was excellent with great choice Room was a little small with a step in the middle Location was excellent for us 
207214,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The rooms were much smaller than I expected and there was not much space to move around , Staff were friendly helpful and personable while the welcome drink on arrival was a nice touch and much appreciated The hotel is situated in a quiet but pleasant area close to Hyde Park and to Bayswater underground station We were also able to walk to Paddington overground station from the premises 
207215,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Booking com doesn t always show what the room will actually look like I E booked a double room but it was displayed like a club room so when we got there we were slightly disappointed,No Positive
207216,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The rooms are absolutely tiny I booked a double deluxe room which can supposedly fit two people It would barely fit one person it was the smallest room I have ever seen in a hotel There would not be room for a large suitcase This is particularly poor for a four star hotel I would not stay here again due to this , It was very clean the staff were helpful and location is good 
207217,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, On check in staff announced that work was going on and asked to ship me to another hotel managed to find me a room when I refused but still not great arriving after a long day , Good clean room effective shower 
207218,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I didn t like the way the hotel managed the payment of the several bookings we had For instance an deposit of 10 pounds that I hardly could get back Also a collegue of mine stayd 2 nights and payd for three When he asked for his money back they hung up the phone , I did like the location of the hotel It s near the subway and in a good neighbourhood where several dinner opportunities are 
207219,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was like sauna and I visited in May Also were small room with poor layout There was 4 channels that were visible on the telly shower head was broken etc I do not recommend ,No Positive
207220,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The sizes of the rooms were small could do with a bigger space , The breakfast was superb the staff very nice polite and very prompt to assist in any way they can really had a nice time and would love to do it again 
207221,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I am not used to the pillow, Very friendly stuff very helpful Super location A lot of places to eat outside of the hotel Clean The room is very small but we stayed there just for sleeping for that location and price you paid of course you cannot expect a huge room If I go to London next time I will absolutely go back to this hotel 
207222,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The size of rooms are small as well as the size of the double bed We were two and we do not felt comfortable so we upgraded our room form double room to club double room for 20 pounds per night , Good Location Friendly staff and Clean Hotel
207223,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, was supposed to be a deluxe double room was the size of a single with a double bed squashed in im not impressed and the bed was really hard making it impossible to sleep properly, staff attentive and friendly
207224,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was a little tight around the bed accessing wardrobe was a bit tricky as you couldn t open the door fully, Great location easy access to the tube and Hyde Park room had a fantastic number of amenities
207225,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, It was a bit difficult to wash your face because the faucet was kind of too big for the basin so the water splashed everywhere Not a big problem though , Supernice room with high ceiling which gave it a more luxurious feeling I thought that the actually room looked nicer in person than in the picture The room was a nice size sure it was quite small but bigger than I expected Good for 2 people The hotel was also superclose to two different tube stations Bayswater and Queensway We used the Queensway one most because it is on the Central Line which takes you to touristy things such as Marble Arch Oxford Street Piccadilly and so on Perfect 
207226,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Our stay was lovely throughout , Staff were really polite and helpful We thought breakfast would only be a continental but were pleasently suprised with how much was on offer Delicious We were also upgraded on arrival to the club room which was a nice suprise The shower was lovely as well We would definitely stay again 
207227,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room in Paddington was on floor below ground That is the only minus from our trip , We actually were placed in Grand Paddington Court hotel because when we came to Shaftesbury they have moved us becuase there wasn t hot water They were very kind apologized and booked transfer to Paddington In return for moving us in other hotel they have upgraded our service with free breakfast and that is big plus in London for hotel receptionist
207228,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Small dark room too much dark wood making the room seem much smaller and next to lift, Location for us was brilliant very close to restaurants and Hyde Park Very well supplied with toiletries and a comfortable bed 
207229,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, People not smoking by my room For a non smoking hotel always felt smoke in my room That was the only unpleasantly during my stay , I loved the location great area lots of restaurants Tube stations nearby and Hyde Park Perfect 
207230,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The single room was very small The TV didn t work properly despite repeated requests to fix it , The staff were very friendly The location was perfect The room was spotless and well maintained 
207231,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, It was like living in a sailboat not much space very economically designed but good and functional, A European plug in the wall first time ever in England 
207232,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room a little tired in places but generally fantastic If you were to choose to use the TV then you would be left disappointed , Bed was comfy good location and brilliant room service Staff were friendly too 
207233,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was very warm and quite small However it was kept nicely and had everything you would require Also I had read several times to expect small rooms in such a good location so am not let down by this , The staff were very friendly The location is fantastic Extremely easy to get to London city centre Hyde Park is very close Good lively area with a good choice of restaurants shops etc 
207234,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, My room was impossibly small even thought it was supposed to be a double room I am not sure how you would ever get 2 people in that room You couldn t I had a small suitcase and there was barely room to open it I had to wedge it open between the wall andthe bed I also had to walk sideways to get past the desk and the wall and the bed and the wall Good possibly for one night or if you just plan to sleep and then leave each day but not suitable if you want a confortable place to hangout or for longer stay , The hotel was nicely decorated and the staff were excellent 
207235,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Tiny room size Uncomfortable folding strap chair in the room Not every room has refrig, Clean room non smoking hotel Good coffee and hot chocolate in the rooms good wifi Helpful staff
207236,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room and Bed are small But since we spent almost all the time visiting places this wasn t such a big issue , Location is perfect Near the tub and a few minutes walk to Hyde Park The hotel is clean staff is very receptive and the room is cozy although small 
207237,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, A bit dusty here and there in the rooms but the more everyday cleaning was great , We stayed at the Shaftesbury for four nights and we loved our stay Comfy beds lovely decor and a good sized bathroom We were upgraded to a club room for free The location is great with lots of restaurants close to tube stations and there s both a Sainsbury s and a Tesco around the corner Free wifi in the room was a great feature as well It was our fifth and fourth time in London and this was the best hotel we ve stayed at Will stay here again 
207238,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Bed too high for 5 ft Chinese like my daughter and myself Bed too hard You had to shuffle sideways to move around in the toilet There was no place to hang your clothes and towel in the toilet when having a shower I had to put the towel on the bed Piece of glass on shower serves no useful function apart from preventing extra toilet roll from getting wet The floor was soaking anyway when we finished our shower because the piece of glass is situated at the curvature of the bathtub and you cannot stand on the curve The water went everywhere An adult couple would not find the room very comfortable as I was travelling with a child it was just about bearable , Convenient access to public transport network and friendly attentive staff at the breakfast bar 
207239,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, room was small, staff were so helpful I left a pair of jeans behind by mistake and they posted them to me Location perfect for business in london 3 minutes walk from tube Breakfast buffet was very good Room was a bit small but fine for one
207240,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, That despite ringing in the afternoon to discuss my arrival I was not told the room was not available because of refurbishment I was then moved to another hotel the Park Grand Didn t like the noise of heating and not able to regulate it properly , The room at Park Grand where I was moved was small but comfortable Breakfast provided because of inconvenience which was good Noise control was good Newly refurbished bathroom very nice Good location 
207241,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The floor space in the rooms is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo small You can barely move Nowhere to store a case Something was broken in the bathroom The remote control did not work so we could not watch the television The pillows were unbearably hard and uncomfortable , I liked the style of the bedrooms Everything seemed fresh and modern The location is outstanding Great for a short stay 
207242,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, At first we had a small room with the view to the wall outside After asking for another room we got a nice little bit bigger one with street view Nice staff great place
207243,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room is so small and the facilities are a bit old During my stay the lighting and electric plug also have problem , The location is perfect just 2 mins walk from tube station 
207244,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, had to change room due to damp on wall 2nd room club room Had not been checked properly as window been jammed open with pillowcase causing room to be cold Then we had water dripping from above but to be fair were move again to another room which was OK , staff very pleasant and helpful
207245,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room could be a bit bigger , Staff was very friendly welcoming and the location of the hotel was really good 5minutes away from the station We got an upgraded room as well which was a nice surprise Really nice room with welcoming staff who are willing to go an extra miles 
207246,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, All good unless you are on a diet , Free fruit box of chocolates half bottle of wine and soft drinks with club room the hotel also gives chocolates every day on the pillows Nice room very clean good shower 
207247,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, bed could have been perhaps slightly bigger, Fruits and chocolates for guests free wifi of course clean and friendly extremely close to the station Thats all would definitely go back 
207248,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room although we were told was an upgrade to Club Class was very small The noise from the air conditioning units outside the window was very loud even with the windows closed in addition the noise from the toilet above the room off of the stairway was very disturbing particularly at 03 00 am waking us up The room was very stuffy and because of the noise from outside the windows could not remain open and the air conditioning within the room was far to noisy to have switched on On reporting the problem we were told that we were in the biggest room they had and that we could be moved into a smaller one needless to say we stayed where we were and put up with inconvenience Although the location suited our requirements for this trip we would not repeat the experience, The service from the staff was excellent and the location could not have been better 1 block from the subway station and Hyde Park 
207249,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, We got given a free upgrade but it certainly didn t feel like it would have been much better than any of the other rooms Our view was of a concrete wall with the air conditioning condensers right outside made it very difficult to sleep The pillows were either extremely flat or way too big The remote didn t turn the T V on but worked for changing channel etc If they never said it was a free upgrade I probably wouldn t have had a problem with these things , Room was clean and tidy It was one block away from subway station which made it handy to get around and the staff was nice and friendly 
207250,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The rooms in the hotel are very small compared to other 4 stars hotel , The females receptioest were very helpful especially whose called Enrika I would recommend it for short stay in London 
207251,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Staff told you to sit down instead of queueing when we arrived to check in however failed to call you after others stood in the queue and ended up being served before us even though we had already been waiting longer Breakfast charge is too much for what it is, Location
207252,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, room bathroom exceptionally small practically no room for two people to move around or to dress at the same time hand towel rack towel hooks placed too high for practical use for someone 5 foot tall, bed was good personnel were always friendly accommodating as possible but we would most likely not book again here
207253,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room could have been bigger room for a comfortable chair would be good , The bed was very comfortable and the room was very well presented but very small The breakfast was very good 
207254,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Nothing, This hotel is in an excellent location Bayswater station is around 100m away The club room we had was a little small but was perfect for our stay the bed was very comfy and the bathroom was lovely We would definitely stay here again 
207255,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was incredibly tiny to the point where you couldn t open the door of the minibar because the bed was in the way The AC made a terrible noise on the last night and we had to turn it off to be able to sleep but then the room got really hot Staff was nice and helpful but there was one night when we wanted to order some food and a bottle of water and they ordered a pizza for us and told us we could have water from the reception If we had ordered the water it would have cost 2 instead we got water from the reception and paid 4 The photos on Booking com show a basket of fruit for the kind of room we booked and there was no such thing , The staff was nice and the hotel s location was pretty great 
207256,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, no food when i called room service I asked for a smoking room but wasnt informed they have all no smoking still waiting for a refund of full money paid, location
207257,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was small but I think this normal in England, They made check in early even before 8am which was great thing for me in addition clean room and the breakfast was not bad
207258,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was way too small for 2 people to be in , Bed comfy room clean good quality shower products Staff were very polite and helpful especially when we had a problem with smell 
207259,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, So clean Great location Love the little tray with tea coffee hot chocolate sachets and biscuits Lovely staff Possible to hold luggage before check in and after check out 
207260,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, There was a stuffy smell which they could do away with by using nice air freshners, Location is great Was upgraded to a bigger room which wasnt too big but was good so not sure about regular room sizes 
207261,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Our room 102 was above the foyer and you could hear the music playing in the foyer through the night which made it difficult to sleep to be fair They did turn it off when I spoke to them at 1am , Room was well equipped and although fairly small was fine for our needs staff very helpful and friendly 
207262,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room a little noisy, Room v small but v comfortable Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful Every interaction they just did that little extra They could teach my staff a thing or two 
207263,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, More information in rooms in terms of offered facilities , Excellent cascade shower everything quiet cosy and comfortable Staff couldn t have been more helpful even offering an umbrella as it was chucking it down 
207264,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I couldn t fault it in any way , Really down to the helpfulness of Lina the manager and her staff I booked at the last minute on Valentine s Day and I could see that the hotel was busy but despite this I got excellent service and upgraded to a room with a bath tub without any fuss as my arm was in a plaster cast at the time Also new mattresses and carpets in rooms and 2 minute walk to the tube station 
207265,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, No bathroom vanity just the sink nowhere to place your stuff but this is just a trifle Could hear the neighbours sometimes, Nice looking room though pretty small but comfortable Clean soft bed kettle microwave wine glasses fridge for those who need them Close to the tube 
207266,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room could have been bigger very small for a double it was okay for me as a single occupier but bathroom and bedroom very small and a view of a dirty brick wall outside my window , Closeness to Bayswater a Tube station 
207267,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, A little bit of traffic noise as window quite old Room was a little small but very comfy, We were pleasantly surprised by fruit chocs wine and soft drinks in our room and there was also a microwave 
207268,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was so small but did it s purpose USB port in our room was not working , The room was clean and tidy staff are all very helpful Very close to underground station 
207269,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, Front desk staff and bellhop were extremely helpful Good location for shopping on Oxford St and only 30 mins to Heathrow My daughter claims this hotel has the best shower she has ever had in any hotel she has ever stayed Thailand USA and UK 
207270,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The window was not very sound proof and it was a little noisy outside in the evening otherwise everthing was all right , The hotel has a lovely London style atmosphere The room was exactly like on the pictures if not a little more spacious very comfortable clean and had excellent wifi The staff is extremely friendly and helpful they packed me some breakfast since I left the hotel early The location is perfect next to Hyde Park and a few minutes walk from the metro station Bayswater 
207271,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Where to begin The rooms are tiny I stayed in a single room and it was by far the smallest hotel room I have ever experienced The single bed was not full size and I could not lie down entirely The Wardrobe that reduced the size of the bed would not open fully as there was a wall in the way and did not have capacity to hang a suit and shirt The staff were incompetent My business trip plans changed a number of weeks in advance of the stay As such I would be staying for 1 rather than 2 nights When I informed the hotel of my change in plans weeks in advance of my stay they advised that the extra night could not be refunded as I had selected an advance purchase rate This is a fair position however when I suggested that perhaps there was something else they could do for me upgrade room for 1 night etc as I would be paying for 2 nights but only staying for 1 I was simply told no Very poor customer service and they simply sought to take advantage of the change in my plans without thought for the customers position Upon arrival I sought to pay with the business card that I had used to book the hotel The staff were unable to facilitate this and I had to use my personal card to pay for the 2 nights of which I only used 1 on my personal card Again the staff were extremely unhelpful Upon proceedings to check out after 1 night the reception staff could not understand that I was not staying the second night despite the fact that I had advised the hotel weeks in advance and at check in that I would only be staying 1 night The staff at check out were unable to provide an invoice for my stay and were again entirely unhelpful to the situation The hotel needs to invest in staff training as a matter of urgency in addition to review of the room size and layout My one night was simply an awful experience and I will not be returning , Location is good and close to 2 Tube stations 
207272,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, False advertising on hotel part The hotel and room I was assigned to was totally different from what was advertised The hotel staff only informed me that my room will not be at Shaftesbury but at another hotel a few blocks down after I have made my payment for the 3 nights I could not back out at that point in time Very sly and totally not professional Booking com shouldnt allow such establishments to advertise there As a consumer I felt totally cheated And the room was very narrow that I could not even open my luggage properly Otherwise room was clean A very bad first booking with booking com Certainly not worth the money I paid for , Nothing really 
207273,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Standard rooms are VERY small there is no space to hang a long coat and even a medium size suitcase will just fit between the end of the bed and the wall , Excellent location just off Hyde Park with two tube stations within one minute walk Complimentary fruit in the lobby is healthy and a nice touch 
207274,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room 123 was kinda small even the bed was small No place to leave a heavy luggage we were forced to leave the luggage infront of the bathroom door and each time we had to push it away just to get in the smell at the hall the view from the window , Friendly staff fantastic location 1 min away from bayswater tube station Clean room with very good bathroom facilities The breakfast was delicious but there was not much variety of goods Strong wifi signal 
207275,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, I recommend those travelers who want a good basic hotel in a good location I have staid here multiple times on my trips to London and for its price range it really holds up well The staff are friendly the rooms are comfortable and its easy to get to There are also a lot of restaurants etc if you want them
207276,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The TV was poor no Radio 2 available and very limited channels Would prefer more coffee sachets , Small cosy room with opening windows The character of the building made us feel real Londoners not in a glass and claustrophobic impersonal hotel The location was amazingly convenient whether you needed the Underground bus or a good healthy walk in the parks Surrounded by a good choice of eateries and pubs The free shampoos lotions hairdryer and even a toothbrush and toothpaste made life very comfortable 
207277,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, Very small room but just what we needed as a young couple we did not have much money to spend and I am extremely glad we chose this hotel The staff was very welcoming also 
207278,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, There was nothing not like other then I couldn t stay longer , In my opinion this hotel was perfect for our little get away together The location was amazing with Hyde park a five minute walk away and everything within an hours walking distance Lots of small lovely restaurants to pop out for lunch And the room service ham and cheese paninis are amazing 
207279,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, the single room size was very very very small and suffocating despite the clean new furniture the room doesnt worth its cost, The location is wonderful being less than 5 minutes away from two tube stations in addition to bus stops the area is very well serviced so you dont have to cross miles to get to a resturant a supermarket a spa or pharmacy etc the staff very friendly and informative the hotel cleaness furniture is great and new and room temprature was very good and controled the toilet is very clean and good the service was wonderful would stay there again for sure 
207280,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, We had a 3 person room which was nice and large But the third bed was not a real bed It would have been fine if it was for a kid but we were three adults and we paid full price for three people , Everything is clean and nice Reception very friendly and helpfull Location brilliant Wine softdrinks fruit and chocolate in the room for free Breakfast really good 
207281,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, None, Appreciate to have a club room to fit in the baby cot microwave to heat the baby s food milk The room was clean Location was good near to tune stations easy to get halal foods shops such as tecso sainsbury boots near by bus stops within walking distance 
207282,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, We were swapped to their partner hotel which was much further from the tube station But got complimentary breakfast , The staff were the best part very friendly and inviting 
207283,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The only thing that comes to mind is the bolted window and a steaming hot room A C is awesome Though the draft coming through the window frame proved to be enough to cool down the room to normal temperature in an hour and provided a source of fresh air for the rest of the time , Location Nuff said 
207284,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Rooms too small superior single avoid rooms located close to the noisy elevator it even rings during the night Windows open 10 inches, Great location 100 yards from Hyde Park 50 yards from Bayswater Tube station and Queensway 10 min walk from Notting Hill Gate Staff EXTREMELY nice helpful and efficient Very good value for the price
207285,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was a bit too small for two adults and a toddler , The little touches like a packet of biscuits every day made me smile Location was excellent and our room had a nice view Bed was comfy but the room WAS on the small side but this is London after all The staff were friendly and helpful 
207286,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Not a lot of extra space in the room but wouldn t expect a big room in central London , Staff very friendly and helpful Lovely clean bathroom with power shower Lots of tea coffee hot chocolate and biscuits Microwave and fridge in room very useful Stones throw from tube and 5 min walk from Kensington 
207287,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, The hotel was in a great location Nice and quiet at night but just round corner from bars and shops Very clean and the bed comfy Room was small but very nicely decorated Would have struggled in there with a big case Would def go again 
207288,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Wasn t aware no evening restaurant on site normally stay at another hotel in the same family of hotels , Good location very comfortable room was upgraded to club
207289,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, No more gym here they should remove the picture from site That s the only disappointment , Excellent location bayswater train station and Queensway train station is just in front of hotel Victoria line and central line Can t ask for more Staffs are very helpful especially Erika and Anu Surrounding have many great food and 3 mini supermarket and an Oriental minimart Is near Notting hill portobello market a must go on Saturday any craving for Chinese food Four Seasons just 2 mins walk opposite bayswater station 
207290,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room that we ve stayed in was quite small In fact so small that it required some coordination from us to get around it However it is very cosy and nice , The staff is excellent friendly and helpful 
207291,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Rooms and hotel in general is very dated wouldn t have paid more than what I did for it , I paid 88 00 for the night which in London is cheap Tea and coffee facilities in the room and a fridge which was handy If you re staying more than one night then probably not for you as the rooms are small We stayed for one night as we were seeing a show and having the Saturday and Sunday day time sight seeing so the room was fit for purpose in that respect just somewhere to lay your head 
207292,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, very small room they didn t change the billow s cover but I would recommend it , perfect location new furniture and toilet i like the lights in toilet
207293,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I stayed in this hotel for a weekend away with my partner and some friends it was brilliant that they hold your bags for you before you can check in and when you check out This is a lovely hotel however we was given a single room the beds are nothing like the pictures we got given a single bed for two and they refused to do anything about it I had an awful nights sleep my two friends were transferred to the shaftesbury premier because of electrical faults in there room and that was much better than this one ,No Positive

207296,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, Hotel is very conveniently situated close to two tube stations and several useful bus routes Staff are delightful polite friendly helpful Although rooms are not large they are adequate for most people well equipped very clean There is a pleasant bar area in the foyer plus another comfortable seating area with complimentary newspapers fresh fruit also near to Reception A Club lounge is available to guests staying in Club rooms This has a TV a range of hot cold drinks fruit and biscuits We have stayed here twice are happy to recommend it to others 
207297,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Hairdryer in room 407 needs to be changed There should be TV channels from different countries The view from the window is depressing We could hear the sound of the washing machine every morning from 9 o clock Booking com please update the breakfast section as it actually costs 15 12 if one pre pays the day before , The hotel is located within 2 minutes walk to Bayswater Station and 3 minutes walk to Queensway Station Helpful staff The deluxe room is very cosy and comfy but extremely small 9 square metre for a couple 
207298,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was slightly too small but as we spent only the night time there it sufficed , The convenient location and the cost of the room was fantastic The staff were pleasant and helpful

207300,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The beds were so uncomfortable and the bathroom sink was almost impossible to wash your face in The shower always leaked out and into the floor Lighting in room is very dim Also breakfast was pricy and usually hotels give you complimentary breakfast , Location is excellent two major tube stations very close and convienent 
207301,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room gets a bit stuffy after a while ant the airconditioning unit was blowing cold air even when switched off Had difficulty in switching on the airconditioning , Clean room
207302,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, I stayed with my sister last week and we had two single rooms which were also used as doubles I would not have like to have shared it as a double as it was very small We enjoyed our stay and would use again The staff were very friendly and helpfull 
207303,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Don t expect all the amenities of a club room from lounge hours or wine bowl of fruit per their website We were in a club room and did not get wine fruit we did not care about this but we were disappointed that the Club lounge was not consistent supposed to be 6 8pm nightly not always open during stated hours Did not complain as we were always about to go out it became a running joke for us to see if it was open but it would be an issue if you expect it , Front desk staff attentive with Andrea especially noteworthy for remembering our party We appreciated Alex for his helpful service with our bags and always asking if we wanted anything to drink when we were in the lobby Great cleaning staff room always serviced well and ready for us when we returned 
207304,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room really very tiny though well appointed cannot really store a small suitcase unless upright , Location and good staff attitude Hotel s hospitality is good Good value too 
207305,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The double bed is just not a probably double bed size Room is very very small so you are up for a comfortable stay and sleep I d put a question mark , Great location and very convenient tube station is 2 minutes walk Hyde park is just cross the road lots of shops and restaurant 20 minutes walk you could be at Oxford Circle 
207306,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The single room was too small Moving around in the room with 2 big luggages was so difficult Furthermore it was written in the website that the size of the room was 10m it was smaller than that , The location was great it was very close to a bus and tube stations A reasonable value of money and not a long walking distance to Hyde Park and Oxford street The staff was very helpful and friendly

207309,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I was disappointed because I thought it would be close to Hyde Park as I was attending Winter Wonderland this wasn t the case It s closer to Kensington Gardens When I arrived I wasn t asked if I wanted breakfast as an extra , The hotel was clean and good value for money The staff were very friendly and helpful 
207310,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Very small room unable to move around the bed first given the room in the basement without a view but changed it on demand Small dinning room poor breakfast selection, Location location location

207315,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Bit out of the way to walk to places , Liked the decor and feel of the hotel Staff were friendly and welcoming Stayed for a bday celebration and was greeted with room upgrade flowers and balloons Lovely thoughtful touch 
207316,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The beds are good apart from I am 6 3 and my feet hang out of the bed And the light dimmers do not work so it s on or off no inbetween , Very comftable stay lovely place and well located 
207317,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The superior bed was actually 2 single beds so the gap in the middle was really annoying We could also hear something in the evenings an early mornings above us which sounded a lot like a really loud Washing machine The staff were very good an gave us another small room just so we could sleep there if we wanted to so although this did solve the issue it was a pain having our stuff in one room an sleeping in another We didn t want to move our stuff in that room as it was simply too small , The biscuits And also the facilities and shower etc was really good Staff really friendly 
207318,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room had no light and window was backed to a 2x4 back yard A member of staff was smoking out there and the fumes travelled into my room For someone with a lung disease was not to good , Room was lovely although a little small Service was excellent
207319,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, 1 the dirty bath with traces from a previous use 2 Illegal car with no permission to stop at the railway entrance in the midnight was called instead of a taxi i asked for 3 the receipt has been neither printed in time during chek out nor sent on e mail later although promised , good breakfast interior location
207320,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Very small beds and cramped room, This isn t a 4 star hotel with the facilities I would expect from one It s rated as an AA 4star guest accomodation so the rating is misleading 
207321,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Small room not uncommon in London Fairly small bed for two people Limited storage space, Great Location esp for Hyde Park Friendly helpful Staff Clean and well looked after Rooms Quiet no street noise Everything in good working order
207322,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, View from window looking into flats , Nice welcome on 2nd night staff member Roney was very helpful friendly really made sure we were looked after 
207323,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Bed sheets were quite stiff starched , Modern clean lobby Friendly efficient staff Good size room for a single Modern shower with great water pressure Easy walk to Queensway or Bayswater tube and Paddington mainline not too far either 
207324,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, just that the WiFi kept login out when your device is idle But the speed was great Not bad at all you just have to re login everytime , The staff were just amazing great hospitality I was blown away by their niceness especially Enrika and andrea 
207325,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Rooms are quite small but not an issue for me as I was travelling alone May be an issue for couple however , Location ideal for travellers arriving from Heathrow or Gatwick as transport links are so close by 
207326,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room has everything it promised except floor space that was non existent The room was compact but had everything and staff were helpful We could hear the trains go under our room from the tube which ment we had very broken sleep We had no bath but did have an excellent powerful shower , Location was fabulous it was one min walk to Bayswater tube and about 4 min walk to Queensway tube Also very handy for buses into town 
207327,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The receptionist in the sister hotel was very emberast but very nice to us and gave us a complimentary taxi to Oxford street who sadly got lost As my partner was very distressed by the whole expireance , Nothing to like we was not give the chance to see the room as we were informed by a very unfriendly receptionist they had double booked our room and we was put in thier sister hotel on the otherside of the road this was NOT a 4 star hotel The room we changed as soon as we saw it as It was not fit to stay in the second room we had was not a lot better the room was about 11foot square with steep steps into the room As this was supposed to have been a special occasion for us and we were also assured this room was an upgrade the whole event was laughable sadly and we felt very let down by Shaftesbury Hyde Park Hotel 
207328,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, First of all the rooms were too small There is no sofa or chair to sit If you open your suitcase on the floor you literaly no place to walk around so you have to jump over it The bed is too small for two people that was really uncomfortable with the worst thing in London was this hotel There is no place to hang your towel in the bathroom and that s just one example to emphasize the size Breakfast room is in the basement so there is no windows , I would say only the stuff is great they are helpful nice location if you re interested in Hyde Park but if you wanna go the other side of the town you have to walk quite a long way or taka tube from bayswater If first time in London you should stay Knightsbridge site where museums closer 
207329,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Breakfast seemed very expensive and there is no facility to have an evening meal a very small bar in hotel lobby but felt a bit awkward , The location was perfect and good value for money Staff were very helpful 
207330,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, The hotel was fab and more than I expected the location is great 2 mins walk from Bayswater tube station and Kensington Park and 30 mins walk to Marble Arch
207331,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, We booked 2 Double Deluxe Rooms my partner and I arrived on Friday to find out room was very small bed very small wardrobe you couldn t open without the door hitting the TV My parents arrived on the Saturday to find they had a Club Room this room was a lot bigger very well presented had a lot of freebies I immediately went to reception and asked why this was they had been given a complementary room upgrade as they had no deluxe rooms left On our departure Sunday my parents were then billed for the room upgrade they had to fight there corner a little and explained that they were given a complementary upgrade as I found out and they did knock this off in the end , lovely stay brilliant location staff were very pleasant very clean rooms Free Wi Fi My hairdryer broke they came and replaced no problem 
207332,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Small rooms on Ground Floor Much noise from the floor above A bit cold until we found out that we could run the heat our self Cold bathroom , Excellent staff Hurray for the breakfast Very nice hotel with tradition 
207333,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The single room I got was a bit too small and the staircase to the room was bit difficult with my suitcase , The staff at receiption are very friendly and helpful 
207334,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, size of the room was tiny i expected a small room due to the location but there weren t even a full size double bed which was not indicated when i booked otherwise i would not have book my partner is over 6ft tall so this was less than ideal , very close to Bayswater underground easy to get around London and see all the sights 
207335,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was very small and difficult to move around in The bed was up against the wall and there was no dresser I was thankful I was by myself The walls were thin and you could hear your neighbors talking and when they took a shower and flush the toilet It was difficult to control the temperature in the room The staff was not knowledgeable when I asked basic questions where to exchange money print boarding pass and questions about sites , The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable Showers were great Close to 2 tube stops Close to Hyde Park easy walk
207336,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was possibly the worst room we have ever stayed in There were 5 steep steps inside the door to get to the bed I dread to think what would happen if the room No 203 had to be evacuated in an emergency , The location was excellent The breakfast was good 
207337,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Unknowledgeable staff rooms very small absolutely different to the picture no space in the bathroom at all what type of the bar it is breakfast not included in rate too expensive for that type of room and service tried to charge me twice preauthorised all and still charged me 2 nd time hassle to return the money hotel has duty manager only no general manager who to contact housekeeping entered the room without knocking no apology just run away did not feel safe as doors were opened and nobody was there reception said probably it was housekeeping how can i know that and room smelled bad from previous guest cleaning very poor other guest hairs on my bathroom rubber mat horrible dirty furniture needs upgrade missing shelves in lockers tv scratched wifi had to log on all the time did not stay connected Overally i would not suggest anybody to stay there and i would never return there kind regards, Only location 
207338,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, As a single person travelling the room was far to small and stuffy you could not get out of bed on one side to open the window Yet the bath room was very good , The hotel was very clean staff very pleasant The breakfast was vey good 
207339,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, While the room was spotless and beautifully equipped it s size was disappointing for the price 137 adequate for two people for a single night stay but would become annoyingly cramped for longer stays , Excellent location within 100 metres of Bayswater tube station the room was beautifully equipped including refrigerator aircon flat screen tv coffee making facilities iron ironing board The staff were very friendly and helpful and managed to reserve us a room with a bath as requested 
207340,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The bed not long enough for a person who measures 184 cm and felt uncomfortable as did the pillows The room had a musty smell, the staff were helpful and always there
207341,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The kettle in the room when boiled half full decided to spit water everywhere so we removed the plug from the wall to find that it was falling apart very dangerous , Good location 
207342,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was tiny but that comes with the price and location The room was just a little bit bigger than the double bed But the bathroom as nice and the bed was comfortable , Price was not bad 
207343,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, My room was very dirty with several times long hairs in my shower which did not belong to me and I even found a dirty sock under my bed which was also not mine disgusting I complained to the reception but I received no feedback except a sorry for that , I appreciated the equipment in the hotel
207344,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I stayed here twice in 1 room the wifi was v good in another it was a bit patchy , Room was cozy and bathroom very good modern and clean Overall very happy 
207345,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was small, The hotel is pretty good located and it is not expensive in comparison with other hotels in the area The room is clean and the WIFI connection works perfectly 
207346,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was too small Shower was awkwardly situated with the shower head too low Staff at the front desk was friendly but quite consumed with talking to each other and not paying enough attention to the people standing at the front desk One staff member hung up the front desk phone and immediately started laughing and making jokes about the caller with the others at the front desk while I was standing there That was very unprofessional , Great location beautiful lobby elegant surroundings Excellent breakfast and the staff members in the restaurant were very friendly and attentive 
207347,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, We booked a de luxe double room we got a 4 foot bed right against the wall on its left hand side with floor access only on its right side This description does not imply a double room let alone a de luxe one Everything else is so good and well appointed such a shame that it is spoilt be the smallness of the room , Location staff cleanliness all first classs
207348,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was very small and that was with upgrade Only complaint , Clean Nice location Only small and very quiet Breakfast was very nice if a little steep 
207349,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Our room was so SMALL We got the double bed room and there was no space to walk around the bed or to put our luggages anywhere The shower was so tiny as well no bathtub , The hotel is in a great location near the Bayswater and Queensway Tube station It is also a few blocks from the bus stop and the Hop on Hop off bus On Queensway there are lots of restaurants and pubs but note everything closes early by 11pm or midnight The hotel room was modern and very clean 
207350,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was very small cold and on the ground floor A lot of noise from people talking and shouting at night time from outside , Staff were excellent Superb breakfast 
207351,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Rooms are too small that s tue for all most all UK hotels But what annoys me is similar category rooms are not of same size In my different stay I got different size of room paying the same , Location Just a minute from underground lots of restaurants very close to all attractions 
207352,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room is small but I guess all hotels in London within the price are same But it s a clean room shower is good and modern , Location is close to 2 tubes station make it easier to go around London there s a nice coffee shop nearby with excellent food and coffee Supermarket restaurant pharmacy are also very close Hyde park and Kensington park are within walking distance
207353,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Had no bad experience but the only short coming I found with the room we had was that it was quite cramped especially if both of us are traveling with 2 or more luggage pieces , I found the Shaftesbury Hyde Park ideal location for sightseeing shopping and close to good eating establishments The hotel is in a peaceful and relaxing location especially in the evening 
207354,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The first thing I didn t like was that there wasn t one room available upon check in at 11am on a Saturday morning but it was Carnival weekend so I understand they were busy The main thing that I didn t like was that after I did check in that they try to stick you in the worst room first When you ask to change they stick you in another room I went from the back alley room off the lobby to the 3rd floor room next to the elevator It was just annoying that they do that especially as a solo female traveler I read other reviews where they did the same thing to others I think it s really bad hospitality They told me I could look at a third room but by that time I was just annoyed and thankfully the room next to the elevator was quiet You couldn t hear it and there wasn t a lot of people or loud people constantly using it so it was easy to sleep through the night , The location is excellent As a solo traveler being able to walk to sites or take the Tube from either stop was amazing The London sights are so much more spread out than I thought so even if you aren t staying right in the city center it s convenient The room was small but clean and comfortable for one person A couple might want to get a larger room but if you re on a tight budget it s manageable If you re there to just sleep after a long day of sightseeing then it s great The bathroom is also modern which is nice 
207355,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room was absolutely tiny and had a very strong unpleasant smell the whole time I was there No information on hotel facilities or the nearby area was provided by staff on check in and there was none provided in the room I needed to use the safe which did not work and needed maintenance to come out to it twice Staff on reception were pleasant enough but when I asked really quite basic questions about how to get where I needed to be they did not know London well enough to answer Booked because it was relatively cheap and now realise you get what you pay for , Located in friendly safe area Very close to tube station
207356,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, No bad experiences , We arrived after midnight due to travel delays We were beyond tired but check in was seamless and front desk staff particularly trainee Nalini apologize for any mis spelling and her manager on duty went above and beyond to make us comfortable 
207357,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Single room very small but everything you need is there Very close to hand , Reception staff really helpful and kind I can t remember a more comfortable hotel bed 
207358,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, The location was excellent for Hyde Park and we were able to walk all the way to Trafalgar Square through the parks Queensway offered a really good selection of restaurants pubs coffee shops and supermarkets just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel 
207359,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Room size a bit small especially if there were two of you Desk for the business traveller but you have to put all the tea and coffee making facilities on the floor to be able to use it , Exceptionally clean Very good location 
207360,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, Excellent location with easy access to tubes busses parks attractions Modern clean comfortable accommodation Very friendly helpful staff excellent free wifi 
207361,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was surprisingly small Even more so for a 4 stars and with that pricing , Very good position nice building bathroom was small but functional
207362,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I booked the room about 3 weeks ahead Just festival hours before we arrive I received a call from the hotel that they needed to switch me to another sister hotel about 10 minutes from the hotel due to maintenance I checked and found that the hotel we have been asked to move to is about 70 less than what we paid that s after deducting the cost of breakfast offered to us as a convenience , Breakfast is good
207363,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, 1 For single occupation bed was single and narrow Should have at least a double bed I have stayed at other hotel where I had always had a double bed without any extra charge 2 There was no chair There was only a stool which is no good , Staff s ever ready help and positive response 
207364,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Small room for a double Strange booking system They don t tell you that half the price will be charged to your card even though it says pay when you stay Expensive breakfast 12 p p Per day for what is basically self service buffet Plenty of other better places to eat around town Room is abit tatty could do with redecorating , Really nice staff Free upgrade and complementary drinks and chocolates Good budget hotel Fairly good location with Bayswater tube only a minute away however it is so much easier to go to Queensway just down the road and get on the central line Good experience overall 
207365,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, When I went to the hotel they said they changed the hotel because there was a problem Didn t call me before hand poor service n gave me a wrost place to stay, Peaceful
207366,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, We were suppose to stay at Hyde Park but somehow our booking got confused and we were transferred to Shaftesbury Paddington Which is fine The room is slightly small but other than that all is fine , The metro is just roughly 10 mins away which is a plus point There are grocery shops around the hotel 
207367,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Tiny room Could not even open my luggage Horribly soft bed Had to crawl to bottom of bed to get in and out On arrival I was greeted by the receptionist who said half the rooms are under renovation so she will get me a taxi to another sister hotel at Paddington I refused so I was allowed to stay Receptionist said Bookings com was informed but they never informed the guests A bit of a con job I wouldn t stay here again Suggest booking com investigate this , Fantastic location Clean newly renovated rooms 
207368,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Requested many times cot for a baby never happened Anyway event if the give us cot there is no place at all to put in in We had a double deluxe on the ground floor place very tiny with window up on the wall and the view to other walls building Smell wasn t nice very humid To me it wasn t deluxe double room Bathroom tiny , Staff was very nice and breakfast good Location good nearby 3 metro line station less than 1 minute walk Central line and District circle line Nearby Kensington Gardens so it was easy to go with baby for a walk to escape whole city noises 
207369,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, This room was advertised and booked as a deluxe double room Single would have described it better The bed was right next to the window so one person had to get into the bed from the end or crawl over the other person There was a suitcase stand in the room but nowhere to use it we had to open our case on the floor directly behind the door Good job we didn t have to evacuate in a hurry Would not book again,No Positive
207370,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International,No Negative, Staff are amazing There was a lady at the front desk who was amazing Brown long bobbed hair English accent Great person full of life and very helpful
207371,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, The room was smaller than a luxury double that we thought we paid for , The staff were very warm friendly and helpful They went the extra mile to ensure that we enjoyed our stay 
207372,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, No fridge and poor TV resolution Not much of choices of programs too , Clean and not stinky like cigar smell Iron hair dryer and kettle available in the room A station away from paddington to reach Heathrow airport within 15 mins

207379,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, I have absolutely no complaints , Excellent format for solo business travelers Small but clean and sufficient for way less money than the surrounding competition 
207380,Shaftesbury Hyde Park International, Check in process takes a lot of time The rooms are tiny but when I asked for my room to be changed I was moved to a better room The private airport shuttle service that the airport deals with barely waited for me so I the deposit I had paid The hotel compensated by providing a complimentary ride to the closest train station , Great location close to the underground stop very nice area across the street from Hyde Park Friendly staff Room cleanliness Variety of the options in the breakfast
