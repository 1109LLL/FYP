498625,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The fact that without advanced notice we realized upon our arrival after a long flight that 1 we have to pay for all our stay in advance and 2 that the hotel policy was not to accept payment with notes of 500 or 200 Euros The advice of the staff was to go to the nearest bank 15 minutes walk in a hot day after a long flight just to realize that they don t deal with cash money We than had to look for change which accepted only 1 note per person and we needed more Later in the transportation office and in shops we had no problem to pay with these notes I call this a scandal and the management didn t feel that this was a missbehavior not to accept a legal notes Ovetall a small hotel with staff shortage , Fairly good central location and close to the public transport which I needed in order to get to the main congress hall 
498626,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Bathroom smelt Dirty loo roll wasn t flushed when we arrived to our room , Black out curtains Comfey bed Location easy walk to ref light district
498627,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The pillows were too high and big for me to compfortably sleep on and they didn t have other pillows available Had to wait quite long to check in but staff were apologetic , The staff were all very friendly and helpful Lovely room with expresso machine Shower was very good high pressure and hot 
498628,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Rooms so noisy Noisiest hotel I ve ever stayed in noise outside which I know you can t help and really noisy guests but we put up With it And bathrooms no where to put anything quite tiny but small problems, Lovely large comfy beds very clean hotel friendly staff great location
498629,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, This is really not suitable for business trip as the rooms are very loud and I couldn t sleep the whole night The bed was not comfortable Even though I had a room on the 6th floor the windows were small that made the room quite depressing to stay in Check in took too long The hotel restaurant seems really good but not appropriate for room service unless you are in the mood for 3 or 6 course surprise menu, The room was clean Check out was fast
498630,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, A C was not working and in the room during the day you couldn t stay But the personal hotel and position was very good Soon we will be back ,No Positive
498631,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Rooms to the front of the hotel are noisy as the street outside is very busy The bar in the hotel closed quite early i e by 12 30pm ish so a last drink after a night out was not possible , Location excellent base for walking to all of the major sites in the city Very friendly staff and modern rooms 
498632,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, Our room was amazing so much space Lot better than what I was expecting Surrounded by shops and the really easy and quick walk to the dam square Also the pillows were amazing made it so comfortable to sleep
498633,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The bathroom is quite small and the Shower doesn t have a tray to catch the water so u have to put towels down to stop it running up the floor For a lovely modern wee hotel I couldn t understand this Also the air conditioning was broke in the room and they didn t tell us this at check in But when we telephoned down to reception to enquirer they said it had been broke for a few weeks and they were waiting to get it fixed But they sent us up a fan which was ok because we really only used the hotel for a base , I think this a wee gem of a hotel and it s in a great location The Champagne on arrival was a brilliant wee touch and the 2 girls at reception were really nice Veronica Jennifer The room was a grand size We had a lovely quiet room on the 3rd floor at the back of the hotel and the pillows were sooo comfy too 
498634,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, We had to pay more than we were expecting as the air con was broken in the room we had originally booked and so they offered us an upgrade We were given complimentary breakfast however to make up for this and the new room was lovely, Stylish room with immaculate bathroom It was very quiet in the room 
498635,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Our room got very hot and there was no fan or air conditioning though apparently they are installing it now We couldn t leave the window open as the property backs onto a very social and loud area Pillows are huge and uncomfortable but they did track down 2 less inflated ones for us mattress a wee bit thin Internet is slow computer in lobby won t print and staff could not get it to work , The staff was very helpful and tried to fix what they could and booked museum tickets airport transfer and bikes as requested Location was very central near the floating flower market and museum distrinct and walking distance to many things Bikes rented are 3 speed with hand brakes some places only offer 1 speed and peddle brakes Room was clean albeit very small 
498636,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The A C was switched off from the hotel So we have to open the window and enjoy the noise from the drunk people from the bars under the hotel I will never book this hotel again We booked a room from 2 adults 1 child 1 infant They give us a small room without extra beds ,No Positive
498637,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The room we had 209 could have been a little bigger Not a big issue but the cups provided for tea were to be honest very chic and very annoying They had no handles so you burnt your fingers trying to drink from them , An excellent location The staff were exceedingly helpful friendly and efficient It had a cool atmosphere 
498638,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Difficult to access hotel from taxi , The hotel was situated in a perfect location to explore the city by foot The hotel was clean and modern staff were fantastic 
498639,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, More milk and sugar supplied in room for the coffee machine , Bed was comfy coffee machine was a bonus and the selection was lovely Complimentary bottle of water on 1St night was lovely Staff were professional Friendly and informative of places to visit 
498640,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Floor I stayed on was being decorated by the looks of it Floor in my room had paint stains on the floor and bathroom had unfinished areas to it Also room had sight smell of cheap cleaning products not a fresh pleasant smelling room , Having stayed in Amsterdam nermerous times I found the location great good mix of budget through to fine dinning food in easy reach great recommendation from a girl on the hotel bar staff for a new steak and lobster restaurant red the food was simply exquisite great recommendation 
498641,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, It was super noisy in the morning because of the cleaning ladies working in the next room they were moving the furniture talking really loudly The pillows were too big for my taste , The location is just perfect you have plenty of cool restaurants around shopping street is just next corner museums also really nearby The staff at the reception was really nice trying to help with everything 
498642,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, small rooms deluxe and superior was nothing of the sort deluxe was better than superior Staff are friendly until there is an issue and they could not care less to help rectify it , Good location most attractions are walkable
498643,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, From the moment we checked in the staff were helpful and courteous and showed us to our room The room was clean and quiet and equipped with a Nespresso coffee machine Nothing was too much trouble for the staff
498644,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The constant check up from staff when you walk in and out of hotel You can t even invite friends or family up to room for like 15mins without checking in those people Didn t like the escort up to room and the 10mins lecture on where everything is , Asked for quiet room and got one on top level 
498645,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Dirty towels dirty bathrobe bedroom floor dirty Bed not made properly duvet just pulled up Cups not cleaned and coffee not replenished Spoke to reception and they said would sort but didn t Had to speak to a cleaner to arrange for coffee and cups etc Friends room had builders dust in their wardrobe and couldn t put clothes in it They told reception but nothing was done about it Bar man on second night requires further training as put lime in drinks using his fingers Although staff were friendly they didn t deal with any of our issues and that is from both rooms we booked There are ear plugs in each room and I never need them but I did in this hotel It is a nice hotel in a good location but for a property that is newly refurbished it needs to be far better It didn t spoil our trip but it is not a cheap hotel and we expected at least clean rooms , Staff were friendly and great location 
498646,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The first point of contact was not every helpful and rude The rest of the staff were friendly Our check in time was at 3pm and we got the room after 5 30 pm Room was comfortable but not quite finished , Good location Comfortable bed We had an upgrade to Suite due to late check in 
498647,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, There was an issue with the hotel s credit card machine on check in They were very apologetic however , Our room was upgraded to a suite which was vary comfortable and the view was lovely The location of the hotel was excellent 
498648,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Unfortunately we did have what seemed like a stag party directly above us who partied in their room from 3am till 7am but this wasn t a fault of the hotel and being typical brits we just got on with it The pillows were nice and thick though meaning placed over your head could drown out a lot of the noise , Staff were so helpful and friendly and made us feel very welcome
498649,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, There was a strange knocking noise outside our door Was something to do with the lift as if the cable was hitting sonething Quite annoying , Was located 2 minutes walk from Rembrandt Square which has lots of pubs and bars Red Light Districts only ten minutes walk away Hotel was nice and warm We were on top floor 8 floors up Was very clean Shower was very good Free wi fi Never tried eating or drinking in the hotel 17 for breakfast was way over priced considering loads of places just outside you can pick something up for less than 5
498650,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Adjusting the water It was scalding hot But after 5 min I was able to figure it out and adjust it to a good temperature , Really Friendly Staff Awesome bed Superb Location Very clean 
498651,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Very noisy in the hallway Opening closing of the doors , Great location and very spacious room given that it s European style I stayed at their basement type of room 
498652,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The shower was abysmal the water just fell no power The doors don t shut right so we heard slamming doors all night which was annoying The hotel itself is pretty compact feeling It s stylish but still seems dated somehow , The staff were very helpful the hotel was very busy but boy do the staff deal with it well The mattress was firm which was great for me the room had complimentary coffee and water I m a tea drinker but my friend enjoyed the coffee The location was good right next to the flower market and there are a great couple of cafe s around there too I would say it s away from the main hub enough that you don t have to put up with hens stags making lots of noise The hotel and facilities are stylish but small The hotel has no air con so they provide fans which are very powerful 
498653,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, There is no AC and rooms are too hot in September to provide fans only its big terrace would be perfect in winter but not in summer, Staff were very friendly and helpful Location is perfect Rooms include big terrace with nice view Clean
498654,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Mosquitos in the room but when I say to the receptionist they solve immediately, The position the receptionist are so kind and helpful Sofia and natasja are so so nice The Senses restaurant was incredible 
498655,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Could get a bit loud at night as it s located in a very lively area Windows are not soundproof , I love the interior design As soon as you enter the reception area you feel relaxed and happy Room layout is very convenient The room size was big and the Nespresso machine was a nice touch Everything you need is the room Lighting is very good too not too dark and not annoyingly bright just perfect Large spacious bathroom with a good shower and large bathtub Great food from the room service menu gourmet cheeses and large delicious burgers 
498656,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, The room was ready three hours prior to check in and no early fee charged Coffee machine in room was of great assistance after an entertaining night
498657,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Noise from the street No aircon so noisy fan all night The nodt uncomfortable beds ever Dreadful pillows Much too expensive for the type of room facilities,No Positive
498658,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Our ground floor room had no ventilation except doors that opened onto the fire escape Pillows too big Shower rather difficult to control the temperature and the water went everywhere , Staff were friendly and helpful Room was clean and recently decorated Breakfast was good but expensive Free ice lollies to cool us down 
498659,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, There was no air conditioning however the room did have an effective fan but it only worked when we were in the room , Room was very quiet at the back of the hotel Bed was extremely comfortable Staff were friendly and helpful regarding places to eat and visit 
498660,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Not much to not like every thing was to our comfort, We liked the friendly and helpful staff and the overall feeling around the premises of professional attitude and helpful staff
498661,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Depressing hotel small rooms dark narrow corridors just one small elevator for 80 rooms incredible lousy rainshower you d better stand outside in the rain to get wet bad maintenance too small bed Everything except the staff and the location is really bad , Friendly staff Nice location 
498662,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, One of the nights we were there was a Saturday night and there was a lot of noise from the street people yelling out and cars honking until about 4am The other night was very quiet though , We stayed in the studio apartment and it was great It was extremely spacious and clean and it was great having the washing machine and dryer in the room we were halfway through our holiday so it was good being able to do a quick load of washing so we could have fresh clothes for the rest of the trip The location is also excellent it was within walking distance of lots of tourist attractions shops and restaurants The staff were very friendly and helpful The studio apartment is located up two flights of very steep narrow stairs which was fine for us but might be problematic for some people but the staff helped us carry our bags I would highly recommend staying here 
498663,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, In the bathroom shower set up not really functional there is no door or curtain so all area goes wet really quickly, Helpful receptionist answered our requests decent wifi and great location
498664,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The room it was tiny We stayed for three nights and struggled to get much sleep we had a mixture of hot and rainy weather There was no air conditioning so to keep cool it required either using a very loud fan or opening the windows which only opened very slightly and looked onto the wall of a neighbouring building This resulted in external noise not from the bustling city but from the broken gutter outside of the room which was even louder when raining We notified reception who were fully aware of this problem but could do nothing about it The pillows were the sixe of approximately three standard pillows bundled together reception advised that they were the only ones they had so I had to sleep with no pillow The toiletries and bottled water are not refilled daily when housekeeping come although we did receive toiletries refills when we requested them We were on the fifth floor of 8 and there was only one single lift which we had to wait for a lot especially in the mornings when housekeeping were doing the rounds The room key card was very temperamental which meant regular trips up and down to reception waiting for the lift to get it fixed when it didn t work I also think the hotel description was misleading the airport shuttle service was a paid shuttle service which it transpired was only marginally cheaper than a taxi 34 for two rather than 44 and took much longer due to dropping off other passengers Also there was no bike rental service as promised this service included giving us a business card for a local bike hire company where we had to pay their standard rates I would not return to this hotel despite the location , The location was great easy walking distance to all of the main sights Check in was quick the reception area was clean and modern there was an excellent coffee machine in the room and a good variety of TV channels 
498665,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, No air conditioning in the room There was a fan but A C would have made it much better during late afternoon while getting ready for the evening , Great location Just a 10 15 minute walk to the heart of the red light district and only 2 3 min walk to the flower market Plenty of food options very close 
498666,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The noise from the street was unbearable even with earplugs that were provided we had no choice but to have our windows open as there is no A C, The staff bent over backwards were very helpful courteous
498667,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Local temperatures were warm and this hotel does not have air conditioning Opening the windows is one solution that is only partially effective Also the noise when the windows are open is not compatible with sleep , The staff were exceptional from our arrival to departure Katerina Mariska Gerard 
498668,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, We had a misunderstanding with the booking and the staff was amazing and handled the situation very well Beautiful hotel in an excellent location with amazing staff we will definitely be back and recommend to our friends Big thanks to Sofia 
498669,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Noisy both inside and outside huge dip in mattress on one side of bed only coffee facilities in room so no tea pillows too big, Large bed deep bath friendly staff

498671,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, We were on the 7th floor with no windows only sliding doors on the balcony and with someone above us we couldn t leave the doors open at night time the room was boiling, The receptionist who served us was very helpful with recommendations of lovely places to see go and eat 
498672,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Nothing to report No complaints , Staff were so helpful and friendly Rooms very very good value Just fringes on the action for party or casual relaxation

498675,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, Location was central and I was able to walk to all the sites It is a busy street and I had a street room so noise can be an issue Room had all necessary things and was comfortable 
498676,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, This hotel is one road away from Rembrandt square and dam square and the red light district just minutes away Hotel was lovely and the staff where really helpful Would defo stay here again 
498677,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Lighting in the room as in many hotel rooms is poor Dark corridors in the hotel very poorly lit , The staff were very helpful and friendly The rooms were very clean and nice decor 
498678,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Superior room is facing the street which was very noisy at night party people screaming and cars honking the horn all the time Couldnt t sleep until about 5 am when things started to cool down And still I had earplugs If they could fix better insulated windows this would probably do the job Tip Try to get a room not facing the street Hotel is very expensive and yet just normal standard On the other hand other hotels seem just as expensive in Amsterdam , Superior room has normal size nice large double bed Wifi worked fine 
498679,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, the noise from outside a main street the noise inside the hotel if someone one your floor closes the door of his room you hear it loudly in your room , great locaion helpful staff
498680,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Room was alittle small The receptionist ordred us a taxi to the airport and toild us its 45 euros but he didnt gives us any information once we got to the airport taki guy charged us 65 euros and said we were meant to buy a token at the reception for 45 but he never told us that , LOCATION FRIENDLY STAFF

498684,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, On arrival the hotel had already taken one nights payment for each of 3 rooms I d booked I assumed this would be taken off the full cost but I was told by a rude and unhelpful receptionist this was not he case so despite having already paid 458 I was expected to still pay the full amount and the 458 would be refunded although she had no idea when and there was no one there who would know 5 days later I am still waiting for this refund An unexpected extra expense on my arrival , The bar staff were extremely helpful and friendly nice clean accommodation good location
498685,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, We got to wait for room service too long And our delivered dinner was a tiny portion and very expensive Better to eat out We have been charged twice for hotel 2 5 times even Hotel took money of our card without informing us Took us almost 3 weeks to get our money back , We were on our honeymoon and got free upgrade to apartment Very friendly staff Great location Great link between airport 
498686,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The room was quite cold the telephone didn t work and it wasn t as big as expected We was also promised a city view but did not receive this the view was the back of someone s garden we think Not much choice on the hotel restaurant and menu s were different for in the restaurant to room service , Beds are very comfy clean room shower and room service was lovely used once Brilliant location right in the heart of Amsterdam Hotel design makes it easy to find lift bar toilets etc Bar staff were very friendly The reception let us keep our bags in hotel whilst we checked out and enjoyed our last 2 hours before flying home Overall brilliant

498690,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Only a small point The pillows were a little on the large size but I asked the reception staff if I could change my pillow and they were extremely helpful and took me to get a smaller pillow straight away This was only my opinion as my boyfriend thought the large pillows were amazing and really comfortable , We had a lovely stay at the albus hotel the staff are so friendly and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived We had a lovely room on the 6th floor with views of the city The bathroom was of a good size with walk in shower The bed was big and comfy The hotel is in a great location right next to Rembrandt square which is great for restaurants and nightlife and we were within walking distance of all good attractions All in all this hotel is great We had a lovely weekend break and will definitely be returning to the Albus hotel

498692,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The overnight staff one lay wasn t friendly I arrived early around 7am and my room was not ready she said housekeeping gets there at 8 and will start preparing the room I waited till 8 30 then she tells me they won t get there till 9 and will take some time preparing the room meaning wait another hour and a half for the room mind you I had come from a 7 hour flight She never apologized for the inconvenience or said sorry she had a straight face the whole time more like take it or leave it attitude When I said I will look for another hotel and not going to wait any longer then she decided to offer me a room in the basement I was exhausted so I took it It was noisy close to a storage room I could hear doors banging and people moving the whole time Needless to say Im not staying there again In all fairness the lady in the night shift was super nice and sweet , I like the location good spot for shopping but not worth what I paid for

498694,Albus Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The bathroom was dated but clean The shower was weaker than I would have liked On a scale on 1 to 10 for value for money I d rank this at a 6 What brings this number down was the dated bathroom with a weak shower along with the hotel food which was nice but expensive for not a lot of food , The staff were very helpful and friendly The location was very good and the room was lovely Great beds
