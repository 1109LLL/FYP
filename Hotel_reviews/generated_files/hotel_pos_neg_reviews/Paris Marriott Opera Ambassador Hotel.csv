62436,Paris Marriott Opera Ambassador Hotel, Spent 3 nights and had 3 different rooms for each day First day the bathroom was flooded never seen that type of bathroom in any hotel second day no air conditioning and it was very hot especially my niece could not sleep at all and the last room was the best just wandered why we were not allocated the last room in the first instance Our room was not ready at 3 30pm the first day very disappointing , The staff were very friendly and professional
62437,Paris Marriott Opera Ambassador Hotel, Should offer an airport shuttle for the room price Door lock had to be replaced took 15 minutes to get into room Restaurant staff very attentive , Breakfast was great room was very nice but should have been cleaner Night staff were exceptionally friendly Good value for the money not great 
62438,Paris Marriott Opera Ambassador Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is in a wonderful location It s a beautiful place with lots of very very friendly and helpful staff The breakfast is tasty the beds comfortable and the bar good The only reason I didn t give it a better rating is because the TV channels kept cutting out the lights went out randomly but were very very quickly fixed and perhaps the worst the walls and floor are paper thin So when you have upstairs neighbours who come in late and staff who start early it s quite noisy 
62439,Paris Marriott Opera Ambassador Hotel, THE STANDARD OF SERVICE HAS FALLEN SINCE MY LAST STAY TWO YEARS AGO NO RESPONSE TO MY COMPLAINTS FOR OVER TWO DAYS ON INTERMITENT INTERUPTED TV NEWS SERVICE ALSO THOUGH CNN WAS LISTED AS A NEWS CHANNEL SOME OTHER TV CHANNEL WAS SHOWN COMLAINT TO MANAGEMENT WHICH BLAMED TV SERVICE PROVIDER BUT AFTER 2 DAYS WHEN I CHECKED OUT ON 15 MARCH THE PROBLEM WAS NOT RECTIFIED RE CHECKED IN AGAIN ON 16 MARCH SAME PROBLEMS PERSISTED IN THIS ELECTRONIC AGE I CANNOT ACCEPT THAT A MARRIOT HOTEL IS INDIFFERNT TO GUESTS COMPLAINTS ON ITS TV NEWS SERVICE ,No Positive
