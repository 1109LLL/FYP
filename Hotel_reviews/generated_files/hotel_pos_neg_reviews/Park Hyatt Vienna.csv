268460,Park Hyatt Vienna, a bit pricy, Amazing facility amazing location very Clean friendly staff breakfast was great only place I plan to stay at next time I am in the same area of Vienna
268461,Park Hyatt Vienna, The only thing missing was the children bathrobe for going to the pool But we didn t mind that too much , Everything was great The room the staff the service Hotel is very clean the breakfast was great The Bank restaurant was just excellent for dinner their menu is superb The location is just perfect Really had a great stay and would come back to this hotel 
268462,Park Hyatt Vienna,No Negative, The location is great it s in the middle of everything Museums Cafes and Shops Few minutes to see beautiful museums and attractions I enjoyed my staying in the hotel and they were so generous with me and upgraded my room to suite The breakfast was good the rooms are new and clean If I visit Vienna again I will stay at Park Hyatt again for sure highly recommended to everyone Thank you 
268463,Park Hyatt Vienna, There was a guy at concierge who charged me 120 euros for one way city trip While the taxi charge was 15 euros I complained about it and the charge was decreased to 60 euros the same charge for airport transfer That was only thing which annoyed me during the stay , We liked everything and we were offered a complimentary breakfast for all of us during our stay 
268464,Park Hyatt Vienna, With excellent service comes a high price tag Food in the bank brasserie was good but service was not quite in keeping with the rest of the hotel , Large room Very comfortable and excellent service Upgrade and champagne due to anniversary which was a very welcomed gesture In room dining for breakfast was great 
268465,Park Hyatt Vienna, I stayed here maybe more then 5 times But this time was not the best Madam in the room service couldn t properly understand what we wanted she couldn t even repeat our order properly and we needed to call on reception so they could take our order and they still made mistake and gave us two omelet s instead of one And then in the middle of the day we wanted to eat in restaurant and girl on reception said that we can eat in restaurant Also she clarified that when we were talking to her She said even if the restaurant is closed but it was open as she said we can eat in the bar the same menu from restaurant and she also clarified that when we were hanging on the phone and waiting she to clarified that When we came down in 5 minutes in the restaurant they said that it is already closed We starting to explain that we called on reception and girl calrified for us that it is open Restaurant just said sorry So we asked to eat the same menu at the bar and they said that it is not possible D LOL We saw our waiter from the small lobby bar and asked her if it is possible she said not but she said that we can eat room service menu at the bar if we wanted So she helped us to eat that day Thank s to her , This is really one of the best hotels I ve ever been And the best Hyatt in Europe for sure Very clean and with super beds The gym and spa are on the very high level and they really like their guests 
268466,Park Hyatt Vienna, I couldn t get a dinner reservation on the evening of 1 January even though I was a guest at the hotel , Superb shower amenities great service perfect ambiance extraordinary hotel 
268467,Park Hyatt Vienna, To be pedantic my girlfriend reports Pillows were too soft , Room technology Brasserie Bar service Breakfast service Lobby welcome Complimentary still sparkling water Evening turndown service Complimentary room upgrade
268468,Park Hyatt Vienna, We payed 4000USD and the room had a closet the size of a glove compartment After finally agreeing on changing the room it was better The service is questionable for a 5 star hotel Bar service dreadful Coffee shop dreadful It seems they are hiring one professional per station and many young inexperienced staff The moment the place is full as could be expected they all loose their nerve even the experienced ones , The place is unbeatable locationwise also especially for New Year s Eve
268469,Park Hyatt Vienna, Air conditioning was a bit slow to warm room so alternative heating solution would be great for winter time of course , Excellent location Wonderful breakfast Big room space 
268470,Park Hyatt Vienna, If had to be really picky I would say the bed linen was not as soft as other five star hotels We also would have liked to be seated at breakfast and whilst our waitress was very good she would have benefitted from some help as others did not serve tables , Beautiful hotel in superb location Spa is amazing with good facilities Bathroom and shower in room was superbly luxurious Staff were extremely attentive and polite Would definitely recommend a stay here 
268471,Park Hyatt Vienna, I asked for a non smoking room and was gives a smoking one The floor in the room was never cleaned the amenities were seldom replaced and the windows were left open The service and attitude of the staff was that of a 2 star hotel My suitcase was broken while in their care and the over all arrogance of anyone I tried to deal with was not acceptable , Apart from the room layout and the location I was very disappointed with my stay at the Park Hyatt 
268472,Park Hyatt Vienna, we booked a large suite with view it was partial view we did not get checked in early not sure why we paid double the price of a regular room with no extra advantages , the big room Bank resturant 
268473,Park Hyatt Vienna, The fridge is a bit noisy I asked the concierge for a favour to make a reservation for dinner at 7 30pm but for some reason he booked 7pm Fortunately they still have seats for us Also generally there is no greeting or welcome from the staff , The room is very good and modern The restaurant is nice 
268474,Park Hyatt Vienna, The Park Studio king room had no view and was facing the inside of a courtyard which was disappointing The Air conditioning in the room could not be reduced beyond 18 degrees and the room was not cooling evenly The Housekeeping service was very poor for a 5 star hotel and when we entered the room there was a half opened bottle of water left on the bed side table The next day even though the room was double occupancy the housekeeping decided only to put 1 towel instead of 2 and a cup of coffee from the morning was not picked up from the table and cleaned , The Conceirge was very helpful and made some very good recommendations for restaurants The location of the hotel is fantastic 
268475,Park Hyatt Vienna, Room lighting system is electronic and inflexible can you put one bedside light on No, Room size Spa pool excellent superb buffet breakfast Concierge Marion is 5 excellent what good advice 
268476,Park Hyatt Vienna, No fresh fruits provided in the Park Studio upon arrival while this was mentioned on the website No newspaper provided during our stay while this was proposed at the front desk during the check in gold card , Beautiful clean and very comfortable studio excellent breakfast great fitness centre Spa Swimming pool Gym etc ideal location very welcoming staff 
268477,Park Hyatt Vienna,No Negative, A true top quality 5 star experience The staff were superb The facilities excellent The location cannot be bettered Only a few years in operation but it must already rank as THE destination in Vienna Thank you Park Hyatt 
268478,Park Hyatt Vienna, Service for dinner was rather slow and flustered A wider choice of fish and vegetarian dishes on the dinner menu would be appreciated , Excellent location on historic square Stunning design of public areas including restaurant Very comfortable hi tech bedroom and great bathroom and shower Lovely pool and spa facilities
268479,Park Hyatt Vienna,No Negative, Great staff very friendly and always taking time for each customer Also a perfect location in the city centre Rooms are quiet and very comfortable And a great inside pool 
268480,Park Hyatt Vienna, 1 The hotel and or booking com lied about the reservation and fortunately I had my laptop with me to show that booking com offers park deluxe rooms with a king size bed a twin bed when in fact the room has a two twin beds OR a king size bed We were left with no choice but to accept a room with twin beds and a roll away bed for the price of the deluxe park room 2 The second day the room was not made at 3 30pm in the afternoon And the answer from the receptionist to our request to know why it had not been made up was it is probably because housekeeping hasn t reached your room yet 3 Before we left six nights later the TV system went down and nobody could repair it It was repaired at 7 30am on Monday We think that at nearly 700 a night this hotel could afford to have an engineer capable of repairing the system on site 24 7 , The hotel environment is brand new beautifully decorated and very well maintained The swimming pool and spa area is extraordinary for a European capital The food in the dining room for breakfast lunch and dinner and the layout of the dining room next to the open kitchen is impressive The entire service whether delivered by junior or senior hotel staff is excellent The concierge and doormen were exceptionally kind and helpful Rooms serviced twice a day sheets changed daily which is normal but less and less common even in top hotels 
268481,Park Hyatt Vienna, At this rate better bath equipment would be expected Experienced some small issues with cleaness as well Stinking smell at elevator area , Location is awesum Just in the heart of centre Good bed 
268482,Park Hyatt Vienna, Nothing, The location is fantastic Room design and furniture is beautiful Staff is very helpful and friendly The buffet breakfast was v good 
268483,Park Hyatt Vienna, Cleaning trolleys always in corridor but did not always get room supplies replenished Possible drain problems as spa showers and lift shaft were very smelly for a while , Lovely to have the windows open 5 floors up and hear the horses in the street or the buzz of local cafe Excellent spa and pool Scrambled eggs with truffle best breakfast 
268484,Park Hyatt Vienna, Some queues at breakfast with lack of glasses breakfast bowls etc Minor complaint , Great location Excellent room staff fantastic very helpful especially front desk and concierge Also restaurant and bar staff extremely pleasant 
268485,Park Hyatt Vienna, Almost nothing The pearl bar could have been better illuminated and seeing such a nice location as smoking lounge is a bit of surprise I don t smoke so this might be personal , The breakfast room is breathtakingly beautiful Not to miss It is almost a privilege to stay in this wonderful architecture Clean neat comfortable and very private 
268486,Park Hyatt Vienna, Electronic lighting in room was tricky to figure out but this was a minor problem, Beautiful and luxurious Secure Full attention to details Lovely bathroom Kind and friendly staff
268487,Park Hyatt Vienna, Great location amazing suite upgrade but staff not up to speed at all at check in not really welcoming nobody taking care of our bags Even at bel etage floor the used plates remained in the hall way for many hours whole day actually without being cleared door man more busy texting on his smart phone than being supportive Having some very solid comparison of great places benefits from a great location and a greatly built place but it appeared that the hotel has got an overall staff problem , Upgrade to a great ambassador suite
