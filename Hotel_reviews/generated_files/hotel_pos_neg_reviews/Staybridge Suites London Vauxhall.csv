26156,Staybridge Suites London Vauxhall, The only thing I can think of are the hard pillows , The staff are so helpful and friendly We had to leave early due to a family illness and they were so understanding Also so close to Vauxhall station and a great little pub down the road called the Black Dog

26161,Staybridge Suites London Vauxhall, The location was a little away from the main area so in order to reach busier areas you had to travel but it s still close to an underground so that wasn t too much of a problem , They have regular events for example a social hour on Thursdays The staff was friendly clearly knew what they were doing and the rooms were nice and considerably spacey 
26162,Staybridge Suites London Vauxhall, Maybe a bit more gym equipment but everything else was great , Had an amazing stay here The staff were brilliant and whenever we had an enquiry or needed a hand they were there for us Will definitely be back

26164,Staybridge Suites London Vauxhall, the pantry shop prices were a bit on the steep side recommend you walk round the corner to the local shop wifi was a bit iffy , the apartment was great enough room and the kitchen area had everything you needed right down to a dish washer bed was comfortable the lounge area of the hotel spacious 
26165,Staybridge Suites London Vauxhall, The only thing that was a nuisance was the trouble connecting and speed of the wifi in the room , From entering the hotel to leaving there was a nice relaxed atmosphere the staff were very helpful and polite we really liked the layout and amenities of the room we will hopefully be using the same chain in a leisure trip to Newcastle in March

26172,Staybridge Suites London Vauxhall, Any negatives are very small and would not prevent me from booking here again but deserve mentioning The room was so fabulous but the bed bordered on hard as a rock A firm bed is fine but this one was almost too firm and I d have to hesitate if booking for more than a couple days as it would become a problem on my joints Also I would highly recommend that the hotel put a dish towel in the room as I ended up wasting paper towels when drying dishes but didn t want to run the dishwasher for only a coffee cup or wine glass Lastly although checkout was at noon the housekeeper knocked on our door at 1030 and then stood outside waiting for us to leave She practically pushed past me as I rolled my suitcase out of the room a little weird and maybe a one off thing or a translation issue but still a bit rude as your final impression to an otherwise perfect stay , This was an amazing hotel that I would absolutely book at again I looked at hundreds of hotels and I m so glad we booked this one The staff was probably the nicest I ve ever met their dog is super cute breakfast was fabulous and the location perfect The room was very comfortable and well appointed and even roomy by both UK and city standards Although it isn t a highend brand name well known hotel it certainly held its own The lobby is so cozy that you almost want to go sit down there and read Simple things like the still and sparkling water on tap in the lobby area as well as coffee and tea give it a very nice and welcoming vibe It s on the other side of the bridge and down the river from Big Ben a good 20 minute walk However the vauxhall tube stop is a short 5 minute walk away and then only two stops to the district and circle lines So you were far away enough from the tourists without being way outside of the city There is a great little pub just feet away and a big Tescos grocery store down the street maybe a 6 minute walk I would absolutely book here again and I encourage you to try it out 
26173,Staybridge Suites London Vauxhall, Nothing in particular although I wonder if they had a problem with the drains when we were there as the room had a slightly strange smell , Everything Staff fantastic Good location Lovely to take part in the manager s social The place has a nice atmosphere people actually talk to each other
