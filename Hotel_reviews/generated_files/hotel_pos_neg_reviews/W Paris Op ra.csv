414126,W Paris Op ra, People at the reservation office weren t too flexible and helpful for the price you pay you think they d be more considerate , Location wise the place is really good and in the middle of everything 
414127,W Paris Op ra, Nothing in particular but it would be nice if the rooms were equipped with a Kettle they are available on request I was told , The hotel is located right next to the Opera which is a fabulous location Staff were very friendly and helpful 
414128,W Paris Op ra, It is certainly not a five star hotel The menu at the restaurant was poor the food mediocre Traces left by the previous eaters on the table Gin hardly noticeable in gin and tonic cocktail At breakfast nearly impossible to get your order right Bathrobes in the rooms have to be changed these ones have been in use for not less than 5 7 years ,No Positive
414129,W Paris Op ra, The rooms are very modern though lack amenities eg coffee machine kettle and other small things you get in other hotels The hotel makes you pay steep prices for those add ons We didn t bring toothbrush etc as they come standard in order hotels and are readily available in the rooms Here we had to call and only got 1 for the two of us which was not what you would expect from such hotel The reception is slow and don t seem focused problem solving They made us wait for 2 hours at check in even when checking in after 2pm which was as per the booking we made and their T C s , Location was really good very central and close to access the main landmarks Very nice concierge staff 
414130,W Paris Op ra, The hotel has very little in the way of facilities A small lobby small bar restaurant Like a small block of apartments really, Staff were great though and location good
414131,W Paris Op ra,No Negative, Excellent staff Jenna on the desk in particular definitely deserves some recognition for the outstanding service my partner and I received when we arrived on Saturday 
414132,W Paris Op ra,No Negative, The food room ambience of the hotel and the staff were of the highest order I highly recommend the hotel to others and would definitely stay when in Paris next 
414133,W Paris Op ra, There s no real common area such as a lobby area with couches The shower is basically facing the room so if you re traveling with someone you don t want to shower with it becomes a bit tricky , The hotel staff was very friendly and the concierge very helpful with reservations recommendations etc The location is great and the rooms cozy and confortable
414134,W Paris Op ra, 1 Staff was rude When we arrived W Hotel The bell boy just stood there and did not came and help us with our luggage even we called for it 2 Do not go for the breakfast because there is nothing much to eat we paid 38 euro per person You can eat a good meal at other restaurants 3 Cleaner Maid was rude They knocked on our door for cleaning And when I opened the door she scolded me for not putting the do not disturb sign I was in shocked Is this the service you give us With the price I paid Overall W Hotels in Europe are just not worth staying I ve stayed in most of Asia s W Hotel and their service are beyond excellent , Opera House view 
414135,W Paris Op ra, But the design for the detail is so bad The breakfast is so bad only few choice can select Even worse than other 3 stars hotel Not worth to its price The design of hydrant tap is so bad hard to find a comfortable temperature The air conditioning is automatically When we came in it s warm But when we want to sleep it s start to make cool wind And u can not choose it The staff came after I call them twice and can do nothing We are so tired so we turn it off to sleep Fortunately it s not that cold But the air conditioning is rubbish , its a good hotel due to its price Nice staff
414136,W Paris Op ra, The rooms were tired Visible signs of wear and tear When you check into a 5 star hotel you don t want any reminders of previous guests The shower hinges were rusty one fell off when I opened the door scratches and marks all over the sink and bathroom drawers and the carpet was pretty scuffed A big problem being on the first floor was the rumble of the train every three minutes Very loud Also the wifi was beyond terrible and the movies were poor resolution Not what I would expect when paying 11 for one film , The staff were very helpful and eager to please We arrived at 4am and there was someone to immediately check us in park our car and take our bags up to our room after upgrading us to a marvellous suite Big room comfy bed ample storage space and the docking charging station for any mobile device was a nice touch Great location The cafe Cullier down at Galleries Lafayete was the best I ve ever had in France The shower products bliss were large and amazing Great surprise
