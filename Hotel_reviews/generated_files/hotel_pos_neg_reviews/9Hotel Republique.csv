234572,9Hotel Republique, The room was very small but maybe reasonable for that price for a hotel in paris A lot of dust in the room The room key didn t work two times when we came back to the hotel We had to run up and down 5 or 6 times because the new key cards didn t work , The bus and metro station are located just in front of the hotel Very convenient 
234573,9Hotel Republique, Personally we were lucky and everything was wonderful Here are few bits we didn t like but I loved the hotel anyways The area doesn t feel very nice and the metro line was sketchy It s still close to the center 20 30 min metro or walk and generally ok and safe Just not a pleasant one In order to get an iron board you have to pick it downstairs and put it back yourself too Thankfully there s an elevator TV only in french Also I ve seen some people got rooms that facing backyard so it s very dark and everyone could see what s going in their bathroom I definitely wouldn t prefer these rooms , Very stylish hotel itself such a pleasure for eyes Like the one you could find on Pinterest Loved the design so much Clean and spacey for Paris room We probably were lucky and got the bigger room although we ve booked classic double Two balconies huge comfy bed stylish big bathroom with a shower Cleaning every day Nice bonus free coffee and delicious cookies in the lobby Staff speaking English
234574,9Hotel Republique, mess on the balcony fags on the floor the only problem of this really nice hotel with great location , Very nice hotel with helpfull staff great location close to metro station with a lot of restaurants in walking distance 
234575,9Hotel Republique, Being left at the door at 5am because the night watch blocked the door with a Broom and did not answer neither after pressing the bell or calling the hotel My only chance was that I could get in thru the emergency door , Location
234576,9Hotel Republique, Staff struggled to understand English despite having a sign at reception stating we speak English and at one point a male member of staff was very rude to us On arrival our room was not ready which was understandable as it was 12 30pm and check in time was 2pm However after returning at 2 15pm the room was still not ready and we had to wait an extra 30 minutes which set us back with our plans for the day Over all quite disappointed would not return to this hotel ,No Positive
234577,9Hotel Republique, noisy area, loved the breakfast room downstairs and breakfast itself my room was just ok for its value underground station just 2 mins walk 16mins 20 mins walk to louvre et al
234578,9Hotel Republique, the room was extra small I have asked for a quiet one and had a room on the street very noisy Corridor door not soundproof enough The curtains were not completely opacifying No herbal tea available no coffee or tea in the room For a room that was more than 300E night , The hotel style the design of the room the confort of the bed the location the breakfast with fresh fruit nuts 
234579,9Hotel Republique, We initially booked a superior double room which was incredibly small smelt of stale cigarettes and only had towels for one person Unfortunately there wasn t another room available until the next morning so we had to put up with it for one night and then pay for an upgrade to an executive suite frustrating given how much we d already paid but given the room was airy and more than twice the size well worth doing The self service bar in the reception area is a good idea but I d recommend bringing the pricing down as I suspect more people would then use it , The communal areas were stylish and staff helpful 
234580,9Hotel Republique, We didn t noticed there were no refridgerators at first but it was already written in booking com informations so it was our fault Also the west side neighborhood were a little scary to wander around but the hotel itself was right in front of metro station and Republique station a large local station was in walking distance , The room facilities and size bed was overall very good We really enjoyed free coffee at the lobby There are nice bakery and cafes at the east side neighborhood 
234581,9Hotel Republique, Rooms really are quite small Well it is Paris , Handy location for Gare du Nord but far enough Marais and Metro links most places Comfortable and clean Modern but not trying too hard to be trendy 
234582,9Hotel Republique,No Negative, The property was really good The staff was friendly and helpful The location of this property if prefect to access metro you have just step out and walk for 1 min and you are at metro station This made whole experience very comfortable 
234583,9Hotel Republique, Location was okay but not great We chose this place based on it s proximity to Gare Du Nord and also to a music venue Then the band we were planning to see had to cancel their show and the location was suddenly less appealing , Comfortable functional hotel with very kind helpful staff Lebanese restaurant just up the street was nice 
234584,9Hotel Republique,No Negative, Super trendy hotel near a number of metro stations closest being Jacques Bonsergent and the only 5 minute walk to Republique which has the most connections Service was great throughout and our rooms were also upgraded which was a treat 
234585,9Hotel Republique, While the room was very clean it was astronomically TINY and because it had no real windows to the outside world I felt trapped The window we did have opened up to the outside corridor of the hotel It was weird , The location is awesome The Republique area is very vibrant with tons of options for restaurants and bars 
234586,9Hotel Republique, The room I stayed has 2 or 3 rooms next to it In the morning there was huge noise as if someone was constantly bashing my door It actually woke me up I got a bit scared opened the door only to find the cleaner who was cleaning the other rooms I complained to the receptionist and he apologized saying that he d inform the cleaner asap Once my door lock was somehow broken and I had to go 4 times up and down to get a new room card But it never worked until the fifth time when the receptionist finally used a master key Later I left the room tried my room card the lock was magically functional again Lol , The room and the hotel in general looks very cozy and comfortable it s very unique The room is a bit smaller than I imagined but the bed is large and massive Since a good night s sleep is more important anyway I am very satisfied The staff are very friendly and helpful The location is super practical It s no more than 20m walk to the metro station Jacques Bonsergent I enjoyed the books in the hotel lobby Free coffee hot chocolate Very good books One book actually made my day I might still come back the next time 
234587,9Hotel Republique, The property was a little far out however the metro systems are brilliant once you can work them out We felt like geniuses once we had conquered how to use them Was a little off putting the hotel down a side street but it does feel like you re in another world once you re in there We were lucky enough to get a room with a balcony and if you can request one DO Beautiful views of Paris rooftops Amazing hotel I d say a little over priced for how far out you are but over all I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely return should we go back to Paris ,No Positive
234588,9Hotel Republique, The classic room is very small and almost no place to storage the bags and clothes specially if shared by two Room view to the inside of the building , New hotel well decorated and good location Republique and Marais It s in front of Jacques Bonsergent metro station Also V lib bike station across the street Nice staff quiet room and very good breakfast 
234589,9Hotel Republique, Extremely tiny lift Carpets are prone to slipping both in the room in the common areas I slid everytime I stepped on it Was more expensive than usual, It is walking distance from Paris Nord conveniently located around the main road with plenty of eating joints around The Metro is just across the road as well The staff was friendly breakfast was good The room surprised me with a Huge bathroom Very neat 
234590,9Hotel Republique, My wife handwashed some clothes and left them rolled in a towel on the shelves The room cleaner bundled them up and sent them off to the laundry No refund was offered , Exceptionally comfortable quiet room at the rear of the hotel Courteous friendly welcome Everything is clean tidy and new There s a spacious lounge on the ground floor with on tap drinks paid Great shower and bathroom Interesting surrounding area known as village St Denis in the 10th Close to some excellent old restaurants Brasseries Julien and Flo and up and coming new places Good local caf s for breakfast don t bother with the cellar breakfast here at double the cost of a caf Close to Jacques Bonsergeant M tro stop 
234591,9Hotel Republique, Odd showers that left water all over the floor Doors which are noisy when they are opened , Quiet room even though a busy road is nearby Comfy bed Chilled out atmosphere Location 
234592,9Hotel Republique, The rooms are minuscule to the point where there s no room to place luggage The bathroom and toilet is in a cupboard with a sliding door that doesn t close enough to give ANY privacy , Very modern reception area and friendly efficient staff
234593,9Hotel Republique, THE ROOM WAS MUCH SMALLER THAN EXPECTED FOR THE PRICE THE FIRST TIME IN THIS HOTEL WAS VERY DIFFERENT THE HEATING WAS NOT ON WHEN I ENTER IN THE ROOM AT 22 30H OUTSIDE IT WAS 5 VERY COLD I HAD TO WAIT MORE THAN 1 2H TO WARM UP WHEN I ARRIVED AT 14H THE ROOM WAS NOT READY THEY EVEN NOT BRING MY LUGAGE TO THE ROOM AFTER I FEELED LIKE IN A HOSTAL AND NOT IN A 4 HOTEL,No Positive
234594,9Hotel Republique, Next to nothing except for no teas in the room , Great room both decent bed and shower terras with authentic Paris view and Bluetooth speakers were a plus Good breakfast variety service 
234595,9Hotel Republique, On the first night we arrived we were locked out of the room for an hour and the young night shift receptionist was not helpful at all swearing in between trying to open the door repeatedly We weren t given anything complimentary to make up for the massive inconvenience we had to ask for small bottles of water for example and he responded rudely and nonchalantly We eventually went to another room but all of our belongings were in the previous room We understand that these are one offs but it was New year s eve and we just wanted to get a good night s sleep Water could have been hotter too in the rooms This really puts off guests to have warm water Apart from that our stay was amazing and we really loved the service from all the other staff who were on hand to make it special for us , The hot chocolate in the lobby the comfy bed excellent wifi and the amazing guest service from Miguel Walid Nicholas We really loved 9 Republique and would definitely stay there again because of the amazing care shown by its dedicated staff
234596,9Hotel Republique,No Negative, Every detail was taken care of here the rooms are very comfortable breakfast is delicious and the staff were very helpful with recommendations for places to eat and see nearby Thank you for making my short stay in Paris so warm and welcoming I will definitely be returning to 9Hotel 
234597,9Hotel Republique, all good, Location was excellent rooms were very quiet staff friendly and helpful Close to metro connections and easy walk to a good variety of stores and restaurants Good value for money 
234598,9Hotel Republique, When you compare room size in Europe to room size in the States the size is a lot smaller It s comfortable but definitely a lot smaller Be aware and don t be surprised when you open your hotel room , Very nice hotel Very moderne Pleasant and professional staff 
234599,9Hotel Republique, The showerhead had a lot of calcium residu in it Easy to clean Had this in every room I ve been in Also I received clean towels while I put them on the towelheater so it should show that I didn t need fresh ones ,No Positive
234600,9Hotel Republique, The elevator is small, Nice cosy hotel and new with friendly staff Breakfast was very good Enough space in the room comfortable matress bath room was clean and well designed Overall very satisfied and we would book it again when we visit Paris next time

234602,9Hotel Republique, Rooms were a little bit small for the rate I was paying but then we are in Paris so it is to be expected , Bed was extremely comfy great breakfast and loved the location
234603,9Hotel Republique,No Negative, The bedroom and the entire hotel had a very contemporary furniture I loved the big shower and the super comfy bed Great internet connection The hotel staff is very kind and helpful At my arrival the tv in my bedroom didn t work A staff member of the hotel tried to fix the problem but without success so he offered me a new bedroom That was very kind 
234604,9Hotel Republique, Everything great Just a bad luck getting a room next to the lift very small no window or yes window only in the bathroom so that when you closed the bathroom door you felt like in a cave , Great design comfortable bed 
234605,9Hotel Republique, Room amenities can be better No refrigerator in room , Clean new and chic hotel Staff was helpful all the time TV AC high quality Very close to Metro Station Good pricing for the quality 
234606,9Hotel Republique, if the staff knows english it will be better for the costumers it is not about the reception Small rooms , Wonderful location Near the metrostation it is about 15 m Helpfull staff in reception 
234607,9Hotel Republique, Only stayed for 1 night so everything was great, Nice and clean design rooms a bit small bathroom was great Many nice stores and coffee shops in the area Staff was great super friendly and gave us some good tips 
234608,9Hotel Republique, Nothing , Minimalist modernly designed hotel smells beautifully with a freshly baked bread and pastries for breakfast that will make anyone s day The beds are clean and comfortable the parquet gives it a homey feel and the location is right to jacques bonsergent metro station 
234609,9Hotel Republique, Room is comfortable but a bit too small, Very cosy hotel room clean and comfortable with everything bed very comfortable we slept very well Breakfast excellent The lounge is cool you can chill out Overall very modern hotel to stay in Paris And easy to reach from CDG airport
234610,9Hotel Republique, Fine if you like a stark IKEA style but the superior room we had booked was a bad joke No more than 18 either side of the bed the smallest room I have ever been offered in any hotel even in Paris We were upgraded to a more acceptable room but only very reluctantly after an argument Not a tourist location it s in a pretty scruffy area , Very clean Nice breakfast Very close to a Metro station 
234611,9Hotel Republique, Nicholas needs to learn more about customer service and not treat guests like disposable garbage All he cared about was making more money on a room rather than customer satisfaction I extended but it wasn t input the system To my surprise I was called and asked my checkout time When I went to discuss the issue they wanted to increase the price of the room and all he kept telling me is how much money he cant get for the room if I left DISGUSTED I was there over a week but that held no value He obviously lacked people skills and needs to learn the value of hotel service and know reputation is what builds a hotel name , Incredibly comfortable bed Reliable WiFi Few great staff Miguel Wal Maria Miguel was truly amazing in that he made sure our comfort was his priority An asset to the hotel Clean New Close to restaurants supermarkets Metro literally at your doorstep 
234612,9Hotel Republique, None, Good location have many cool shops around the hotel Good design modern style and room clean The hotel manager is very nice and friendly 
234613,9Hotel Republique, Very small rooms without minibar there is no restaurante either in the hotel so if you need something to eat it can be complicated unless you go out , Wi Fi worked very well 
234614,9Hotel Republique, Arrived at 23 pm on sunday and the outside door electronic lock didnt work with our room card key Had to wait a couple of minutes until somebody came and opened for us At that time the neighborhood is not so friendly so a little unpleasant, Great breakfast Totally worth it to pay a little more and have it included on the booking 
234615,9Hotel Republique,No Negative, Amazing hotel in authentic part of Paris Loved the Scandi style decor the comfy beds and great tea and coffee available 24 7 in lobby Excellent healthy breakfast Staff were outstanding Just loved my stay and aim to be back or go to more 9Hotels in other cities 
234616,9Hotel Republique,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and helpful The lobby was inviting and relaxing while enjoying a glass of wine from the help yourself bar cost or coffee and tea free The room and hotel were very clean and the bed was very comfortable 
234617,9Hotel Republique, Pillows are bad not at the same level as the excellent beds Room very very small Elevator slow and tiny , Beautiful design kind and helpful staff Excellent beds nice amenities good location and quiet sleep Overall the feeling is very good
234618,9Hotel Republique, Even though we never found the neighborhood unsafe the surroundings are a bit run down some graffiti vacant stores etc We really liked our room 508 spacious enough big bathroom but there is very little storage room no drawers and a tiny hanging area , Conveniently located close to the tube station the hotel is pleasantly decorated modern and welcoming The multi cultural staff is very helpful and nice having gone out of their way to assist Contrary to some comments in this site we found that breakfast was of good quality and quantity A close by restaurant Popote was excellent value for money 
234619,9Hotel Republique, Room was insanely small bathroom is not properly isolated from the room there is no fridge in the room the gym is way too small the hotel close the door at around midnight till 7 am it gets extremely difficult to get in cusz you have to buzz to wake up the reception guy who comes to open the door simply ridiculous , very modern hotel super new quite good location
234620,9Hotel Republique, The room would benefit from the addition of a small fridge and a little more attention to the functionality of the bathroom door design , Great vibe I think it might be the future of hotels catering to the traveler as an individual Great design no unnecessary fluff Great location despite recent events 
234621,9Hotel Republique, They forgot to put shampoo and shower gel in the bathroom , Open lobby in modern style with free good coffee and thee The hotel has a calm cosy and zen atmosphere There was no noice from other guests 
234622,9Hotel Republique, Lots of graffiti in the general vicinity not at the hotel Small room with windows but no view , Very clean Short walk to restaurants High end appointments in the room Nice lobby 
234623,9Hotel Republique,No Negative, We booked a classic room but on arrival the hotel Manager Miguel decided to upgrade us to a bigger room since we had booked for 3 nights and had big luggage He was also very helpful giving us directions to attractions in the city Other staff were very helpful and friendly as well Free coffee and muffins in the reception area 
234624,9Hotel Republique, The only complaint I would have is that the scrambled eggs at breakfast didn t taste fresh Almost like powdered eggs though everything else at breakfast was great , Really lovely hotel Great staff comfy rooms and beds and really nicely furnished I will absolutely recommend to others and come back in the future 
234625,9Hotel Republique, Hotel may feel narrow as the double standard contains only a bed little cupboard and a small table You may miss nothing though , Location many lines from the metro Republique 3 minutes walk will carry you to all important spots in no time Very clean Nice bathroom with large shower Beautiful lobby with free coffee tea Friendly staff
234626,9Hotel Republique, Wet room When you showered the water came into the hallway and took some time to dry out, Large comfortable clean bed Very good location Helpful friendly staff
234627,9Hotel Republique, Having to hold the shower nossel while showering was difficult and meant water went everywhere We were also travelling with two teenage boys and had requested two rooms one with a Queen size bed the other with two separate single beds When we arrived they didn t have the latter Awkward and embarrassing for them , Good location modern and metro very close 
234628,9Hotel Republique,No Negative, The staff was truly amazing The service excellent and they took care of our every need and beyond The room was amazing as well Only gold stars for these guys 
234629,9Hotel Republique, Not sure how this place has such high reviews Room very small I booked this hotel because they said there were twin beds available so that s what I requested When I checked in they said they didn t have any Staff was absent for long periods of time downstairs and when I got back after midnight one night I was locked out of the hotel for about ten minutes until the only staff member on duty actually decided to check the ground floor , Comfortable bed Nice booking policy 
234630,9Hotel Republique, pillows a bit spongy, very comfortable quiet location next to metro walking distance from Gare du Nord quirky self service bar pleasant staff near to restaurants bars
234631,9Hotel Republique, Missing a shower head holder slider Would be good to have extra shampoo etc when there is more than 1 person staying in , Staff were very pleasant and welcoming The hotel was very clean comfy and close to the metros and a quick walk from Gare du Nord 
234632,9Hotel Republique,No Negative, Excellent value for money in an expensive city Chic hotel well located with style and flair with great Metro links a few steps from the door Exceptional and personal assistance from staff I ll be staying here again when coming through Paris 
234633,9Hotel Republique,No Negative, The stay and staff were amazing They were so helpful when asking on how to get to places and monuments As well as when we had asked to possibly change the room for one with a bath they changed us straight away and when my girlfriend and I had realised the plug sockets where different from the UK ones the receptionist let us borrow one of theirs The hotel was super fancy too and I know it s nothing important but the free hot chocolate was the best hot chocolate I have ever tasted I loved my stay and would go back tomorrow 
234634,9Hotel Republique, Rooms are indeed vary small but the layout is relatively ok for a Paris hotel Elevators were not working for 2 days so we had to climb to the forth floor Management did all they could but during the weekend they were off , Staff was amazing Casual and very friendly Location is great right next to a metro station and walking distance from Place Republic Breakfast was wonderful Rich and tasty Fitness center is tiny but well placed so the experience is fine
234635,9Hotel Republique, Not mentioned on booking that the standard room did not have a window just frosted glass to internal courtyard I presume So on arrival charged extra 150euros to upgrade to room with a window to outside This may have been a better room overall but think it s unfair not to flag this up at time of booking , Staff nice and helpful Walked from Gare du Nord Easy to get to all the tourist attractions 
234636,9Hotel Republique, The superior room was tiny The bed was two singles pushed together The bathroom had a sliding door that clearly could never shut flush with the wall In addition some maintenance work started outside the room at 9am ,No Positive

234641,9Hotel Republique, The manager was very rude on our arrival We paid for an upgrade where booking offered a bigger and a quiet room and they did not have any of those things, The reception is comfortable and with a nice decoration but the gym and rooms are really small
234642,9Hotel Republique, Some drawer space in the room for underware etc Small drawer beside the bed for reading glasses etc Otherwise excellent , Staff very helpful and friendly Cleanliness was excellent Loved our balcony room 
234643,9Hotel Republique, , Nice very clean room with comfortable bed Bathroom facilities are great The breakfast is tasty fresh juices good coffee offers variety of choices and is totally worth its value The location is very convenient within walking distance to Gare du Nord and Republic square very good bus and metro connection Good wifi connection Overall the atmosphere is very nice would definitely return to this hotel
