63229,Number Sixteen, nothing, They left us a bottle of champagne on our wedding night and the staff were lovely amazing little hotel in the heart of London with stunning gardens happy bride
63230,Number Sixteen, We enjoyed our stay so much we hardly want to criticise but if were to offer any suggestions for improvement there was no extractor fan in the bathroom although the window did open and the bathroom window was not quite fully frosted having a clear border of a few centimetres all around the edge which was a little disconcerting In terms of the staff everyone was extremely friendly helpful and keen to please we just found that one of the older ladies who delivered the breakfast from room service came across a little too instructive rather than suggestive in terms of her comments so although not at all unpleasant her manner caused a slightly prickly reaction which could perhaps have been avoided This is being super critical though so don t let that deter you from staying in the best hotel we have ever experienced , Best stay ever The d cor was tasteful and gorgeous both in the bedrooms and the public areas We have never experienced such a clean hotel which gave us the confidence to completely relax and enjoy our stay The bed was huge we requested extra large and very comfy we always get back ache when sleeping away from home but not this time The bathroom although fairly compact was well designed with space to house display toiletries and make yourself feel at home There were extra little touches to be found everywhere from a welcome message and complementary relaxing spray and lotion to full length mirrors on the amazing fabric covered 180 degree opening wardrobe doors making the room both interesting and practical We booked a deluxe room and were so impressed we awarded it the accolade of best hotel we have ever stayed in We ordered from the room service menu for both breakfast and evening meal and it appeared on time was all present and correct and was totally delicious The staff were friendly and helpful and everything just worked The tube is just minutes away from the hotel and we will definitely book a return visit the next time we go to Wimbledon 
63231,Number Sixteen, The bathroom was miniscule and the room wasn t much bigger It was a single in London though so I guess that s to be expected , A unique boutique hotel with charm Everyone who worked there was fantastic always smiling and ready to help Room was very clean and the bathroom although small looked brand new Perfect spot on a quiet street very close to the underground 
63232,Number Sixteen, Mattress was lumpy , Staff is friendly helpful and hardworking Location is ideal The tube is less than two blacks away Great restaurants Moti Mahal e g and taverns Zetland Arms throughout the upscale South Kensington neighborhood If you need a hair out gentlemen Italian barbers the world s best staff the South Ken barbershop nearby 
63233,Number Sixteen, I booked this room as a one night transit for my parents who are both in their 80s They had to fill a gap in their itineray so weren t going to stay long in any case If they had they would have moved The room they were allocated was terrible Firstly the lift only went to the floor below and there were steep stairs up to their room which they found hard to climb Secondly the room itself was tiny Thirdly the bathroom was so small as to be almost unusable Incredibly the toilet seat was a kids size apparently so the door clould just fit around it And the door to the shower was partially blocked by the other small fixtures in the tiny bathroom This hotel markets itself as an upmarket boutique luxury hotel It is anything but My parents did not cause a fuss as they were out again the next morning but considering the 5 star billing and prices it left a very bad taste in the mouth A ripoff Be warned , The hotel is in a nice side street in South Kensington 
63234,Number Sixteen, There was no coffee available in the room or lobby Could order room service but that seems so yesterday , Great location a 4 minute walk from the South Kensington tube station Charming group of three residences joined as one mini hotel Staff very helpful 
63235,Number Sixteen,No Negative, Fantastic location Wonderful rooms The hotel is both stylish and comfortable at the same time The staff was outstanding especially our new friend Arthur His tips and recommendations made our brief time in London quite memorable 
63236,Number Sixteen, poor design in the bedroom which is a surprise as the hotel trades on the interior design Poor amenities in the room no tea and coffee making facility Charging for this and overcharging for tea to the room Felt like a chain hotel trying to make money and not the uniqueness that the brand began with Would not come again , The bed was very comfortable and sheets good quality 
63237,Number Sixteen,No Negative, Fabulous staff location rooms beautifully and originally decorated Guest lounge with honesty bar a thoughtful facility and the tea always made in pots breakfast delicious 
63238,Number Sixteen, The Continental breakfast however was a bit of a letdown no breads just some croissants and cakes The croissants weren t even fresh or warm but stale We tried ordering some toast but they were very plain and tepid at best , The hotel itself was superb staff friendly and helpful room immaculate and luxurious all the things one would expect from a hotel in this class 
63239,Number Sixteen, We were so disappointed that there was a private function in the garden which meant we could not enjoy a drink outside on a beautiful sunny evening surely it would be possible to keep an area just for hotel guests available all the time Felt like all the hotel guests were cooped up in the smaller sitting rooms inside the hotel Given the price of rooms I would expect guests to be prioritised , Great location beautiful garden and really friendly staff
63240,Number Sixteen, I had a single room and it was REALLY small especially the bathroom Later in the trip I stayed at a different hotel a little further out of the city in Kingston and got a double room easily twice as big for half the money and just as nice It s a little more complex to get into city from Kingston but I ll take that effort to save 150 a night So to me the value for money wasn t great In fairness the common areas were very nice so the best strategy is to use them until it s time to go to sleep , A really nice boutique hotel with ultra attentive staff and a lot of character and style A block to South Kensington tube station which gives quick access to Heathrow and to all of central London Also easy walk to Victoria and Albert Museum if you are doing any touristing 
63241,Number Sixteen, My single room was awfully small It didn t matter at all But you ve been warned , Staff were excellent Modern place and slightly quirky Loved decent 24 hour room service as well 
63242,Number Sixteen, Lack of tea coffee facilities in the room, Beautiful bedroom and bathroom very comfortable bed Beautifully clean and extremely well maintained Super breakfast Friendly staff 
63243,Number Sixteen, As a 57 year old who travels frequently I have never experienced such dreadful service in any hotel or restaurant Absolutely shocking Mistake after mistake orders not taken then a huge delay before returning to advise half the courses not available Drinks order only partly served Starter course missing Part of main missing and in each case it took an age to get sorted with a waiter who was unfit for the job in every respect apart from appearance Ruined a well planned evening and stay and this is an expensive establishment promising much but failing to deliver , location general decor and atmosphere reception staff Unfortunately all rendered irrelevant as the restaurant and then attitude of the management put this hotel firmly in the never again category
63244,Number Sixteen, Bathroom somewhat small but adequate and beautifully maintained , Outstanding decor well equipped and comfortable room eg clothes brush provided staff very friendly and helpful superbly located for museums shopping restaurants Very near S Kensington tube 
63245,Number Sixteen, Room bar fridge drinks were bit expensive, There was very little if anything not to like a tastefully decorated hotel were there was no word No 
63246,Number Sixteen, Breakfast service was a bit off forgot my order , Location location location and then you enter and the interior is beautifully appointed the decor is stunning and sophisticated with surprising art and bold colors that alone would be enough but the staff are attentive courteous gracious and delightful to talk with and offered many great recommendations 
63247,Number Sixteen, Not a thing to be improved upon , The position of the hotel is extremely convenient only a few minutes walk to South Kensington tube station yet in a quiet setting The staff could not have been more helpful We loved the quirky d cor and high degree of comfort The small restaurant has a good wine list and delicious well presented meals are offered I m almost inclined to keep this my lovely hotel a best kept secret but they deserve the recognition We are quite discerning read particular guests and we could not find fault with anything here The mini bar is stocked with quality product Heaps of interesting pieces of artwork adorn the common areas for guests to enjoy The overall vibe of the hotel is trendy but really inviting Very highly recommended 
63248,Number Sixteen, Breakfast was included to our surprise his was not a full breakfast staff at breakfast generally very disinterested to assist as opposed to rest of staff in hotel Some staff at breakfast setting could not understand basic English language ,No Positive
63249,Number Sixteen, The noise from above Being in Room 2 and the dining room above with no floor coverings just floorboards it was rather noisy , Tastefully decorated Very comfy bed Great location 
63250,Number Sixteen, The roof floor room is very romantic but ceiling lights in bathroom dirty fallen off with dirts , Hotel s interial Deco very nice Bed is comfortable Just a couple minutes walk to the tub station very convenient 
63251,Number Sixteen, When booked breakfast was included Eventually it was not a full breakfast but continental breakfast You had to pay extra for a warm breakfast The restaurant staff disappointed but one older lady working in the restaurant was very friendly and helpful , The reception and cleaning staff were very friendly and helpful Beautiful hotel 
63252,Number Sixteen,No Negative, Perfect relaxing place for the last day of my visit to the UK Love the art and decor and everything about it Stayed there years ago and it was great to see it was still as wonderful 
63253,Number Sixteen, I found drinks totally overpriced min 17 for qla G T 8ish for a green tea which is usually available for free in most hotels etc Diner menu was not overly inspired and also very expensive for the quality Baby food options were very limited only the home made chicken nuggets were really worth it very few healthy baby friendly alternatives Also we ended up in the lower ground floor without being told which was a very bad surprise for a so called Deluxe room at 359 a night , Best bedding I ever tried luxurious pillows and mattress Top quality bathroom furniture and a lot of space Lovely romantic garden with pond Very nice details such as little slippers and bath set for our baby the staff was also bringing bottled water and tucked the teddy bear safely in our bed which is cute They were also able to arrange a push chair for us 
63254,Number Sixteen, Room 1 is a basement room from 0600 there are staff walking back and forward on the floor above making it impossible to sleep with the noise Nobody should have to put up with this at such a hotel I am surprised that the hotel has till now not tried to make recompense for what was a largely sleepless night The check out at 1200 is too early for what is not a cheap hotel, Staff are great really friendly Honesty bar is very nice
63255,Number Sixteen, Bed not so comfortable Bit too hard for my taste , So beautiful room and excellent service when it comes to staff in reception Especially the tall guy Alexander As working in hotel and restaurant business ourselves he was absolutely amazing Staff in restaurant bit confused and not present Could use some more guidance and most of all confidence Lovely hotel 
63256,Number Sixteen, the decor of the public rooms it didn t feel very cozy and not what I would expect of a small London hotel also the furniture was uncomfortable especially in the bar area and the lighting was terrible I really liked the decor of the Franklin which is unfortunately now closed , The food was delicious and the little garden off of the dining room was lovely My room was quite nice and very comfortable I can t say enough nice things about your staff they were all wonderful especially Karilos the Lithuanian and Jaun SP the Portuguese 
63257,Number Sixteen, Very small room designer ie inconvenient layout in the bathroom small single uncomfortable bed, Great location and recent property upgrades facade upgrades are still ongoing
63258,Number Sixteen, i would avoid a basement bedroom in the future owing to constant disturbance from the noise of footsteps overhead Also while work to the front of the building continues I would request a room at the rear of the hotel to avoid disturbance from noise and workmen moving about on the scaffolding in front of the rooms Windows , Beautiful hotel in excellent location Excellent customer service When I complained about noise in the basement bedroom I was in the staff were extremely helpful and apologetic and were quick to move me to a different room 
63259,Number Sixteen, The exterior scaffold erected which hopefully is temporary , Comfy room and warm services of friendly staff The garden was absolutely charming Very convenient location 
63260,Number Sixteen, there was construction work and renovations that woke me up every morning even after i asked the change the room , the bed was super comfy the service and location were great
63261,Number Sixteen,No Negative, the room smelled of paint and the staff don t really care The doors are horrendous we were constantly awakened by banging doors in the morning it s a nightmare we had to open our windows to air the room in window due to the bad smell Despite repeated talk to the front desk there was no communication between the staff When we spoke to the manager she offered us two complimentary breakfast The manager is not equipped to deal with customer complaints It s a great disappointment for us to have such service standard under the the soho house group I will not recommend this hotel for the prices charged and the service standard 
63262,Number Sixteen, The only minor issue is when we ordered room service and it may be down to personal preference but we were not totally satisfied with the chicken caeser salad and salmon fish cakes , We both had the best nights sleep in a long time thanks to the amazing bed staff were so welcoming and friendly The interior design was beautif and uplifting Management was also super helpful with any queries we had 
63263,Number Sixteen, Very high payment request 50 for very slight late checkout one hour Frankly they get down to 25 after a discussion but still it is too much , Environment
63264,Number Sixteen, Our room was in basement and very nice but was directly under the kitchen Very noisy from 0530am with kitchen staff walking above us about preparing breakfast Room 2 not a suitable for light sleepers Without a quibble the staff swapped our room for our 2nd night Our reservation included breakfast but was only for Continental breakfast and had to pay an additional 5 per person In UK when breakfast is continental is states this and not just breakfast Hotel needs to make this clear otherwise would have scored a 10 , Staff were very courteous Breakfast nice 
63265,Number Sixteen, Room 102 prone to kitchen cooking smells and blind on the bathroom window wouldn t go amiss , Staff were lovely Hotel was warm comfy with eclectic bright and tasteful decor The abundance of fruit choice at breakfast Yummy pastries 
63266,Number Sixteen,No Negative, Can t rate this hotel highly enough I have never experienced such a wonderful level of staff friendliness every single member of the staff we encountered greeted us with a smile and Good Morning or Evening The hotel is beautifully decorated breakfast is wonderful poached eggs and avocado on rye yum and rooms so very comfortable with lovely linen Cleanliness a perfect 10 Thankyou so very much for our stay 
63267,Number Sixteen,No Negative, Fantastic location in a real neighborhood which abounds in shops restaurants etc and is just around the corner from the South Kensington tube stop I have stayed here since 1980 many times and it just keeps getting better every time 
63268,Number Sixteen, they didn t allow me to take pictures they said because I had a pro camera if I was taking with my iPhone was ok the room was nice but very small and the ac was not working good The assistant manger was so rude she was treating us like guest we really felt bad the manger was kind and understanding , The Manger
