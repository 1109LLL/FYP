177266,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The lighting in the room was poor needs some down lights put in had to open the curtain during the day to see , The veiw from the 9th floor fantastic Breakfast was very good lots to choose from
177267,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, We were not given the room we were promised 2 twins instead of a king We were promised an upgrade because we are platinum members Then the next day it wa unavailable, The location was great
177268,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Extremely hot showers will trigger fire alarms and hotel evacuations even at 3 30am in the middle of the night Fire and smoke alarms definitely work , Staff were friendly and helpful Room was clean and comfortable with excellent air conditioning 
177269,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame,No Negative, The location to Notre Dame and the Latin Quarter area is fantastic makes walking to all areas a breeze the rooftop area is fantastic and the rooms with small balcony views towards the tower are amazing
177270,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Colour scheme is questionable Towels are small I hate small towels in bathrooms Very small wardrobe and not a lot of storage space but o k for a weekend , Great views from the room Easy check in and out Good central location and easy to find Plenty of places to eat in the area Rooms larger than the normal size we have stayed in when visiting Paris in the past Bathroom also an o k size Free safe in room and mini fridge were both very useful 
177271,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, They didn t clean the towels and cups and give new shampoos daily One man on reception quite rude , The location is absolutely fantastic and the rooftop bar has spectacular views of the whole of Paris 
177272,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Bathroom was good size BUT poorly designed Tiny sink squished in to a spot where your arms would not fit within the walls on either side to dry your hair No place to put your toiletries 2 tiny corner shelves in a place that is not useful , Clean hotel great location Love the Roof top bar restaurant Amaxing views of Paris 
177273,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The rooms was ok but the barrier on the balcony to the next room is useless and the guy in the next room kept talking to us So no privacy He was smoking cigars and there was no way to escape the smoke , We only booked because friend had a short time in Paris So booked a room with the Eiffel tower view so he could take pictures The view of the roof tops and the tower is nice 
177274,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Bar Staff was very rude argumentative and confrontational They like to advertise the roof top bar but it required reservations that were not given to hotel guests but locals , Great Location
177275,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Nothing to complain about, Location location location Busy area full of everything you need and metro station is nearby Staff were very helpful and the hotel was always clean 
177276,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Cooked breakfast poor quality very fatty bacon Poor communication as we had emailed the hotel twice with a question regarding our stay Got our response after we had left and were on our way home V, Clean hotel in a central location Easy to find from the metro
177277,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Only one elevator was in service Had to wait long time to get up and down , The room was sufficient a lot packed into small space Paid extra to get balcony and view of Paris Booking com picture showed Eiffel Tower receptionist said we would see Norte Dame from our balcony We saw a building across the street blocking any view of Paris 
177278,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Very noisy room Given the location the rooms need to have much better sound insulation and improved double glazing Would not recommend staying for more than one night unless you are an insomniac , Convenient location Pleasant staff 
177279,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, we stayed 3 nights in hotel and every day same breakfast menu card which was boring , Great Nice Location within market restaurants and centre of city
177280,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, It was on the high end for pricing Hotel tax plus breakfast for two was another 50 euro added to a 720 euro for 3 nights I did it for location but will shop around in same area next time , Convenient location I liked the back patio and common areas and roof top deck Although decking needs replacing Can trip on some patchy spots 
177281,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Client service of this hotel is very poor Staff not friendly absolutely not client oriented bathtub in room had several damages due presumably to shower appliance strikes on it Room was very small as it was for 3 it had a sofa bed we never asked for that So we had real small beds and little space for circulation There are no Do not Disturb tags available for guests elevators are really slow and quite a lot of waiting needed There is a sign at the elevators where the hotel suggests that you should make reservations directly with them in order to have a better price , Location is very good as well as breakfast service 
177282,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The size of the room was abysmally small For example it was impossible to use the hair dryer in the bathroom without keeping the door open My husband suggested that we were given such a small room because we used Booking com and the hotel simply gave us a small and cheap room I hope this isn t the case Additionally we had to ask for soap and for toilet paper since the chamber maid did not leave sufficient supply of either after the second day our stay was for a week Although there was a heating kettle for tea and coffee in the room one day the coffee supply was not adequately replenished and another day no milk or cream was provided Breakfast was conveniently available as was a Starbuck s on site , The staff at Reception were absolutely wonderful They were cordial accommodating and sensitive to our needs Any complaints we had see below toilet paper and soap were were we solved satisfactorily The room was clean 
177283,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The rooms were too small the heating system didn t seem to work and the rooms were a bit cold For 200 Euro excluding breakfast l felt a bit short changed , Property is in a great location if you want to tour the city as it is close to everything train station main city attractions etc 
177284,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Buffet breakfast poorly organised and not great value at 18 euros , Superb view of Eiffel Tower and modern facilities throughout First rate location with many great bars and restaurants on the banks of the Seine and surrounding areas Close to Notre Dame and very near Metro 
177285,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame,No Negative, This Holiday Inn Notre Dame was wonderful The staff was very friendly and helpful We travelled with our son and daughter in law and we booked two rooms with balconies with a view of the Eiffel Tower The rooms were small but comfortable the bathroom was quite roomy and the view was amazing We had 8 days of sunshine and used the balcony every morning and evening Paris streets can be noisy but we could not hear it in our rooms the higher the floor the less noise The hotel is near the metro Notre Dame The Louvre and 1 block to the Seine I will definitely book this hotel again on our next trip to Paris 
177286,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The toilet is bolted to the wall and not the floor which caused me some nervousness being a large man 6 4 350lbs Also the elevators are tiny We had to wait for 4 different elevators to go by to get down the day we checked out due to there being no room, The room was a decent size for being in the thick of things in a major city Rooftop deck has amazing views 
177287,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Tiny room less than 15 Sam so had to change rooms Ended up with a bigger room about 18sqm but woke everyday as I was next to the construction going on next door This was not mentioned and was very very loud with drills and banging which shook our room The management just said it was out of their control but they should have warned us , Great roof bar and location
177288,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, A bit pricey for what you get The rooftop staff need to get their act together otherwise all the rest were excellent , Truly excellent location All the necessary comforts were there 
177289,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, FIRST NIGHT I FOUND MYSELF IN A SMALL ROOM IMPOSSIBLE TO FIT IN WITH 2PERS THAN THE HOTEL CHANGED THE ROOM FOR A BETTER ONE LIKE THEPICTURE I HAD ON MYMOBILE BEFORE THE BOOKING, LOCATION
177290,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The only negative aspect was small size of the king size room and the fact that the toilet had a sliding door that left a massive gap on the side making the presence of a door quite pointless You might as well not have a door Having said all this I would still stay at the place , Breakfast was excellent staff were fantastic and the location was ideal 
177291,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, All good , Location Cleanliness Perfect stay in Paris Will definitely stay here next time I come Walking distance to Louvre Notre Dame and even walked to Eiffel Tower 5 minutes away from subway station direct train from CDG Definitely recommended you will not make a mistake by booking it 
177292,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame,No Negative, The location is perfect walking distance to everything The staff was helpful and the room was very clean Very good breakfast Nothing missing The terrace is amazing 
177293,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame,No Negative, The staff was so professional Lorenzo was exceptionally helpful The hotel is of a very high quality standard for a Holiday Inn Excellent modern vibe about this hotel which was up my street Location was excellent for lively access around Latin quarter and Notre Dame metro Direct metro lines to Eiffel Tower Recommend for young people staying in Paris Rooftop view at Sunset is something else 
177294,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame,No Negative, Lorenzo at the front desk was very helpful in arranging a shuttle for us to the airport We found all interactions with hotel staff to be very helpful and attentive 
177295,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The room was very small compact and impersonal We had to ask for the room to be cleaned each day As soon as we mentioned it at the reception someone came to top up teas coffees and clean There is also a card to be left on the door which we hadn t read on the first morning which says clean my room It was in with lots of informative leaflets Unfortunately on the reverse is do not clean my room When we went out for the day it was knocked off and put back on incorrectly This could be improved , The staff were friendly and helpful The downstairs facilities were good clean and the quick breakfast in the bar area was excellent juice croissants lovely bread with butter and potted jams and tea or coffee for 7 5euros The location is just around the corner from Notre Dame Cathedral and walkable to many of the attractions 
177296,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, I booked a double room with 2 beds for me and my 16 yr old son Yet when we arrived they had reserved 1 double bed room They blamed booking Com for the mistake and gave us room with 2 beds which was smaller than room I paid for kettle never worked and took several calls and hours to replace it the tv blacked out after 5 minutes of watching , View from the roof terrace was amazing 
177297,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Room service menu was very poor, Location of hotel is so close to Notre Dame cathedral and good selection of restaurants near by beautiful modern hotel and very comfy 
177298,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The bed was a bit rustly just because of the material it was made of but that s really nitpicking and I wouldn t say it impacted us in any way , The location was excellent very close to the Notre Dame Cathedral Staff were friendly and helpful The bed was comfy and the room was always very clean 
177299,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Breakfast was not worth it Don t waste your money The rooms are very small by USA standards We made it work but just to warn you the rooms are extremely small and there is no privacy when it comes to using the bathroom , The location of the hotel is AMAZING Very close to two metro stops tons of restaurants coffee shops and even pharmacies The location made it very easy to get to all parts of Paris The Louvre Notre Dame and Siene River cruises are all walking distance from the hotel 
177300,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The room was very small staircase , very good location Nice and friendly staff Breakfast buffet OK and sufficient Balcony and roof terrace magnificent
177301,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Unfortunately there wasn t mini bar , The hotel is perfectly situated in the Latin Quarter a few minutes walk from the Cite Notre Dame Sainte Chapelle Saint The nearest Metro station is 50 m We were on the sixth floor of a room with balcony with a beautiful view of the roofs of Paris and the Eiffel Tower The room was clean comfortable and well equipped The breakfast is hearty buffet style with usual hot and cold meals From the rooftop terrace offers a stunning view 
177302,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Lighting in the rooms was a bit dim No magnifying mirror in bathroom so not easy to put make up on , Bed was super comfy brand new mattresses Lovely to have a lounge area downstairs to relax in lots of books to look at Staff were very friendly 
177303,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, OK apart from my comments i liked the room the view was excellent room service menu was not very good at all needs big improvement plus very very expensive for what you get if you would like you too I will consult with you and show improvements on menu and presentation and also profit and loss contact me at chefs richardhenderson co uk However I will come back I like the place a lot , ok fair enough the hotel staff did not know I was ill however i did put my breakfast recommendations on the door key early as it stated on the form first morning no room service breakfast second same so i gave up however I will not let that phase me as i ts a great hotel and would stay again Also as I was Ill I did not want my room cleaned but these annoying messages came up on the TV to notify me that they had seen the do not disturb sign on the door erm Do not disturb 
177304,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The hotel location, I was check in early morning and I ask for pack breakfast I have not get it there is no parking in the hotel I have to park my car in paid parking
177305,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, They should have slippers in the room And making tea coffee area not suitable and cupboards not properly light Also same routine breakfast No water bottles complement No toothbrush , Only the place in central Only that 
177306,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Breakfast was horrible No options in the buffet Worst scramble eggs you can ever have fatty very hard sausages fruits are limited to orange and sometimes you can see a banana or two try to catch it before someone else The room was very small even compared to Paris standards The water will leak out of the bath every time you take shower There was a pillar at the end of the bed that will block you watching the TV Only French channles available with the exception of some news channels Wifi was only offered for free for three hours The guy at the reception informed us at check in that the room with the view is only available for two nights booking for four nights and that we have to check with the reception after two nights to change the room When we checked they were surprised and mentioned that the room is available and no need to change , Location was perfect Near Notre Dame Cathedriale and next to the metro and 3 minutes from RER 
177307,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Nothing Love this hotel , We have stayed in this hotel at least 6 times already and we just feel super comfortable with this choice every time we go to Paris Last time I complained about the scrambled eggs and this time I have to say the chef learned how to make them 
177308,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame,No Negative, recommendation by the front desk at an off the beaten track for an Italian evening meal excellent It was pouring with rain when we arrived appreciated the loan of an umbrella from the front desk otherwise we may have been saturated at Notre Dame
177309,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Our room was a wet room Much prefer a separate shower so you don t have to keep getting wet feet , Couldnt have been a better location perfect for visiting the Notre Dame and exploring the Latin Quarter in the evening Disappointed it was raining because the view from the roof terrace was gorgeous 
177310,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Lights in the room turned on and off as if controlled remotely Very strange , Location was ideal staff was professional and friendly Room was nicely appointed with a balcony and Eiffel tower view Response to our slow draining shower stall was quick 
177311,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Chairs on the balcony need replacing but as weather wasn t too good it didn t detract from our stay, Continental choice was really good but if you prefer traditional English breakfast choice not great 
177312,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, We thought it was a small room considering it was an Executive Suite and no space to hang clothes other than a tiny wardrobe had to live out of suitcases , The bed was really comfy and the view of the Eiffel Tower was a lovely touch 
177313,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame,No Negative, Great view of the Eiffel Tower from room and open roof top Location was exceptional close to public transport Notre Dame and Louvre Many eateries within walking distance 
177314,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Dining options seemed limited pricey but lots of options nearby , Lovely breakfasts friendly staff v comfortable bed quiet room super location train straight from CDG airport to st Michel stop which is approx 100 from hotel 
177315,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, An over zealous breakfast waiter wanting to clean set the 2 places at our table when we are in the middle of our breakfast and in conversation I asked him to wait until later but he said no I m just doing my job It took another staff member to tell him to leave it till later All other staff were friendly and efficient , Location on quiet side street in amongst the action great view from the roof terrace and see the Eiffel Tower Sparkle 
177316,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Bathroom fittings not great Sink tap was ridiculous couldn t turn on or off as not enough room between mirror and tap to get your fingers around the tap, Fantastic location and amazing roof bar
177317,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, We never complain about anything but unfortunately the soundproofing was not the best outside noises can be easily heard Customer service could be better , Stayed here for 3 nights in Autumn late Oct ROOFTOP WAS AMAZING Bar wasn t operating but you could take your own drinks and food up and enjoy the views anyway View is simply stunning you can get some great photos of the Eiffel Tower Room was average bed comfy Excellent location and area right next to St Michel Metro Station that gives you a direct link to the Palace of Versailles 
177318,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, We ordered 2single beds was ok at arrival When we came back at night beds were put together with 1cover Had to ask to separate it again girl at reception not so friendly girl from room service very friendly but we were tired and couldn t t go to bed We were disappointed that the roof top terrace was not open despite good weather , Bed very comfortable The day of arrival The girl at the reception very friendly Room quiet but only until the builders across the road started to work at approx 8 clock in the morning 
177319,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The room was a bit small and it was hard to find a spot for my suitcase without moving the extra chair in the room , The staff were very helpful I loved the terrace even though it rained a bit the room was quite nice and comfortable
177320,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Rooms are small but typical for Paris They were very well appointed however , The view from the 8th floor was fabulous go for a room with a balcony Lovely breakfast and the rooftop terrace was spectacular GREAT location 
177321,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The door to the shower isn t a full door just a swinging door but at least it is fully frosted so you have privacy Some of the English language channels were not working , Views of the Eiffel tower from our room and the roof were great Staff was very pleasant and we didn t have any issues getting a room right away we checked in around 7pm You can walk to everything from here 
177322,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The hotel breakfast is good quick and convenient but pricey if not included in the cost of the room , Great location for a tourist visiting the sights of Paris The Metro could not be closer and there are an abundance of restaurants in the area 
177323,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Breakfast was good but under staffed or managed as the food ran out very quickly and every day during my stay We had to wait a while before the food was replenished , Perfect location metro right outside area full of bars restaurants for the evening Close to the river Notre Dame The hotel was also very quiet and the beds extremely comfortable 
177324,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Service was very poor couldn t get drinks served on the rooftop and reception staff were not particularly friendly, Good location with great rooftop terrace
177325,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Breakfast could have been better Apart from that very good value for money , Excellent location by the Latin Quarter Standard room was comfortable although not spacious Service was good reasonable but not lavish breakfast 
177326,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Prices of drinks on rooftop bar were so expensive Only went there once Plants around balconies were dead so that could be rectified I am sure, Great location and view of Eiffel Tower in distance Can walk there but it s a long walk but very doable
177327,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Being woken up at 1 30 am on our last night by an evacuation alarm for no apparent reason , The location is excellent the staff very friendly helpful and the facilities very good 
177328,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Room size booked a queen leisure and got a standard room changed room but was it a queen leisure , Location to st michal they did change our room but only after we complained
177329,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Could have been more choice with the breakfast The lifts are a nightmare with one not going to all floors TV only showed news channels which gets boring, Rooftop bar was lovely if not a little small Decor nice and modern
177330,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Rooms r small but we really weren t there much except to sleep , The rooftop bar was terrific and the view to die for The staff were friendly and accommodating I would definitely stay there again if I ever get back to Paris The hotel is centrally located to e everything and the streets r full of life day and night 
177331,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame,No Negative, The Roof Top terrace is amazing and is for hotel guests only it is the best kept secret and gives an amazing view of the Eiffel Tower especially at night when it lights up on the hour 
177332,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The room was nice but the bathroom offered no privacy no bathroom should have a glass window looking into the main bedroom Wrong on every account , Location was excellent and perfect for our needs
177333,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame,No Negative, Room was compact but had everything you needed we had a queen room with Eiffel Tower view and it was simply stunning Worth the extra Bed was so comfy and shower was amazing Rooftop bar was a wonderful addition with stunning views of Paris Was in a perfect location to see all the sights Would definitely return

177335,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Should pay more attention to cleaning especially bedsheets and towels , Location was excellent rooftop bar had a great view and the staff was friendly
177336,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The bathroom was beautiful and shower wonderful but because the room was angled there were no shelves in bathroom to put toilet articles on Always had to reload them into my tote after every shower , We had an executive suite and we had a brilliant view of the Eiffel tower and an outside balcony The room was comfortable and roomy by Paris standards 
177337,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The room was a little small and the bathroom was very compact but was fine for our stay as we were out most of the time , The staff were friendly and helpful and location is excellent for St Michel Notre Dame etc 
177338,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Only thing missing was swimming pool facilities and rooms a little on the small side , Excellent location Lovely modern clean hotel Exactly what we needed and the balcony with views made the room 
177339,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, room was smallest I have ever stayed in and wasn t ready when we checked in at 4pm the room wasn t cleaned properly the first day no clean towels dirty cups left no tea coffee left the second day it wasn t even cleaned at all and the maid had dreadful BO , location excellent and the roof terrace was great
177340,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The rooms were a little small for the price and to get a third person in there we had to pay an additional 35 euro per night , We loved the location of the property in a great neighborhood with plenty to do right around there and walking distance to Pont des Arts Notre Dame and many other iconic sights The staff was awesome helped with making reservations and pointing us in the right direction for things There s also an amazing rooftop bar that we really enjoyed having drinks and taking in a beautiful view of the city from Would definitely recommend 
177341,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The room 416 was a very small double room I was on my own but if my husband and I had both been there we would not have fit There was only room for one case and pretty much standing room for just one person in the bathroom When I booked I booked for one person so this room may only be assigned to a single traveler , The location was great I was able to walk to most all the main tourist attractions The bed was extremely comfortable and they provided a good selection of pillows firm soft 
177342,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The tap is difficult to turn without a lever The decor is too garish with the carpet in magenta colour , I was glad we booked this hotel as there was a straight line from Gare du Nord to this hotel The room was cosy and comfortable with good shower facilities We had a good night sleep 
177343,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, the first 2 days for breakfast they couldn t give egg they said it is weekend they kept promising for the following day even if you don t have you should have topped up what you have until the breakfast time finished the lady during breakfast was understanding and nice though when we checked out reception was giving us false info that the blue RER was not working it was , excellent location cleanliness computer in lobby area with printer welcoming staff i would recommend this hotel I m sure it was a small mistake 
177344,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Glass pocket door to bathroom is plain dangerous sink overflows is too shallow no shelves to put anything modern touch in decor but NO thought to usefulness, Location and staff
177345,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, If I had to say something perhaps it would just be more toiletries in the bathroom , We were upgraded to a lovely Eiffel tower view room because it was my birthday very nice touch 
177346,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame,No Negative, My wife and I enjoyed a lot staying at this Hotel The rooms are a bit small but very clean and tidy The furniture practically looks new All the personal and staff very kind and prone to help us Perfect centric location in Paris close to St Michel metro station plenty of bars restaurants and even a supermarket Monoprix a few blocks away The breakfast surpassed our expectations Next time we visit Paris undoubtedly we ll return to this great place

177354,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Cleaning staff walked into the room twice without knocking We also paid over 300 more than our friends who booked similar dates on a 3 night stay Description of an executive king room was not appropriate for the size of room we had , Roof garden location

177383,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The advertisement talked about the awesome bar on the roof But there was no information in the room and no reference to it anywhere else Seemed like something you had to ask for maybe pay for We expected to be able to go up there and see the view , This was a great location Close to Notre Dame the Louvre the Eiffel tower The view from the balcony could have been better but we could see the Eiffel tower lit up 
177384,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, The Breakfast was very disappointing On any day there was not a full selection of items in particular the Hot Buffet section The Staff did not automatically check this and when asked to replenish the food they appeared surprised displaying a poor attitude which gave the impression they were doing you a favour rather than providing a Service A number of guests raised complaints with the Breakfast Staff during the period of our stay and there was a slight improvement on the final day following the completion of a Customer Satisfaction questionnaires , The location was really good
177385,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame,No Negative, The breakfast has Nespresso coffee and all premium quality products The room is comfortable very fashion and isolated from noise The location is very close to Notredame church and Louvre museum

177390,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, I rang the night before checkout to see if I could have my luggage bought down the next day on checkout and was informed I could but on actually check out day I was informed this was not possible and I was also told there was only one person on reception but there were actually two males who said they would have bought my luggage down if they had know Every other hotel I stayed in whilst in France this was never an issue Being a mature solo female some assistance would have been appreciated I also requested a small amount of milk to be used in my room but was told it would have to go on my bill through room service I don t believe that was necessary given the small quantity required Overall the service levels did vary greatly depending on the staff member All staff should be trained to the same level of customer service , Location was excellent Rooms were clean and the balcony was great for seeing the view Roof top bar a plus also for the view
177391,Holiday Inn Paris Notre Dame, Water built up in shower base and would not drain away quickly enough Had to turn off tap to let it drain mid shower or the floor would flood Cocktails on roof were quite expensive , Liked the shower fixtures and the water pressure Roof top bar and wonderful views of Paris Helpful staff
