130790,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, An old wobbly armchair was said to be a bed for our little girl And others amenities were in poor condition It s a pity the place could be pleasant as there s a lovely terrace and it s an ancient charming building , The location of the hotel

130795,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Extremly small room was in the basement of the building Nothing at all to see from the windows The Air condition did not work during the whole stay extremly hot in the room The check in out times were horrible we couldnt check in before 2pm and had to check out 10 30AM No minibar fridge Expensive not worth the money , Good breakfast and clean bathroom Free wi fi 
130796,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The breakfast room was small and packed but worst thing was air conditioning in room did not work despite being assured we would have it and maintenance looking at it , The staff were helpful and friendly
130797,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The single room was too small you couldn t plug in your chargers or appliances as the plugs were hidden at the back of a fitted unit next to bed I performed contornists moves to plug In the fan there was also a glass top that overhung the unit which caught on your leg getting in and out of bed The breakfast room was too small for the number of people using it,No Positive
130798,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, After I got some yogurt and fruits and finished them the nice staff brought me toasts and asked me about what I would like for my breakfast It s delicious sufficient 
130799,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was very small and on the main road As it was warm the window needed to be open and the road noise was very intrusive all night , Staff were helpful as wanted breakfast before the official stat time
130800,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Rooms overall cleanliness concierge not knowing what rooms they have staff not being very friendly lack of business facilities or any facilities beyond rooms and the breakfast bar Far from a good hotel experience 4 , Location management reacted well on a complaint
130801,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, small single room is a cupboard and the bathroom is a cupboard in the cupboard no other way to fill kettle but in the shower the washbasin too small only way to open suitcase is on the bed the whole thing is ridiculous , the locationh
130802,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Frankly an appauling room The single bed only just fit in front of the window Extremely Noisy all night Very hot even though it had a fan which i had to leave on all night Pillow wasnt particularly comfortable either I can live with a small room as its central london but it wasnt that hot a day so the room must suffer from a problem with the heat hence the fan and the noise from the street is just shocking One of the worst nights I have ever had in a hotel ,No Positive
130803,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The cold water didn t work they never fixed it Read the fine print carefully there was no air conditioning just a fan which I had to point at myself to keep myself cool throughout the night The room was pretty small I liked that they had a tea kettle but it was too hot to use it , Internet worked really well Shower had good stream and lots of hot water Breakfast was pretty good 
130804,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The bed wasn t big enough for a 195cm tall person and the mattress wasn t very comfy , Very pleasant and helpful staff good location working wifi 
130805,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Basement room blind didn t completely came down to cover window Window overlooked a walkway staff used Room wasn t cleaned well and was very dusty Only 2 electrical sockets and 1 didn t work , Location was very central And I am sure none basement rooms may of been quieter
130806,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, proper coffee for breakfast would have been good rather than just filter plus better sliced bread other than the cheapest white sliced for toast Rooms were a little small but go with the age and layout of the buildings , quiet room at back of hotel the fact it wasn t a high rise hotel free wifi
130807,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, dirty no air conditioning rude staff shabby decor noisy smelled dirty unhelpful reception , Nothing only attribute is the proximity to access to fairly central London 
130808,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Small double room seemed more like a student sized halls of residence with ensuite squeezed in It was a very hot day so the window was open but the blind and the window were very dusty, Great central location for a London visit with lots of very good restaurants and bars in the side streets and 2 minutes from the British museum luggage holding after check out was a very efficient tagged system
130809,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It was 30 degrees when we arrived at the hotel and the air conditioning in the room didn t work As this was the reason we booked this hotel we were very disappointed I went to reception twice to ask about it but on both occasions there was nobody there We spent the night very hot and sweaty and didn t get much sleep Not what I expect for 175 pounds per night After reading the instruction chart on the room wall it appeared that the system was being over ridden by a central control We were not happy at all , Good location Tube station is a 5 minute walk and can get you into Leicester Square within 2 stops Breakfast was basic but nice 
130810,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, I loved the view out the window over the garden The room was tiny which I had expected but comfy and the wifi worked seamlessly Breakfast was hearty and and served with a smile 
130811,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was very hot air con did not work properly hence the extra electric fan in room Bacon at breakfast extremely over cooked each morning inedible Duvet on bed filthy , Good location Room was quiet 
130812,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The mattress was bumpy without a matress protector just a sheet The windows looked like they had not been cleaned in years Extractor fan was not walking in the shower Power sockets difficult to reach , Proximity to where I needed to be the following day Good breakfast 
130813,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The garden area could have done with a bit of a spruce up , Great location very near to British Museum and just a short walk to Oxford Street The room was very quiet and overlooked the garden area The reception staff were very friendly 
130814,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was small with no desk or place to work, The hotel is close to Euston Station and the Northern line and easy walking distance to many attractions 
130815,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room far from clean air conditioning was a fan full of dust fire alarm flashed bright green lighting up the whole room in the night got there to discover no lift and no other staff member to help take the bags as my partner is awaiting surgery had to struggle between us Staff serving food in flip flops and leggings most certainly not 4 stars I would say 3 and pushing it , The location was perfect for sight seeing breakfast was fine
130816,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Access to electric outlets is very difficult there is no overhead lighting near the bed and no real place to put toiletries in the bathroom It was difficult to control the temperature in the room and only a duvet was available as a cover not exactly the sort of thing most people want when on a warm evening in a warm room , Excellent location for where I needed to be 
130817,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed very uncomfortable and the same with the pillows The towels in bathroom are in need of renewal very hard and discolered The breakfast room is downstairs there are no elevators serving any floor of this building we were fortunate to have a room on the first floor Anyone with mobility issues like myself will experience difficulty There are no bar facilities on the premises This accommodation in my opinion has been wrongfully classed as a hotel I feel this should have been classed as a Guest House , Excellent breakfast menu In room safe Good powerful shower 
130818,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There should be somewhere clear that tells you how the lights work with the key card or the receptionist could mention it when you check in , I liked the design of the rooms the friendly staff and the good cooked breakfast on the morning The single rooms are very small but very clean and functional for a short break The ensuite is well designed 
130819,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room allocated next to breakfast room so noise and smells from just after 4am No ventilation as window didn t open , Not much really it was in ok position but nothing much more than that 
130820,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, 1 I requested a ground floor or first floor room due to mobility problems When we arrived we were told our room was on the third floor There is no lift We were then offered a room in the basement which was small the bed was small the wardrobe was small the bathroom was in a closet 2 The following morning we went for breakfast at approx 9 15am We were told without apology that breakfast finished at 9 00am It was not possible to get coffee juice toast we were told to make coffee in our room 3 My husband fell out of the bed during the night He is used to a normal sized double bed 4 Staff did not care This was supposed to be a 4 star hotel and I would rate it as a 2 star We will certainly not stay there again , There was nothing to like other than the location We previously stayed at an adjacent hotel so we knew the area well 
130821,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was ridiculously small and had no air conditioning I banged my tooth on the kettle trying to plug in my phone charger as the socket was really inaccessible , Location 
130822,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, the room first night the room was horrible they gave us room that is not the same from the site It was downstairs there is no air conditioning no wardrobe as described on the site The room was too small and short We could not sleep because of the heat and there was only one small window which is not enough In the morning they changed the room again not from the picture I could not recommended , location
130823,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The building facade gave a complete misrepresentation of the property inside Three floors with narrow staircase and no lift What staff there were not overly helpful and showed little enthusiasm The breakfast room was minute and basically in the cellar with poor ventilation The kitchen was a small room in the cellar and the smell of the cooking was transposed throughout the building the juice fruit and milk containers we re placed tightly together on top of a cupboard along with coffee warming machine The breakfast was not attractive and everything was swimming in grease The bedroom on the third floor was in need of a good spring clean the nets were filthy the floor sloped from one corner to the opposite wall Overall not worthy of 2 stars at the most definitely not 4 star as advertised, The location was the only positive part of the hotel 
130824,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The extra small room gets so hot in the summer No air con and a tiny fan that wasn t high enough to reach me was terrible , Great location Right next to public transport and welcoming staff Clean rooms and complementary breakfast is good 
130825,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The price was too much for the standard of the hotel The bed was very hard and uncomfortable Breakfast was ok bacon was like rubber overall not impressed, The location to the theatre
130826,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very dusty small and cramped single room Overpriced by any western standards I understand that people will always book a room in Bloomsbury for what APPEARS to be a low price compared with the service but at least try to invest on the atmosphere The name and the photos of the ad are really misleading I can only suggest this place as an extreme emergency situation but I really believe even a youth hostel would be more charming and equipped , General niceness of stuff although one had the impression these days it s more important to be fluent in Russian than in English at London s hotels lobbies The bathroom was surprisingly ok and clean although small and with very low quality towels 
130827,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lock on the door An airco that only runs for 120 minhtes 30 celcius that week Broken blinds Still charge 150 euro per night for 1 person Yet another hotel via Booking which doesn t bring what the website suggests , Location Clean room 
130828,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The air con was not working until 5 in the evening and was about as good as an asmatic cat And as the room was on the top floor we were sweeting before we got to our room , The staff did all they could to help but the problems were out of there control 
130829,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The rooms paint was a little tired but I believe the hotel are refreshing the rooms as we speak They were clean though , The hotel left some flowers and a bottle of Prosecco for my girlfriends 50th birthday A really nice touch thank you I will drop them a thank you message when I get a mo as I appreciated it I would stay again Breakfast was good too and the rooms very quiet 
130830,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No Aircon 0r it was not working Very noisy as aircon units just outside of room and could not have window open as very noisy Very hot in London circa 30deg plus band the romm and rset of hotel felt like it , Breakfast
130831,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was very hot with ineffective or non existent air conditioning Very uncomfortable for sleeping with temps reaching 30 Celsius during our stay , Location was Great 
130832,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Basic functions if you travel alone with huge suitcases it will be a good chance to excesize because there is no porter to help you with luggage and there is no elevators in this hotel Single room is the smallest I ve ever seen Smaller than Japanese hotels even And no air con in the room , Staff is friendly Breakfast is good 
130833,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I knew it was to be a small room but I could never ever imagine that the room was to be THAT small beyond joking it really was about 2x2 sqm It might have been perfect for a hobbit or a half man but it doesn t seem to be of a proper size for a human I also had to share this room with a spider on the ceiling but anyway it s summer and that poor creature didn t take much space The room has a bed if you re taller than 1 75m you may find it too small for you a table with tea coffee biscuits a cup a kettle an extremely small space for a shower toilet however there s just no place to drop one s luggage If you have just a laptop with you probably it s not a big problem but if you have a bag with your belongings the only place to put it is on the floor and either you aren t able to open the bathroom or you re not able to open the entrance door If you have a suite you need to keep fresh and ironed over the night there s no chance to do so in this room , Very friendly and helpful staff and tasty breakfast As for the hotel itself it has pretty good location and it s quite easy to find the property 
130834,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was a little snug I mean my dogs kennel was bigger than this 1 5 meters x 6 meters with the double bed with it s brown stained duvet squeezed in at the end There was no bar so just a B B really, Breakfast was really good
130835,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed was broken Room was microscopic Breakfast staff all dressed as if they d just come out of a fitness session and you had to stand around for a good few minutes before being noticed with one customer having to ask if he could be seated It s not like they were stupidly busy they were just pottering about and largely inattentive ,No Positive
130836,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Single room incredibily small Just bed and you Noisy and hot No ventilation No fridge Rather B B standard not a hotel , Staff very nice and helpfull
130837,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The Wifi didn t connect There was no lift I didn t like the fact that the Breakfast room was on the basement floor it made it feel a bit Claustrophobic None of these are big issues for me just my thoughts , The room was very comfortable and clean including a fan which was needed while the weather was so hot The shower was great 
130838,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Single room is too small there is not even a chair in the room The room is very noisy as the road there is through the window many cars and public transport This is very bad for sleep , Good location within walking distance to the main Londons attractions To the metro by foot can go no more than 7 minutes Good English classic breakfast fried or scrambled eggs fried tomatoes mushrooms beans There are fruits coffee juice yogurt All tasty and fresh Attentive friendly staff 
130839,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The hotel would make a lot of guests happy if they sold cold drinks in the reception, Location location location Five minutes walk from Goodge Street station Northern Line five minutes walk to British Museum and ten minutes walk to Seven Dials and Covent Garden with all it s shopping shows and restaurants 
130840,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I fall in the room when getting out the bathroom because had to step down 15 cm and the floor was very smooth and nothing to hold to After this incident an extra bathcloth from the hotel helped , Great location Small room but all facilities Friendly staff and good service 
130841,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Noisy due to the street and bad windows Doors making too much noise when closing My room was too tiny even nothing for putting my clothes It was cold and I did not manage to set the heater or it was simply not working The bed sheet at one day was dirty At breakfast the coffee was quite bad and never ready at 7 30 , The shower was very good
130842,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, See above Double bed in room GL3 was far too narrow for a couple My partner had to sleep in the single bed Lucky we had a triple What would he have done otherwise , Modern room is nice But bed far too small and narrow for a couple Meaning my partner had to sleep in the other bed Lucky we had a triple
130843,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Traffic ruined my sleep That us the number one necessity of booking a hotel room The hotel staff knew that the window is not double glazed and yet I was put into the room The breakfast was like a factory production line I shall not book the hotel again , I like some of the staff who did their best 
130844,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Do not under any circumstances book the small single room this is room G2 This is literally a store cupboard with a short bed crammed into the corner and a tiny wet cell for a bathroom I m not the tallest person 5 5 165cm but the bed in this room was far too short even for me I also had to move it away from the wall a little bit as this is an outside wall mostly of the wall is a drafty window actually and as a result absolutely freezing Even with the bed nudged away from the wall I still woke up with a raging headache as there was a draft from the window all night and any part of me that was not covered by the duvet was cold and damp This house would also do well with stocking up on WD 40 The door hinges creak squeak and whine rather loudly Something that being in room G2 you will not be able to avoid witnessing The room is adjacent to the door leading to the breakfast room and for some reason someone kept going in and out of it until 2 30am and then again from around 6 30am onwards It doesn t take a genius to work out how much sleep I actually got With the room also being under the stairs definitely not in a cute way like in Harry Potter and just opposite the hotel entrance you will hear all the comings and goings no matter how quiet the minority of people try to be If it s not their footsteps or voices waking keeping you up it will be the squeaky doors As for the bathroom I was amazed at the outstanding water pressure of the hand held shower head Unfortunately the physical size of the actual shower can t quite cope with the masses of water shooting out of the shower head so you will be flooding the bathroom even if you re conscious of it and try had to avoid it Consequently you ll be flooding the bedroom too so make sure to move everything off the little floor space there is around the bed before you attempt to shower , The location of this hotel is relatively convenient if you re just looking for somewhere to put your head for a few hours after a night out Make sure to either take earplugs or get blind drunk before turning in though 
130845,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was quite small for 2 adults and 1 child The room was in basement so there was no view available from the room The breakfast was available only for 1 30 hours from 7 30am For those on leisure holidays with children find it too less a time Secondly there were not many options to order for breakfast We got the room after 2 00pm despite requesting for an early checkin ,No Positive
130846,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The bed bugs in my room and the absence of reaction from the hotel management The noise from the streets , The place was conveniently close to our professional meeting location The hotel staff is friendly 
130847,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was too small Reception wasn t clean , There were none And when the coffee ran out the staff didn t want to replace it I had to ask twice 
130848,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Size of single room no aircon window did not open not very clean breakfast very poor and staff at breakfast unfriendly and not helpful, Friendly staff at reception
130849,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Regarding my particular room it DID have an en suite bathroom but it was so small that I could barely turn in the bathroom which didn t bother me but could bother someone more claustrophobic My room was on the first floor at the back with a direct door to the garden awesome so it was relatively quiet However the room is right next to the stairs to the breakfast area so in the morning there was noise and the room smelled of food , Smallest room I ve ever been in it s like I m in Harry Potter s closet under the staircase That being said this place is just what you need for a short short notice trip to Central London on a budget my room was 75 Breakfast is also included and it s a pretty good one too full English so that s another 5 10 value right there Overall I m happy 
130850,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Short staffed on first day felt sorry for the ladies Was very busy , Breakfast was freshly cooked bit short staffed first morning Second morning was fine 
130851,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room is small as expected However there is neither a chair nor a stool to sit on Only the bed There is no ventilation in the room but they did provide a fan The fan had a 2 hour time limit I d wake up every two hours or so feeling very warm and then turn the fan on again There is no place to put your items when you unpack There are ample electrical connections but they are hard to access Make sure to bring the bulky plug converters that are needed to use US plugs in the British receptacles , Good convenient location WiFi worked well 
130852,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The breakfast which they advertise is included is very narrow in options Also even though they say it ends at 9 00 during weekdays they were starting to clean up at 8 15 There was NO COFFEE which is I think the least you can provide in any breakfast I had selected a table and after standing up for grabbing a fruit I came back to my table to find that the toast I was about to eat had already been taken away I stood up for less than 1 minute ,No Positive
130853,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny bit more space in room would have been a bonus , Historical location close to all the action Could walk everywhere or get bus easily Felt safe travelling on my own Lovely staff and breakfast Very clean and great value for money 
130854,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The noise was the worst room gave onto a busy 3 lane road with poor sound insulation so it was continually noisy The room was tiny No table of any kind for a laptop or eating anything No fridge A single bed with a narrow space to one side of it so narrow I struggled to get my clothes in and out my modest sized suitcase The bathroom was very tiny miniscule washbasin with almost no space for toiletries 2 small towels with a small peg on the door There was no aircon but a fan was provided , Close to the West end and the location of my seminar 
130855,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Dirty room No air conditioning and no windows that opened Tiny rooms Far too small for comfort Would have moved hotels if for the fact that I would have lost my money , Lovely staff
130856,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The hotel room It was tiny The bedside table glass cover was dirty with finger prints of another person The roman blinds looked dirty and were dusty The images online made the rooms look modern clean and spacious , The cooked breakfast 
130857,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Just one little point breakfast time from Monday till Saturday was till 9 00 and on Sunday till 9 30 only Coming for the weekend trip to London it was a little bit too short till 9 00 or till 9 30 I expected breakfast time at least till 10 00 and didn t notice that info though there was a notice of that in the room and on Saturday we were late at 9 18 and just had a short time to get cornflakes Even the tea was not available And when I have asked a lady to give me 2 black tea bags she told me it is not possible too late after I insisted she with a very unfriendly face opened a cupboard and gave me 2 tea bags That was my only negative comment about that hotel All the rest was great and a very good value for money , Room was very well equipped with all the modern appliances and clean Reasonable room size I was with my little daughter and booked a single room but have written to the hotel that we will be 2 It was very nice of them to provide me a room with double bed for the same price It was good to have an English breakfast included in the room price 
130858,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Net curtains didn t look clean I couldn t get the room to go cool and I couldn t open the window , Cosy attic room for 1 on the top floor I felt very safe 
130859,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was to cater for 3 people unfortunately our 3rd couldnt make it but if they had we wouldnt be able to move in the room Would have been nice to have a fridge , The location is brilliant making it easy to get to places that we needed to 
130860,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Extremely small room for a 4 star Not exactly 4 star 2 3 will be more appropriate No wardrobe at all so most of the room floor was occupied with my luggage Breakfast is ok but bacon was like a shoe sole Garden has a non used potential , Location clean bathroom
130861,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, Excellent service They went extra mile to give us the fan in hot weather of London We arrived early but the room was ready and they let us have the early check in 
130862,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bathroom was a little too small, Bathroom was small but you get what you pay for Also dont ask them to call you a taxi They have some people called city ryders they call and their price is absurd to take you to airport 
130863,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, breakfast was okay and breakfast service was poor too short staffed and not polite we had no welcome when we arrived we had to wait on the stair well for 15 minutes with 5 other people to be seated as there were not enough tables to cater for the amount of people just 20 minutes before breakfast was over at 9 pm which we felt was a little early for the weekend Not a word was spoken to us by the waitresses apart from when we were seated English breakfast and scrambled egg or fried manners and politeness cost nothing , comfy bed nice shower clean and tidy
130864,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There was only enough for one cup or tea in the room There was also only one large towel available and not enough toilet roll The breakfast room was very hot and crowded Hotel in general was very warm, Enjoyable breakfast Comfortable and clean room Great location to either walk into central or underground very near by Friendly staff It is a good hotel for the price 
130865,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, Really enjoyed staying at this hotel warm very modern shower great so was the TV bed very comfortable and only 10 minutes from the dominion theatre and Oxford street would definitely visit again
130866,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The clump of hair on my pillow when I got to my room The thick layer of dust on the curtain which prevented me from dropping the blinds for fear of my lungs , When I checked out 
130867,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room too small Just enough room for 1 person bed and my suitecase opened on the floor The abundance of space caused the temperature to go skyhigh This cupboard extended with window shouldn t have been for rent in the first place , Leaving the hotel 
130868,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Air conditioning didn t seem to cool the room down Hotel room was quite small and breakfast room was even smaller , Just a short walk away from the New London Theatre and other attractions Breakfast was cooked fresh and made to order 
130869,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Even though I got a small room I didn t expect it to be that tiny room was relatively clean however there was a lot of dust on the blinds which made my allergies act up , Location is excellent good for a short stay Good value for money
130870,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location in walking distance from oxford street regent street Very close to the British Museum and Goodge metro station Full english breakfast nice staff and very good prices for central London 
130871,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We were not able to lock the door from inside I asked but they said there is nothing they can do about it The reason being is that the building is old Our room was in the basement I did not feel secure at all Also there were no towels in the room , Near by Kings Cross station You can pretty much walk to all those tourist spots 
130872,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No porridge in breakfast, Enjoyed the hot breakfast and selection room cozy and complete with amenities appreciated being able to have hot tea coffee shortbread cookie Staff professional in its concierge duties
130873,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Too much noise from the street the window was not efficient The WIFI was not always aivalable The room was too small no table no chair , The location near the British Museum and Soho
130874,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Service at breakfast unclear Poor communication from staff No menu so unsure of options Very compact room Short bed especially is over 5ft 10, Free WiFi and decent breakfast on offer More than enough coffee and biscuits in room Clean
130875,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Incredible key of the room did not work many times towel was dirty really noisy if i could choose between car and this hotel i would choose car, nothing
130876,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Our room was on the second floor so it was a bit difficult carrying cases as there was no lift Bathroom needed a towel rail or hook as nowhere to hang used towel The mattress on the foldable bed for the third guest was extremely soft , Good location and great breakfast Very clean Very good value for money The complimentary tea and coffee tray was a welcome bonus 
130877,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed settee very lumpy and uncomfortable Had to wait for twenty five minutes by the door for breakfast as the restaurant full Staff were unfriendly with no apologies , Location
130878,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I stayed at the property before and room on 1st floor was ok On this occasion I got a small room on ground floor The room needs updating paint marks on walls and door frames worn flooring broken step to toilet drafty window it was incredibly noise as you could hear everyone talking as they entered the hotel every step on main stairs resonates in the room Pity the back garden door with access from this room is a mess with brambles and broken chair this could be a beautiful feature , Really friendly staff both reception and breakfast room 
130879,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bedrooms so small No indication of this in hotel information No air conditioning supplied with 3 fans which reflects the temperature of the room Breakfast room good but again far too small for the number of guests Bit of an uncomfortable stay , Location easy access to Underground
130880,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It was incredibly noisy The room was next to an open kitchen on one side and breakfast room on the other From 6 45am it was impossible to sleep and it smelt of cooking smells ,No Positive
130881,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Paint was peeling Building could use some cosmetic work Room was much smaller than expected Not much room for luggage other than beneath the bed , The proximity to the tube and neighborhood was great Easy to get anywhere in London Felt safe walking alone at night 25yo female 
130882,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We were in a room near the breakfast room Staff were speaking so loud at 6 30 in the morning that it woke us up Also the noise of guests and crockery was loud so we didn t get much sleep This room should not be used as a bedroom as it s far too close to the dining area Altogether very disappointed with our stay and bad value for money , The location
130883,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The noises from outside every night ambulance and emergency vehicles annoying noises disturbs sleep , Amazing location reasonable price friendly staff 
130884,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The rooms are small but for the price I would say if you expect anything better then you re beyond stingy spend more money and go 5 star , I love the extra friendly staff here it s why I went back and why I probably will again That and the massive shower heads 
130885,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, People with small children or those with reduced mobility have no lift Dining area small although we quickly found a table and were soon served , It was efficiently run and the facilities more than served our purpose meeting up with family in Covent Garden Half way between Euston and Covent garden with British Museum minutes away and quite a few bars and cafes and shops some greenery around and quiet places to sit Decorating was recent and a good selection was offered at breakfast plenty of towels and very clean bed linen There was no noise at night no disturbances A room at the back of the hotel gave us a very peaceful night 
130886,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, They put us in basement room next to kitchen and dining room Very noisy Also started decorating whilst we were there didn t tell us got paint on my jacket I complained 3 times and the manager was never available always in a meeting , Near to places we wanted to visit
130887,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Both the room and en suite were tiny I booked a single room perhaps this was a small single The Breakfast room on the lower ground floor was busy and quite tight for space too , Excellent location within walking distance from Euston Station and Theatreland Comfortable bed good shower and widescreen TV all helped This was the best price I could find in the Bloomsbury area Would book again 
130888,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Struttura molto sporca La camera non corrispondeva affatto alle foto Ci hanno messo in cantina Camera estremamente umida dopo aver protestato ce l hanno cambiata La sala per la colazione nel seminterrato e insufficiente per il numero di ospiti La qualit del cibo scadente, Solo la posizione
130889,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I requested a room no higher than the third floor On arrival was cheerfully advised that my room was on the fourth floor as I d asked no lift narrow staircase filthy net curtains tatty bathroom , It was easy walking distance to UCL and the train station 
130890,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room I stayed in was on the ground floor right next to the road which was quite noisy at night and woke me up a few times Consider asking for a room that is set back from the road for a better night s sleep , Good location and reasonable price for central London 
130891,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Single room is too small no luxury Nobody to help with your luggage to the second floor You just pay for the location nothing else Only suitable for short stay, Location is really good but it is the only advantage for this hotel Breakfast is fine as well
130892,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Rooms for singles are at the front of building right on a very busy noisey road The first room I had was unbearable the second was still really noisey , The breakfast and bathroom 
130893,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Probably the smallest room I have ever booked I could not open my suitcase in a way where I would not have to jump over it when going to the bathroom , Properly cooked breakfast individual to each guest Walking distance from Euston and Esuton Square buses not he street going directly to West End 
130894,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, This is 4 star hotel and it is absolutely not Chipped and dirty walls old furniture very small double bed poor wifi connection and speed All the aspects together fit better to 2 star hotel 
130895,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Our room was small and had a double bed the size of which was 4 6 Not the best nights sleep was disappointed bed should be at least 5ft Ensuite area was small , Full English breakfast was included and was of a good standard Staff friendly Good to see tea making facilities in our room Albeit the shower was small it was lovely modern and hot 
130896,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Single room just had room for a bed but given prices in London I think it was reasonable value for money I would stay here again , Staff good and bathroom though small had a good shower and was newly fitted Good TV too Breakfasts were good too freshly cooked and a good selection of cereals etc 
130897,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It is cramped and rooms facing Gower Street are very noisy with insufficient glazing protection , It is a useful good value hotel in a handy location for transport and a good range of services and activities 
130898,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The breakfast room was quite small and very warm but not surprised when old fashioned building and doing the best with what they have got , Ideal location for what we needed it for Clean and tidy modern room with a nice shower Was taking my wife to theatre and told hotel and was surprised with champagne and chocolate on arrival What a nice and would use this hotel again 
130899,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was extremely hot Had air con but too noisy to sleep Mattresses were very hard, Great location Staff very helpful Made the room lovely for my daughter s 21st The price for the location was very good A basic hotel no frills but ticks the boxes 
130900,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We had two adjoining rooms for 3 one with a double bed and the other with a put u up which was very low and very uncomfortable The room with the double bed had side tables attached to the headboard the bed a TV on the wall and nothing else The rooms would benefit from some storage one hook and two hangers for 3 of us and somewhere to put things Very basic, The location is good and the place was clean
130901,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The only disappointment was that there was no lift , The receptionist was very chatty and extremely helpful especially with her local knowledge of the area 
130902,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Our bed sloped downwards on 1 side Could do with a menu on the breakfast tables to know what was on offer The meat on the full English could be a bit more generous 1 slice of bacon and 1 small sausage, The room was well presented and clean The bathroom was also clean and modern The staff were friendly and helpful and always had a smile on their face 
130903,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The brown carpet and window frames need updating It needs to keep up with the hotel 2 doors down with its standards and decor Other guests need to be mindful of not slamming the doors at night perhaps reception should mention this during check in The receptionist had a welcoming smile unlike the staff at breakfast I m aware its early but please smile and acknowledge your guests , The veggie breakfast was lovely and lots of it Served hot which is always a bonus Ample room on the 3rd floor we didn t mind claiming the stairs The bathroom was small but very modern and clean they need to put a hook on the door as there wasn t anywhere to hang your towel A very convenient one night stay in a central location 
130904,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Teeny tiny room marginally bigger than the small single bed Third floor with no lift ok for me but won t suit all Teabag in the room was stale and discoloured, location was good And they had a room when all else seemed to be full
130905,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room we had was tiny and the bed was squashed in a corner up against the window a double bed but not much bigger than a single and a tight squeeze for two The bathroom tap was loose so we couldn t really use it but other than that it was Ok , The Staff were amazingly friendly and helpful certainly can t fault them on that The location was also great about a 5 min walk to the start of Oxford Street and just enough out of the hustle to be pretty quiet and relaxed 
130906,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny rool It was like a cabinet with a bed and a tiny toilet Couldnt even dress properly for the lack os space Breakfast time until 9 on monday so early Check out also very early at 10 30, Location
130907,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very very very small room which must have previously been an entrance given that on the back of the bed there was a door No closet no space for the suitcase Very small toilet ,No Positive
130908,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room too small with shower cubicle akin to those in some Tokyo hotels leaving no room for one to soap himself , Introduce boiled eggs and more fruits as English breakfast is very unhealthy with high sodium and cholesterol if taken every day
130909,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Single rooms are exceptionally small very hot in February and Windows that can t be opened Queue to be seated for breakfast , Location close to Euston station about 10mins walk 
130910,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, i stayed in room G2 effectively it was a porch that had been converted into the smallest room i have ever been in Bed wasn t even a full sized single More doors and windows than walls Must have been next to vent from kitchen as woke up to the smells of a greasy breakfast,No Positive
130911,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Was put in an underground room like a prison Window overlooks the laundry Only one electricity socket next to the door so use an ironing board you have to stands stuck to the door No curtain on the window A man arrived an hour after I checked in 2pm to fix the curtain when I wanted to have some me rest,No Positive
130912,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Shower smelt like smoke not sure why Also outside our window was an abandoned sofa and a ladder Bit odd Shampoo shower gel was pretty poor left my boyfriends hair feeling gross , Nice room good location comfy bed
130913,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I am not even five foot tall and my arms reached the sides of the room when stretched the room really is a very small single However it is London and it s still worth it if you can fit , Location was excellent Good price and easy check in 
130914,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed was broken Mattress severely sloped to one side v bad nights sleep Offered 15 discount on next stay Not enough to compensate for the pain it caused the next day V small breakfast room and so was breakfast , Relatively close to walk into central London Staff were friendly Room was quite spacious and clean 
130915,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, the room was rather cramped with the sofa bed being used, the breakfast was excellent Set us up for the whole day The shower and toilet were well appointed and spotlessly clean 
130916,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Spotty wifi drafty space heater provided breakfast ended too early and I ll say it again the room was Lilliputian It s not possible to open the bathroom or main door if your suitcase is on the floor , I got to experience a page right out of English Literature Unfortunately it was as the giant in Gulliver s Travels The single room is TINY 
130917,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was so hot ridiculously hot Windows wide open partly do do with the window arm being snapped off this did not circulate any air So restless night sleep Staff at breakfast where snapping and rude Breakfast room was so small you could barely swing your arm let alone a cat , It was in the most convenient place Lovely part of London easy access to shopping bars and restaurants 
130918,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room and bathroom were REALLY tiny but acceptable for the price in central London if you are out all day and just use the room for sleeping , Really lovely staff Very good breakfast cooked to order scrambled eggs were best I have had in a hotel including Hilton s 
130919,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room in lower ground floor meant no windows Imagine it would get very stuffy in summer season There was dust everywhere Previous occupants even wrote CLEAN ME in the dust clearly the cleaners haven t noticed but I saw it instantly The cushions placed on bed were stinking so the smell transferred on the pillows Net curtains and shower curtain needs a good clean too , Breakfast was lovely and staff friendly Nice quiet room 
130920,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was very small and claustrophobic I felt like Harry Potter under the stairs The room was on the stairs and guest were standing on the landing talking outside me door Bed was hard no room to hang anything up Wifi non existent Shower room was tiny I could hardly turn around in the shower without hurting myself on shower sticking out couldn t sit on the loo properly as the pipes for the sick get in the way I had to wait 20 mins for a table in the small breakfast room again couldn t walk around without squeezing past chairs tables When finally seated I waited another 10 mins before being asked what I wanted for breakfast The sausages had a bad after taste , Room was clean and modern with tea coffee making facilities and large flat screen TV 
130921,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, My blind in my room didn t work and my window did not shut there was a safety window in front so it wasn t cold but it was very noisy I understand it was central so a busy road but if the window shut I m sure it would have been quieter Also they say there is a place to leave luggage after check out if your not leaving until later it s just next to the reception desk no private room and no luggage tickets you just leave it there under your own will which is not stated I paid and left it safely at kings cross , The location was fantastic very central 
130922,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I had a single room which was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in it was ridiculous Thankfully only needed it 8pm until 8am There wasn t anything to hang clothes on apart from the door handle No wardrobe There wasn t any room to put my case apart from on the floor next to the bed which meant jumping over it to get to either the door or bathroom only one step would mean you were at both There was some form of sealed external door behind the bed which presumably used to go outside which meant there was a draft at the head of the bed This meant changing and sleeping at the other end of the bed The bathroom layout which meant if you were unfortunate enough to have to sit on the toilet you would also have to watch out for hitting your head on the sink The hotel itself seemed fine The single room unfortunately itself was the size of a cupboard and I definitely wouldn t recommend ,No Positive
130923,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No hot water in the morning told receptionist they said they will sort it out so we decided to go down for breakfast but there was no room so had to go back to hotel room and wait while waiting they said water is back working but ours was not so tried again to go down for breakfast still no room or hot water and then it was was time to leave so we wasn t very happy as we had our child with us , good location tube station around the corner Nice staff Room ok Quite hotel good for families Someone always on reception willing to help
130924,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Small room but not a problem, Good basic hotel in great location Walking distance to oxford street and British museum Comfy bed Good shower Tasty breakfast Would book again
130925,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Loo could have done with some bleach around the rim , Central location but on a quiet street Comfortable bed plenty of tea and coffee and biscuits 
130926,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Being woken up at 4 30 5am by staff preparing breakfast and talking very loudly outside of my room I had to tell them to be quiet , Room was spacious and well decorated 
130927,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We waited a good 5 mins at reception with no one there despite ringing the bell 3 times My room G2 was a cabin I could touch the walls with my arms outstretched I m just under 6 foot tall My feet were hanging off the bottom of the bed my head almost touched the shower head The view outside was of some old sofas and an aluminium ladder dumped outside It was right next to the extractor fans so I was woken by those starting at 0700hrs and then everyone having to walk past my door to get downstairs to the breakfast room I know the rate is only 75 night but these days that can get you a decent Premier Inn Not impressed , Breakfast was nice but cramped and busy 
130928,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The full English was cold The coffee was stewed where it had been standing, Everything was ok accept the full English breakfast was cold and the coffee was stewed
130929,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed was small but was fine for one night Bathroom was also small and tap didn t work properly but had a great shower , Location was great for theatre and shops Breakfast provided had a selection of cereal and a fry up Could leave your luggage all day but just in reception area on show 
130930,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I got lost one night had to ring the hotel to find out what bus to get back to the hotel as the tube had stopped but the receptionist didn t know The shower temperature was piping hot a little to hot for comfort didn t seem to change no matter which way i twisted the temperature knob the bathroom was small and compact but acceptable , The bloomsbury palce was a short walk away from goodge tube stop The staff were friendly The room and bathroom were clean and tidy Breakfast was served quickly and tasted amazing Brew facilities in the room with biscuits was a good touch as well as the hair dryer which i forgot to pack I would return again 
130931,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We missed breakfast because it finished at 0930 a slightly later time would have been good but we have nothing that we didn t like and for the price it was excellent , In a very convenient location walking distance to both station and theatre Staff friendly and although the room was small the bed was comfortable and shower good which was all we needed for the one night 
130932,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Window wouldn t stay open for fresh air but there was a fan in the room that we used, COMFORTABLE BED ROOM CLEAN STAFF VERY WELCOMING EXCELLENT LOCATION FOR THEATRES GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY
130933,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The hotel is clean but scruffy from the dead flowers in the reception area to the marked walls and frayed carpets Outside our window was of a back yard of weeds and old sofas Staff were polite but not really friendly , Good central Location for British Museum Tube Soho hotel was quiet beds comfortable shower good and breakfast tasty and delivered quickly Good value for the location 
130934,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Small room cold dark Broken tap sink shower door didn t close properly Only one cup supplied for tea coffee second cup not available when asked , Breakfast 
130935,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The hotel decor is very worn and looking very tired Could do with a coat of paint and new interior accessories The breakfast was very poor Bacon was covered in oil and so was the plate the cooked breakfast was cold They served one breakfast then it was a 5 minute wait before the rest was served Not good at all,No Positive
130936,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Don t be put off by the small breakfast room get there early as the breakfast is lovely , 2nd stay at this hotel clean and staff are very friendly 
130937,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Cracked tiles in bathroom toilet could have been cleaner curtain hanging off rail in bedroom camp bed not very comfortable , Free wifi and convenient location
130938,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was in a poor state of repair I chose the normal single room and it was tiny so the small single room must be microscopic Most hotels of this price range give a bottle of water not here Window was broken meaning it was cold and road noise was terrible blind was also broken meaning morning light streamed in and it looked like it could fall down at any minute Breakfast may have been good but the breakfast room was so small that on both occasions I went down it was packed and getting a seat looked to be a good 10 minute wait Short time frame for serving breakfast too meant even going down at the start of service 7 30 was tight for getting to my work , Good location mid point between three tube lines I use Shower was good 
130939,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Nothing, Well located hotel lThis hotel is great value The room was warm and very clean The shower room was spotles The shower was powerful with never ending hot water The breakfast was plentiful 
130940,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast in the basement was unbearably hot and very busy so had to wait for table when in a hurry, Location and staff who were happy to help and print off required information etc 
130941,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The kitchen breakfast staff was unfriendly The room was literally tiny The bed size was non standard single It was suitable for young child really Need a headboard too , Receptionist was friendly The room seems clean but need some repair work

130943,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We were in a basement room on a busy road The traffic was really noisy all night The bathroom was tiny , It was close to Kings Cross Station the Phoenix Theatre and the British Museum 
130944,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Well I first booked a single room That room was too small had no desk and it was very noisy street noise were beyond imagination So I asked the hotel staff to locate me to another room so the did after the manager approval to a double room Which I think was a positive gesture of them , The double room are generally ok except the one in the basement as it is very close to the kitchen Their breakfast is very good perfectly cooked eggs fresh veggies and other stuff The staff are really friendly and the hotel location is perfect very close to goodge station Oxford st and the London school 
130945,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Multiple issues two examples 1 The lock on the door did not work so I had to push the bed up against the door in the night whilst I slept on it to make sure no one came in 2 On the Saturday afternoon I was there I came back in the middle of the day to be told I was not allowed in my room because members of staff were moving 3 large pieces of furniture through my room out into the garden my room had a door into the garden without gaining permission asking me if it was OK or even telling me this was going to happen When I asked if they could stop and carry out the moving of the furniture on Sunday morning after I had vacated the room because I was in a rush they refused and said they would only be a few more minutes another 15 minutes past They left my room full of dirty foot prints on the floor and had moved many of my personal items to get out of the other door , Sadly not one aspect of the hotel was even up to a satisfactory standard 
130946,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The single room is small almostthe bed will not fit in no chair nor even a proper place for the luggage 3rd floor 60 stairs no lift, Location breakfast and cost The bath room is good even size wise not as the rest of the room 
130947,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, room so small road outside noisy but in fairness i knew both these things before i booked the room breakfast very good, quality bed nice working modern bathroom
130948,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The tiny room that I stayed it was very hot and uncomfortable And the breakfast didn t have many options just a couple of cereals and coffee , Good location
130949,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Service was a bit informal bordering on awkward but still wasn t a big issue , Location was fantastic for where I needed to be On a really nice and quiet street too I ended up being in London and lost my place to stay because of a late train I booked this hotel around 15 minutes before I arrived at midnight and everything was ready for me upon arrival 
130950,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, What was there not to like , The staff were helpful and pleasant The room was clean tidy and had everything I wanted and needed and the breakfast was great
130951,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed bugs having to leave the hotel at 4am in the morning on the first night and walk to a sister hotel with mice and being charged for the horrific experience no sleep , The lady on reception tried to help but ultimately she was limited in her scope as her boss was sleeping 
130952,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast room was a little too small for all the people to eat at the same time , Price for this area of London was adequate plus the breakfast was really good and plenty I also liked the free coffee and tea cattle in the room 
130953,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was extremely small It was cold in the room as well The door in the room did not work very well Some members of staff were unwelcoming talking foreign language in front of me Others were very helpful Breakfast starts not until 7 30 which I can t comment on as I was unable to attend , Location is excellent proximity to train station restaurants and bars Price 
130954,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Just a little too small No space to put case in room Breakfast room packed so full with tables and chairs it was difficult to move round safely , Spotlessly clean at all times Staff work extremely hard and were friendly and helpful 
130955,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Front facing rooms still get a lot of traffic noise and the dining area was quite warm as its in the basement, Staff were very friendly room was quaint and cosy and clean tidy the cooked breakfast was nice 
130956,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The bed and sofa bed were exceedingly uncomfortable The sheets were clean but stained Had to ask for extra bed linen for the sofa bed The tap and toilet roll holder was loose The staff serving breakfast seemed grumpy and just a small smile would have been nice , The location was great Good shower with hot water Cheap deal so couldn t really expect much 
130957,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, First of all it is not a hotel of more than 2 people in a room Why I was travelling with my family mum and dad and we took the family room My bed was a sofa bed half broken and a very thin mattres on it which its not even suitable for camping When we told the receptionist she told us do not worry You just sleep and you will go out and also when i need it cups for coffee she said this is not my job and she gave us like by force also note that this hotel does not have elevator sobif you have heavy laguages it will be difficult for you to get up the stairs Our room was downstairs so we could listen screaming and footsteps all the time walking i do not recommend it sorry , The wifi and the shower is the only thing we found fair 
130958,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The hotel doesn t have a lift and when I asked the receptionist if there was one because we had 3 baggages he just answered no and he didn t offer to help us The curtains were ripped and dirty blood stains ,No Positive
130959,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It should be illegal to rent rooms this size to people i couldn t even move around and there was a breeze coming out of my window on the side of my bed , good location
130960,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There s no lift not a complaint just a fact you might want to consider , Great value for such a central location Our room for 3 was a large double room with a folding bed which was OK for our daughter but wouldn t have been great for a larger person The breakfast was excellent nice really tasty bacon and the best scrambled eggs I ve had in a hotel in years 
130961,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was so small for 75 it was like a broom cupboard Should not be allowed and customers should be warned before they book and pay up , The shower was nice
130962,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, If you would like an accurate picture of the room do you remember Harry Potter s room under the stairs at Dudley s house Precisely that was my room No consideration for a late check out, Location
130963,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny room those at front of building are very noisy, Good value for money convenient location nice staff excellent breakfast effficient and reliable wifi
130964,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The shower was too hot and couldnt make it colder so having a shower was a bit of a performance also road noise was quite loud as my room was right next to busy main road but i used to live next to a railway line and so i learnt to shut the noise out , The staff were all very helpful i have to eat gluten free and they were very helpful at breakfast good location all very clean and comfortable 
130965,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Much better soundproofing in the windows I could hear the traffic as loud as I d I were on the street Better blinds the room was flooded with light from the street lamps as there were large gaps either side of the blind Better bedding the duvet and bed sheet were too small for the bed and the pillows too flat If these were addressed the room could become fantastic , Great location just over the road from my destination Choice at breakfast free wifi free tea and coffee facilities free toiletries 
130966,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, curtains were very dirty room at street side with bed positioned against window make me feel like cars were driving over me Forgotten earplugs and none available at reception breakfast staff dressed like they came straight out of bed small bed for 2 persons 140cm , style of the room was ok modern looks small room but functional good breakfast good price 75 gbp nice area 
130967,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It s certainly not a four stars hotel Only 90 minutes for breakfast late start at 7 30 and early finish at 9 00 Without lift Very small rooms Poor staff , The location
130968,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The breakfast was awful the service was slow and uncommunicative the full English breakfast was appalling and worst I have ever had It consisted of cold toast put down before breakfast order without plates or cutlery etc over done egg grey mass which I can only assume were mushrooms one piece of bacon which was fatty baked beans a tomato and a sausage which was surprisingly nice The other breakfast products yoghurt cheese milk cereal etc provided were set out on the side under light and were not chilled The staff were distant and unwelcoming at times Our room was entered just after popped out after we first arrived which made us feel uneasy The shower was extremely small the en suite door handle broken the fan was full with dust and the shower products provided were that of 1950 rose and lavender , Bed was comfortable and location was great 
130969,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Hotel and rooms uncomfortably hot too noisy with window open hike up 3 flights of stairs not great Didn t really see staff very much overall disappointed with hotel feel I could have got better for a little extra cost wouldn t stay again, location
130970,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Uninterested and lacked friendliness staff customer services needed developing E g Upon arrival staff to busy eating breakfast or on phone Breakfast staff just lacked a welcome and direction for guests , Convenient location room and hotel clean price was reasonable
130971,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very very small room for single literally only enough space for a single bed Room s curtain could not be closed and next to the road traffic can get a bit distracting when trying to sleep Usual selection for english breakfast which was okay not great , Wifi was very fast with a great connection unlike most other hotels B Bs Facilities for ironing available 24hour reception with helpful staff all around Room and ensuite bathroom were very clean and bed was comfy with a warm duvet Great value for money if you just need a place to stay overnight especially with London hotels being so expensive 
130972,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The double glazed window in my room was broken It wouldn t shut so the room was cold and the street noise horrendous The general standard of maintsinence was poor the door handle to the bathroom was hanging off the tap was loose and the bedroom door didn t lock The paintwork throughout is dirty, The shower is good and the breakfast The bed was comfortable and there was tea and coffe in the room 
130973,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, As all door etc were all painted with Matt white paint they showed up all grubby hand marks This shouldn t put anyone off but hopefully the hotel will rethink its paint finishes and give them a wipe regularly , Excellent location and not excessively expensive Not very big room but perfectly adequate Breakfast good Staff very cooperative in removing spare fold up bed that was not needed 
130974,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Only one thing if you book a small single room assure you do NOT get the one next to the breakfast room It is a converted corridor and there is no room for your suitcase unless you put it on your bed But I am used to small rooms so I could live with that however since it is a converted corridor it has giant windows that leak cold air The space heaters could not keep up with the cold air plus the cold air rushed in just a bed level so it would nearly be impossible to ever sleep w o freezing My stay was in January The staff nodded knowingly and w o issue moved me to a different room, It included a full English breakfast and all the food properly prepared and quite good
130975,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Size of the bathroom was too small felt uncomfortable when staff were talking in their own language, Location was brilliant bed was comfortable breakfast was perfect easy check in can leave your luggage if your too early or if you can t get your train til a certain time requested extra towels staff were pleasant
130976,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was so small I felt claustrophobic was even smaller than an easyHotel room I ve paid 19 for in central London Was way too hot too phone didn t work and so called reception from my mobile to tell them I needed the air conditioning on and they said it was disabled for all of winter and to open my window Room was overlooking busy road so couldn t sleep a wink terrible night , Location was great
130977,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Unfortunately the room did not match the pictures I saw online The double bed was very small the room was small and stuffy within the lower ground level The condiments had not been replaced and the bathroom sink had broken The staff seemed friendly but where not very helpful when we needed their assistance , The location is great 
130978,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, room was not window area and bathroom clean shower temp could not be regulated and tap loose no gluten free bread, location and open access reception staff pleasant
130979,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No complaints here , We enjoyed the breakfast it was great and very tasty We d recommend this place especially for the location within walking distance of everything we needed Thank you God Bless 
130980,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The staff could have been friendlier However was good money and great location close to train station and walking distance for everything else , Room was very nice size and tidy Slept like a baby but not sure if i was just so tired out or the bed 
130981,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Hotel is so hot your feel suffocated Air con didn t work in the room therefore had to open the window which meant the road noise was pretty bad throughout the night, Standard of room and bathroom is acceptable
130982,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Had a single room with bed under the window no headboard so couldn t sit up in bed Breakfast room was small and cramped and a number of guests were stood in the doorway and corridor waiting for a table, The shower was great good strong water pressure
130983,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Shower didn t work room was very noisy and the blinds wouldn t close so was light as well quite dirty thick layer of dust on the bed side table and blinds were filthy , Cheap
130984,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Communications prior to arrival went ignored The room allocated was cold and fit for hobbits only A shower that low you couldn t stand under it if your over 5 7 a bathroom mirror that gave you a view of well your chest only Plug sockets that are positioned that you have to wedge plugs in with a bent wire in order to use things A breakfast room that is not even close to being big enough having a breakfast end time of 9am and having customers having to queue up at the door was appalling And tinned mushrooms Really , The locality was the best selling point and the girls working to cope with breakfast were lovely and worked their socks off
130985,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny room could touch both walls at same time No lock on door Door leading to outside behind bed which is unnerving at night Only plug sockets were behind safe difficult to reach Toilet and shower were in a cupboard Dreary room not cleaned properly stained curtains , Good location friendly welcoming staff 
130986,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was a bit dusty Window was right next to the bed but didn t close all the way Right next to the street and very loud Could smell cigarette smoke through the walls windows Breakfast is only until 9am very early No one available to help carry luggage up down stairs TV remote didn t work and staff didn t fix the issue Uncomfortable pillows bed , Breakfast was good Bed seemed clean Great location 
130987,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Size of rooms temperature controls in the room and hallways were non existent within minutes of having a shower on the morning it felt like I needed another and it was cold outside Room size was poor it was hard to iron a shirt given the size of the room ,No Positive
130988,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, very poor breakfast The second day I went for breakfast at 9 00 actually a bit before 9 and they didn t serve me because they close at 9 00 The room wasn t hot enought Very bad intentet connection, Very good location
130989,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, The room was small but perfectly adequate The free safe was a welcome addition Unfortunately missed breakfast but a very pleasant hotel would definitely use again 
130990,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Facilities we stayed there as a group and the hotel doesn t have lift so we carry our big bags all the way to our room by stairs in second floor and I asked the reception if they can help us and her answer just no , Location is good near to train station
130991,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lift and the single room is on the top floor Noisy No desk in the room , Wonderful location so that I can walk to King s Cross British Museum and SOHO The bathroom is better than I expected though the single room is very small 
130992,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Booked 7 nights at the hotel As soon as I arrived I smelled the dust and mold from the carpet Fortunately we spent most of our time outside but I still got a severe allergy on the 5th night with a blocked nose and sinus The cleaning staff also forgot to replenish the hand soap almost everyday , Excellent location with a bus stop only a few metres away Near to St Pancras Station the British Museum and Oxford Street The English breakfast was timely and tasty with vegetarian options as well The staff is polite and helpful 
130993,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, They need ventilation in the breakfast room When you go to have breakfast it smells greasy After breakfast my clothes smelled very bad , Location is great you can walk to Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Circus 
130994,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, My small single was not as described and paid for it was a cold blocked off back passage with locked half covered external back door with no key or bolt I was afraid someone could unlock the door from the outside The bed was a child s bed with no headboard jammed up against the door There was a small side table no chair desk wardrobe luggage rack iron board hairdryer in fact at 5 4 I could touch both sides of the room simultaneously and only just fitted in the bed Luckily I only had a small cabin sized wheelie case and handbag because it would not have been possible to bring a large case in to the room Thank goodness I was slim enough to slip in to the tiny ensuite also Unfortunately the room was in need of repair and redecoration too The male receptionist was quite unsympathetic and had no idea why I was not happy with the room The hotel was full so I could not be allocated another room room booked weeks prior At 11pm at night he suggested I could go and try and find another hotel He didn t offer to help me and of course I would have had to pay for this corridor Overall terrible experience never to be repeated You have been warned , The female night receptionist was sympathetic The breakfast was fresh and plentiful
130995,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We were put in a ground floor room This was very strange No windoes apart from an old wooden door with paint chipped off it which opened into a tiny concreted area full of leaves The bed wasn t the comfiest very hard Although the bedroom area was nice enough the other part of the room which was up some stairs and you had to duck under an arch to get to it I am quite tall and this could pose some problems if nipping to the toilet in the night There was dust on the dressing table area like it hadn t been cleaned in a while The breakfast wasn t what I would call a full English With one rasher of bacon and one sausage some scrambled egg and beans and a fried tomato We were starting for 2 nights however we didn t get up for breakfast on the second morning It is only served until 9am also which I found a little early if you ask me , Location of hotel was great easy to either walk or jump in a cab
130996,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, 1st room was tiny ridiculously small for a twin on the front by noisy road This was unacceptable Thus we were given the basement room a little larger but still on roadside The stairs were creeky and adjacent door slamming was inappropriate Also linen delivery was thrown from the street to outside our room window below early morning giving a heavy body thud noise This was not pleasant We Shouldn t have to wear ear plugs in Hotels , Staff were very good and helpful and happy Location was very good for stations and site seeing shopping Allowed us to leave our bags after checking out until our 4pm train home which was great 
130997,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Everything was fine no complaints , The English breakfast was as I like it best We love to stay on Gower Street because it is so convenient to The British Museum The British Library Kings Cross the West End and so many other interesting places 
130998,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The extra bed pull out in the 3 bed room My friend said it wasn t comfortable The double bed was absolutely fine, Decor and beds fantastic Nice and quiet friendly Facilities just right Massive choice of breakfast
130999,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bathroom a little small but clean and heater aircon not working Lots of stairs for third floor , Comfortable bed and room quite adequate with teas coffee and biscuits Breakfast more than adequate and well cooked Staff were very helpful and really polite 
131000,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, A triple room is a double with an extra squeaky bed prized in No space to get to kettle or to use dressing table Freezing cold room with very draughty windows and a heater that is luke warm , Location is good and breakfast is nice but very stuffy breakfast room with no windows 
131001,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The cleanliness was rather poor Found hairs in our bed walls had mug splotches on and hotel was rather slacking when it came to being clean The blind was broke so couldn t see out the window and there were stains in the toilet At breakfast there wasn t a lot of choice unlike most hotels but was okay , Great location 
131002,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, First room we got was very small you could only get out of bed from one side after some discussion we were booked to a bigger room at the back side of the hotel, Location was great on the edge of Soho and near to the major theaters 
131003,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I booked a small single room but this is an exaggeration compared with what I actually got The room was literally a converted store cupboard The bed was not even a full size single bed Shower leaked and very noisy Far too expensive for a male shift hotel room , Location was great Small walk to oxford street and lots of lovely shops and cafes around
131004,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Our room was particularly small for 3 people and I m pregnant Additionally we had towels in our bathroom that were already soiled and had to have the kettle cleaned , The location of this hotel is great right near a tube stop and high street It was a clean and well presented budget travel option for London Breakfast was good and staff polite and helpful 
131005,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The hotel was very hot in fact we had our windows open all night in December all in all it did have the facilities that were advertised but it didn t feel like a 4 star hotel, The breakfast was fine
131006,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room size was incredibly small Also I think the bed I slept in was a child s bed as my toes were hanging off the end and I m only 5 5 Place in need of a refurb as looked a bit rundown overall , Staff very helpful and accommodating Room was clean 
131007,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very small bathroom but still OK The breakfast is good but only if you stay 2 3 days only Then it will be boring always the same full or not full English breakfast , The room for 3 is nice and spacey for 2 The bed was hard I really did like it it was very comfortable for me Coffee and tea in the room but don t expect anything special 
131008,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was clearly not a room it was a lobby to the garden where they put a bed 80x170cm which obviously was a sofa and not a bed Located on one of the landing in the staircase the room was noisy and not comfy at all the bathroom was a cupboard where I could barely stand I travel a lot for business and that room was far way the worst I ve ever had ,No Positive
131009,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, the the room smelled like an ashtray especially after you get out of the shower and the steam fills the room the single room is so small that you can t even open your bag, the breakfast was nice and the staff was helpful
131010,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Never ever accept room lg4 It is between the dining room and kitchen It is very noisy smells of cooking and the room temperature is uncontrollable Really awful , Location 
131011,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Nothing It exceeded our expectations , Excellent location Comfortable rooms with everything you need Especially liked the fact breakfast was included in our rate Would definitely return 
131012,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There are tiny rooms there are train compartments and there are Bloomsbury Palace rooms There was a recess for the bed with a 30 cm space on the side It was my first visit to London so I don t know this is perhaps local standards but I have never been anywhere close to a hotel room this small It was OK since I this time only needed a bed but the room description says there would be a writing desk which there wasn t It couldn t possibly have fitted in There wasn t even room to tuck away your luggage You had to place it on the floor thereby blocking either the entrance door or the door to the bathroom My computer which I had to use in bed had to be stored under the bed I estimate the total floor area to less than 2 square metres making up a narrow corridor from the door to the bed Accurate information about exactly how small the rooms are would be honest to give customers the chance to make an informed decision The cleaning under the bed and other hard to reach areas was so so I guess it s hard for the cleaners to vacuum such a small room where there s barely any space to move around your equipment The curtains were torn and had black fringes Sheets and bathroom were clean though I never tried breakfast since there was a long queue of people waiting to be seated and no tables available There were several nice coffeshops in the neighbourhood however so I didn t go hungry , The location couldn t have been better A reasonably quiet neighbourhood two blocks from the British Museum walking distance to everything you need and close to tube and buses 
131013,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Had to wait for breakfast as dining room was too small Luckily I was not on a deadline to leave before a table became available Also breakfast bar coffee and juice was cleared whilst we were still sitting there , Very clean premises bedroom and bathroom Friendly staff Comfortable accommodation 
131014,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, not disable friendly at all We had to go up three flights of stairs with our suitcase as I am 69 yrs old with arthritis I found this quiet hard wouldn t stay again , Breakfast very good Staff exceptional 
131015,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I was kept waiting on departure as no one was at reception receptionist was in front doorway chatting to someone and smoking Although she was friendly when returning to reception and apologised for my wait it is not good enough service , Receptionist on arrival was very helpful in meeting my request for a quiet room Room was clean and perfectly suitable for a short stay Breakfast was plentiful and tasty nice thick bacon Excellent value for money Good location I would definitely stay there again 
131016,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It was very old fashioned with brown carpets and everywhere needed to be painted the net curtains in the bedroom looked dirty for the price I paid and the number of stars I was expecting a lot better The rooms were very small and the bathrooms were tiny Breakfast tasted good but the dining room wasn t great not much room and very dark , The location was great with only a couple of minutes walk to the tube and on the Euston line very easy to get to
131017,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The single room was very tiny and although I knew the bed was small as I was notified I wasn t expecting it to be that small Also no space for your clothes just 1 small peg to hang one item However I did not spend much time in the room so it was fine and the staff very helpful Would stay here again, The hotel was very clean and the breakfast was excellent as the staff asked what you wanted to eat and then prepared it A good choice of cereals fruit juices also They provided a good supply of tea coffee and biscuits
131018,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, As we were travelling as a family of 3 our bedroom was ok but very small Very small breakfast room and had to wait for an available table so you could end up waiting in line There was a bedroom next door in the basement that could have been used to extend the breakfast room There is no hotel bar only a sofa in reception if you wanted to relax outside of your room , The location of the hotel is perfect for the West end Staff was helpful and pleasant 
131019,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Didn t like the Lower ground floor room basement with a window that looked out onto a brick wall would have liked a view Very small double bed and although site mentions a variety of double bed sizes when I asked was told hotel only had the one size double bed Small compact size of double room and equally small bathroom , excellent location good breakfast safe in room staff 
131020,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Including Palace in the hotel name appears somewhat overdone since rooms and overall space in the hotel are overall cramped , Location close to attractions very good
131021,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Not suitable for elderly as there is no lift Carrying the luggage on the staircase can be very tidieous , Conveniently located walking distance to British museum and underground
131022,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Dealt with some ongoing noise late into the night from above room that was not hotels fault and they tried to remedy it after I asked and had a faulty heat ac unit in room , Room and bathroom were clean Breakfast was basic but nice and they do offer full English made to order when you come and sit down 
131023,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I was in a bottom floor single room and it was more like old and run down back utility room which had a door and a full room length large widow to the back Also there was no headboard well unless you include the back door as one As a result this room was freezing I can t understate how bad his room was and can t believe that they are using it as a room I only stayed approx 2 hours as it was so uncortable and cold they had no other rooms available but did allow me to checkout without any charge found another hotel around the corner , The staff member was helpful in contacting manager about the issues I had but apart from that nothing
131024,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I was aware the single bedroom would be small but not as tiny as it was This I could have been happy with but for half the price It was certainly not value for money and the bed proved very uncomfortable as well with springs poking into me The room was clean and the location is fantastic but I would think twice booking this hotel given the broom cupboard size of the room ,No Positive
131025,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, everything was so disgusting that i d go for expedia next time , how can you possibly sell out a hotel like that as a 4 star please go see for yourselves or read the reviews at trip advisor tiny rooms no wardrobes no fridge dirty noisy cooking smell unprofessional staff 2 star would be right for it 
131026,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I got a really small room like s closet When I asked for another room I got one that was underground It was bigger but between the kitchen and the tiny restaurant This was super noisy and it smelled like a kitchen In the morning I had to wait in order to find a table for my breakfast and generally there was no space for anyone The breakfast was of low quality and it was served until 9 I had to do check out at 10 30 The only positive thing was the location I wouldn t recommend it to other visitors ,No Positive
131027,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room allocated to me on the ground floor was previously a hallway The converted room was so small with a locked glass door to the garden The adjacent shower room was extremely tight There was a floor grip where attempts had been made to stick it down ehich in my view was a trip hazard The receptionist did not tell me breakfast isn t served after 9 00 Therefore I missed it Staff were not particularly concerned This had been sold by booking com as 4 , Location central to where I wanted to be
131028,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Rooms and overall hotel in need of refurbishment definitely not 4 star Net curtains in the bedroom dirty window wouldn t stay open no runner cracks above doorway large gap between bottom of the door and floor lock on door didn t work as the plate in the frame was in the wrong place the list goes on , Breakfast included and tasty Variety of cooked cereal and fruit 
131029,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room I had was really small and had a big step into and from the toilet that was dangerous the walls where cracked , The staff was really friendly nothing was ever to much bother for them the breakfast was outstanding lovely clean room with lots of tea and coffee 
131030,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The condition of the room was very poor There were cracks in the walls and the pictures at booking com did not match with the room According to booking com they were suppose to re imburse 50 but it was not paid by the deadline set by booking com ,No Positive
131031,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Stayed in smallest room I have ever seen small single which seems to have been a porch or fire escape corridor with a door each end of bed could touch far wall whilst lay in bed Noisy with kitchen fans but did the job for a very brief stay, Good location I have stayed here before and would again but not in the small single room
131032,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Two flights of stairs asked for help with my luggage No sorry The room was a shoe box Hooks on wall for clothes one power point under a shelf jammed between bed and wall Had to kneel on floor to find it Blind did not work I asked to be moved and was put on the ground floor I carried my bags down the stairs Slightly larger room with a wardrobe and 2 power points jammed under shelf between bed and wall The air conditioning didn t work because it was a weekend no one to fix it I was given a fan When I made a cup of tea no spoon I was fed up stirred my tea with my pen Very disappointed waste of money , Location
131033,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The ground floor room G5 was pokey and oddly shaped and facing on to Gower St at ground level it was really noisy The UCL Hospital is just up the road and while it is comforting to be close to such a centre of excellence the noise and frequency of emergency ambulances going past was a bummer , The location was ideal for the 3 things we wanted to do on the trip The shower in the room was excellent and the breakfast was among the best we have had in a London hotel 
131034,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The website clearly states a double room has a double bed What we got was two singles pushed together with two single duvets Whenever we rolled towards the middle the beds separated I consider this a misrepresentation as I would not have booked this hotel had I known the truth We asked very nicely at reception to change rooms after the first night to be told we couldn t I had to ask by email their complaints procedure to have our room changed which they clearly weren t happy about and I still feel the website should be changed and I m unimpressed I didn t receive what was promised on night one ,No Positive
131035,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Noisy being in basement next to kitchen and room was too hot and too isolated for solo traveller query rodent scratching around at night time, Breakfast was great and good service good location
131036,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was way smaller than i expected I had problem with placing my luggage in the room , Very good location Walking distance to most of the attractions I liked the heating 
131037,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room we stayed in on the ground floor was quite grubby and a bit musty There wasn t a full curtain only a blind which was broken at the top and was filthy The bed was clean and comfy It is ok for 1 night but I wouldn t stay any longer and don t believe the ratings as it is definitely not a 4 hotel more like a 2 , The staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was very good Location for the West End is within walking distance of about 15 20 mins 
131038,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, staff were terrible hotel is filthy blind didn t pull down and net curtains were so dirty they were black and not white it is so easy to take down nets to wash so not sure why they don t staff were unhelpful when I complained that the double lock on my door didn t work , close to town
131039,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Allocated a room on the basement floor next to the kitchen Not only did the room smell and very filthy hairs in the shower sticky carpets and dust the walls were not sound proof Hence it felt as thou you were staying in the kitchen itself ,No Positive
131040,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, In view of the keen price and all the good points I accept the restriction in room size Quite acceptable for a short stay Thank you I shall certainly return , Location 24 hour receptionist Cleanliness Good service Good breakfast Good value 
131041,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was extremely small It was impossible to open the bathroom door without having to move the luggage first I spent a lot of time moving my luggage and changing things of place just to reach the bathroom or the room door The room has everything mentioned in the booking but there is no enough space to put everything there Over the bedside table is the safe box over the safe box is the tray with the coffe cups etc and inside the bedside table drawer is the telephone unplugged The room was very cold It has been a hall to the back yard now closed two doors and a big window not warm at all It doesn t has a good heater The heater available was not good enough and I froze The second morning they have had a problem in the kitchen and there were no hot food The variety of cold breakfast didn t change It was the same I would expect a bigger variety of cold things if they can t serve the traditional English breakfast proposed in the booking I have considered to change hotel after the first night but the payment was made in advanced and I didn t try This tiny and dysfunctional room should be cheaper I would not return to this hotel , The staff would kind and the location is good The room was clean 
131042,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It was noisy at night next to the stairs extremely small no room to move in the shower The breakfast room was small and crowded, The room was clean bed comfortable great location near tube and central for ameneties
131043,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The small room was infinitesimally small Prisoners in solitary confinement have better accommodation Smelly just above kitchen Noisy straight on front of front door onto street and traffic passes to lower ground floor and breakfast room and noise from rooms above It appeared to be little more than a cupboard The ensuite was even smaller Try sitting on the look with the minute sink on your boob and trying to wash in the sink was dreadful When I complained i was fobbed off and felt forced to spend the night because without a refund I couldn t go elsewhere It was my worst nights sleep ever and breakfast was as bland as the room , Just the location
131044,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very poor breakfast if you don t go for a full English Shower not made for persons taller than 185cm, Comfortable and quiet room Enough room for two 
131045,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast was good but room far too small for either guests or staff to move around too many people needed to eat in a very small space, Room very clean and comfortable
131046,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was very small and dusty around the window where the blind didn t work No one had bothered to look behind it in a long while The rest of the room and bathroom was very clean, Location was great
131047,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was the size of a cupboard with not enough room for a desk or chair this made it very difficult for me as I was in London on business and needed the evening to prepare my work I was forced to work uncomfortably in the reception area I had a cold and poor nights sleep , The breakfast was good and all staff I came into contact with were friendly and efficient The evening receptionist was very kind and polite and did his best to make me comfortable by ordering me a meal on my arrival and something to drink 
131048,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room 205 small single Room was only as long as the single bed and floor space approx 2 x 6 Ensuite tiny but clean Room was on a half landing so staircase directly outside bedroom door which meant I could hear everyone coming and going Door didn t lock although accessed only on key card wifi signal didn t reach room no mattress protector on bed just a thin sheet with blood stains see photos Net curtain was a grubby grey and roman blind was dusty where it hadn t been hoovered for a while Head end of bed right next to window so very draughty all night Decided not to sample the breakfast after reading reviews so went to Euston Station instead , The location of the tube and the training course I was attending
131049,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Curtain was broken Staff didn t fix it seemed disinterested Effectively slept on an ledge in front of an open window for 4 nights facing a busy street Also their internet was unusable half the time so i had to find coffee shops to do work For the price per night totally unacceptable , Good location
131050,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, All the rest We were in the lower ground room LG5 which feels damp smells of tobacco and looks like a badly converted cellar The room and the whole experience was probably worth 40 less than the price we paid , Location is quite good
131051,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lift , Reasonable size triple room for the price Good en suite with excellent shower Despite being in a basement room there was a window which kept the room bright and airy Ten minute walk from Euston Station and Oxford Street Five minutes from British Museum Tottenham Court Road Plenty of caf s and restaurants within walking distance 
131052,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was really hot air conditioning didn t work but we were given a fan we had two single beds pushed together rather than a double bed , Good location easy transport links 
131053,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I stayed in the hotel for 2 days The heater in room did not worked for both days despite complaining about it since first day Due to this i had clod and flu The room is very very small and there is no space to even stand in the room Wifi signals were too weak and room was very dusty ,No Positive
131054,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed very uncomfortable very hot very noisy bed side table lamp not working door lock not working couldn t connect to wifi got a very bad rash from bed sheets, Nothing
131055,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very poor WiFi neither my phone nor the laptop was able to connect while in the room Very poor window isolation the room was a bit cold because cold air kept coming inside from outside, Very good location 
131056,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, cramped room and bathroom, Breakfast service and food were excellent The electric teapot and shortbread were appreciated We were glad our room was not overlooking the street 
131057,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room quite small but ok and I would not quite say this is what we did not like just cant find anything else to say, close to were we were going Staff very friendly and the breakfast was lovely
131058,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Hotel overall was fine unfortunately our room was awful G5 It was tiny nothing like any of photographs Noisy due to been on street level so constant traffic noise Dark and dingy with no space The bed was pushed up against window with a table next to it which you had to climb over to get into bed The tv was on the wall at the left side of the bed so impossible to watch Clearly a failed attempt at adding another room , Breakfast and shower okay 
131059,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Walking up four flights of stairs a couple of times a day The bathroom was a little on the small size , The room was comfortable and a reasonable size Breakfast was good but the finish time of 9am was a bit early for people on holiday 
131060,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Small room bed not very comfortable bathroom no shelves or towel racks Also no elevator for lugging bags to 3rd really 4th floor , Great neighborhood decent breakfast helpful staff moderate price
131061,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, If it matters to you the room is indeed minimal size Just a step off your bed and you are in bathroom But it was ok for me as a solo traveler with just 1 carry on , Good location and breakfast Room reasonably quiet in court side Bed comfortable Kettle in the room 
131062,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I didn t expect a lot but the Breakfast times were a little to short so I missed it Until 9am and on Sundays until 9 30, Perfect location Our room was very quiet 
131063,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Dingey room No secure location for bags as we couldn t check in until 2 Left bags in the reception area Breakfast was only served latest 9am which is quite early and check out was 10 30 Paid over 100 for less than 24 hours , Location so central to everything
131064,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, On top floor extremely difficult to climb No bath shower cramped wouldn t stay again even though good location Staff not that friendly walls very thin could hear people talking not great for rest after long day , Not enough selection no croissants cooked breakfast left a lot to be desired Sunday morning Cramped area for guests to sit couldn t move at breakfast Dissatisfied with breakfast area and selection Very early breakfast finish at 9 o clock 10 30 checkout bit early to where I have stayed before 
131065,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room very very small No desk Barely enough room for 2 people 1 night stay there would be okay but any longer and it s very claustrophobic Probably wouldn t stay there again mainly due to size of rooms was very disappointed considering we had booked to stay for 3 nights , Location was good went to London for Harry Potter play and was 15 mins walk to the theatre 5 mins for shopping Breakfast very nice Lots of options for continental Pretty basic cooked breakfast but still good quality 
131066,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room I got was very small Insulation is not goo I heard all the noise coming from outside The heater was broken I asked to be fixed but somehow it was not I asked to change the room but there was no free one from the same category Then I asked to change to any other room even if I ve to pay for it so they ve upgraded my room for one night for free I was just disappointed because I though they should have taken these actions before I ask for it , Value of money is good
131067,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The double bed was unbalanced so the person sleeping on the right side was in danger to fell off the bed Breakfast was ok but very limited in choices , Location was good 
131068,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Dirty room mud stains on the walls and blind Ground floor room hardly any sleep due to the amount of noise Hard bed walls paper thin , Staff were lovely 
131069,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, 1 when I checked in and after I paid the stuff told me that the room is in the underground floor I told the stuff to change it as I have a phobia but the stuff refused saying no other available rooms I told him that they should but that in the selection of the room as an option to agree to stay in underground floor or not to agree 2 I didn t like the way the stuff were answer your notes For example the main light in the room was not working When I asked he said you can use the beside bed ones 3 another example for the rudeness in the stuff I request for extra duvet the reception said they don t have and he asked me the reason why I need i and if I have extra people in the roomt This was very very rude question 4 My booked room was with full English breakfast I didn t like the breakfast at all There isn t any verity of food just value Even the bread I have to requested it from the waiter It was one of the worst breakfast I ever had , The location
131070,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, This must be the worst hotel I have ever stayed in London I have stayed in a lot and I am at a loss why it is rated how it is Our room and particularly en suite was very dirty and grimy In addition the smell of grease and fried food permeates through the whole hotel every morning leaving your clothes in need of a dry clean We couldn t even open our window due to the smell coming up from the basement kitchen Don t let the photos on this website fool you as I did , Nothing
131071,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Would have liked a bit more space for luggage, Location Breakfast passed the scrambled egg test Shoebox room but managed to just squeeze in the necessities 
131072,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny hot room No space to work No room to unpack Very loud due to street noise Staff were indifferent Very expensive I would have been better off traveling home in the evening and buying two day returns to London , Free standing A C unit which was essential Relatively new ensuite shower room Breakfast was reasonable 
131073,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny room even for London Room very stuffy fan provided Traffic noise, Good location for train termini Friendly staff Good wifi Good breakfast Great shower
131074,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, As a single female traveller I felt unsafe as door had no working lock The single room was also extra tiny Overall place is shabby and most certainly not 4 stars I Felt seriously misled by 4 star rating I did not stay in the end as thankfully found friend to stay with instead after seeing how dreadful this place truely is Don t be tempted by the price Whatever money you spend here is too much Please read the reviews on tripadvisor Do not book here , Nothing 
131075,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny dark basement room waste water noise broken tap in bathroom woken by someone hiccoughing and knocking on the door at 06 00 Hot stuffy small breakfast room with not enough tables Poor breakfast, Good location
131076,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The cooked breakfast took 45 minutes and still didn t arrive so I had to leave for work with a slice of dry dead toast and some plastic wrapped cheese The staff in the tiny kitchen doesn t speak English the tiny dining room catered for about twenty people at the same time The room was in the cellar supposedly for three persons with just a skylight and airless The reception is only manned part of the time and you never see a manager This hotel is overpriced and I felt seriously ripped off I will not use this hotel again ,No Positive
131077,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room seemed to be much smaller then how they appeared on booking com Also other guests had the same feeling Although the pictures are accurate Just a little deceiving The bed was small we just fitted in their with the two of us There was no A C Just a little fan that made more noise then actually moving air The window and curtains were dirty We could not control the room temperature The bathroom was ok Small but clean , Breakfast was good for the price Basic buffet breakfast But on request included in price for us they make english breakfast with eggs and a selection of beans bacon tomatoes sausage etc 
131078,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, As I booked this hotel for a work trip I had expected an in room workspace even if it was a very small desk There want one which may not be a problem for the average tourist , Front desk staff were terrific as was the location Check in process was quick and easy while the folks at the front desk were always helpful with recommendations Also there were various wifi connections available so the wifi service was always good even in the basement breakfast room 
131079,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It wasn t very welcoming It felt like it needed a lick of paint The breakfast room was totally inadequate It wasn t as good as I d expected it to be No bath, The location was good the shower was good The bed was comfy Windows that opened was great

131081,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Since the hotel does not have lift it would be a really nice thing to have the luggage taken to the room after check in and taken down at the reception prior chck out , The staff at the hotel were just amazing 
131082,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The curtain in the room and shower head were very dirty and the room was very hot with no aircon The room was smaller than expected but we managed to cram everything in the walking space The shower handle that was mounted to the wall was loose and quite dangerous but was fixed quickly by staff A few extra touches and this hotel could be a lot nicer , The location was perfect In a good neighbourhood with shopping and the tube a block behind the hotel Soho and the British Museum were a short walk away 
131083,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The blond young receptionist on arrival was not a welcoming one The shower is small We had a triple room for two people which was already not big So not sure about the standard room London is overpriced as always , The location was good for us Clean triple room no smell good room temperature inside for September 
131084,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The rooms where heated up even outside temperatures where only around 15 C Rooms are tiny literally the size of the bed and noisy if you have them to the road due to old windows ,No Positive
131085,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room size was incredibly small The orientation of the bed was a triumph of logistics over comfort , I had to stay in London for one night This hotel was adequate and served my purposes at a reasonable cost Other than that there is nothing remarkable to report 
131086,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Can t think of anything really , Great and friendly staff in overall quick check in and out The lady who was in charge of the breakfast was very nice and helpful really good

131091,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Airco did not function room was extremely hot Even additional mobile airco and fan did not help Noise of the kitchen early morning Plus smell of eggs plus noise of device outside made sleeping extremely difficult, Location is good as well as the shower
131092,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The single room was very tiny not good for more than a few nights The trafic noice was quite loud specially with open windows , It was close to restaurants and 10 min walk to underground stations The room and toilet look recently refurbished and they were very clean 
131093,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast room very squashed and no choice of what we wanted for breakfast other than asked if we wanted scrambled or fried eggs the rest was just brought , Location
131094,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The shower in the room was challenging Not much room in there , Great location for our needs Staff were excellent throughout Close to numerous tube stations making travel across London very easy 
131095,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The 4 starts must be some mistake This is not more than a 2 stars hotel No continental breakfast offered as written in the description asked for it answer was no Breakfast room is quite small and gets uncomfortable when busy No mini bar in the room Hotel is located on a pretty busy street and was very noisy also during late night and early morning hours Room was very tiny sink is way too close to the toilette for a larger person this will be an issue Windows and curtains in the room were very dirty also the carpet in the corridor was not exactly clean there is more one can wish from a cleanliness point of view So don t be misled by the Palace word in the name there s nothing palace about it , Well located some 15min walk from Soho Good transport connections Staff is ok Full English breakfast was tasty Coffee and tea kettle available in the room WiFi signal was very good 
131096,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was awful small dirty dingy with no air con Very poor value for money, Good breakfast choice prompt service as was check in and out Superb location to all the key parts of central London
131097,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The net curtains were filthy there were mice in the wall and window box and I couldn t wait to get out of there Staff would not do me a packed lunch instead of breakfast really unhelpful Would not stay there again ,No Positive
131098,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, 8 square meters is not much rather claustrophobic and the rooms to the front are noisy due to all night traffic even when the windows are closed , The breakfast was fine I enjoyed the peaches and peeled grapefruits 
131099,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, the place was very dated shabby not friendly too hot no cold water staff were miserable most of all it was dangerous when you open the windows no safety catches kids could fall out health and safety would have a ball they put us in the basement no windows no wardrobe no cold water never again NOT a 4 star hotel , breakfast was the onlynice thing about this place cant even call it a hotel 
131100,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was very small and very hot The bed was very short though comfortable , The bathroom was good and the location is fine if you want to be close to British Museum 
131101,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was beyond small No storage space only three hangers on the wall The internet worked about one third of the time the phone in my room did not work at all , Staff was friendly 
131102,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Our room was ridiculously hot And I mean Hot A portable air con unit that you needed the window open for Obviously needed to close the window at night The window blinds didn t work so had the lights from the building opposite and from the store cupboard outside our window glaring through the window all night And did I mention RIDICULOUSLY HOT , Our room was a nice size ensuite and tea making facilities We were on the lower ground floor 
131103,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room too small No telephone in the bedroom not working No air conditioning Bathroom could be better No lift, location Nice catering staff for breakfast 
131104,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The rooms are awfuly hot even with a fan we were on the 3rd floor and there s no lift The breakfast room is a little small and even though the buffet is adquiate and the cooked breakfast very nice the bacon is always over done, This is a nice hotel of the main road with a resturants and bars close by
131105,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The air conditioning is hopeless and should not be advertised as such Any visitors from the US just won t understand how this can be described as air con , Staff are really pleasant and professional rooms are a good size 
131106,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, TINY room facing busy Gower Street Breakfast room is so small you may have to queue to get in , Terrific location opposite the university where I was working 
131107,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast very disorganised not enough tables so had to share with a very nice man who offered Self service tea in a cup rather than a nice pot, Bed was comfortable although two singles and was meant to be double
131108,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, small rooms even at basements you can get rooms AC was not working rooms were suffocating Requested staff to arrange different room or to fix AC they give you table fans as AC Nothing was done had to stay in ground floor suffocating room beside kitchen whose smell woke us up every morning breakfast is served in small congested room where I could not secure place in time and had to skip it in lack of time I would never recommend anyone this hotel unless you can confirm with hotel prior to payment that you wont get basement rooms , very bad experience I had at this hotel felt like cheated only location is good point and probably breakfast which you can miss easily for not getting place to sit in small room where it is served Nothing like 4 star hotel staff was good but do not do anything on request 
131109,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Staff were very abrupt Wifi cut out occasionally room was only about the size of the bed but that wasn t too much an issue, Great location within walking distance of many shops and stations breakfast was good free WiFi
131110,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, no complaints had a great stay , I really liked my single room it was very tiny but had everything in it was comfortable and clean I loved the bed next to the window had a cup of coffee while people watching in the morning it was great The location is very handy close enough the bus and metro stations and right in the corner to the British Museum They also allow guests to leave their luggage in the reception to pick it up later after checkout 
131111,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We paid for a family room and it was actually a double room with a camp bed put up at the end of the double bed so we didn t have any room at all to move around The staff were very inattentive when we went for breakfast and I had to keep going to find someone for service , The room and ensuite were very clean and the shower was powerful and nice and hot 
131112,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The blind was broken and the heating came on through the night This wasn t needed due to it being summer The toilet was also too close to the sink , Location not far from the tube and shops Breakfast was good 
131113,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Unable to work air conditioning but large fan had been put in room Dirty voile curtains, Quiet Clean room good shower ideally placed with short walk to the theatre
131114,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Rooms are very tight and the corridors and rooms were very hot No fan in one of the rooms we booked and had to go down to reception to collect the one they had there The internet isn t very strong and depends largely on which room you re in Staff could do nothing order than offer an apology , It was nice and clean
131115,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very hot but helped by fan in the room Wear something to breakfast you re not going out in too as you can smell like a fry up afterwards , Well decorated bedroom and bathroom with efficient shower with all you might need Good breakfast tailored to order crispy bacon 
131116,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It is really warm in inside of the room There was no air conditioning In addition the window in the room number 204 needs to be repaired I had some problems with opening , The main plus of course is a great location 5 minutes walk from the underground station 10 minutes from Oxford street I was also happy to get coffee tea facilities The staff was helpful and provided me all necessary information equipment 
131117,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Poor drainage on shower two lights in room not working Cued to get a table for breakfast in the morning Room slightly dirty I e Cobwebs in corners and dust on night stand , very spacious room great shower and comfortable bed Breakfast also very good Good location for theatre trips and Covent Garden 
131118,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Booked to stay at this hotel because it has air conditioning for a long bank holiday weekend On both of the days of our stay it wasn t working Our room for most of the day and night was nearly 30 degrees Its fair to say we did not have a good weekend in London , Staff ran an excellent breakfast service 
131119,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Air con in the room didn t work There was a fan and it was 20 degrees but in the stairway and the room it was too hot We had the fan on and window open 24 7 The stairs needed a hoover and the room needed a good clean as well Dust skirting boards , Location of this hotel s fantastic for the money didnt use a tube or bus all weekend Breakfast was ok Ensuite tiny but good shower Room was not a bad size for 3 adults Price was decent considering it was bank holiday weekend 
131120,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I can t figure out how come this small hotel can be rated as 4 stars In most Asian countries even a 2 star hotel can be better than this one One terrible experience was by the last night when I stayed the toilet was stuck and I have to ask the receptionist to get me a pump to fix it Can you imagine this could happen in a 4 star hotel Besides the room G3 we stayed was equipped with a malfunctioned air con , Nothing
131121,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The heat in the room No air conditioning but a fan is provided for you but in the middle of a heatwave with window open no air was coming in to room at all Single rooms are really small compact , Property was clean staff very friendly helpful Excellent location for Central London
131122,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, All great Only suggestion would be could maybe do with a menu on the table at breakfast so you can choose what you would like rather than the waitress having to keep repeating herself 
131123,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Hotel staff not interested no one asked if we were happy On3rd floor with no lift and no offer of assistance So hot throughout hotel and very uncomfortable despite useless air condioning small fan in room which was small stuffy Net curtains in room landings filthy Bed ok bathroom ok but tiny Breakfast had to ask 3 times for fruit juice only one girl serving No cups or glasses to hand breakfast quite poor quality Will not return , Location was good pretty central
131124,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The hotel was dirty the rooms were stifling hot and the fan didn t work The carpets didn t fit the floor meaning dirty floorboards were showing There weren t enough seats in the breakfast room for the number of guests meaning guests had to queue for breakfast Waitresses didn t speak very good English and could not understand basic requests for salt or sweetener I would not recommend this hotel at all , The breakfast was tasty when the waitress was eventually able to translate my request for salt 
131125,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Terrible management and service Let me list the ways A C was advertised as part of he room but actually broken during or entire stay The staff promised it would be fixed the next day but never was We were given two fans that did not cool our room right next to the kitchen downstairs We asked to move rooms but the staff promised they would look into it but never followed through They took our large bath towels one day and replaced them with hand towels because they did not get their laundry delivery Our ironing board had a burned cover Basically we should have gotten a discount or even a full refund for this awful experience , Great location 
131126,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, General cleanliness of the hotel was poor We didn t use the room tea coffee facilities as the kettle cups were dirty Had to complain about heavily stained towels , The hotel was in a good central location Lots of places within walking distance 
131127,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, bathroom no bath just shower had a leak broken glass light cover which I cut my thumb on and a very tight squeeze for three people leaving no access to tea coffee and floor space Reported broken lamp and leak to reception whom apologised but didn t do anything about the problem , ok breakfast and good location for Covent Garden
131128,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The small single room was tiny and I am sure it does not meet hotel standards The hotel should not be selling this room , Good location Friendly staff 
131129,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The air conditioning was not working Two oscillating fans had been placed in the room It was a very warm spell and we were located on the top floor The mushrooms used for the cooked breakfast were not fresh, Our room was quieter than we expected There was 24 hour reception Our tea and coffee were replenished each day which we did not expect Pleased that fresh fruit was offered at breakfast along with a reasonable selection of cereals and fruit juice 
131130,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lift and put on top floor with 4 suitcases Do not attempt if you have difficulties walking No help even offered with luggage, Breakfast and room was clean good location within walking distance to west end
131131,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The fact that I paid 260 for two nights and all they did was put us in a standard room and put a put up bed where u couldn t move around no air con and the beds and bin where not emptied, Location
131132,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Small breakfast room we had to wait in que to take a seat on sunday but other days were ok Bed was a little unconformtable , Room was clean we got new towels everyday wifi was working perfectly Room is small but it has everything you need 
131133,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Air conditioning not working at height of summer when temp was in the 30s Breakfast room a little small , Clean large bedroom with new bathroom Great breakfast and friendly staff Good location to access Euston station and City Centre
131134,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Rooms very small and in need of a lick of paint Breakfast room was too small and some guests had to queue outside the staff seemed rushed off their feet trying to keep up , The location two minute walk to the tube
131135,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We were OK as fit and healthy but beware there is no lift so you have to walk with your cases to whatever floor you are on , It was a much better experience than I was expecting due to previous poor reviews Reception staff very helpful We were in room 207 perfect for the 3 of us it had air conditioning and was very quiet They even left a birthday card and Lindt chocolates for my daughters Birthday Overall excellent value for money 
131136,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, nothing really if i had to out something it was that the room was a little warm when entering but fired up the air con and all sorted, Great location and price Hotel was extremely clean and tidy breakfast in the morning was great and lovely friendly staff couldn t ask for more for a night in London Would definitely recommend
131137,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, As a solo traveller I booked a single room It was barely bigger than a cupboard Just the length of a single bed and about 6ft wide Don t ask for a small single room if you want a comfortable night , The breakfast was good and the staff very friendly 
131138,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Rooms were a bit hot And of course very small but that s London rooms for you , Bathroom was very clean Bed was comfortable Really close to city centre for shopping 20 mins walk or so Good for one night 
131139,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The hotel probably needs a refurb or a brush of paint as skirting so were a little dusty in hallways and paintwork looked tired y, Breakfasts were good and varied especially liked the tea coffee in the rooms Beds very comfy and bathroom looked like it had been updated 
131140,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Cramped breakfast room with not enough tables for the number of guests No elevator The rooms on the street can be quite noisy , Good location near the tube and close to the British Museum and a good value The hardworking staff is eager to be helpful 
131141,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I had problems with connecting my electrical devices the first day, the problem resolved from the second day staff were nice and helpful I like the breakfast
131142,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I wasn t able to open the external part of the window and this bugged me a little since I prefer sleeping with windows open , I really liked my room it was small but very comfortable the space is used wisely and pretty The staff was very kind and helpful 
131143,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room aircondition street noisy, Reception people are good room without aircondition Honestly hotel is good but is not 4 stars hotel also I hear the car in the street all night
131144,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The handle to the bathroom door fell off when I arrived and they didn t have another room they could swap me too Single room was cramped and there was not enough space to put my suitcase,No Positive
131145,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed small but considering location and room size it was perfect Excellent value for money would be hard to find a hotel as comfortable at this price Staff all female I hope they are not over worked , I loved the location and breakfast was delicious Beautiful white bed linen and towels 
131146,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, My room was extremely small and being on the third floor extremely hot even though I was provided with a fan , It s location was perfect for all the site seeing I wanted to do
131147,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The noise in the rooms at the front is horrendous It s like sleeping on a motorway And there is not even any double glazing There is SOOT on the window ledge due to the road pollution , Breakfast is correct 
131148,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The single room was a tick too small hardly any space for a very small bag Breakfast itself nice and good breakfast room too small not always seats available and after breakfast one has all beakfast smell in the clothes That s something what I do not like to smell the breakfast still all day long in hair and clothes , Location within London ideal room and bath very clean modern bathroom nice service in and out Good value for money 
131149,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The booking confirmation showed that room had air conditioning and a laptop safe safe deposit box It had neither unless you count a pedestal fan that sounds like an apache taking off as air conditioning and the safe was present but had no power looked like it had been broken into and was not affixed to anything All this was compounded by it being the hottest day of the year and the room displaying a sign that we leave our possession in the room at our own risk The cleanliness and quality of the rooms is nothing like the pictures The staircases are a hazard as individual steps are sinking and have not been repaired The beds are not remotely comfortable there are no satellite channels available on the TV as advertised and the cooked breakfast was disgusting grease fest stick to the cereal I only booked the place to be near Euston station but I ve rated location here based entirely on a tourism perspective There is nothing noteworthy nearby if you don t need to be in this area don t be , Nothing really The staff were polite nothing out of the ordinary but saying that being polite and apologetic didn t get me a room with air conditioning 
131150,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Have booked the hotel for 3 pax a few months before checking in and put in a request for air conditioning summer and ground floor room else need an elevetor we had 6 luggages Instead we were given a room in basement two with 2 miserable fans because we were late in our check in Not acceptable as the booking was made much earlier and request was also put in then The room should have been reserved If not ground floor maybe in basement one The staff should have tried to accommodate our request and not give the reason as the hotel was full and we were late in checking in Worse still we stayed here for 2 nights and on the second night they removed a fan from our room We insisted that they replaced the missing fan as the room was very stuffy with no windows Overall stay was not good , Breakfast was good 
131151,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Air con didn t work Paid for three beds and got one double and the worst fold out bed ever it wasn t even made and when she came to pull it out it was dirty breakfast room was hot and dingy food wasn t great staff never communicated with you The communal garden had 20 bin bags of rubbish and looks like it s been abandoned , I liked leaving the hotel and the shower was powerful
131152,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The bed was tiny for two people i woke up numb down one side from awkward sleeping pattern my partner was in constant fear she would fall out of bed we had to roll up a hand towel and stick in under the edge of her side of the mattress to create a safety ledge naturally this was removed after the 1st night by cleaning staff and then we were short changed the hand towel as well grrrrr This bed is for one person only its the smallest double bed in human history i felt tortured having to sleep in it Never staying there again ,No Positive
131153,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room number LG1 was extremely hot even with two air condition units on Double bed very small probably only 4 foot wide , good location breakfast quite good unfortunately it has to be ordered by 9 00am
131154,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very basic for 4 stars Our room was in the basement which was really hot right next to the kitchen which was incredibly loud in the morning over the breakfast periods Seems expensive for what you get but I guess that s London , Location it was clean
131155,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lifts trying to get a large suitcase upto the third floor Doors banging from other rooms Ok for a couple of nights smsll bedroom, Breakfast Receptionist help
131156,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, 3 floors up with no elevator , Location location location It was opposite the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine where I was working Outside was also a bus stop with frequent buses straight into the West End Breakfast included 
131157,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, My single room would be better described as a broom cupboard with a bed Shower room washbasin too small for kettle to fit under , Decent breakfast Location 
131158,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, room was just too too small wall to wall bed no room for a suitcase Rooms could easily be remodelled making 2 singles out of 3 for a vast improvement , location
131159,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, ridiculously small room I have been to Tokyo and even there my room were never that small Way too expensive for a cupboard , really nice staff members
131160,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very small room with limited floor space No bath towels available on first night for use in shower Air conditioning broken in room so uncomfortable temperature over whole stay , Staff were attentive on reception particularly Fan from reception had been placed in room to try and cool it down 
131161,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Air con wasn t working and the room was an oven in a warm summer evening , Great location next to British museum walkable to Euston station and West End
131162,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There were only a few negatives from our stay which included The occupiers of neighbouring rooms were not very considerate continually slamming doors and talking loudly in the small corridor outside our room The decor in the room was a little on the tired side with a window catch missing A very hot few days in London and the air conditioning not working in the room meant the windows had to be left open so the smell of breakfast cooking each morning was very strong , Excellent location with easy access to Euston station and two underground stations Goodge Street and Russell Square Free wi fi tv and tea and coffee making facilities provided The room was clean with fresh towels provided every day and the beds made We would definitely stay at this hotel again the location and price could not be faulted If the few negatives were addressed I would have given each part of my review as excellent 
131163,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The temperature in the room was too high summer time it was poorly air conditioned and it felt like I was in a sauna Because of that sleeping throught the night in this hotel was the worst part of my trip to London And it s a 4 star hotel Yeah right,No Positive
131164,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, The central location is amazing Windows were double sound proofed so I didn t hear the traffic outside which I assumed would be a problem on Gower St This was excellent 
131165,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lift in the hotel so u have to use the stairs the a c is very bad cause at that time the weather was hot we suffered alot no trash basket in the room no one can hepl u with the luggages , the location of the hotel only
131166,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room extremely small Not a single chair or small table to put your belongings simply there was no space I asked for another room and was told all were the same size Wifi did not work Had to come down to the lounge to have Internet, Location Bathroom small but clean and ok Some staff not all gentle and helpful 
131167,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, the accommodation was not brilliant there is no lift in the building and arrival and departure were both trials to be endured thankfully i only had a 5 night stay so i put up with these shortcomings the mistake will not be repeated , the bed was not over comfortable and was shoe horned into this minute bedroom 
131168,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, breakfast was terrible in terms of comfort of the environment with a small room in the basement very hot and crammed with people the room was extremely small basically just a single bed surrounded by walls , breakfast was ok in terms of food and drinks nothing special though the room was very clean and the staff polite and helpful the location is great next to Russell square the British Museum and transport facilities 
131169,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Noisey on the road side of the hotel especially when hot as the windows needed to be opened to cool the room , The location put me right in the centre of London
131170,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No other facilities e g bar But wasn t a problem , Great location Nice small hotel We found Goodge Street was the nearest tube station just round the corner Price included breakfast which was very nice Our room was LG4 lower ground was a bit worried but pleasantly surprised when opened the door Woke up at 6 50 to hear breakfast being prepped as our room was between the kitchen and dining room Overall really liked the hotel they even let us leave our case after checking out for a few hours Completely recommend 
131171,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, More Maintence Runs in the carpet right outside of our door The faucet was loose and spun when you tried to push it to the hot or cold Caulking in the shower needs attention , The staff could not have have any better They call us Taxi s were friendly gave us directions The breakfast people were quick attentive on top of everything Really good job for all the staff 
131172,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was so small it was claustrophobic The bathroom was barely big enough to fit in There was no air conditioning and the room was stiflingly hot It was on the street side so without air the window was open and it was noisy Really think how badly you want to stay here before booking English Breakfast wasn t what you d expect from a pub or anywhere else and was missing traditional elements , Location was great and really close to the underground 
131173,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, My room was really cramped and it was really difficult to open a large suitcase in it no wardrobe just a tiny little shelf no air conditioning rather boring and limited breakfast menu either English breakfast or yoghurt no salads and the dining room gets really stuffy when filled with guests poor wifi connection, Brilliant location friendly staff room cleaned every day towels changed every day tea coffe facilities and bisquits
131174,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny room Very very noisy at the front of the hotel Window sash broken so I could not close the it and there was a very noisy generator and people working outside my window at night plus traffic Very little sleep , Clean tidy room Bathroom contained lots of towels and shower gel soap etc 
131175,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Waited at reception 10 15 mins for someone to return to the desk so I could check in Small single room was incredibly tiny like a shoe box Asked to upgrade but nothing bigger available Bed wasn t even a full size single no headboard on quite free wheels so slid around the floor a bit and crammed really close to the wall window sill Barely any floor space or room to hang store anything Had to hang clothes above the tea station Shower room very very small barely a cloakroom tiny shower not even full sized and a tiny cloakroom sized sink right next to the toilet Generally the room was finished to a very poor standard plaster chipping around the edges bare filler visible and needed a good lick of paint Laminate floor had suffered water damage hardly surprising in view of the proximity of the shower to the door into the bedroom Basically felt like a corridor cupboard that they ve tried to monetise and done a poor job of it if it had been finished to a better standard the size would have been easier to excuse All in all not what I expected from a genius recommendation I thought they were supposed to be great deals to reward loyal booking com customers not a punishment , The shower itself was good pity the cubicle was so tiny Nice location 
131176,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Size of the single room like a shoe box heating room was too warm Blind rail fell nearly hitting me on the head Room was incredibly noisy from the traffic , Breakfast was ok staff friendly 
131177,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The stair is probably a few hundred years old but is rickety and needs replaced I don t think there was a lift and I hauled my case up the stairs , Antiquated hotel in a lovely period townhouse a bit shabby inside but was rather charming Location and price is excellent 
131178,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Facility needs a serious remodel except for the shower Carpet in room old why they have carpet in a hotel is beyond me Base flooring outside bathroom door was very uneven probable due to wood rot covered by carpet to disguise poor maintenance , Location and nice shower 
131179,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very small room and unable to open the window Reception supplied me with a fan which made it bearable , Good breakfast and only 5mins walk from Goodge St underground station 
131180,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, This was probably the most pathetic excuse of a hotel room that I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in some dingy places before The room was the converted former exit to the back yard and the hard floor showed obvious signs of water damage To top it off the bed was tiny only 170 cm long about 5 7 I m not tall but even so my feet were sticking out past the bed Clatter from kitchen and a noise from some electrical motor nearby made it impossible to sleep past seven in the morning If they put you in the tiny room half a set of stairs down from the entrance just say no The other rooms in the hotel might be ok but this room was just horrible , The staff was friendly the little I had to do with them That I only stayed here for one night 
131181,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We were positioned in LG1 lower ground where people could see through the window should the curtains be open and we were lying in bed not a big problem BUT the main air con wasn t working and it seemed we had a standing air con unit next to the bed this air con unit generated more heat from the side than the cool air it could produce making the room a sauna we could open the window but have to keep the thick curtains closed for any sort or privacy meaning no cold air would pass through we were up several times in the night for cold showers SLEEPLESS NIGHT,No Positive
131182,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The kitchen staff need to wear hair nets Myself and my partner both had hair in our breakfast , Great sized room and very clean Staff very friendly and helpful
131183,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Why do you need to heat up the rooms to like 25 27 degrees and then use coolers to cool them down Suck a waste The cleanliness leaves a lot to wish for dusty and fithy walls Mattress ok but why not complete it with a decent mattress topper I could feel every spring in the mattress , The location is perfect for those who enjoy Camden Soho China Town and all the theatres Breakfast is ok not excellent but ok 
131184,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, The room could have done with being repainted Pretty much all the woodwork was scuffed although it was clean and as I booked a single I did get a room with a small double and a single so can t really complain 
131185,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, single room was heading to the main street and therefor very loud additionally the room was somewhere overheated therefore it was necessary to open the window not a good combination with the street,No Positive
131186,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Insulation is not good a lot of noise coming from others and outside Room is very small compact , Clean Staff are helpful Price is relatively good
131187,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, When luggage is store its just left in reception area and no one checks you are picking up the right bag when you come back they just leave you to it , Big room really clean good location 
131188,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Noise from the boiler as we were in a basement room Very hot and unable to leave the window open due to noise , Great breakfast great location for theatre and bars restaurants 
131189,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast although very tasty there were not enough tables to seat everyone , Very quiet area with a room with all you need About a 15 minute walk from Covent Garden area so it s perfect for over night theatre trips Room was small but beautiful and modern
131190,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, 1 room very small if your bmi is greater than 20 you will struggle Walls cracked For 100 a night not great sorry i don t like writing this review Honestly the room was just the bed and a foot of space to the left Bathroom v small sink very small 2 poor selection at breakfast on buffet but cooked breakfast ok 3 some hotel staff very rude although to be fair 2 good, location Some staff tried to help Shower good
131191,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The beds were a little uncomfortable There was a problem with the door that needed to be fixed whilst we were there which was fine but they waited until we had come back into our room before they started to fix it, Arrived early and able to check into room straight away Staff were friendly and approachable Great location 10 15 minute walk from Euston station and a 15 minute walk to the Prince Edward Theatre Tea and coffee facilities in the room was a nice bonus For an overnight stay it is ideal and particularly if you want to be within walking distance of Tottenham Court Road and the West End 
131192,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very small cabin room not good if u are tall or big No air con fan only which is uncomfortable given size of room and London was about 30 degrees, Boutique hotel Staff Were pleasant and very helpful Breakfast was made fresh to order and very good Location relatively quiet and convenient yet close to bus routes and underground Recommend for short stay Price maybe considered good for Location Shopping and restaurants close walk 
131193,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Two single beds pushed together don t make for a great sleep especially when they continually drift apart Breakfast room is extraordinarily hot , Decent size room The bathroom although small was very well appointed with a great shower head Good air con in the room Breakfast very tasty 
131194,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Couldn t get into our room twice Key wouldn t work Had to get master key in the end Room was extremely hot air conditioning didn t work had to get a fan It was still extremely hot, Very clean 
131195,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The floor sloped so badly we kept sliding out of bed and had a very poor nights sleep The room was clean but the floor was a real problem, Good location
131196,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Towels in the shower were small ok if you are a very slim person The breakfast room was very small cramped for the amount of guests that were staying , We picked this hotel for its location it was excellent for everywhere we needed to go The room was comfortable very clean Breakfast was very good with a good choice 
131197,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, Such value for money Hotel is in the Heart Of London almost everything within a brisk 15 minute walk 2 tube stations within 5 minute walk very cosy quiet at night and very friendly staff Will DEFINITELY stay here again 
131198,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast area should be bigger to accommodate all guests Some were kept waiting for tables which put pressure on those already seated to eat their breakfast quickly , Tasty breakfast Friendly staff Excellent location Comfortable bed Clean room 
131199,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was so small I couldn t even put my clithes on properly it was part of the landing that got sectioned off and made into a room This was not fairly reflected in the booking process and the price was xomparable to other places I have stayed in where the room size was much better Breakfast was served in the basement with very little ventilation which made the breakfast hall unbearable to sit in No wi fi in rooms either which is atrocious , The location is handy for central London and close to underground stations 
131200,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, A lot of stairs to get the the third floor The room door would not lock and the air conditioning was broken Hopefully both have now been repaired, The room was clean of a reasonable size and relatively quiet for central London The breakfast was good
131201,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed not the greatest Decor a bit tired in some places but clean enough Small room and quite warm but fine for a couple of nights , Nice staff Great location Good restaurants on door step Decent price for 3 accommodation with breakfast inc 
131202,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast room crowded at time we went which was dangerous carrying hot tea coffee between tables with children there However still got fast service Breakfast good Room was very warm but air conditioner provided , Location was good
131203,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Was rather warm and a slightly better fan would have been handy but I hate the heat more than most , Staff were very friendly and very helpful possibly the best I ve encountered in a hotel fantastic breakfast nice comfortable room a little on the small size but fair enough for the price in London 
131204,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, The staff eccept for 1 person were very friendly Small breakfast room but swift service and breakfast was equal to any that I have had in 5 star hotels My triple room at rear of hotel was a normal size room not small and shower area nicely tiled I did notice that the brown carpet bad choice was ravelling at some doorways where they had come away from the gripper bedrooms were comfy bed fine no complaints Would stay there again 
131205,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, My room was hardly bigger than a shoebox For GBP 100 night My feet were hanging off the bed and im not particularly tall 170 cm My room was made out of the way towards the backyard hence the shoebox had 2 doors My room was above the kitchen so i woke up for the smell of eggs and fried bacon i did not like it at all You get much more for value if u add 20 pounds and get a different place , Location was the best thing about the place They also had relatively ok wifi 
131206,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast logistics The order from table that took quite a while though the place wasn t crowded A buffet kind of breakfast is more my cup of tea , The staff was very friendly Location was excellent for our purpose 
131207,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I was first put in basement room which felt like a dungeon I expected a small room but not to be in subterranean level Receptionist was nice and moved me to first floor I had no problems that room was even smaller than the first but there is no double glazing and the noise from the street was continuous I may as well had the bed on the pavement I could not sleep all night I would not recommend him at all , Clean and central
131208,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The single room was very small , The room was clean the bed comfortable and the facilities were satisfactory Staff very nice Breakfast was basic but ok 
131209,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was very small It was literally a corridor turned into a room , The location of the hotel is excellent The room was very clean and the staff were very helpful 
131210,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, A bit noisy being ground floor and fronting on to Gower Street but that was ok No temperature control in the room was a bit warm as are many hotels these days and didn t work out how to open the window although I probably wouldn t have due to the traffic noise , Great value very easy fuss free reception Good breakfast included Small room but plenty big enough for what I needed Good selection of complimentary toiletries Two small bottles of mineral water provided and much appreciated Very clean very nice shower Bed was very comfy with plenty of pillows I stayed here because the local Premier Inn was full but I think I prefer this hotel Certainly I ll be staying here again when I have an early morning meeting in the City I also booked a single room but got a double which was a bonus 
131211,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I had the room LG4 on the lower floor next to the breakfast room I booked a single room and I had a room with a proper double bed which was fantastic but as you can imagine I have been waken up at 6 00am because of the noises around the breakfast room That was extremely unpleasant So make sure to avoid this room , The position was great that is why I have booked this hotel for the second time now The room was very clean as always 
131212,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The rooms could do with updating Staff being a bit more friendlier, The location was good easy walking distance to everywhere we wanted The fact that we could leave our luggage and go back for it later 
131213,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We thought we booked a twin room but apparently that was not true And the staff could do nothing to help us So my mom stayed in the single and I slept in a hostel near by I really wish there had been a manager or some kind of human treatment of us in this situation It left a bad taste in my mouth concerning our reservation , The breakfast was really good for an English breakfast My mom said that it was comfortable enough But tiny she couldn t even turn around in the bathroom 
131214,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, On the third floor no lift not disabled friendly bathroom cramped whole of upper floors sweltering hot breakfast area in basement and also too hot, Breakfast good and staff very helpful Receptionist allowed us to leave our luggage at main reception after check out 
131215,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, The lady on reception on the Sunday afternoon at 3pm on Monday 2 May and again on the morning of Tuesday 3 May was really helpful and friendly Didn t catch her name but please pass on my thanks 
131216,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was tiny only place to sit was on the bed but the television was at standing eye night almost impossible to view from the bed without hurting your neck , Location Cleanliness and staff
131217,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We were in a small but clean room on the top floor There is no lift and therefore had to carry our case s up several flights of stairs The room was very hot and already had a fan tall on a stand and the air conditioning might as well have been non existent The weather outside was warm and obviously heat rises so it was like a sauna and very uncomfortable to sleep in if at all Our complaints were met with a smile and the engineer will be here tomorrow I actually met him and he said the air con was working but said to me what do you expect in the Summer I reminded him it was early May and the whole point of air con was to regulate the temperature to an ambient one The room cooled a little as the outside temperature got lower but not good , The staff were polite but did not deal with our room issue The location of the hotel is good The breakfast was plentiful with good choices The room and the hotel is clean though looking tired in the communal areas 
131218,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The windows were filthy on the INSIDE see photo Could not open the window would have got covered in dirt while trying in any case and the room was too hot Asked them to open it when I went out but they didn t Curtain falling off rail so privacy poor Could hardly hear the tv at times due to traffic noise in a VERY small room tv at foot of the bed Nowhere to put case no room for a chair or table hardly room to stand up beside bed and get dressed Dining room too small so had to queue ages for breakfast Toast was not toasted just died up bread Their philosophy is Pack em in tight and charge a lot of money because we re in a good spot , Only good thing really is location 
131219,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, Pleasant staff and excellent central location and good value for such location Breakfast included I was lucky enough to have a room in the front of the hotel with an air conditioning system I was on the third floor which was good for avoiding the noise of the traffic 
131220,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The inexpensive single room is on the top floor a long walk with a suitcase It s very small but was okay but the position of the safe made it hard to see almost on the floor and inconvenient to use Is there an outlet in the room itself I only saw and used the one in the bathroom but it was great that it took American plugs directly I came with an adapter but didn t need it Wish there had been a second set of pegs and more hangars for clothes since there s no closet But the arrangement in general is really efficient Only other thing a folding chair could hang on a wall peg and be used as needed , Bed very comfortable nice tv very hot water and good water pressure Friendly staff Nice breakfasts While they had full English breakfasts I don t really like that However they had plenty of fresh fruit cheese cereal and toast so I was content I really liked the shady garden 
131221,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Lots to choose for breakfast however my full english was not great, Very close to main places to visit walking distance from underground great value for money
131222,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, How this hotel has 4 stars is completely outrageous It is hugely expensive to what you get I had booked a small single room and it was truly small Beside the small 80 cm single bed there was less than 80 cm floor space width The bathroom was actually no more than 60x120cm and had I not been a quite petite individual I would literally not been able to get into or turn in the tiny shower Good water pressure though ,No Positive
131223,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Micro size room sleepless due to road noise poor room facilities no air cooling system Shower handles jammed not for disabled no sound proofing on walls or windows Window shutter jammed Poor blinds on window No space for suitcase No wardrobe for clothes , Staff
131224,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room LG1 was a basement room below street level next to the Hotel ventilation which was noisy at night Not worth paying 140 Euros per night for such an accomodation ,No Positive
131225,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room LG5 mould in bedroom and bathroom Paint peeling off walls of shower No proper shower screen Ants in bathroom following morning No ventilation only very old fans for any cool air Heating was left on in room on a very hot day making the mould situation worse ,No Positive
131226,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I knew it was a small room but it was really no more than a cupboard I am only 1 63m and I could just about touch both sides of the room Also I could hardly turn around in the shower It was also far too hot and even with a fan provided by reception I had a poor nights sleep , Staff on reception very friendly
131227,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, A bigger bathroom would be nice although it was sufficient , Breakfast was great Room was very warm it almost felt like summer The staff were very courteous and helpful The location is good also We had a wonderful stay 
131228,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No complaints here , The receptionists were very nice and helpful when we needed something Cool people for sure The breakfast was large portions which was good and it was nice to see we can request extras of an item for no charge This location is also by far the best spot in London You are close to everything you d want to see in a circumference I ll definitely be coming back here again without question 
131229,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Generally I don t like carpet on the floors but that very common in the UK and the internet was a little slow but that s also common in London so it s only a minor thing , Big and spacious room spacious en suite bathroom newly renovated very clean and comfort bed I would definately stay there again this location suits my business and activities when in London Goodge Street underground station is only few minutes away And at last my private secret I love organic food and there is a great organic supermarket with diverse food hot and cold buffet called Planet Organic within few minutes walking distance at Torrington Place Highly reccomend it 
131230,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It is dated and is in need to revamping A little paint new carpets would go a long way to making this a far better hotel , We had a double room which was clean safe and had a good bathroom and clean bedding Breakfast was nice 
131231,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The lack of air conditions The room that I was allocated was in the basement which also did not have any air conditions It was ok on a cold day but on a hot day I don t think it would be a very comfortable room , The room was clean and the bed was comfortable 
131232,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was small and it was very hot and i was lucky to have a fan in my room The bedding had a stain on it and the bathroom had pubic hairs on the floor The actual English breakfast was not good I would have my breakfast in a near cafe instead Bacon was like cardboard scrambled eggs didn t taste good and I left most of it , Location was brilliant Plenty of choice wirh breakfast cereal Tea in the room and biscuits was good Staff were polite enough 
131233,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Lobby is not impressive at all When you walk in you do not feel like you are in a good place , Nice hotel best thing about it is location and room cleanliness comfort 
131234,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, Very pleased after booking last minute due to horrendous previous hotel which I left promptly refused to stay Was 7pm Saturday eve with an exhausted 7yr old daughter Short 5 min walk to get food etc Room was lovely clean and comfortable Bathroom very small but fine Staff lovely great breakfast 
131235,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Wifi was slow Room is small but was good for me as a single Noisy insulation is not that good, Stuff were helpful When there was a problem they have acted immediately Clean
131236,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The single bedroom was so small and there were barely any space to put the luggage I had to put my luggage against the door to create more space in the room It felt like there were lack of design plan for storage space had been put into the room since putting the luggage against the door would be considered a safety hazard but it had to be done to be able to open the bathroom door The wall desperately needs to be fixed and the curtain needs a little bit of vacuum done Also I rarely saw any staff on the front desk which is kind of frustating when you need their immediate assistance , Newly upgrade bathroom
131237,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It was very small there is not desk or a table to put things or work if you are in business travel The room close to the street bit noisy the lobby very small you can not really sit there The curtains were dirty , The breakfast was good 
131238,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The entrance smelt of smoke The reception was unmanned rundown messy and dirty Reception staff seemed like they had better things to do than speak to me The walls and windows were rundown and a bit grubby net curtains were grubby bathroom door was grubby house keeping was so poor that the previous guest had left some shoes in the bottom of the wardrobe and house keeping hadn t seen them No ironing facilities or hairdryer in room had to ask for them and this seemed to be an inconvenience to them The outside of the hotel was dirty and rundown Bathroom was TINY like 1 5ft by 2 5ft if that If I had been staying more than one night or had been there for anything more than work I d have checked out before I checked in First impressions count for a lot and my first and last were as bad as each other , The bed was comfy although I do prefer a firmer mattress so some guests may not like this They accommodated my request for an early check in Fire place in the room was a nice touch although purely decorative Room was warm Refilled coffee tray on request Bedding was clean and fresh Breakfast was basic but not terrible
131239,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lift Breakfast room small First room on third floor was small and sloped Moved to basement room which was better , We stayed 2 nights Breakfast was OK good selection Sweet selection on reception was great 
131240,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was very hot when I arrived The sash window and the inner sash were both stuck open so the air conditioning was ineffective The inside of the windows and the frames were absolutely filthy resulting in black handmarks on the walls where other people had obviously tried to move the windows I asked the receptionist to arrange for the window to be closed only to be told it already was I assured her it wasn t and someone did come and close it while I was out However they did not manage to close the inner sash so as a result it was very noisy with traffic and sirens throughout the night Made for a poor nights sleep ,No Positive
131241,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Smallest hotel room I ve ever stayed in had to move my bag around to move in the room Feet touched the wall in the bed Iron smoked when I turned it on Reception smelled of overpowering cleanly products Really noisy as the exterior window had been nailed open and there was just a single pane of extra glazing Uncomfortably hot Very pleased to leave in the morning ,No Positive
131242,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Our room was for 3 adults and a fold out bed had been put up unable to get to the tea coffee facilities which were behind the put up bed Window did not close properly and we were above the kitchen so everything smelt of bacon in our room from 6am , Good location quiet hotel and friendly staff 
131243,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Wifi useless Breakfast service started 7 30 which is late when on business 7am would be better, Good value Room comfortable with lovely newly refurbished en suite Breakfast good
131244,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Rooms were incredibly small and beds for anyone over 5 8 foot was a problem Also I booked for two people and they charged my account even though I stated the two people were paying on departure ,No Positive
131245,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Staff try their best in poor English No management visible or contactable , The room was a tiny cupboard on the cellar Very claustrophobic The sink so tiny the kettle didn t fit under the tap The front desk is not manned until about 1pm and they don t allow you to check in until 2pm even though the room cupboard under the stairs was free not at all value for money
131246,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast served from 7 30 which seems a little late for business guests , The room was very very small as I knew it would be but very well appointed and very nicely furnished everything seems quite new and smart Breakfast was also very good and a welcome inclusion in the price 
131247,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It would be hard going if we were older or infirm as we were on the top floor with steep stairs and no lift but this is a Victorian property and we enjoyed the charm and overall feel of the building , After seeing some bad reviews we were worried about our stay but were very pleasantly surprised Roomy bedroom friendly staff clean and comfortable overall Very nice breakfast included Would certainly stay again And very reasonable price near a good secure car park too 
131248,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lift Traffic noise when the room is on the main road , Location is excellent It is close to university tube station shops and restaurants English breakfast is good Have been to Bloomsbury Palace Hotel 6 times Never had anything to complain about 
131249,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Small and crammed area for breakfast Staff unable to understand what your menu choice was required for breakfast Insufficient room in bedroom , It served its purpose for our needs
131250,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The bed springs had gone on one side so the bed tilted and was very uncomfortable The plaster was chipping off the walls The blinds were dirty The bedside lamp was broken , The location was good 
131251,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast was terrible, Bed was fine and room decent Staff was gentle and room was quite clean although with marks on the sheets and holes in the curtain Very nice view from the window at the garden Very quite room 
131252,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Mega tiny room Wasn t a single room Was smaller than a box room The hotel and room was boiling hot Was unable to turn heating off , Staff friendly 
131253,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Had issues with the checking in Took over an hour to resolve with bloomsbury denying my reservation despite me having email proof from Booking Com and then asking to just purchase another room to deal with it in the morning as this was getting very late into the night with work the next morning Seemed very reserved to assist and then Booking com finally answered the phone to refuse any form of compensation Booking Com blaming the Bloomsbury palace and the Bloomsbury palace blaming Booking com Overall did not feel like a guest in the hotel and more a nuisance ,No Positive
131254,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The noises outside of the traffic passing by was hard to ignore A good night s sleep was nearly impossible , The service was friendly The complimentary breakfast was an excellent standard English breakfast The facilities in the room were nice if tiny 
131255,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was indeed extremely small though I was prepared for it after having read reviews before booking I was travelling with a backpack so little space was not a major issue but those travelling with larger suitcases and planning to put their stuff around the room should think twice as there is really no extra space anywhere Also the room was a bit dusty , The location is great just 5 min from the British Museum and very close to several tube stations The staff were friendly cleaning was done efficiently The shower worked well 
131256,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room 105 was ludicrously small The wall was cold and given how small the room was I woke up every time I turned in bed The breakfast was mediocre poached eggs hard white sliced bread , 
131257,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was too warm the window was jammed open so I couldnt close it and there was traffic noise all night , The location is very handy for British Museum Oxford St etc The room was reasonably good value for money in the centre of London 
131258,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It could definitely be more clean I couldn t say that it was dirty But I stayed for four nights and the sheets were not changed not even once There was an issue with the sink it was draining extremely slowly and as a result it was getting dirty very fast I have noticed that it wasn t cleaned either even if my room was made up The breakfast was offered for a very short time 7 30 9 00 so all the clients of the hotel were trying to get served on the same time The waitresses were doing their best but under such pressure of work and pressure of time their work was not easy at all Longer breakfast hours could make life easier both for the customers and the workers The room was extremely small not the smallest i have stayed to in London though And extremely hot The bed was OK but the furniture and deco was definitely tired And the walls too as you could see huge cracks from the top to the bottom , This hotel is in a very nice area Just a stone drop from the British museum surrounded from universities and museums close to several stations of the underground and bus stops it s central safe and convenient The room was warm and was offering coffee and tea facilities The breakfast was quite rich as except the full English breakfast there was also offered a good variety of juices cereals and tea 
131259,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The smallest room I have ever seen even in Japan In a traveller lodge I had a better room Nobidea how a 9 square meter room including bath cam be legal Small Dirty Awful , Excellent position
131260,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, tiny bathroom room heater takes a long time to work hotel does not have luggage storage no elevator triple rooms would usually have 3 songle beds ours only has 2 single beds and 1 sofa bed phone is not working , english breakfast
131261,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Double bed was a bit hard and not a double more of a 3 4 bed, Was clean and served its purpose it s more of a B B than a hotel Good power shower in the room
131262,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Shelf in the bathroon would have been good but nice fluffy towels made up for inconvenience, Great location Friendly staff Good variety for breakfast Comfortable clean room and really nice sweeties at the front desk 
131263,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, small breakfast room due to automatic ventilation starting at around 6am we have had a lot of aroma smell from the kitchen in our room, excellent location near to BM and all small museums belonging to the University walking distance to London Eye via Traf sq cca 30min Oxford st cca 10min 
131264,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, A small uncomfortable bed very short Ill fitting door poorly blacked out small window above the door meant some light came into the room at night No chair in room The bathroom sink so small virtually unusable, staff friendly and helpful 
131265,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Few small issues with room cracks and paint missing on walls especially around window Room was very warm but a fan was present for us There is air conditioning but I was told it s turned off in winter even though it is Spring now the guests don t get the choice to us it, The hotel was perfect for a short stay Decor was lovely Wonderful hot strong showers Breakfast was very tasty and staff were very attentive Staff very friendly Great location
131266,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast The buffet just have fruit cereals and coffee You have to ask for the breakfast and it s only available English breakfast, We ve booked a triple room and we had lots of space The toilet was very good new with a very nice shower The location was good 15 minutes walking to the best part of Oxford Street and 3 minutes walking to the tube 
131267,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Three flights of stairs with a suitcase was tough needed a lift Also no air con as it was March but rooms were roasting Rooms are small and bathrooms are tiny Breakfast room small and got very busy so often have to wait a bit for a table and not much room to wait Check out at 10 30am too early , Location was excellent 5 minutes walk to a tube station that was only a stop away from Oxford street could also walk to Oxford street from hotel Cooked breakfast was served super fast after ordering good choice of cereals fruit and yoghurt also Room was comfortable and modern Staff friendly 
131268,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, basement room a bit small and warm air con faulty breakfast room cramped but did the job not the best full english ive had sausage was full of bone gristle good location for theatre tube and food and good price probably wouldnt use it again though ,No Positive
131269,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny tiny tiny room small single Very uncomfortable bed Almost non existent Wi Fi connection No TV signal Nowhere to hang clothes Not enough room to store luggage and move around room No bedside table lamp No air con and window sealed off Surly breakfast staff This particular room was not really fit for purpose and not worth the money despite the location , The location The shower Clean bathroom Breakfast was okay Some pleasant members of staff
131270,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Ridiculously small single room containing shabby furniture dirty glassware and a tiny rock hard bed Clearly no thought at all given to comfort of guests ,No Positive

131272,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny rooms Single glazed Windows let in cold and street noise Woeful breakfast Coffee was cold , Location is great Staff were competent and friendly 
131273,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There was clanking from the radiator which didn t stop even when I turned it off Had to wear ear plugs Tiny room even by London standards , Friendly reception staff Good location 
131274,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I really can t believe this hotel is classified as 4 stars a part from the price Rooms are so small that you can t open your luggage no wardrobe and you don t have enough air for breathing New windows have been placed over the old ones and in order to open them you have to jump on the bed when I tried to open it to have more air it suddenly fell down and I could have seriously hurt my hands and fingers It was really dangerous , position
131275,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The single rooms can be on the small side although this varies and is I suppose down to luck , The double rooms are certainly a better option Always clean Very central location Friendly and helpful staff 
131276,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There was never enough space in the morning in the breakfast room on 2 of the 3 days I was there so I was not really able to enjoy breakfast properly Also there is no lifts so its difficult if you re on the 3rd floor to take your suitcase up the steep stairs, staff were helpful and overall nice and comfortable place
131277,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room in had on the road side of the building and the additional window installed to reduce traffic sound was broken and wouldn t close This meant I only had about 5 hours of sleep if that The room is also very small so at nearly 6ft tall I had to sleep at an angle to prevent my feet pressing on the wall Could have gotten much nicer had I paid just 10 more for a different hotel, The hotel was very close to where I had to go the following day so very convenient for me At that price I couldn t expect too much 
131278,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed too short I m 5ft 11 and room was very very draughty the room wasn t really a room but an outhouse to the back door , It is clean 
131279,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast served at the table you needed to wait which is not very convenient during business trip The room was too small and not very comfortable Dirty curtains , Good location The bed was very comfortable Both the linen and the towels clean The bathroom of good standard Very helpful and professional staff 
131280,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Towels too small and nowhere to hang them Very Hot in ground floor room and difficult to adjust temperature , Nice comfy beds Decent breakfast Good central location
131281,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, When I requested an iron as they said I could do they proceeded to tell me there were no irons or boards after saying they didn t know what one was I was due for an important examination the next day and needed an iron It left me looking scruffy There was no change in the breakfast for people who had to leave before it officially started Lights came through the window all night Very small room, The shower was nice Good location Bed was comfy
131282,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Six flights of stairs to room Very loud street traffic if staying in front facing room Redecoration in room and hallways urgently required No security for left luggage you must leave it in reception without any supervision, Excellent location for West End Very good wifi Nice breakfast Comfy bed
131283,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast was chaotic and there was not enough room to sit down Staff were rushed off their feet trying to cope , Very central and convenient for seeing London Room was clean and comfortable Staff were friendly and helpful 
131284,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed was a bit hard for our liking and windows frames in need of repair in our room and we had to wait for a table for breakfast as room is quite small when everyone arrives for breakfast at the same time but no hardship having to wait for 5 mins , Nice breakfast and staff were very helpful on reception they even printed our 2 for 1 voucher out for the zoo Thank you Breakfast staff were very nice and we re flat out catering for everyone 
131285,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, the front receptionists were very nice friendly and welcoming also the young man on the night time shift went out of his way to get the iron and some juice and bring it to me room 10 10 
131286,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, More drawer storage in room a good job we were only in for one night Breakfast period too short 7 30 to 9 00 which meant that the staff were run off their feet dining room very cramped They did an amazing job under the circumstances , Light airy room Comfortable bed Tea coffee making facilities adequate but not fully replenished 
131287,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I was on the first floor at the front of the building in room 108 It was comfortable but super small no hanging space and very noisy as it was directly above the street I would ask for a room at the back or higher up next time , Shower was great and bed very comfortable
131288,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It was obvious that there were 3 of us staying and only 2 sets of towels on first night and only 1 set on 2nd night Also no sheet on fold down bed and despite asking we got given a duvet Staff didn t really understand what we were saying Also only 1 toilet roll put in toilet at any one time Had to keep asking for additional toilet rolls , Very quiet room at back of hotel Excellent location Good breakfast and plenty choice
131289,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny room narrow stairs I know what did I expect but 6 stories between my room and breakfast and that s a lot to navigate with no elevator , Some of the desk staff were great others less so the bed was quite confortable
131290,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Small rooms but again cheap prices make up for it The breakfast room is a bit bleak but you get a decent full English breakfast which will last you a full day , Although it was very small the room was very clean and nicely designed Not the romantic type hotel but very convenient for solo or business travelers The staff was very friendly as well 
131291,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed was uncomfortable and my room didn t have any air conditioning I didn t want to open the window because of the noise from the street , Great location and price good breakfast I had a small room which was good for a one night solo traveller 
131292,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, room was next to kitchen and stank of fried food and they have no proper towels just like very small face towels for you to shower with You can hear all the noise from the room above and form the reception as I had the 1st floor room , bed was ok
131293,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There was plenty of storage but a drawer or two would have made it 100 instead of 99 9 , After reading mixed reviews on here I am unsure what others were expecting an think some reviews are extremely unfair yes it was my personal view but for London and the central area the Hotel is located and for the price well I was expecting less than what I got if I am honest I have stayed in some terrible hotels in the past in London but I give this one an 10 10 Everything really was superb 100 Staff room facilities location breakfast all 10 10 I had no complaints at all if I had a problem it was dealt with efficiently and promptly and actually looking back the only problem I had was with the sofa bed the staff had kindly put out and made up in my room and I needed it taken down and well I struggled Tadeusz the lovely maintenance guy was more than happy to help he ad only knocked to see if everything was okay I decided to take myself to London as a belated birthday treat to see Dickens museum and The museum of London Crime Museum uncovered Kamila was there on arrival greeted me with a big smile welcomed me let me freshen up as I was early and wanted to go out to a museum gave me a map of the area and directions being a single traveller and a woman on my own and not having travelled on my own for years Kamila had offered any problems whilst out to call the hotel That gave me such confidence When check in came Kamila asked how the museum was and generally was interested I went and checked in my room was lovely big t v massive arm chair which was a sofa bed if required Bathroom and shower had two settings was great and clean Wardrobe plenty of hangers space and a safe which was peace of mind to leave lots in my room Tea and coffee facilities and my room looked onto a court yard was lovely with birds and peaceful for where the hotel was located 
131294,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was to small entering wind through all the windows The bed to small and I only am 1 73cm, The location is very good Personal is very friendly
131295,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Compact single room but was OK for one night visit had everything needed, Excellent location in central London near Euston and UCL Nice breakfast and included wifi Great value for one night stay 
131296,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, The rate included a full English breakfast which was cooked to order and piping hot Perfect location for sightseeing in London Staff very friendly I was able to leave my luggage the day I arrived and after I checked out at no extra cost 
131297,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Our room was situated so there was a constant through the night noise like a lorry reversing This went on all night I had two hours sleep and ruined the next day as we were all so tired Second thing and this is the thing that would make me never stay again when my husband checked in he was told breakfast was till 10am We arrived at 9 02am a really rude waitress told us we were 2 min late so could not have the cooked breakfast we were really looking forward too She was not even apologetic in her manner just point blank rude When she left the room the other guests also commented on her rudeness to us So unfortunately for us we had a room where a noise kept us up till around 6am we finally had two hours sleep then we re refused breakfat Would never go back and a colleague of mine is cancelling her booking there in August , Room nice and clean 
131298,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, This time my stay was awful I get room G2 on ground floor Before reconstruction of hotel on this place was restroom and shower So room was very very small After check in in room was so cold as on the street There was additional heating source but it was connected on electricity don t work when remove hotel card In the room are 2 big windows as before there was toilet and in the room was so windy that I can t sleep in the bed I moved the bed to other side of the room But than I blocked all door to toilet to go out It was very uncomfortable every evening and morning to move bed and in general cold and windy Once more ventilation system in this room looks like are common with the kitchen When in the morning they started with breakfast in the room was a smell of burning singeing Very strong smell I was in this hotel many times but this time my room I can t call as a room , Location Staff was helpful 
131299,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I used to pay the hotel room charge when I check out However it was paid as soon as after booked hotel In this case I cannot use this booking com application , it is nearby British museum 
131300,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No option of late check out or room service to have breakfast in room floorboards above our room very squeaky and noisy, Ideal spot with walkable distance to the underground and shops
131301,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I definitely would not recommend staying here We arrived in the morning to leave our suitcases and couldn t check in yet which was fine However there was no secure space available to leave our luggage it was just left next to the reception desk all day When we came back later to check in we were given room G03 on the ground floor It was the worst room I have ever seen The room was right next to the hotel entrance so noise was definitely a problem The room was tiny you could only access the bed from one side and the tv was to the right of the bed so it would have been impossible to watch The window opened on to the side walk of Gower Street which has a lot of traffic at all times of day so noise was definitely a problem from that side as well There was a horrible smell in the room it smelled like the bathroom hadn t been cleaned in months We went to the reception to ask for a different room because the one we were given was not inhabitable but all they could offer us was some febreeze to mask the smell We ended up having to find another hotel at 8pm in the evening the night before a big work meeting , There was relatively little argument about refunding our payment straight away 
131302,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Staff in dining room need to learn to have manners and smile Breakfast certainly wasn t delicious a 4cup cafeti re for a 30seater dining room is ridiculous Yes rooms small but adequate as not in room much anyway , Ideally situated for Covent Garden Oxford st etc 
131303,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast finished at 9 too early in my opinion hotel does not supply towels We were not told this before arriving says on website has showers and toiletries Rooms small bed small boyfriend only 5 9 and his feet over hung the bed Very noisey from 7 30am onwards herds of elephants going up and down the stairs safe in room broken sign basically saying if anything gets stolen it s not the fault of the hotel Air con and heating in room was also broken good location but terrible hotel although staff were friendly, Good location for trains etc staff were friendly
131304,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was very small and definitely not big enough for third person When we arrived third bed not made up and only one member of staff on duty She did not know where to get bed linen to make up bed We asked if there was a bigger room and we looked at one in the basement and one on the second floor We opted for the room on second floor I had originally requested a ground floor The second floor was inconvenient due to carrying luggage Very small shower room ,No Positive
131305,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Probably the smallest hotel room I have stayed in around the world with the bed taking up nearly the whole area There was mud on the valance around the bed The A C failed and the room was so stuffy and hot that I had to open the window on to noisy Gower St all night I was given a fan by reception which helped a bit , The breakfast and the shower toilet were fine 
131306,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The service at breakfast was diabolical I was not greeted at all despite several waitresses wondering rudely past me There was no glass on my table so had to wait until more were brought into the room I stood waiting as there was no coffee either and half of the cutlery was missing I stared at a waitress who finally asked if I wanted anything My breakfast came fairly quickly but toast was delayed Then there was no butter left and when the waitress spent several minutes wondering in and out and my toast getting cold came with a pot of margerine and told me the butter was frozen Not good service at all and let the hotel down completely , Really great location within walking distance of Tottenham court Road Hotel was clean and modern Good shower and comfy bed I had a single room which was tiny but all I needed for my trip The receptionist was very professional and helpful 
131307,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We booked a double bed room which was very small and compact the room temperature was boiling hot without having heating on and nothing to cool it down but there was a portable fan and we couldn t use it Went for breakfast just before the closing time and there were so many people in the room having breakfast but there were no staff and I noticed couple of staff in the kitchen who were busy checking time on their wrist watch They both saw me standing but didn t bothered yo come out So i went back to my room and tried to make cuppa tea but there was no tea spoon anywhere O dear We just checked out and went to the cafe nearby and had breakfast , The price was reasonable Clean toilet and bathroom
131308,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The single sofa bed, 3 of us stayed here So there was a double bed and a sofa bed The most uncomfortable bed i have ever tried to sleep in Apart from that everything else was very good Location was exceptional
131309,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Wasn t the cleanest hotel but was perfectly adequate Receptionist when we checked in was lovely but rest of staff were not quite so welcoming Again not a problem if you just want to come and go Only real issue was the luggage storage not very secure and worried that somebody may take a liking to our cases more Was fine though All in all a good stay and would definitely stay again , Excellent location for exploring London in quite a charming Street Very close to the university so lots of students but not an issue whatsoever Room was spacious with good facilities and shortbread biscuits Breakfast was pretty good too 
131310,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Just felt rooms were a little to warm at night for ladies of a certain age , Great location for the theatres and central to other of londons sights Did not need an Oyster card as everywhere was in walking distance Clean and friendly hotel and all requirements were met The room was at back of hotel which meant it was quiet Yes Even met Hotel Manager and proceeded to congratulate him on a well run hotel and cleanliness was too notch 
131311,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Early breakfast times could be extended Very cold room as rotten window and wind blew straight in and stayed when temperatures were at freezing, Staff very helpful and quick service Excellent location for what we wanted to do
131312,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, as the weather was cold a blanket would have been a nice addition , location near to the venue for my work and to the British Museum to see an exhibition 10 mins walk from mainline and underground stations 
131313,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The sofa bed was a bit hard and the corridors and the staircase narrow , Triple room was large clean and the location was perfect especially for the money The AC and wifi were working fine Breakfast was quite extensive 
131314,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I have never been in such a small room I couldn t even open my suitcase But then I have been told that many London rooms are very small , Staff was very helpful in every way possible 
131315,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lift but not a big problem for us , We thought for the money 85 pounds to be 12mins walk from covent garden and having a full cooked fresh full english breakfast it was great yes the bathroom was small but so what it was clean and newly decorated and I didnt come to London for a bathroom I would stay again and am sending friends
131316,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The bed was too small and the room absolutely too noisy , Good location english breakfast served everyday overall cleanliness hotel room fully refurbished 
131317,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was smaller than expected but alright for one night Was Noisy from the traffic in Gower Street all night as the Double Glazing Window was broken , Good Location and nice Breakfast 
131318,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Small room and tiny bathroom but standard for European hotels , Good breakfast Excellent central location Tube stations very close Buses run past the door Can walk to a lot of attractions Laundry convenience stores close 
131319,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, quality of room not baby friendly despite a phone call prior to booking to say it was carpet rod grippers visible and could be stood on travel cot not real cot again despite a call prior to booking to confirm it wasn t a travel cot reception staff not friendly at all , friendly maintenance man location
131320,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, 1 Only reserve the room designated as small if it is for a child or if you are really desperate There is really very little space and almost none to put clothes let alone to store luggage 2 Very little lounge space area in the building for someone to use in order to avoid staying in the room in my case working inside the room is completely impractical unless you decide to use the bed 3 The basement restaurant area is uncomfortably small and it felt totally cramped at least whenever I tried to use it 4 There was a waiting line for breakfast which was mediocre , 1 Very good location small distance from several tube stations several University of London buildings UCL and the British Museum 2 Friendly personnel doing the best they could given the infrastructure 
131321,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Staff seemed a little unsure of what was what and also no room to leave luggage just stored freely in reception, Excellent location and cleanliness of rooms Breakfast very good too
131322,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was on the small side Was in a room facing the street so there was a bit of traffic noise , Good location close to a few tube stations and bus stop across the road Covent Garden Canden Soho all within walking distance Good breakfast 
131323,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The breakfast staff were rude the room floor was uneven the bed was tilted on one side making it difficult to sleep in without falling out the window had a huge gap in the frame letting quite a draft in , The location was good breakfast was good 
131324,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, 1 Staff is on call 24 hour to ensure security and all our requests 2 Treat this as a real hotel because they provide full service like private bathrooms and room service but at a guesthouse price 3 Right opposite to bus station which are departing from St Pancras King s Cross Station Super convenient 4 Nice full English breakfast for all 5 Walking distance to The British Museum 
131325,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The staff were horrible On arrival I got no information other than here s your key go up these stairs I then proceeded to carry a 30kg bag up two flights of steps with no help while the staff chatted away below me On check out I asked what s the address for a cab and received the answer oh I don t know Google it , It was comfortable enough but small Location was easy to get around and I enjoyed wandering 
131326,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, When I arrived the allocated room had not been prepared the staff apologised and allocated me a new room which was ready , Location was good for train and theatres I walked everywhere did not use public transport after arriving in St Pancras 
131327,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The bed and pillows were very hard They had nowhere to store luggage apart from next to the reception desk and no way of monitoring who collected the bags The breakfast finished very early , It was close to where we needed to be The breakfast was good and varied Excellent value for money Lovely shower 
131328,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Rooms were too small especially it is impossible to live in single small room I think its better to book the normal single rooms they were better , Location was perfect friendly staff I stayed for 5 nights i dont have any complains and the staff was friendly and very helpful for everything It is really close to oxford street and picadilly line
131329,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, Friendly efficient attentive staff Great selection for breakfast Reception attended 24hrs a day CCTV WiFi We had basement room which was very quiet clean and comfortable About 15 minutes walk from Euston station and further 15 20 minutes walk to Chinatown Covent Garden West End Big Ben 
131330,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room and bathroom were functional but small in loft type conversion Breakfast room was very basic No lift 3 floors Could get noisy walls thin Price a bit high Shabby lace curtain , Breakfast was great friendly staff Area was OK short distance to attractions and station Clean and comfortable 
131331,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, there s no lift so if you struggle with stairs I would avoid , Everything was great Location around 15 mins walk to Leicester square very quiet breakfast size of room wifi helpful staff only downside was no lift highly recommend if u can get for no more than 115 00
131332,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Not the best selection for breakfast but it was included in the price you get what you pay for , The room was clean and tidy Really near Goodge Street within 5 minutes walking distance
131333,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, These are minor issues which would make a considerable difference overall The ground floor room I stayed in would benefit from additional glazing to mute traffic noise An insecure tap fitting in the basin made me concerned not to break it It was a shame one of the waitresses in the breakfast room didn t understand the word sandwich , I felt welcome when I arrived The hotel cost per night is reasonable for London It is situated close to Euston station UCL good restaurants in nearby Store Street 
131334,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was very very small not much bigger than a cupboard TV s Arial was not plugged in and there was no instruction of how to do so Unable locate the socket No room for chair nor writing table Forced to use the room for only sleeping The window blind was broken and could not be lifted I had to discover how the lighting was activated , Location
131335,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There s no lift but the highest floor is 3 so it s not a big deal if you re moderately healthy, After reading the reviews I was a bit worried going to the hotel but I was pleasantly shocked when I arrived the hotel was great I am actually surprised about all the negative comments I personally can t fault it I guess most people who disliked it never been to properly shabby hotels Yes the room is small but well decorated comfortable newly refurbished and clean and there is definitely space for the suitcase I didn t have any smell in my room either The bathroom was clean and towels changed daily Rooms had wifi and flat screen tv with plenty of channels Full english breakfast although I wish they served porridge too But the best bit is certainly location Just 2 min walk from the tube Goodge street and walking distance to Covent Garden or Oxford street 15 min or Euston sq 10 min A couple of restaurants and Tesco Metro nearby too Overall I m extremely pleased with the facilities and value for money 
131336,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There is a reason for the price The room was extremely small Got a room on the Gower Street side I would not have that again , Good location Good breakfast New bathroom Value for money It was cheap 
131337,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room it s self comfortable enough but vicinity of road made it very noisy if on front ground floor , Room it s self comfortable enough but vicinity of road made it very noisy if on front ground floor 
131338,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lift in the hotel you or the staff have to carry your luggage up a maximum of 4 flights of somewhat narrow stairs I ve seen narrower stairs if your room is on the top floor 3rd floor The desk staff offered someone to help My wife and I are both healthy walkers and climb stairs with ease but people with bad knees may be challenged , Desk staff was very competent spoke English and probably other languages helpful about best use of taxis and buses and on duty at any hour that we were awake or returning from shows or dinner Breakfast was a full English breakfast Juices milk good strong coffee cereals toast jams jellies tea sausages English bacon eggs scrambled perfectly or fried perfectly baked beans saut ed mushrooms apples pears bananas oranges served by a friendly staff with short waiting time Our triple room double bed plus twin size pull out sofa bed would have been a little tight for 3 people in the room but was adequate for my wife and I especially when we had the sofa bed mattress taken away on request Comfortable bed and pillows with usable night stands each side of the bed wardrobe with adequate hangers and safe for valuables Adequate bathroom that included the W C lavatory and shower plenty of hot water and pressure and 110 volt and 220 volt American receptacles in the bathroom Plenty of Great Britain style 220 volt receptacles in the room and good lighting in the room and bathroom Altogether spiffy No traffic or other outside noise coming into our room 
131339,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was so small that a person my size could not even fit I am a fairly small person and me and my luggage together was too much for this 5sqm small little space including bathroom that shower tho new was tiny and toilet seat was so close to sink that event I could hit my head The bed squezed toward to window was getting so much street noise I though I was gonna get nauseous from street pollution I can not warn you enough Internet photos do not always show reality There are better places for this price I urge Booking dot com to find better places or double check photo reality ratio , Bathroom was renovated and the sheets were clean Thank God Other than that everything about this hotel was wrong 
131340,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Nothing, Clean excellent location very comfortable Friendly Helpful staff Pound for pound better than most more expensive hotels I have stayed at 
131341,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I had a terrible experience and have since tried several times to contact the manager who has failed on each time to get back in touch with me On my first night i was woken up at 1 45 in the morning by a loud alarm going off outside my room I had to phone reception to inform them to turn it off It came on again later on in the night and completely disrupted my sleep I woke up late and tired and was so upset by the previous nights events I didn t want to eat breakfast so went out to a cafe instead on route to my meeting The following morning i was due to travel back to Devon and was very upset to find no hot water whatsoever in the shower None one in the hotel explained or apologised to me and I later overheard the receptionist say that someone was going to come and fix it later that day I would like a part refund but this hotel isn t responding Please help , The location was great and the female receptionist was very friendly 
131342,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Triple room in the underground floor very dark looking like a dungeon the pictures on booking com shows very different above the ground room Due to walls ceiling curvature it was not possible to place mirror on normal height so shaving required bending me back During the day of our stay there was no hot water boiler malfunction and the staff started action to fix it only after my call There was no heating December either and the personnel was very well aware of the issue they were using electric heater at the reception desk but they started acting on the issue only when I directly asked them to do so There were no additional blankets in the whole hotel I don t even mention lack of blankets in the room as there was no cabinet in the room to store them or your belongings There is air conditioning mentioned on booking com in my room I was only able to find old fan it was cold so no big issue For me it looks like the universal recipe for a hotel in London take some old place invest in it once then run it for 20 years without any repairs and call for serious amount of money The word Palace in hotel s name is just a sad joke , Location
131343,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was minuscule Only just enough space to cram a single bed in Don t use if you have any incling of claustophobia Breakfast was canteen style Far from palacial , Convenient for travel and venue 
131344,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very expensive and not that value for money Rooms are bad Rooms services are not available Cleaning people are a bit rude Rooms are very small and very congested , Location is great Close to the direct lines and walking distance from all the hubs
131345,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room I stayed in was really small The toiletries were uninspiring , The food breakfast was nice and filling The staff were helpful and pleasant 
131346,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Extremely small room too small for a wardrobe you can t walk in the room The door hardly opens Window was broken noise cold air light was flickering Wifi extremely slow and unstable , Quiet location close to the underground shops and restaurants nearby Tidy uncomplicated dealings with the reception Has TV Wifi bathroom shower daily fresh towels and bed made 
131347,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Noise and smell from the kitchen, The hotel is lovely but I had the lower ground floor room next to the kitchen so there was a smell of frying in the room and when the kitchen woke up early in the morning so did I Other rooms would be fine I m sure 
131348,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative, We booked the room two hours before the arriving and it was quite cheap for a last minute booking The room was small but it was nice and comfortable as well We really enjoyed it 
131349,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, On top floor so lots of stairs hotel was very warm slept with window wide open thus making it noisey , Great location for central London not too far from anywhere 
131350,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Rooms facing onto Gower Street can be noisy earplugs may be of use to light sleepers , No fuss accommodation easily reached from several underground lines 
131351,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very noisy as the rooms are just next to a main road Asked if I can have a quiet room but was told everything they have faces the road, Great location Good breakfast
131352,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny tiny room But did all I needed as was only there to sleep However the road was very noisy, Useful location for the course I was attending at Great Ormond Street
131353,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast room was too small and crowded, Very quiet location Walking distance to Covent Garden and Theatres The room was small but had everything you needed
131354,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Didn t sleep well at all as sound insulation to road was poor The old window wouldn t close properly so I was subject to very loud traffic noise for most of the night A corridor fire door wasn t working properly so it banged loudly into the early ours , The location was convenient
131355,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The bed was so small I had my feet sticking out all night plus I wasn t a proper double bed so struggled to sleep If in paying over 100 quid I expect a decent sleep , Location was great and it looked nice from outside Staff were nice and helpful

131361,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, From what I could tell my room was actually a converted entrance hall with a single bed in it I m used to having small rooms in London but this really was ridiculous The bed was so small that my feet were hanging out of the bottom I m 5 9 and it was situated alongside a drafty window so I had a draft on my face all night At the top of the bed was where I assume the back door used to be so more drafts came through here , The breakfast was good with lots of choice and the staff were friendly

131400,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was tiny and there wasn t a traveler compatible outlet in the bathroom but that s my only complaint Not a deal breaker by any means , This was a very central location which I loved Walking distance to most everything or a two block walk to the nearest underground station The staff was very helpful and friendly I d definitely stay there again 
131401,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was ridiculously small Basically the size of the small bed and the doorway Smallest I have ever experienced Not even room to put your travel bag down Literally a cupboard , Location and modern fittings Also good cleanliness 
131402,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We were on the top floor and there is no elevator which made lugging our suitcases up the staircases a bit of a challenge , Staff were very helpful Location couldn t have been better so close to train station and the British Museum Room was large clean and obviously recently refurbished with new fittings Breakfast each morning was very good

131412,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The only negative would be to keep on top of the decoration as it did look a little tired and lacking in character given the age of the property , When we arrived we were greeted with a pleasant smile by the male receptionist the check in was quick and we were offered a choice of two rooms as we were a party of three The location was very good within 15 mins walking distance to many attractions and places of interest The breakfast had a good choice of cereals fresh fruit yogurts toast cooked breakfast fruit juices tea and coffee enough to set you up for a day of exploring the capital or your important businesses meeting
