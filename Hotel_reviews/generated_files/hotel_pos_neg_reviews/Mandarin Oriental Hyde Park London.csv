230275,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, It would be hard to improve on excellence, The entire stay was excellent from check in to check out The staff in the Hotel were very very good and made our stay very enjoyable 
230276,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, Old facility Aircon didnt work when we arrived They finally moved me to a different room after I insisted They tried to bring in portable aircon one that you can move around Never ever do that again MO An upgrade is the least you can do for a hotel your class , Prime location for shopping and sightseeing
230277,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, Air conditioning did nit cool enough Housekeeper came late everyday at around 4pm so when we got back everyday we either had to leave or skip the service entirely , Room decor nice and bathroom excellent
230278,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, The room i booked including BF and 20 tax with courtyard view was aprox aed 10 530 however when i arrived the hotel charged 14000 dirhams for the room not aure why and they dis not clarify The room had not view at all one window was blocked by construction which the hotel did not mention they were having Second window was to the fire eacape The person at the reception said unless i pay they will mot change my room which was very disappointing honestly i was there for 3 nights to drop off my 12 yr old to summer school my first time in the city amd they made me feel u welcome and i didnt appreciate their treatment They ahould have changed the room since they have over charged me almoat 1200 ,No Positive
230279,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, Heavy building work at the time of our stay with drilling noises from 8am Water shut with no warning for several hours we could not shower that morning, Good location and friendly staff
230280,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, Construction site in the middle of the hotel Entrance blocked by trucks And this comes at 900 pounds plus plus all taxes etc THAT WAS A RIPP OFF ORGANISED BY THEM AND YOU , You did not tell me that they are undergoing a major renovation The entrance was a construction site They claimed you were informed and you have to announce it on time of booking But you did not I think you are the guilty party not them
230281,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, The towels were dirty And there is a renovation going on so we had to use side door to walk in and out of the hotel If that was mentioned in on booking I would not book this hotel , I like the location of the hotel it was a walking distance from Harrods Sloan street and Hydepark 
230282,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, The only downer was that there were renovation works taking place so we had no view from our room which made the room very dark so we needed the light on all the time , The staff were excellent they were so attentive and really made our stay a very comfortable one 
230283,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, There is a bit of renovation going on to the outside of the Hotel but this does not in any way impact on your stay , Where to start Firstly this beautiful hotel is situated in Knightsbridge directly opposite to Harvey Nicholls and 100 meters away from Harrods My room looked out over Hyde Park and it was an amazing experience to wake up to The staff is amazing and they made me feel like I was an old friend From the welcome of the reception team to the friendliness of the food and beverage team I felt pampered on every occasion The concierge team was probably the best I have experienced in the 91 countries I have travelled to They arranged shopping for me for me from a sports shop not close by and were fantastic in getting us a booking at NOPI restaurant on the day The rooms are very comfortable and the bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on Well done to the entire team 
230284,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, I get lost inside the hotel There was no view due to the construction , Staff was very nice and helpful Arrange a birthday cake in the room Location was perfect Room was amazing as well 
230285,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, Shame that the inprovement work was still on going whilst we were there Looking forward to going back when it s all finished, This was the last day of our honeymoon and they really made a fuss of us 
230286,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, I own a building and roofing company and really didn t expect to be living in one no warning and scaffold and work men everywhere I complained but no one cared, Staff were amazing breakfast was lovely although I got charged 29 for picking up a piece of pineapple from the contintel section scaffold and workmen everywhere I would pick a different hotel until the refurbishment is complete
230287,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, There was a giant construction in the hotel Booking com should be aware of the situation and warn its clients We were shocked when we arrive to the hotel ,No Positive
230288,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, Its hard to be perfect i know but simple things such as not letting rooms out that are within direct earshot of the very noisy renovation would be a good start Having to pay for WiFi access in this type of hotel is nonsense high room rates set this hotel apart from all others so to charge for something so trivial seems petty , The staff Superb From arriving at the front door to leaving the next day simply exceptional service Even when things were not quite right the situation was dealt with in a polite efficient and courteous manner that was much appreciated The food in the restaurant was of the highest quality and a real treat to the taste buds once again the service was impeccable Location is excellent only a stones throw away from Harrods and all the bling of Knightsbridge with Harvey Nichols directly opposite the hotel But the real star for this hotel has to be the staff 10 out of 10 
230289,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, Duty Manager at my arrival Not Welcoming at all Dishonesty from reservation department Will never go back to this hotel in London Food was always cold when served via room service and also at the breakfast in the restaurant No access area for children strollers Got help for 6 nights However it was embracing to ask for help to carry the strollers to the lift area , Location Pool Spa
230290,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, courtyard view was actually a view of a brick wall in room entertainment was awkward to operate food service very over priced, the traditional d cor the convenient location the feeling of being pampered by the staff 
230291,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, The security of the hotel needs improving One of our rooms suffered from early morning knocking at the door by stranger not the hotel staff , The location facilities are perfect It is very near Hyde Park and we were able to enjoy a nice walk in the morning The staff was very helpful Notably the beds were very comfortable as the mattress were not so soft as other hotels Breakfast is delicious 
230292,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, b ed was hard but was swiftly dealt with when i told housekeeping waiters seemed a little uptight due i think to the very demanding clientele we had a good time and would go again, everything mostly was excellent

230294,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, Trying to book a table was abit confusing They couldn t tell us straight away if there was a vacant table we had to wait 10 minutes for the manager Then at the bar restaurant can t remember the name we were told we couldn t book but to come back at 9 30pm it was on a 1st come 1st served basis We did manage to get in there and Hestons and very nice they both were , A beautiful elegant hotel with very friendly polite attentive and helpful staff Nothing was too much trouble for them 
230295,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, Second visit and second time room was not ready for 3pm check in again waited an hour Really not pleased and won t be staying again they really need to sort this out , Dinner at Heston Blumenthal excellent
230296,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, View of brick walls from the 3 windows of the suit and so close 2 meeters you can t tell if it s sunshine or not outside Doors bathrooms and woodwork old and tired No paintings or plants in the suite Not much on the shelf in the way of decoration to make it welcoming , Location staff very nice lobby welcoming bar cool and relaxing coffee shop warm

230301,Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London, We had no keys to the room we had two rooms booked we were unable to come and go from each room as we had to call them to open the room There was no Internet as they said there was a problem with there system We then went out and came back and at 1pm and ask for the keys they had taken our luggage from the rooms without our permission or telling us They said we don t need to go back up to the rooms as they have taken out all our luggage from the room as checkout was 1230 I was disgusted I have stayed around many 5 star hotels around the world this has to the worse ever experience , Nothing was very annoyed
