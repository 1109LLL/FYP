115103,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, Small and poorly equipped gym I do not expect pro gym during my travels but a bit more than this , Friendly staff high standard room equipment with app controlled light curtain etc Good restaurants and shops are nearby 
115104,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, Facilities are all a bit sub par for a 5 star hotel Breakfast was good but only continental breakfast was included It does not specify that on Booking com and the hotel did not explain on check in either As a result if you get eggs which I did it is 9 or 10 euros extra When I pointed out on check out that it was never explained that breakfast was only partially included the staff apologized but did not offer to remove the charges Also rooms are modern but the iPad controls only work some of the time Pool is fine but small and the hottub is more like a lukewarm pool with jets Unfortunately for the price I have to say there are better options in Paris , The hotel is very modern and nice Rooms are decently sized and the bathrooms are extremely nice Location is good to explore the surrounding neighborhoods 
115105,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, Paying extra for cooked breakfast, decor was nice room very comfortable with high tech facilities reception were very helpful and friendly location was excellent
115106,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, DO NOT SELECT THE ROOM WITH BREAKFAST This is the most disappointed choice that I ve ever made during this trip The breakfast is soooooo SAD I saw comments that the hotel manager made saying that they already improved their breakfast I was hopping that when we arrived the hotel will at least have some improvement because of all these complains But the breakfast is incredible over priced it is totally a ripped off FOR 25 EURO per person you get five kind of bread 3 of them are toast with different oatmeal taste pretty much the same And juice that poured from boxed juice that you can easily get everywhere The MIX fruits is the same every day you can t tell them apart from canned fruit they are cubes and watery There s not even any hot stuff if you want egg that s an addition 9euro which is a joke to me A heavily carb based unbalanced breakfast for 4 of us for 4 days is 400 Euro This is ridiculous You can easily get a lovely meal at a fancy restaurant for this price The service is also quiet miserable I saw the waitress pouring juice from boxes and get coffee from automatic coffee machine there s not much to do really but you still get your hot drinks over 10 minutes of waiting And one day the table next ours got Their hot chocolate thick like jam even they are already waited for a long time they have to send it back and wait again The breakfast is not making any sense for me I m willing to pay for the price but at least serve me something that s acceptable and please improve the service I booked two rooms with two twin beds since we are a family of four It was pretty clear written on the booking information Some how they left only one room with twin bed It takes quiet a long time to check us in It was probably the longest time that I waited for since the hotel only have about less than 50 rooms Because of the bed situation the staff tried to make it up by upgrading us to larger rooms , The overall experience with this hotel is acceptable The location is great and the room is bigger then average rooms you will get in Paris But there are still quiet a lot to improve to be a decent 5 star hotel 
115107,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, There was nowhere to pull up to and unload the luggage The AC didn t work and the staff kept making excuses about why The front desk wasn t very honest about several key things First when we tried to see the catacombs they offered a service to help skip the long line We waited hours for the tickets which never showed up We arranged for a taxi the evening before but when we went down to go to the airport there was no taxi They said 5 minutes That turned into 30 We ended up hailing a cab ourselves I am sure it was forgotten It was very disappointing for a hotel in that price range I will not recommend it or stay there again , The location was good There were comfortable linens and bed 
115108,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, Some of the hi tech is just over the top Buttons for opening curtains four different settings for lights etc We just about got used to it by the time we left We also found the breakfast buffet a bit disappointing considering the price Basically just a Continental breakfast with Corn Flakes We had to ask for Muesli which they didn t have until second day Service also slow Save your money and go to one of the many local cafes , An oasis in a superb location Small but excellently designed rooms with loads of facilities including Japanese toilet needs getting used to Small warm pool in the basement with lovely hammam steam room and good spa A joy to come back to after a busy day in Paris Lovely helpful staff except in restaurant Quiet rooms at the back well worth it 
115109,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, Occasionally the service was a bit slow at breakfast and upon check in The staff was wonderful and friendly despite being overwhelmed with a lot of guests appearing at once , We loved the design and decor of the rooms They were clean and spacious and beautiful The hotel itself was in a spectacular location and since it was a smaller road with more pedestrians than cars there was very little street noise I would definitely stay here again 
115110,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, The sleeping area is small The view is very poor , The staff is just excellent Location is super A free Paris walking tour was provided as a compliment 
115111,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, Pillows were too high and too hard All 4 pillows the same Only got one supply of complimentary toiletries Not replenished on 2nd night, Great location complimentary Evian in the bedroom
115112,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, Room was incredibly small which was disappointing The breakfast was also disappointing It is a continental breakfast coffee croissants fruit salad etc but if you want anything else like eggs you are charged for it I found this to be very cheeky for a 5 hotel at those room rates My husband ordered avocado toast which was literally a single small piece of toast with some slivers of avocado for 12 Euros We also had a very disappointing experience in that the air conditioning did not function in our room and it was over 30 degrees outside so it was difficult to sleep and extremely uncomfortable We were not happy with the reaction we had to escalate several times before being moved to a different room with functioning air conditioning for our last night Again for a 5 hotel this was not acceptable , Location is fantastic
115113,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, Honestly nothing even worth noting , Friendly staff and helpful to newbies in the the city breakfast was delicious location was perfect and right next to the biggest train station 
115114,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, A number of items 1 False advertising the bathrooms did not look like the picture There was no bathtub In fact we were advised by the hotel that only 1 superior room has a bath tub and double baisen clearly they should not use this as the example picture 2 Incompetent Service lengthy check in delays constantly asking staff to clean our flooded bathroom asking after each shower no response to an enquiry about the bath tub until I followed it up As an apology they put a bottle of champagne in the minibar but didn t tell us it was there and then actually billed the champagne to our room which we didn t drink or know existed Even today I have been holding off writing this review as I was awaiting written feedback from the hotel and was hoping to give them the benefit of the doubt 3 a number of other reviews have dealt with the breakfast and I have nothing further to add it s nothing special We have had such an upsetting experience here It is a shame Hopefully the hotel can work on customer service its advertising and plumbing issues and move forward I have never written a negative review before but our stay ended on an upsetting note and we have received no correspondence today as promised , Comfortable bed Clean with the exception of flooding bathroom new hotel with the potential to be 5 stars one day 
115115,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL The management is false advertising BREAKFAST IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PRICE OF THE STAY ONLY a Continental Breakfast is included SO unless you want to eat croissants and bread your entire stay at this hotel BE PREPARED TO SPEND 8 EUROS FOR A COUPLE OF EGGS EACH PERSON family 32 EUROS Adds up after a week in addition to the 2 2 500 for the week A sofa bed was also supposed to be part of our room and when we arrived the woman at front desk said NO not the deluxe room I am glad I printed off the booking com confirmation All these details including breakfast included were written there The general manager said I am embarrassed The restaurant is in complete disarray They try but come up far too short No room in the restaurant either Had to wait a few mornings to sit , Most of the staff were awesome and went out of their way to help Location was pretty good Not far from Metro about a 10 minute walk to Louvre Pretty good shopping all around 
115116,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, The unhelpful surly attitude of some staff members made what could have been a great hotel stay just ok , very nice room central location and nice spa facilities
115117,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line,No Negative, The room is very clean big bed is very comfy has a nice balcony and amazing big bathroom In terms of room I would rate as one of the best in Paris Location not my personal favorite it s a 20 minute nice walk to all the fancy shops and nice restaurants Breakfast very limited options staff were friendly but not very accommodating Asked for restaurant reservations before arrival and they confirmed during check in at the restaurants they didn t find our reservations We arrived at around 8pm next morning asked for late checkout they said they needed the room asap but when tried booking online or through booking their were rooms available for a new hotel I would not have done that I would give it another try if the rates stay the same right now it s very much value for money 300 Euros night including breakfast but maybe this is because they just opened if they raise the prices I would stay elsewhere 
115118,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, Had to ask for coffee twice for the room at the front desk Came back from being out all day around 5ish and the room still wasn t clean Not a fan of continental breakfast It was a included but still not a fan Outdated movies to watch really the only English things to watch unless your a fan of constant news Leisure area downstairs wasn t great Vacationing it is nice to come back after a long day and sit down and have a drink , Being new was nice Room was spacious and bathroom was great Front desk staff and restaurant staff were great 
115119,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, Breakfast is too sweet Only jam fruit yoghurt and croissant Even your room is including breakfast if you want to eat cheese you need to pay additional 9 euro For 2 boiled eggs you will pay 8 euro , The room was clean Location is good
115120,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, The bed was too soft and the duvet and pillows were of poor quality The pool is very small and only 4 chairs to rest I didn t get that from the photos The massage rates are one of the most expensive ones I have ever seen anywhere in the world The restaurant opens at 12 and closes at 2pm Queues at breakfast The included breakfast is just a contenental one so don t get too excited Stayed there for a week but couldn t eat a lunch or dinner at the restaurant Either fully booked or closed and in one occasion that I manged to get a table I was told there is no English menu and when I asked the waiteress to help me to translate and order food she was so unhelpful pulling faces and so uninterested that I gave up and Left Not the service to expect from a 5 star hotel I was better treated at the local bistro , It certainly was a very clean hotel The staff at the reception were helpful Location is very good 
115121,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, Maybe the breakfast it was a bit of a letdown We expected to have some eggs or sausages cereals It was only few types of bread , Everything We had the most comfortable sleep ever Everything smelled so nice and the room is spacious with me my husband and my daughter Would like to go back here 
115122,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, Small room for breakfast which causes troubles at peak times for breakfast long waiting time for breakfast service no chairs for guests in main breakfast room , Very well equipped rooms and the whole hotel with latest modern technologies 
115123,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, Nothing but If I have to mention a small incident we had no cappuccino at breakfast machine malfunction which embarrased the maitre so he treated us with a very nice glass of champagne , Great concierge Helped us with everything we needed including a reservation at a 3 Michelin restaurant nd storing our bikes Exceptional toilet with heated seating Location is perfect next to Louvre Great breakfast 
115124,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, The breakfast service was very disorganized waiters kept forgetting orders and were inattentive to guests , The location of the hotel is excellent Close to all major attractions very nice restaurants nearby Bed is very comfortable The staffs are very welcoming and helpful 
115125,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, There were no free tables at breakfast It took 20 minutes to seat us in reception where we received a couple of pastries and one little coffee each I offered to collect our own food but was rebuffed Not great for a 600 room nor when one is holding a wriggling hungry one year old and has an impatient three year old wondering where his croissant is they had run out of croissants too , Excellent room brilliant swimming pool with a swim against current that was perhaps the most exciting thing so far in my three year old son s life Staff were lovely including the woman running breakfast who did her best but did not have the space nor the staff she needed 
115126,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, They didn t say that the rooftop room The room temperature was reduced every day so it was always cold The breakfast was not delicious and there was no choice and it was not varied for just an extra charge ,No Positive
115127,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, The included breakfast 25euros was alright but the service was really slow and I had to ask for several items that were forgotten , The swimming pool was amazing with warm temperature plenty of spaces The Sauna is really nice with beautiful ceiling of lights The hotel provided an Ipad in the room to control all lighting in the room pretty cool Free water bottles were provided everyday and a lot of free movies were available on the TV e g avengers etc 
115128,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, iPad light controls too clever sometime did not work Restaurant team still learning breakfast very slow , Brand new hotel furnished to a high standard generally high quality throughout Very helpful concierge Large room although we were upgraded 
115129,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, Nothing , My wife and I had a wonderful stay Located just a 4 minute stroll from the Louvre and the nearest metro station and in a safe and secure district of Paris the Maison Albar is an excellent choice for anyone visiting Paris who enjoys a bit of luxury as well a being within walking distance of the main sights The hotel itself is beautifully designed and meticulously clean The staff are incredibly friendly helpful and well trained The pool and spa are clean modern and beautifully designed It s not often I would stay in the same hotel twice but with the Maison Albar I will defiantly be returning in the near future 
115130,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line,No Negative, Everything is perfect Location is great very close to Louvre Forum Les Halles etc with nice shops and restaurants nearby Room is very clean and decor is elegant and stylish Staff are pleasant and helpful Breakfast is good too 
115131,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, Honestly Nothing could have been better for us The best hotel we have visited for a very long time , staff were fantastic caring and with an eye for detail We loved Emilie Nothing was too much trouble The room and technology enablement were brilliant Location just perfect 
115132,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, The price of the breakfast a la carte but on the other hand it was very tasty , Service minded staff Great indoor swimming pool Comfortable bed Coffee tea and bottled water free of charge in the room 
115133,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, Wi Fi was slow and the staff is not the 5 star hotel staff Even though the hotel is beautifuly designed I don t think it is a 5 star service as it is a supposed to be , This is a beautiful hotel right in the center It has everything in a walking distance you are right in the middle of Paris Gym and SPA are amazing 
115134,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, I wanted to give the hotel a perfect score But during our very early morning checkout the front desk staff less experienced I guess could not cancel the pre authorization on my card after spending like 20 mins In the end I had to switch to a card with a much higher fee and we were much late for our car service I was told somebody will reach out to me regarding to the inconvenience but nobody ever did anyway , Brand new hotel There are problems here or there but the stuff are generally very nice and always tries their best to help 
115135,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, The hotel only opened in early December and it feels some way short of 5 stars especially on service Management Training and discipline are lacking so staff seem chaotic and bit dazed both at reception but also in the spa and especially in the restaurant Service at both dinner and breakfast was very very slow and haphazard They re working hard and trying but there seemed to be a general lack of training and awareness of what 5 star means at least in an international context Hotel has amazing potential Didn t like iPad controls for lights and everything in the room give me an old fashioned light switch any day , General loccation is great although immediate area isn t Nice style and vibe Wonderful pool 
115136,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line, 1 Print out of instructions needed for coffee machine 2 Prefer not to have sales pitch for spa items, 1 Very high tech 2 Staff very friendly 3 Quiet clean and cozy
115137,Maison Albar Hotel Paris C line,No Negative, Sugar Brioche excellent coffee and Caf Mimosa for food next door is fantastic
