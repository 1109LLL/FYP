278325,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, The only thing I would suggest is white bedding The Red and grey duvet cover was not very pleasing White always gives you a sense of it being very clean , This hotel stands out for its great location and amazingggg Staff I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family and would also be my hotel of choice if I went to Barcelona in the future Great points of interest nearby and I must say again the staff was very friendly and helpful Specially the receptionist Tarik What a nice person My husband and I were very happy 
278326,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, I really have nothing negative to say There was a small leak around showerstall so the floor around sink would get wet but no big deal I just placed a towel down , Location was excellent and close to everything Fantastic place to eat across the street called Corner Very safe and easy to get to Born area which is right across the street 
278327,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, One bad thing is that they charge you extra for using the safedepositebox locaded in your room The room you already paid for And the breakfast is nothing compares to Park Hotels breakfast across the street ,No Positive
278328,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, Booked a three bed room which wasnt available when we arrived Fortunately a co worker had a twin room and was able to accommodate the third person We accepted this for the first night of eight nights and checked on two more occasions whether we needed to change to our triple room We were told we could stay put if we liked and they would leave us in those rooms despite the fact the accommodating co worker was checking out one night before us We were happy with that as the rooms were well positioned Then on the last night no one seemed to be aware of this agreement due to lack of communication between their staff We were told one of the rooms had to be vacated because they were fully booked and they also had no triple rooms available despite out booking We had to pack our co workers belongings out and after we some discussion they placed us in a disabled room that could accommodate a third bed They also refunded the difference between a double and a triple room for the duration of our stay and threw in the safe key charge for free after we demanded they discuss that with the manager , Location Functional Front room balconies look out over street 
278329,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, That you need to pay for the safety box The door of the hotelroom was closing very loudly especially other guests coming home after 00 00 was very annoying That we could not get a late check out even paid at the day of our departure , The bed and location of the hotel
278330,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, Can t find anything to complain about would have no hesitation recommending this hotel , All the staff were excellent the room was very good with air conditioning which was much appreciated in the Barcelona heat The location was perfect for us as we like to walk everywhere but right next door is Estacion de Franca if you prefer trains 
278331,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, Very Bad Experience The mini bar in the room was broken I spoke with 5 different people from the Hotel and nobody did anything They should offer me a new room To pay 120 Euros per day without breakfast and not be able to drink cold water in the room at Barcelona summer is really bad experience ,No Positive
278332,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, Rooms felt dated not a lot of soap and cleaning times were all over the place Front desk staff was not friendly , Decent location Easy to grab cabs since you are near the train station 
278333,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, The safe was an extra , the Breakfast was good enough for the money The zoo and the beach are very near They sell the two floors bus tour and other attractions 
278334,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, It was a soul less box When I arrived I thought I had walked into the reception of an office building This hotel has no atmosphere Luckily you are so close to the Gothic quarter that you can walk a couple of minutes to get atmosphere in the bars and restaurants Simple things like shower gel would be appreciated and are expected at this price , Great location
278335,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, Only small things that can be easily remedied Plastic soap dish totaly out of place please change it to a glass one Bathroom was a little used up chips of paint missing on corner of a cupboard and stone on the shower head But in overall very clean and nice place , Room was really elegant I felt like aritstocracy And although it was from street side the windows are very tight and do not let noise in Also the staff there is very friendly and helping with everything and patient with all silly questions I had 
278336,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, Coffee from the machine at breakfast was OK rather than great , Very helpful staff Rooms had good sized desks Very easy to get taxis since almost next door to railway station 
278337,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, The hotel is using some air freshener spray in the rooms and we could not breath and we had to switch the room There is no carpet on the floor at all The breakfast offer is good just we couldnt eat in peace because the tables had been cleaned every time we are there and the rubbish bag was in front of us or close to us during we had a breakfast Also it was very noisy because the kitchen door have been opened all the time The breakfast is served in the basement without windows although the hotel has nice lounge behind the reception with street view which is always empty A room isolation could be better , The hotel has great location The receptionists are very friendly The whole hotel is very clean 
278338,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, The attitude of the staff not helpful at all , the location of the hotel is good however the staff is extremely unpleasant not helpful at all and always pulling long faces We stayed in for 2 nights and never seen a smile on any front desk staff 
278339,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, The room wasn t as nice as expected and the wifi was really bad Maybe not the best hotel for a business trip , Great location in Barcelona with lots of bars and restaurants around Touristic sights and seafront within walking distance Good room price at the time of the booking 
278340,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, If you have a car to park this hotel isnt the ideal because they have a parking space however isnt in the hotel is like 2 or 3 blocks away and you need to be catching the keys of the parking and delivering the keys leaving the car badly parking even for a short moment just to deliver the keys isnt very comfortable The breakfast is nothing special and very expensive like the parking , The location is very good being near everything that you probably want to see and the rooms aren t bad 
278341,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, The shower had leaking taps water pressure barley more than rinsed the shampoo out of my hair Another thing that really annoyed me was hat the day before i was due to stay in this hotel they took the first nights fee out of my bank account which was never ever allowed to happen They said this was standard procedure but it is not stated anywhere on the booking com site or the hotels site so i wasn t impressed when i questioned the desk staff they just said we can do that if we want wasn t impressed with this at all also a lot of them didn t speak very good English but were all pleasant Also for a 4 star hotel they should have free shampoo and conditioner and other toiletries a very small slim little bar of soap does not cut 4 star standards , The beds were extremely comfortable and room was very clean I would stay here again but wouldn t pay any more than 80 per room per night and other guests told us the breakfast was very pricey but we didn t have any
278342,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, Didn t like the twin beds would have preferred a double bed but didn t change rooms as wanted to be near our sons room but this was the only downside , Location good very clean hotel helpful pleasant staff and loved the walk in shower 
278343,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, Did not like the breakfast that we had pre paid for at the hotel so went to caf across road good breakfast at half the price The Hotel is good but lacks a bar area there is plenty of room to accommodate one seems a shame, Rooms are good nicely decorated hotel is located in a good area
278344,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, The lighting in the room wasn t great could do with some extra lighting as well as a full length mirror , The hotel was in a great location to the train station park restaurants marina and taxi rank The room was comfortable staff were helpful and polite 
278345,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, extremely slow wi fi to the point of being unusable room rather small the hotel is a little tired and in need up updating, Great location friendly staff
278346,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, Didn t have breakfast at the hotel as it was a bit pricey and not included in room rate but loads of cafes nearby, Very friendly staff great location
278347,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, Noisy rooms You can hear people just walking in the hallways The pipes seem to make noise if anyone in the building showers Water leaks noisily for half an hour after talking a shower yourself so plan accordingly Internet is really slow The rooms have two single beds instead of big beds Toiletries are dispensed in ant sized rations and some common amenities like a place to hang coats in the room are missing , Great location Rooms look nice 
278348,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, they sprayed windex on the bed sheets covers etc We couldn t sleep with that smell , it has a great location you can walk to the Barrio Gotico the water front and the cathedral
278349,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, Breakfast was terrible only sour and almost nothing sweet The room was on the first floor which means on the Street with noise coming from outside The cost is really to high but I think there was something in Barcelona those days because almost all the hotels were overpriced, The position is great and the furniture is really nice and modern looking
278350,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, Noisy room no sound proofing towards the corridor Far too expensive compared to level of standard Expensive breakfast Appears to be clean until you look under the bed , The location 
278351,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, We requested before booking and upon checkin for a double bed not 2 singles put together I requested it while booking and called them the day of and they said it should be fone They must have forgotten Uncomfortable trying to cuddle and having the beds come apart ever so slightly and your body start sinking in between them But that would be the only negative , Our room felt like pure royalty We had a balcony and it was so nice every morning to wake up to the streets of Barcelona The rooms were clean and spacious and the bathroom was nice and big too We exudes not to get breakfast and went to nearby cafes restaurants instead so can t comment on the food they provide The location was great only 10 min walk from the beach We re definitely staying here every time we re in Barcelona 
278352,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, Staff were somewhat cold , Beautiful modern design in the rooms with very comfortable facilities The location is fantastic 10 minute walk to the beach and to the gothic quarter 15 minute walk to La Ramblas and a three minute walk to the closest metro station 
278353,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, My room was very dark because it was facing a backyard I had friends staying in rooms facing the street their rooms were much brighter and hand balconies , Hotel s location could not be better for a hotel in Barcelona Rooms designed very modernly Perfect high speed wi fi 
278354,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona,No Negative, Had a great holiday in Barcelona but needed a clean quiet room for at least one night before travelling back to usa after disastrous airbnb experience Wish I d stayed at this hotel for my entire stay 
278355,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, A bit noisy from the hallways no tea coffee machine available in the room we got twin beds and there was no way to make them stick together maybe get a tool to make the beds stick together , Great location
278356,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, Extra payment for a safe 2 euros per day is annoying and can be absorbed in the price Breakfast is normal and can be improved had cold scrambled eggs Pouches of shower gel not practical and would be better in small bottles Air conditioning and air circulation can be improved , Convenient location and within a walking distance from rambla street near a metro and a train station Clean and tidy Good price quality ratio Friendly and helpful staff Lots of small restaurants in the vicinity 
278357,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, basic services were not availble no tissues no toilet accessories we called for a box of tissues thay said ise toilet paper we asked reception to call us a cab they said u go and order , location was good other than that it is not worth a 4 stars hotel
278358,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, The pictures on booking com are over the top We booked a room with bath Because of late check in 15 00 Rooms with bath where given away The room was very hot We called for help but no working airconditioning The price is far over the top No tea or coffee at the room Cheap shampoo and soap in little package For enviroment better put a refill Would go again for 50 euro less a nigth a lot of better options , It s located next to the trainstation close to the beach and to Poblenou 
278359,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, The only thing that I would say I didn t like was the tv I tried looking for English Channel or a channel where they speak English but all I found was bbc world new which is not an everyday thing to watch the news But other then that I loved everything , I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel the bed was so comfortable I had the perfect sleep of my life I loved the view from the balcony and the bathroom was just perfect especially the shower some times in other hotels ill experience cold water but here it was amazing I loved my stay and will recommend family and friends thank you very much 
278360,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, Some of the personnel rude and not adequate for a four stars hotel Cleaning of the room not done in the morning early afternoon From 10 00 a m Till 3 00 p m , Nothing to report 
278361,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, There is no bar in the Hotel We did not eat breakfast so can not comment , Location was great in the El Born area which we loved Better than Las Ramblas Still very busy but local bars resturants Great value We walked everywhere from here Shop opposite The staff were very good Rooms lovely 
278362,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, sounds from the corridor asked for double but it was 2 singles, no noise from the street good place for relax comfortable beds nice bathroom very clean
278363,Hotel Ciutadella Barcelona, The morning receptionist was awful when i needed to get my car out of the garage in the morning My son and I were in a rush to catch our flight The receptionist wanted me to fetch my car and then find my way back past road works and one way streets leave luggage child etc in the car on a double yellow line on a busy road and run into the hotel to return the garage entrance zapper Eventually after much stressful complaining he reluctantly sent someone to come with me to open up the garage I had a child and luggage with me However the housekeeper that was eventually allowed to accompany me was wonderful kind and understanding Thank goodness for her Ps it must be noted that the night porter the previous evening when we checked in was much better than the morning receptionist the night porter acknowledged that the garage was very hard to reach with the road works so he let a member of staff guide us to the garage on arrival a big thank you to him , Location
