168855,Hilton London Olympia, The underground car park also l mistakenly thought it was included in the price 37 for 24 hours which by London prices are not too bad but if l had know l would have gone by train, Location for Olympia was perfect only a 5 10 minute walk away
168856,Hilton London Olympia, Storage space a little short in room Very high price for a mid level hotel, Excellent location for Olympia Friendly and helpful staff Comfortable room 
168857,Hilton London Olympia, The bath was rank stained brown I ended up just washing at the sink There was a stink of smoke in our bathroom from about 8pm Generally expensive but good quality Like 4 for fries The twin beds are up against each other so its like a shared bed anyway Crashing outside lorries and metal pallets at 5am The digital clock on the tv was annoying I recommend unplugging before you go to sleep I also unplugged the bright clock radio No free wifi , Liked the bar area in the evening I thought it would be packed but it was just right Close to the Olympia for LFCC Tea and toast for breakfast was nice except they brought me my tea instead of me going to get as much as I want But i m sure they d give more if you ask Really pleasant staff except the concierge who took our bags in Miserable and didn t say anything to us Could have at least let us know what on earth to do Or a minimum a good morning madam sir I liked the seating area in reception it meant we were waiting for our train out of the rain in a comfortable chair 
168858,Hilton London Olympia, The noise from the service elavator the grime in the bathroom the leaking aircon door didn t feel secure etc, The breakfast was very nice and good for all types of people
168859,Hilton London Olympia, I ve found a lot of problems with my room from the wifi connection to the temperature of the room , The staff was very kind and efficient the room was nice and the location is perfect if you want to stay in Kensington Just a couple of minutes from Olympia Fair ambient 
168860,Hilton London Olympia, I was very disappointed with the hotel It was old and in need of renovation The bathroom door was peeling and the window wouldn t shut properly I was very sad that the Hilton didn t live up to my expectations, The staff were excellent
168861,Hilton London Olympia, View could have been a little better but the room was very nice spacious clean and had a good size bathroom with everything we needed, Bed and pillows very comfy Was very pleased that the room had iron ironing board and hairdryer
168862,Hilton London Olympia, Rest of hotel was very tired and shabby Drink marks on work surfaces dirty sheets blocked drain in bathroom Dirty marks on walls flaking paint No way near standard of Hilton Hotels I have stayed in previously , Reception and restaurant areas very nice 
168863,Hilton London Olympia, As we tried out packing very light we planned on washing our clothing a few times A towel heater helped us so much while we visited Paris for a few days in between our days at your hotel I know it s a luxury but without one at your hotel it took days for our clothes to dry One day we asked the maid to come back in a little bit since we were almost ready to go out for the day but she never did And another day she never came at all But we chose not to report it and get someone in trouble , Croissants were wonderful Breakfast bar was very good But the best part of our time there were the concierge staff They did everything they could to make our stay the best We d originally booked another hotel but it was so horrible it wasn t fit for an animal My granddaughter found your hotel online and we were over the moon happy to see our room We were treated so nice 
168864,Hilton London Olympia,No Negative, Bed extra comfy Staff very accommodating I dont like lifts and were put in room on 6th floor within half an hour I was offered a room on the second floor very pleased
168865,Hilton London Olympia, The provision of tea and coffee in the room cold have been a little more generous While it is good to know the restaurant staff are keen to attend to the guests need personally I did not feel it was necessary to be asked about the quality of beverages food and service by no fewer than six staff The involvement of so many staff may explain one or two slight delays in the service , The room was extremely comfortable beds were just right and the facilities ideal The restaurant is very well appointed and pleasant
168866,Hilton London Olympia, The rooms and corridors are dark drab and in serious need of re decoration the rooms have poor lighting and the bathrooms are very dated The price was not a good reflection or what I expected for a Hilton Hotel, Friendly staff good breakfast
168867,Hilton London Olympia, Check in is at 3 and we arrived at 11 very tired , The bed was very comfortable and I appreciated the very fluffy blanket The breakfast buffet was delicious and offered a good variety of meals The staff was very friendly and very helpful There aren t many restaurants around the hotel but the bus stops next to the hotel which will take you to restaurants in 10 15 minutes depending where you want to go The buses are very reliable The hotel was in a quieter part of the city which made it very comfortable 
168868,Hilton London Olympia, the initial room i was put in wasn t up to standard for someone to stay in and should not have been used until it had been sorted out properly I had to move rooms Mistakes were made in getting orders wrong not completing promises made poor door security on it seems all rooms so safety is a high aspect of concern double locks don t work so you only have a chain Overcharging occurred , if things go wrong the staff are very quick and polite to respond and put them right 
168869,Hilton London Olympia, I know it s the modern hotel way but don t like not being able to open the windows at all Air con bothers my sinuses , The twin room was spacious and lovely and cool from the air con when we first walked in as it had been a hot day 
168870,Hilton London Olympia, It s a bit out of the way for the centre of London but still managed to get about easily , Bed was so comfy and the room was a lovely size and temperature Ironing board and iron in the wardrobe was a life saver

168873,Hilton London Olympia, This Hotel is in need of urgent refurbishment Not the standard we expected from a Hilton Hotel and it certainly would not encourage us to book with the Hilton group in the future Bedroom carpets grubby and sticky Bath panel and tiles have seen better days Corridors need redecorated and carpets replaced Bar area also in need of an upgrade , Reception staff friendly and very helpful
168874,Hilton London Olympia, Dirty bathroom Dirty carpets Broken beds Non rectification of issues until we escalated 8 times Dirty restaurant all seating stained Showers on one side of building suitable only for people 4 ft tall or less Far from Hilton standards , Location close to Olympia

168876,Hilton London Olympia, This room was miles better than the room we stayed in the first time so not much I didn t like The view wasn t great as we were facing an alley way but that can t really be helped Always abit expensive though when it comes to convention times which is shocking , They had proper air con in the room we were in this time Everything you need really in the room 
168877,Hilton London Olympia, The building is old and not refreshed especially paint The room was so small it was hard to go through the room because there was 30centimeters between bed and wall we had to pass luggage above the bed Would have been fine in a less expansive hotel but I found it non acceptable in a Hilton , The staff was good
168878,Hilton London Olympia, Minibar in my room was empty and turned off First room I got smelled bad Wifi kept braking down few times a day and I had to relog , Most of the staff was extraordinary

168881,Hilton London Olympia, It is a shame that this house still bears the name Hilton the Rooms are dark small and extremely noisy substandard If you stand up in the bathtub to take a shower your head is fully emerged into the ceiling panel The furniture should be immediately disposed of Dirty and overused If it wasn t for the location none of us would ever stay there , Concierge service was excellent 
168882,Hilton London Olympia, this hotel has a reputation for not being very good however my company advised me to stay here due to the location and proximity to the exhibition centre I will certainly advise my company and colleagues to never stay there again , Location was good

168887,Hilton London Olympia, I didn t like the noisy air conditioning in my room and being woken up by water pouring out of air con one morning Or noisy staff with radios turned up stomping past my room at 0437 on Sunday morning , It was very close to Olympia 
168888,Hilton London Olympia, The balcony door was wedged closed with a plaster It sounded like we were outside in the middle of a busy area with Police sirens going off all night , The cocktail Salted Caramel Martini which cost 10
168889,Hilton London Olympia, The rooms and hallways beyond the lobby we re incredibly dated The space felt cramped in the bedrooms and they are very badly designed in terms of maximising space It felt tired and not at all worth the money we spent , The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly The location was excellent but only because we booked specifically for its proximity to the London Olympia The bar restaurant was lovely and obviously recently refurbished 
168890,Hilton London Olympia, Wrong bill charged for a movie we did not watch because at that time we were eating in the restaurant of the hotel Strange and ackward service in the bar they did not even know that an apple martini was on their menu ,No Positive

168895,Hilton London Olympia, Room smelled of urine didn t re room til next day then put us in the wrong type of room Staff on front desk took too long to deal with my complaint , The executive lounge and bar area Staff there were friendly and helpful and both areas were well maintained 
168896,Hilton London Olympia, I booked a double room I was surprised to find myself in a very small single room I had to complain to get the room I reserved by late afternoon next day , Breakfast is good personnel very friendly Very clean Room cleaning is understaffed Rooms stay undone till 18h Unacceptable 
168897,Hilton London Olympia,No Negative, Near Kensington and other London attractions Good free wifi in room Buses are available right outside the hotel The hotel is very secured as key card is needed to access the elevators 
168898,Hilton London Olympia, wifi kept disconnected noisy location and horrible room service Ordered dinner through room service and was told to wait about 35mins Waited for almost 1 hour and half and I finally got impatient and called room service again Then the staff told me the kitchen was of out ingredients which they could told me when I ordered the food or call me once they realised this matter No they didn t they just let people kept waiting , Great location right next to the TLS Contact

168900,Hilton London Olympia, Have no real complaints about our stay here will be returning to this hotel again Only a very minor point but had to turn the air con off in the room while sleeping as was a little noisy However if your not a light sleeper this wouldn t be an issue at all , Staff were very friendly and helpful Arrived late to the hotel and the reception staff were very efficient and quick to check us in which was appreciated Rooms spacious clean and comfortable Large breakfast selection Was staying for a weekend convention in the Olympia so the location was perfect Number of tube stations close by Kensington High Street being a 10 min walk along the same road Kensington Olympia is the closest but trains run only at certain days times Very easy access to other parts of London Have stayed here before and will stay again 
168901,Hilton London Olympia, well as mention in wrong column some butts and a crisp packet on balcony but it was raining so i wouldnt have gone out on it anyway also i was on the 8th floor and area around lifts the wall needs painting looked quite shabby little things everyone genuinely lovely which is so much more important than paint had a great stay, yes bed very comfy staff really lovely some cigarette buts on my balcony but didnt mention it while there because i enjoyed my stay and it was raining 
168902,Hilton London Olympia, No free Wifi 18 for breakfast ridiculously overpriced Sadly not up to par with modern standards Dated badly in need of an overhaul Residual smell of smoke in the fabric of the building , Dated badly in need of an overhaul Residual smell of smoke in the fabric of the building but location good and staff pleasant comfortable beds and good quality bedding
168903,Hilton London Olympia, No free wifi Thought that was a habit of the past Paid wifi costed more than using my mobile data so I just used my mobile as hotspot for my laptop But not good , Location is very good And it is very easy to come in with the underground from Heathrow to Hammersmith 30 minutes and from there with bus 4 stops 5 minutes 
168904,Hilton London Olympia, The first night I could not sleep because of the aircon ventilation It was very loud and could not be switched off I was totally exhausted the whole day not ideal when on business trip On the second day I got another room which was quieter The windows don t isolate from the street noise The deco carpet in the room doors of the elevator etc are old fashioned 80ies It would need a complete renovation I paid 430 for 2 nights incl breaktfast The quality is not worth the price , Staff was kind and helpful 
168905,Hilton London Olympia, Room was comfortable but a bitt tired Furntiture a bit worn bathroom dated and stains on carpet, Great staff really helpful Amazing selection for breakfast
168906,Hilton London Olympia, The rooms including the bathrooms were dated but were comfortable enough , The staff were fabulous The concierge staff were brilliant Should be commended went out of their way to help We got into London after a long haul flight early in the morning and they did all that they could to get a room for us Very much appreciated 
168907,Hilton London Olympia, Response from staff when colleague trapped in a lift for half an hour We actually released our colleague from the lift ourselves after being told twice that there was someone on the first floor where the lift was stuck only to find when we got to the first floor that there was no member of staff staying with the person trapped in the lift We are sending a formal letter of complaint from our lawyer in regard to this The procedure they had in place was either not being adhered too or was totally unsuitable for the situation Combine this with the name of Hilton and the situation is even more unacceptable There were many breaches of health and safety during this situation The main response we got from the day manager was that when you cross a road you don t expect to get run over , location breakfast and bar staff
168908,Hilton London Olympia, We were over for an exhibition where we like to use the hotel bar to wind down and they always chucked us out too early The other Hilton in Kensington didn t do this We have stayed at the Novotel many times and they have never done that either Made our exhibition experience a bore and we won t stay here next year ,No Positive
168909,Hilton London Olympia, No proper restaurant facility open for evening meals although good selection of meals were available in the bar area, Location and friendliness of staff
168910,Hilton London Olympia, the food at breakfast was cold there are lifts at the hotel but you still have to walk up stairs to get to your room and to the restaurant my husband has bad legs and stairs are a big problem , staff are friendly 
168911,Hilton London Olympia, everything The room was tired and needing a facelift long ago The reception system is out of date the breakfast looked very lack lusture and with a huge play on gross profit achievement The Hilton Olympia was like a typical budget hotel , just the location nothing more
168912,Hilton London Olympia, The decoration was very dated with dull lighting and carpets peeling of the floor of which i tripped over one on the 6th floor It is in desperate need of refurbishment The downstairs lobby was quite nice thought The bathroom was a bit dated too I was very surprised that this hotel was a hilton , The beds were comfortable 
168913,Hilton London Olympia, Check in was not good The credit card machine did not accept any of my cards although they were accepted elsewhere on the same day I ended up having to pay upfront in cash Despite this I was refused breakfast the next day unless I paid in advance because there was no credit card on file Housekeeping was also poor In particular no soap was provided and I had to ask at reception who only provided hairdo conditioner and shower gel , Bed was comfortable 
168914,Hilton London Olympia, The temperature of the room was chilly but with the very easy to use controls in the room that was fixed in minutes , It is the first time I have been to a Hilton Hotel but like the name suggests it s all class 
168915,Hilton London Olympia, I have asked for early check in but I was told that I only can go to executive room for extra charge and as we were very tired we had paid the extra but the room was normal size double room and nothing like an executive room at all At the time of booking I have chosen to pay cash at my departure but I was told my credit card already was charged For being a Hilton hotel it has a very basic facility compare to other cheap chain hotels , Good location easy access to buses and under ground friendly and helpful staff 
168916,Hilton London Olympia, I have booked 5 months ago but I paid in the currency when I arrived at the hotel I would prefer to have paid by the time of my booking , Clean and spacious room 
168917,Hilton London Olympia, The toilets in reception were appalling blocked wash basin overflowing bins strong smell of urine Our room overlooked the service area and my sleep was disturbed by the constant hum of what seemed liked hundreds of airconditioning units beneath my window , The towels were huge white and fluffy the bedlinen was crisp and fresh the bed was comfy the bathroom was well lit with a bath and good shower The room was a good size 
168918,Hilton London Olympia, Tv didn t work Room and decor tired shower head lower than head height Hotel charged credit card an extra 30 00in case i had any room service I was not asked if this was OK nor did i give permission for them to do so and to insult me further they haven t even refunded me the money since checking out 24 hours later How can you take people s money without asking , Location
168919,Hilton London Olympia,No Negative, The staff at Hilton s Olympia is just GREAT It s incredible how can they care for customers I told them I was booking in order to celebrate my partner s birthday and the setup of the bedroom was amazing I will definitively repeat for sure 
168920,Hilton London Olympia, The view from the room was horrible It overlooked all the pipes boilers We should have been told before booking We couldn t open the window for some fresh air , The location
168921,Hilton London Olympia, Internet should be free like it is at almost all other hotels and not just for Hilton Honors members Room fridge should provide space for guest to put their items not just foodstuffs and drinks suppose you have a medicine that needs to be kept refrigerated Access to my room required me to climb stairs twice what would I do if I had a lot of luggage was carrying something heavy or was infirm and had difficulty climbing stairs The floor I was on looked very old and worn down like the hallways in old 2 star hotels not what you would expect in a Hilton , Buffet breakfast was excellent good variety of food available but the cheese options were a bit limited Room was equipped with a kettle and tea and coffee but no hot chocolate iron and ironing board Bathroom amenities were provided but the shower cap was not replaced after it was used Reasonable number and location of power outlets but no European type sockets Overall staff very friendly and polite even if they do forget to bring you your breakfast tea 
168922,Hilton London Olympia, Far from the tube minuscule room horrible noise from the road could not get any sleep thank god I had hearing plugs Only saving grace was very nice staff ,No Positive
168923,Hilton London Olympia, Room a little small Decor in room a little dated , Staff really helpful Public areas beautifully refurbished Dinner in bar really good Nice location only 15 mins walk from tube and located on Kensington High Street with excellent shopping 
168924,Hilton London Olympia, The bed was the most uncomfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in I booked two rooms on the same booking but we were 4 floors apart The window in our room was broken and did not shut properly this room 735 is facing the busy street and therefore the noise level was dreadful ,No Positive
168925,Hilton London Olympia, The hotel is very outdated it needs a full refurbishment The rooms had an old fusty smell which did not go away when we opened the windows, The breakfast rooms was nice and the food was of a good standard
168926,Hilton London Olympia, Needs a renovation beds were not that comfortable feels very dated , Its was close to the Olympia centre ideal location if you are going to an exhibition 
168927,Hilton London Olympia, This alleged 4 star hotel is in desperate need of renovation we were upgraded to an executive room that was seriously dated poor condition and not too clean The bar area also dated and unclean with sub standard furniture and service After asking for a minute to look at the drinks menu barely sat down on first contact had to go to bar after 15 minutes to order a cocktail and a beer neither of which were good These were returned discussed with the Manager and not charged fortunately We gave breakfast a miss even though paid for as part of room in order not to be further disappointed Could not wait to leave , Location for Olympia 
168928,Hilton London Olympia, Could be more bath soap we we re travelling light No great problem though , Great location for Olympia and bus outside to almost all London Friendly reception staff too 
168929,Hilton London Olympia, Really not worth the money there wasn t a hair dryer in the room and the room was tiny and the bathroom for a couple Ended up in a travel lodge, How close it was to shops
168930,Hilton London Olympia, Nothing, Staff excellent delighted with the upgrade given by the nice man who checked us in Room great breakfast lovely and the staff have again been most helpful in returning the set of keys I stupidly left in the room 
168931,Hilton London Olympia, We chose the hotel purely due to location Probably wouldn t stay again Basic rooms I can cope with but the bathroom was disgusting and needed to be cleaned properly Lighting was also an issue in the bedroom and the hallways smelt damp ,No Positive
168932,Hilton London Olympia, nothing nothing, nothing the worst hotel i ever visited since 55 years your house keeping an older woman sold one bathrobe for 20 pound but never delivered 
168933,Hilton London Olympia, The noise level from outside while I TRIED to sleep Need to invest in some good windows On arrival my bed was unmade and curtains closed Did not even recieve my 5 complimentary voucher or a deduction of my bill , The breakfast was amazing but it would be considering the price it cost 
168934,Hilton London Olympia, A bit of a walk from reception to our room which included a few random steps less able bodied travellers may struggle with this , Great location for Kensington Olympia train station and for a walk to Kensington High Street shops Very comfortable bed with lovely clean bedroom and bathroom Lovely bar area too 
168935,Hilton London Olympia, THE ROOM AT LEAST OURS NEEDED RENOVATION I THINK THE WHOLE HOTEL WOULD LOOK BETTER WITH A LITTLE RENOVATION THE BATHROOM NOT VERY COMFORTABLE SHORTAGE OF SUPPLIES LIKE SOAP FOR INSTANCE, THE PROXIMITY TO THE BOOK FAIR THE FRIENDLINESS OF THE STAFF THE RESTAURANT AND BREAKFAST
168936,Hilton London Olympia, The breakfast food was not really hot Same with tea and coffee , The muffins at breakfast were great The toiletries were lovely The bed was SO comfy and had smooth good quality sheets 
168937,Hilton London Olympia, It was all great , We loved Bruna at the front desk She gave us great advice for the next leg of our trip to Lisbon Also everyone in the Executive Lounge were wonderful 
168938,Hilton London Olympia, Had a very late business meeting the night before and did not appreciate being woken up by house keeping knocking loudly on the door at 10am twice Shouting house keeping ,No Positive
168939,Hilton London Olympia, Even though it is the law to provide an allergens list for the restaurant we were repeatedly told that they didn t have gluten free menu Eventually the chef hand ticked a menu for items which were gluten free but we were not convinced that the staff had any idea how to ensure that myself and my 3 coeliac daughters didn t suffer ill health after eating the meal if there had been any other option we would have left but it was 8pm pouring with rain and we were all exhausted after a busy working day at the Olympia exhibition centre Thankfully after a long wait when the meal arrived it was delicious , Location
168940,Hilton London Olympia, Our room was very cold even with the heating turned right up it was freezing we were at the front of the building as well so it was very noisy through the night with the traffic As we were working at Olympia for a show on the second night we were out for networking drinks and by the time we got back to the hotel we were wanting to order food We got told due to the time this had to be done from our room and we only had an option of sandwiches and pizza When we tried to call it went to voicemail I ask the bar staff if I could order it there and deliver to our room and she said no I went down to reception and the lady was not helpful at all she looked very confused with the whole matter Finally I called reception from my room phone and got the food delivered but to be honest the bread on the sandwiches were stale and it was just awful Unfortunately we are staying with you again in September for another show as this is already booked I can only hope that our experience is somewhat better , The bed was veryyyyyyy comfortable 
168941,Hilton London Olympia, As above, We complained room 240 bed uncomfortable and on every turn sqeeked the room was very tatty and edges not clean we then got moved to 619 and the room was bigger The bed comfort still tatty furnishings and cleanliness not great Bathroom and carpets In my house I use a hoover nozzle for corners and edges this hotel didn t there were tea stains where people slip between tray and bin Hallways badly battered and unloved Not at all impressed and we made a complaint We have received an offer of an executive room breakfast in the executive lounge Not sure if that is enough to get us back there again What would you suggest 
168942,Hilton London Olympia, Checkin time at 3pm was very late When we did go to check in there was a queue which was very slow It took around 30 mins to check in We were charged 12 5 service charge in the bar which was ridiculous considering on one day we were the only ones in there and yet still had to wait quite a bit for our drinks Then later on we had to clear our glasses off the table ourselves as no one came near our table It was also quite difficult to go to restaurant with a buggy during busy times as only one lift serviced the restaurant and lifts are tiny so it was always full, Staff very friendly and breakfast was lovely
168943,Hilton London Olympia, Couldn t get a hot drink when returning to bar at the end of the evening Organisation at breakfast was a little haphazard with long queues The whole place needed some tlc , Breakfast nice bed comfy 
168944,Hilton London Olympia, The appearance of the reception is a fa ade that deceives the lack of investment in the rest of the hotel The staff are efficient and functional but are clearly not trained in attentive customer service and creating a great experience for every guest, Location
168945,Hilton London Olympia, Bed was very hard and uncomfortable Not enough hot water to fill the bath Bathroom cleanliness wasn t the best, Good breakfast Staff were very polite
168946,Hilton London Olympia, carpets look really old and dirty hotel looks very old asked for smoking room and it seems the room was smoking and not me couldnt sleep from the smell , staff
168947,Hilton London Olympia, The room I was put in smelt of heavy smoking ash tray on the side The bathroom was filthy and a fitting was hanging off the wall , Friendly staff at reception
168948,Hilton London Olympia, The hotel is tired and outdated in terms of decor Staff although efficient showed very little interest in my complaint of a bad nights sleep for my two year old son as we were put in a room right next to a housekeeping closet and entry and exit to this room happened until late into the evening The room itself felt rather dirty the carpet should be replaced or burnt It was filthy The bathrooms fittings were very old there was rust a cracked basin pock marked bath and the entire room felt generally unclean and certainly unpolished Very disappointing stay It seems the hotel relies on regular patronage from the Olympias exhibition centre as well as numerous airline staff and as they are still getting bookings they have made no effort to update the rooms or hotel decor in anyway , Nothing 
168949,Hilton London Olympia, Bar area was cold and you needed your coat on Bedroom wasn t ver warm either and had a very stale smell Service in the bar was poor Charged different prices for the same round and 121 2 service charge even when you went to the bar yourself Staff did not understand same again We ordered to half pints of lager and then requested the same twice more When the bill came we had been charged for 2 half pints the first time and then for pints the other times although the size glasses were the same This happened again in the evening when I ordered a baileys I was charged 4 the first time yet 8 for the second yet I had exactly the same amount of baileys both time Beware if you are putting this on your room bill as you will not realise what they are doing Again we ordered food with an extra portion of chips This did not arrive with the meal and when we asked the waitress where it was were told chips didn t come with the meal Again we explained we had ordered it as an extra but by the time it arrived my daughter had almost finished her meal , Excellent breakfast
168950,Hilton London Olympia, Everything was just a disgrace to be honest will not stay or recommend to any body, Ye room had really bad smell in it should be called the Stilton was very cold to could not get warm then ran a bath it was that hot a burned my foot the toilet was vibrating when used really poor and disappointed for the stay the cooked breakfast was really greasy staff were quite rude to
168951,Hilton London Olympia, The d cor in my room was dated the bathroom especially Could do with a new bathroom suite retiling , The bed was comfy and staff were very helpful 
168952,Hilton London Olympia, The location of the toilet facilities was poor To reach the tissue you had to twist your back and bang your hand on the lever , We arrived to see staff arguing on the lift lobby Not good it could have been done in private 
168953,Hilton London Olympia, Though i booked for three night mainly to be able to check in immediately upon my arrival I wasnt cheched in but had to put in two rooms in temporary basis befor finaly moved to my final place This is totally unacceptable and not satsifactory I demand compensation from you or the hotel for the inconvenience and hassle i had to go through , Like the excutive lounge staff
168954,Hilton London Olympia,No Negative, Lovely room everything provided right down to slippers Comfy bed Very quiet considering right on the high street Excellent choice at breakfast Conference facilities excellent bright airy room plenty of tea etc provided 
168955,Hilton London Olympia, Room service atrocious Wrong numbers on menu No answer on phone Going through to EE voicemail When breakfast came only part of it Bed very uncomfortable Soundproofing non existent, Staff helpful
168956,Hilton London Olympia, Needs a refurb for example whilst the bathroom was clean it smelled foisty and damp certainly not worth 250 per night, Great location for Olympia Nice bar area 
168957,Hilton London Olympia, The receptionist did not find our reservation and would not call booking for us at 01 00 in the night gave us a hard time We had to call and email afte midnight and we had to book new reservation but at the end he was wrong Rooms are very old window broken in too so it became noisy with the train running under the property One restaurant 1 hour to receive our food very little stuff for so many guests , Location
168958,Hilton London Olympia, Should have been a straight 10 Let down by a cold room They limit the heating to 19 5 degrees Didn t like that much , Wonderful staff very helpful and kind 
168959,Hilton London Olympia, Bar is not cheap though table service included for drinks Room was small though adequate and bathroom feels a little dated compared to other hotels I stay in Not a great location for getting into central London 20 ride to Regent Street Westminster etc however that wasn t the point of my stay , Great location for the Olympia exhibition halls with a very short walk 3 5mins The breakfasts were one of the best examples I ve had in a hotel with a good selection and very good cooked breakfast Staff a little overwhelmed with breakfast traffic on the second day however Reception staff very helpful and check in was effortless Bar seating area is excellent and staff very helpful

168962,Hilton London Olympia, It s old and the rooms are small It isn t an Hilton standard anymore , The staff is very gentle we asked for another room because it was freezing and hey upgraded us 
168963,Hilton London Olympia, Really not a 4 hotel It needs updating and decorating tomorrow wouldn t be too soon In the bedroom the curtains were hanging off the runners there were no pictures on the wall and the bed was so close to the wall I kept bumping into it In the bathroom there is a shower curtain which I hate as think it s unhygienic By the lifts the doors are very scuffed and scratched , The beds were very comfortable with clean white sheets 
168964,Hilton London Olympia, When you get out of the lift it is like you have gone back in time 20 years Very shabby decor extremely dated rooms dirty carpets horrendous curtains and the room smelled funny bad did not want to walk on the carpets, The hotel is well positioned and very good value for London The bar was nice and the staff were friendly
168965,Hilton London Olympia, On whole very good Only small points the hall stairs are a bit tatty and not very welcoming Bath very small, Location for Olympia Executive lounge Bed comfortable

168967,Hilton London Olympia, The room was lovely and but a little dated The shower leaked and kettle did not work , The staff truly were amazing nothing was too much of a problem 
168968,Hilton London Olympia, Nothing, Fantastic staff free upgrade for my husbands birthday A bottle of presseco birthday cake and fruit al as a gift from the hotel the staff were so polite and helpful 
168969,Hilton London Olympia, Earlier check in would ve been nice one of our party had just had an operation on his leg and couldn t walk far So we had late lunch in your restaurant but were bothered by your staff because we didn t want to give over our credit card and weren t checked in Our plates were cleared before everyone had finished eating in fact I was scared to put my fork down The d cor was dreary dated too , Breakfast was excellent Location ideal for Olympia Horse Show
168970,Hilton London Olympia, Absolutely nothing , I liked seeing that so many of the top riders in the world were also staying at the hotel It reassured me that so many people that obviously spent a lot of time travelling found it a comfortable hotel to stay 
168971,Hilton London Olympia, Room run down in need of refurbishment Found hair in my food informed the attendant he didn t know what to do told him to tell the chef heard nothing further Not what I expected for a Hilton hotel, Greeted very nicely agreed to be added to the reward scheme Hilton Honours and then received complimentary champagne and sweets later that day
168972,Hilton London Olympia, The bed was not at all comfortable I could feel almost every spring under me as I moved It was certainly not what I have experienced in other Hilton hotels , Reception staff welcome was lovely The gentleman who welcomed me on arrival was very friendly professional and welcoming 
168973,Hilton London Olympia, Can be more comfortable, The staff are very helpful They had a room ready and checked me in even though I was early Close to Kensington high street shopping area and the stop bus is opposite
168974,Hilton London Olympia, Room size is small Bath tub dated property needs refurbishment, Room service was good Check in was prompt did not have to wait for long person on reception very helpful Had some issues with the toilet engineer was sent promptly
168975,Hilton London Olympia, No dislikes at all, I didn t go for breakfast on the first morning and the staff were very helpful and explained to my wife breakfast could be taken in the room and helped her with a tray to our room Thank you one and all
168976,Hilton London Olympia, Greeting by the frontline staff can be improved We got stares instead of a smile And offering concierge service would be greatly appreciated We obviously had luggages but left to looked after them ourselves and all staff just looked on as if we were some kind like a terrorist Tottally didn t expect this esp from Hilton So upset Paid 400 for this such a bad experience , Sophisticated look
168977,Hilton London Olympia, Staff knowledge on location and directions was poor Bar staff trying to serve too many customers at once neglecting to make time to understand customers needs, Location
168978,Hilton London Olympia, Only thing that is the only issue is the ventilation is fairly loud but it probably is in most hotels , Great place really good atmosphere Great breakfast too 
168979,Hilton London Olympia, The towels smelt horrifically The bed was rock solid and the pillows were terrible with no alternative The breakfast is overpriced for the quality The overground is infrequent so isn t the best place to stay for central London access The window didn t close fully so noisy through the night and although drafty offered fresh air , The staff were very pleasant and accommodating Although it was very busy on news year day the staff at breakfast were very quick to replenish and meet demand 
168980,Hilton London Olympia, the bedding was dirty and the staff changed this when we notified them the room was cold and in need of some TLC , Breakfast was adequate The size of the room and bed were fine Staff were very attentive and friendly 
168981,Hilton London Olympia, Only one person on check in so it took 20 minutes including a return to complain about the room Noisy air conditioning units in back courtyard of first room sounded like an airport and window did not close properly Corridors looking tired Broken sink plug in the second room My breakfast was very poor lumpy porridge made with water prefer milk looking and tasting like wallpaper paste no full fat milk for cereals choice of skimmed semi skimmed only indifferent coffee in jugs not freshly made , Location is superb We got an immediate free upgrade to a larger quieter room when I complained about the first one Would still come back because of the location 
168982,Hilton London Olympia, The exterior of the hotel looks like a 1960s office block 0 curb appeal They don t show this on booking pictures Reception area is modern like you d expect but it all goes down hill from there Rooms look like they are still in the 80s with old brown carpets and wood furnishings When I first arrived I was put in a tiny box room with 3 foot bath and afrosted window that opened onto a wall In fairness they did upgrade me after I had to complain as I paid 112 for one night The beds are hard I can only compare to putting a duvet on a wood floor and using that for a mattress Pillows are soft though In summary like a lot of Hilton hotels Dated and in dire need of modernisation There much better hotels than this is london for the same money or cheaper , The staff are friendly 
168983,Hilton London Olympia, Think we got ripped off in the bar I had a small glass of merlot and we had a single measure of Jameson whiskey with a splash of coke from the gun and it was 17 90, Great breakfast buffet
168984,Hilton London Olympia, In the evening the bar restaurant was closed for a private party I was not told of this during check in or at any other time when I asked at reception if another room had been made available i e The business lounge I was told that if I required any food or drink I would have to use room service On a Saturday evening this is not acceptable and the attitude of the staff on reciption was very take it or leave it attitude Also the hotel is looking very tired and need of refurbishment I will never stay at this hotel again I have been using it for many years and now I will be looking for other places to stay , Location for olympia
168985,Hilton London Olympia, The room was tiny with only 1 light by the door and one in the bathroom making the room even smaller darker and very dull On top of this 3 of the lamps did not work The bed was uncomfortable unclean and creaky Even the slightest movement turning round to get comfy made a tremendous amount of noise I checked under the wooden bed and the legs were cracked and split The description of what was included in the double deluxe room did not reflect on what we were given The staff were awfully rude with the exception of one or two people The waiters waitresses in the bar seemed to ignore our table but wait on some others As usual users of Hilton hotels through leasure and business we did not expect what we had come to and I doubt we will ever use a Hilton again Definitely NOT worth the money Extremely disappointed , Breakfast was ok 
168986,Hilton London Olympia, The window latch was broken so there was a draught and lots of road noise and rooms aren t very soundproof as we were woken at 4am by the people in the room next door coming in , Great breakfast and friendly staff
168987,Hilton London Olympia,No Negative, Not having to sleep on the floor at our daughters flat which is just round the corner from your hotel Luxury we will do it again if we get the same room rat 
168988,Hilton London Olympia, The room was very cold Despite being offered a heater we waited 1 1 2 hrs and had to ring again for it Also were told by one member of staff bath robes and slippers were no longer a service provided we asked another member of staff who provided them with no hesitation , Clean comfy beds good food friendly staff
168989,Hilton London Olympia, I booked this hotel room in April of 2016 to make sure I got the best price and that I could actually get a room Upon arrival everything seemed fine off we went to the horse show and returned at 11 30 to go to the bar as we had done for 5 years on the trot on a Saturday night and also I might add more or less the reason we go to the show We were turned away as FEI had a party and we did not have the wrist bands I could bore you with all the details that ensued after this i e abysmal staff service ignorance and inability to help from everyone involved But the long and short of this story is that the hotel staff here did not provide the services that we had paid for and tried to get away with claiming no responsibility Really ruined my london trip away and will definitely be my last time paying to stay here , The proximity to Olympia horse show
168990,Hilton London Olympia, Bathroom was tired with chipped enamel and cracks in basin Shower was over the bath with a curtain never a good look The room had a constant background noise due to the air conditioning towers outside the window, We were able to get freshly cooked hot food after midnight in a lively sociable bar within the hotel
168991,Hilton London Olympia, Corridors from lifts to rooms looked tired old but room was modern clean 15 minute walk from Earls Court tube station 15 20 min tube ride into the centre of London, Nice bar with friendly staff decent menu
168992,Hilton London Olympia, The beds weren t very comfy in one of them the springs had been damaged sp was uncomfortable on my back just thought the room was a little basic, The overall layout of the room was convenient along with fresh sheets and the compliments left 
168993,Hilton London Olympia, The air conditioner did not work in the first night but our request for room change was refused To be fair the hotel got us a new room with working air conditioner the next day after we complained again , Fast check in request for late check out granted
168994,Hilton London Olympia, The bathroom floor didn t look very clean old water soap marks Room generally very ordinary More than 10 minutes from tube It would have been helpful to know about the bus from the tube to the hotelwhich we found out about too late, staff were very helpful and friendly Reception area and bar very well presented
168995,Hilton London Olympia, Prices in main bar double rum and coke double Baileys 12 60 in the Hand and Flower 200 yards away 23 80 in hotel rather excessive Dirty cutlery at breakfast had to try 3 forks before I got a clean one , Comfortable room beds Executive Lounge facility

168997,Hilton London Olympia, Booked twin bed non smoking room On arrival had to accept double bed smoking room Given free breakfast Would rather have had what was booked , Free breakfast 
168998,Hilton London Olympia, I believe that the entire staff s performance made up for the dated decor and aged facilities They really deserve a venue worth their efforts , Staff attitude and performance was excellent The food at dinner and breakfast was tasty and of high quality and served with a smile 
168999,Hilton London Olympia, Everything carpet to begin and rooms and everything it is old old old old, Horrible i would not even rate this hotel 1 star maybe close to a hostel terrible terrible terrible

169003,Hilton London Olympia, The location and the staff, Location is very good and close to all the activities Bus station is next to the hotel Staff are outstanding The hotel room is clean and and well maintained Bathroom very small and outdated
169004,Hilton London Olympia, Would have been nice to have a bit more room and have television on wall at end of beds rather than off to one side of the room , Beds were really comfortable Breakfast was excellent Restaurant and reception staff were brilliant 
169005,Hilton London Olympia, Lumpy beds 10 minutes to run hot water 1st day concierge moved me out of the way of the lifts for another customer with more bags Had 2 meals in the restaurant and both were not cooked properly and waited 15 minutes just to get a drink and a menu ,No Positive
169006,Hilton London Olympia, Breakfast is very good but very very expensive although rooms good value overall B B is reasonable for London Some rooms on road side suffer quite alot of noise from road Decided to eat in Hotel one night because so wet outside to go anywhere else Food choice limited and service slow , Stayed while exhibiting at Olympia Location is excellent for Olympia for for Kensington using the buses Proximity to Tube poor as Olympia is such an out of the way tube station 
169007,Hilton London Olympia, We arrived and room was not ready this was 7 30pm and check in was after 2pm Moved to another executive room as per our booking and as we were trying to get comfortable after our journey there were staff in our room separating beds and putting sheets on etc We went to the executive lounge at 8 15pm this was supposed to be open until 9pm but they were already clearing the food etc so again not very welcoming We expected far better than this having booked a twin executive suite very disappointed , Location
169008,Hilton London Olympia, The rooms do not live up to the front of house They are tired a little fur coat not knickers I m afraid , The location is perfect for the Olympia

169011,Hilton London Olympia, 1 My room was not ready for occupation when I arrived at approximately 3 50pm 2 I was sent to 3 rooms one of which was in a noisy position above a major road in breach of my booking arrangement and two of which were not made up before being accommodated in a forth slightly up graded room I had to queue at reception each time I eventually ended up in a room with a severely cracked sink tepid hot water in the morning around 7 am and a very squeaky bed , The Position of the hotel near Olympia and well prepared food 
169012,Hilton London Olympia, Reception told me my debit card had been declined with booking com and wanted a credit card instead I refused so they took payment on my debit card which has ample funds that was very disgusting of them for me to be told my card was declined when it was fine room service was appaulingly slow also the room was very small for a double , very good breakfast
169013,Hilton London Olympia, Wasn t happy with the meal we ordered in the evening steak wasn t that nice at all and we gave our room number then went up to bed and after a little while we were being called several times in the room to go back and pay the bill The breakfast was also not particularly nice and so we didn t really enjoy it at all I have also filled in a complaint form ,No Positive

169015,Hilton London Olympia, Our 2nd floor bedroom was situated to the front side of the hotel It was really noisy being so close to the road with sirens and fast cars It made it difficult to sleep Also it needed more staff at peak times i e Evening room service and morning check out , It s close location to Olympia with parking facilities 
169016,Hilton London Olympia, The room felt very small and thankfully I was on my own so that was sufficient However if I travelled with my husband we would have struggled for space Good enough for one night in London , Convenient location and lovely staff
169017,Hilton London Olympia, TV remote didn t always work possibly needs new batteries 1 50 for a bottle of water It was free at the Hilton Heathrow You want to economise on laundry but the handwash soap gets changed daily , Breakfast

169019,Hilton London Olympia, This hotel is very convenient for Olympia but less so if you need to get to anywhere else in London , Not luxurious but perfectly comfortable enough for a couple of nights 
169020,Hilton London Olympia, Not much as I said the room was comfortable but some bits were a bit tired bath enamel was chipped and bath panel has signs of water damage , Room was comfortable and clean breakfast was good with plenty of variety and staff were friendly and helpful

169023,Hilton London Olympia, Unfortunately this hotel just needs to be refurbished or at least replace the mattresses They are awful and have really bad spring problems in both of the rooms we tried after being moved We were told that all of the mattresses are the same Considering I stay at the Hilton in numerous locations this was a real let down and I believe I should have been refunded I even went away with a bad ache , The service from the staff was excellent and they tried to help as best as they could which was a delight 
169024,Hilton London Olympia, The decor very dated the furniture My bedroom is100 better expected a lot from the HIlton but the luxury was not there for the price I paid It was like a cheap cheap hotel Holiday Inn would have been better and cheaper, Staff and loby
169025,Hilton London Olympia, The bathrooms are tiny the bedroom was tired and did not live up to executive status, The executive lounge was very welcoming and made up for a lot of other things
169026,Hilton London Olympia, stained cracked bath and bathroom very tired and jaded indifferent staff overpaid for parking lifts broken roof tiles in bathroom broken and miss fitting clock radio broken a travelodge would have been much better in terms of cleanliness and decor,No Positive
169027,Hilton London Olympia, Breakfast was very pricey at nearly 20 per head They offer a 5 credit off your restaurant or room service bill if you forgo room service for a day but BEWARE It does not appear that housekeeping are very good at passing this information on to the billing department They did not automatically add the credit to our bill and when we queried this with the girl at reception although pleasant she appeared quite reluctant to accept that this was an error on their part In the end she disappeared for five minutes and returned and confirmed it would be taken off our bill but there was no apology or admission that they had made an oversight in the first place Our advice would be to make sure you tell reception if you decide to do this as although they just say that you simply need to place the hanger on your door that information probably will not make it onto your bill Rooms whilst clean appear to be quite drab and tired and the lifts were extremely unreliable Also our bed was very hard and uncomfortable which was quite disappointing considering the room rate and the fact that they upgraded us on arrival , Breakfast choice and service was excellent Also the burgers we had in the evening on our first night were amongst the best we have ever had The majority of the staff were all very polite well trained and helpful Money had clearly been invested in the restaurant and public areas which are in stark contrast to the corridors and rooms above 
169028,Hilton London Olympia, Plugs , Junior suite was great with lots of room and windows made it light and airy beds comfy Not very many plugs bathroom clean with everything you need Breakfast great spoilt for choice Great location for the museums 
169029,Hilton London Olympia, Bar prices far too expensive One lift out of order causing problems with a full hotel Bedroom corridors bit dated and tired Access to carpark dark dingy Insufficient staff for busy checkouts, Excellent location for Olympia Bedroom small but adequate lovely modern refurbed bathroom beds quite comfy Society bar and restaurant very nice
169030,Hilton London Olympia, Client can t turn off air conditioner the other one is very tall but taken to a room with small bed fell down to ground in the deep sleep Their bathrooms are not clean enough to stay compared with their past experiences in Hilton Said would send a solving e mail to us haven t received until now ,No Positive
169031,Hilton London Olympia, A member of staff let themselves into our room after we had checked in and were in the room I met him in the doorway and he immediately said he had the wrong room Left me feeling a bit suspicious , it was convenient for the exhibition centre and close to a Byron s restaurant

169035,Hilton London Olympia, Exorbitant price of room Room was not available until 7 30pm which after a 14 hour day was unacceptable Minibar not stocked even though requested 3 times Reason was hotel was too busy Decor in room was worn tired and in need of overhaul , Proximity to trade show at Olympia great staff surprisingly low prices in the bar restaurant executive Lounge 
169036,Hilton London Olympia, Dated and dull room whole Hotel although modern downstairs had a dark Dark and dull appearance almost everywhere Bed was comfortable cover was stained but clean however constant sound of Police ambulance sirens every night made it difficult to sleep Towells did not smell fresh Stained floor around toilet Dirty food trays left in corridor for 2 days Couldn t eat any bacon or sausage for breakast as it was fatty contained gristle Most expensive piece of toast and cup of tea I have ever bought 2 breakfasts Way more expensive and difficult to get to Covent Garden every day than the impression given Ended up spending average of 45 per day on cabs Would have been more expensive if hotel had booked them Couldnt cancel rest of the week as I used Booking com will never use them or Hilton Hotels again , The staff on reception were extremely helpful 
169037,Hilton London Olympia, 2 of the lifts were not working mini bar not stocked this is poor in any hotel let alone a decent one view from window absolutely shocking suggest you make sure you request a decent view, Decent location good for buses and tube to all locations Breakfast excellent 
169038,Hilton London Olympia, Tea and Coffee facilities were a little sparse Also due to fridge being weighted for mini bar couldn t cool our own prosecco , Very friendly staff Quiet rooms Blissful sleep 
169039,Hilton London Olympia, Car parking charges astronomical room tiny room prices set for lottery winners only empty non working mini bar shower pressure a joke air con not working lifts constantly broken The bath was old repaired and filthy , Close to Olympia

169041,Hilton London Olympia, everything room disgusting booked an upgrade for my anniversery but should have booked a traveldoge as much better would like a full refund , nothing
169042,Hilton London Olympia, Two elevators out of three were out of order during my stay which made it Difficult to go up and down as I was staying in the 7th floor the problem was not solved until l left the hotel Breakfast in executive lounge was not that great and in general the lounge food and drinks supply during the day or the happy hours 6 to 8 pm were that not great The noise of the trains can be heared in the room even during night, All Hotel staff are very friendly
169043,Hilton London Olympia, The very nice male staff at the desk told me I would have water in my room when the only drinks in the mini bar were alcoholic beverages and energy drink The lock on the door would not turn when the door was closed but I figured out the trick to do so The air conditioning had no off button switch The noise from the road was awful I could hear the cars passing in the street below my third floor window as if the window was open There were stairs in the corridor leading to my room ,No Positive
169044,Hilton London Olympia, The receptionist checked us in late due to availability of the room and waited for so long Also the two lifts were not working during our stay , I love how the Concierge assisted us the whole stay The two albanian gentlemen staff were so helpful and accomodating Hats off to them 
169045,Hilton London Olympia, Arrived at 15 30 but didn t check in until 45 minutes later as been told by the staff that room wasn t ready Very small bathroom for a standard room and the television was really out of date as I didn t even know how to turn it on and some of the lights doesn t work in the room , location
169046,Hilton London Olympia, The staff were rude and the concierge wouldn t give us any information about how to get around London The toilet was broken on arrival and it took three phone calls before anything was done and eventually somebody came up at 11 30pm so we had to wait up until they left before we could sleep and we had driven for 8 hours On the second day we got back at 3 30pm to get ready for going to the lion king that night however we got back to the room and housekeeping had not been in I called down to say we were in a rush and wanted showers with no clean towels it took them half an hour to get us towels meaning we didn t have time for a shower before we went out for the night The next day when we returned there was a handyman in the bathroom retiling the bathroom he left after using all the toilet roll for god knows what and the bathroom was a mess from the materials he was using to re tile There was only 1 lift working for the whole hotel for the duration of our stay which meant we had to wait for roughly 5 10 mins every time When house keeping did come I asked the staff member for towels and to not bother cleaning the room she said she didn t speak English and came into the room and started cleaning around us The room we were allocated too had boilers air vents outside that were very noisy all night so gave us a disturbed sleep When going for breakfast we put a do not disturb sign on the door as we had money ipads phones lying around and when we came back from breakfast someone was in our room Overall the stay was absolutely horrific and as a Hilton honours member I am so disappointed that I will probably never stay in a Hilton again , Sandra who worked in the bar 
169047,Hilton London Olympia, No underground station nearby other than the very intermittent service from Olympia and a 15 minute walk to Kensington High Street Tired Air conditioning , Excellent position for visiting Olympia exhibition halls Polite helpful staff Large comfortable double bed 5 pub over the road the Warwick Arms Good Hilton breakfast in the morning 
169048,Hilton London Olympia, The tube station which should have been the closest seems to not be in use So we got off at Earls Court but it is better to get off at High Street Kensington as its more straight forward I hoped for a better view from the room as it is in a nice part of London but instead we looked over the back of the hotel where the bins were and we couldn t open the window very much The room was fine it was clean but I felt needed a bit of something to brighten it up , The hotel room was ready when we arrived at 1pm which was a bonus We didn t pay for breakfast there as there was plenty of alternatives on the High Street and this made us get up and out to make the most of the day The bar area is very nice and it is handy that there is a costa coffee under the hotel Staff very friendly and pleasant Plenty of restaurants and bars a short walk away We went for the carnival so it was a good location for us 
169049,Hilton London Olympia, The breakfast seems to be expensive so we didn t even bother to try it , We arrived earlier before the official check in time however the staff was able to help us to get a room so we can take a rest after a 6 hour flight we contacted them via booking com earlier though The location is pretty great We have 7 day Oyster travel cards so we can either take a bus in which the stop is within a minute or arrive the nearby tube station high street Kensington via the bus Within walking distance of 10 15 minutes there is a 24 hour Tesco in which you can buy groceries Feeling pretty safe in the neighborhood The room was a bit old but no complaint as it is normal for hotels in big cities e g NYC The washroom is pretty new and in generally we had a great stay thanks for the comfy hotel and great location

169203,Hilton London Olympia, Note that the closest tube station doesn t actually function as a tube stop most of the time and is mostly overground Also I left a white shirt out which must have been picked up by housekeeping as it was the same colour as the towels and sheets and never got it back or heard anything more after ringing multiple times and being assured that someone would get back to me one way or another never heard anything more Was only a 40 shirt but would have been nice to hear something , Nice hotel comfy beds good breakfast

169210,Hilton London Olympia, we had to wait a good 45 mins to get in our room as it wasn t ready however they did give us complimentary drinks could of had more tea and coffee facilities in the room and the toilet was very noisy flushing, loved the room and the bed was awesome and very comfy 
169211,Hilton London Olympia, Hotel were unable to find booking on arrival leading to check in taking 20 minutes To be told we had received a complimentary upgrade was quite frankly insulting Having stayed in a number of hotels including Hilton hotels I am very aware that this was nothing more than the basic room I am more than happy to stay in the room type I have booked but do not appreciate being lied to over a complimentary upgrade Sealant around the window in room has come away and was causing noise pollution into the room in an already noisy room due to the business of the road outside of the hotel Not only did this cause the room to be much louder but also caused the cold to come into the room We asked to change room due to this but would told the hotel was fully booked and offered no other assistance and no effort made to resolve our complaint We re disturbed in the morning by housekeeping despite having do not disturb sign on door Housekeeper had said the paperwork showed the room as empty this was still 2 hours before check out was due Would also note that this hotel is not well located for activities in central London eg museums and west end We should ve researched this better Overall not a pleasent or relaxing stay , Clean room

169228,Hilton London Olympia, Nothing wrong but just the mini bar in the room which you were to use would be paid out of your pocket was a bit of the downside but other than that nothing else I didn t like , I never tried the Hilton before but wanted to see what the location and room would be like in a well known area I loved the hotel room me and my friend stayed in for the time we were there for excellent facilities comfortable bed staff we so very helpful and the location was lovely

169234,Hilton London Olympia, The free wifi didn t work at all unfortunately For a Hilton we though the room was a bit tatty such as the uneven carpet we were in room 541 plus the window view was a bit uninspiring ie a brick wall I know it s London prices but I have stayed in fantastic boutique hotels for the same price so you can t help but be a bit disappointed , Very friendly reception staff clean rooms
169235,Hilton London Olympia, When I booked the Hilton Kensington Olympia through late rooms it gave me the option for a smoking room which I chose We was very disappointed to arrive and not be given a smoking room I booked the room 8 weeks in advance The staff were good and gave us free breakfast but still would of preferred the chosen room ,No Positive
169236,Hilton London Olympia, This hotel is not up to the standard you will expect from a Hilton 3 at best going on global standards WAY overpriced Aircon in room did not work blew stale warm air not even a mini bar TV system is painful to use takes 5 minutes working through menus and adverts to get a channel on Annoying sub titles set as default and the button to remove them throws you back to the main menu Room dated 80 s decor No mention of free wi fi until asked for instead they try to charge extortionate rates through your browser Closest tube is not connected to main lines so quite inconvenient , The only real positive was the large comfy bed The hotel generally is ok but it is not up to the standard you would expect from a Hilton 
169237,Hilton London Olympia, I didn t have a proper window in my room and so had no natural daylight for my whole stay Rather depressing , The location was excellent for London Olympia exhibition hall 
169238,Hilton London Olympia,No Negative, If visiting Olympia the position is excellent no guaranteed parking therefore parked overnight at Olympia which was nt to herendous Railway station just down the road so could arrive by train and save on parking fees Friendly staff very good breakfast No complaints 
169239,Hilton London Olympia, The rooms are very small and old This hotel urgently needs a refurbishment The walls seemed like they were made of cardboard I heared people talking all the time The beds were really small and uncomfortable The bathroom was completely outdated and not as clean as you would demand a Hilton to be , Bar and restaurant are cosy
169240,Hilton London Olympia, Room smelled stale it was tiny old and in need of serious renovation Bathroom was tiny and falling to pieces Wasn t worth 50 a night let alone the rip off over 250 a night I was charged Told staff how disgusting the room was they offered me a free drink Will never use again, Nothing at all
169241,Hilton London Olympia, Nothing really i m simple me contented for everything , I like hilton hotel very quiet lovely comfy bed at night lovely breakfast very comfortable place

169243,Hilton London Olympia, Due to late arrival beyond our control even though we had emailed and followed up to ensure a twin room this was not available despite staff saying it would be set side for us The staff upon arrival made us feel second class mentioned we booked via booking com and argued therefor we should not expect anything extra Not a classy treatment from a otherwise high end hotel chain ,No Positive
169244,Hilton London Olympia, Ugly decor and furniture in the rooms for a Hilton hotel The rooms need to be redecorated new furniture added , friendly and polite staff clean rooms hotel close to kensington nice lobby
169245,Hilton London Olympia, There were a number of reasons we are giving this review as negative Firstly somewhere very close to our room 559 was either a service lift or some sliding doors that were in use all day The noise felt like it was in our room and was impossible to ignore I spoke to the receptionist and she did offer us a move but we were exhibiting at the Olympia for four days and simply did not have time morning or night or the energy to change rooms The bathroom was very tatty in places the door had clearly been very wet and was spreading badly at the base areas of tiling etc had been filled and generally it was not what you would expect The queues for breakfast in the mornings were long and the restaurant staff one in particular rather stern For what is obviously a hotel servicing many hundreds of guests attending shows at the exhibition centre all needing breakfast at around the same time this is very poor Wi Fi connection very poor Blocked toilets next to restaurant one day husband reported it and they were still blocked the next day Sorry its so long but this was a real disappointment , Breakfast was good 
169246,Hilton London Olympia, Felt that the location was further away from the shops and eateries on High St from what it appeared on a map on booking Why is London accommodation so expensive ,No Positive
169247,Hilton London Olympia,No Negative, The delightful friendly helpful staff are one of this hotel s greatest assets Probably shouldn t say this but as a smoker it was lovely to be allocated an appropriate room and not have to go outside 
169248,Hilton London Olympia, The gym is disgusting The price of a breakfast far too high The lifts are a mess and the coridoors are awful , the staff were very helpful The meals were quite good Handy for Olympia 
169249,Hilton London Olympia, Hope they can improve the air conditioner system of guestroom feel it is too noisy and the voice from washroom is bit noisy as well , Enjoy the breakfast buffet and the staff service they have great smile and feel very warm 
169250,Hilton London Olympia, Had to go get cash from machine to have room service Insisted on minimum 200 withdrawal to pay 30 pound room meal Refused to take credit or debit card in room for food , Large bed
169251,Hilton London Olympia, The rooms are tired and drab breakfast was expensive and almost cold Parking was terribly over priced the restaurant of an evening was deserted and after paying a fortune for tiny poorly cooked portions I realised why , The staff and location were perfect 
169252,Hilton London Olympia, The shower was tiny kept hitting the ceiling and I m not that tall when I was washing my hair I accidentally touched the ceiling and the tile to the vent moved above my head The pillows were flat and uncomfortable Temperature in room was uncontrollable one of my pet peeves noisy cleaners and one even came right into the room at 9am while my partner was asleep but I had my eyes open and I had my leg out and my partner was naked but completely asleep I didn t say anything to the staff at the time because I didn t want my partner to be aware of it and then become embarrassed We had late check out already booked Room facing street so there was a lot of noise coming from the traffic and the window didn t block any sound out plus there was a breeze from the sides of the windows The view was of a tree stuck up against our window Iv had a better breakfast at the Crowne Plaza too Room 406 I understand that it is a cheaper booking through booking com but to be informed that it was my partners 30th I would have thought that being a Hilton hotel that you would have us a room that faces away from the street I work in Hilton on Park Lane and was just a bit surprised as the same level of care wasn t carried out , I liked the attention to detail and fulfilment of most of my request regarding my partners birthday The staff however forgot to put down rose petals for room decoration despite emails The little chocolate cakes and macaroons and champagne were a delight Thank you That was so special and he was really happy about that He loved it Also a reservations agent called Outi Vuori was fantastic at replying to my emails promptly and catering to my requests Thank you That was so nice to be treated with priority 
169253,Hilton London Olympia, Shower wasnt that great but at the end of the day it worked Breakfast was 12 each which we thought was expensive so didn t go considering the various resteraunts within walking distance , Bed was very comfortable Room was cleaned to a good standard and very professional staff We were able to leave our cases all day at the hotel after we had checked out which was nice
