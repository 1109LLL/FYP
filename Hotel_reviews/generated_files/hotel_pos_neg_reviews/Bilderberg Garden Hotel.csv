313078,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, cleaning is extremely poor dust everywhere finger spots on the furniture dirty spots in the bathroom I have asked the cleaning lady to tidy up the room properly but it did not help much Very slow elevator requires a lot of waiting Shower was leaking water WiFi could also be better Air conditioning was noisy My room was facing the street and was also noisy The cleaning personnel is on some kind of strike against electricity saving Every time we returned to the hotel all the lights were on in the room and air conditioning was on with an open window Location is far from the centre you need to walk 5 7 min to the tram station then take several stops to the main tourist area It is absolutely not a 5 star hotel I always trust booking com and reviews published there I travel a lot and have not been deceived yet But this time I had an impression that all good ratings and reviews for this hotel were a fake , room is spacious for Amsterdam standards with bathrobes slippers occitane toiletries
313079,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The corridors are rather dismal as is the decor in the room which was rather dark , The bed was very comfy The staff pleasant The breakfast good but pricey Good location 10 15 mins walk to museums My second visit to hotel and I would go again 
313080,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Wifi come on its a 5 star hotel and i don t want to pay for watching a movie, We stayed at Bilderberg Gardens with a couple of friends The hotel is a five star hotel and it really is unless you dare to have a deeper look e g the air condtionsystem started making strange noises from time to time the bar closed every day around 1am Maybe thats critisism on high level but the free wifi was the worst i have ever experienced I am quite sure we are not the target audience for such a hotel but the price was good and the tram station lines 5 and 24 was just a few minute walk away 
313081,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Aircon not working properly old fashioned dated bathroom Sheets were clean but smelled of chip fat and vinegar not what you would expect for a 5 property Expensive to park 29 euro per day and they add a daily service charge for no apparent reason service should be included when booking a 5 star hotel , Large room comfortable bed nice toiletries
313082,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, I had the worst experience when I first got in the hotel not only I took a long flight and was tired and wanted to check in early but the staff at the reception was very rude I understand that check in is strictly at 3pm but there s no need to be rude about it I arrived at 10 30am and asked him if I could check in early and he said no he didn t even make eye contact I waited until literally 2 55pm and he said very rudely and loudly five more minutes I got so nervous that my phone fell on the floor Second issue was the toilet It was clean but I noticed hairs in the bathtub and towel placed on sink I cleaned it myself as I was extremely exahusted to change rooms or to even walk downstairs to tell them about it I just passed out right after Third issue was the restaurant I tried their pasta on my last day and it made sick on the way to the airport that I actually threw up It tasted weird but I thought I d eat it anyway PS I don t know what was the guy s name but he was the worst Other staff were nicer and one of them apologized to me for his behavior One person gave a bad look to the rest of the staff I m extremely dissatisfied with my experience it was just horrible , Comfy beds
313083,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Firstly I have no idea how this hotel can rate as 5 stars Perhaps it is the expensive hatted restaurant attached that gives it its status When we arrived there was no porter to help with our luggage We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel We had clean towels etc however our linen was not changed the whole time The bathroom has mould around the tiles and whan we complained that the bar fridge was not cold we were told that it was a closet not a fridge My friend and I have travelled regularly all around the world staying in 5 star hotels and neither of us have ever heard that a fridge is a closet There is also the issue of room service To order anything to your room including ice attracts a 7 50 Euro charge which is ludicrious and just plain greedy All in all I would love to stay in the area again if I come back to Amsterdam but not at this hotel, Loved the area that the hotel is situated in with nice restaurants within walking distance and the tram with easy access into the city centre
313084,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The hotel is a little way from transport into the city about 10 minute walk to trams At breakfast water for tea coffee needs to be hotter , Lovely room with very comfortable bed Friendly and helpful staff Good food at breakfast with wide range to choose from High quality meals in the restaurant and pleasant ambience Hotel is situated in an attractive and safe area of the city 
313085,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, A bit noisy if the window is open but really no need for that as the room is airconditioned , The staff were very nice and helpful We just came from Tomorrowland super exhausted and had a flight the next day The hotel room was very clean and comfortable and they gave us an extra hour till checkout for free and took care of our luggage after we checked out Had the best extremely needed sleep and showers Relatively close to trams and 20 mins walk to train station when we were getting to the airport 
313086,Bilderberg Garden Hotel,No Negative, Staff at breakfast time were really helpful friendly and professional Hotel location is really good easy to reach from central station and the neighbourhood first class This was our 2nd trip and we will consider it again when travelling in Amsterdam
313087,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, All other staff were awful too busy smoking weed at the back of the hotel The bar is never staffed and very overpriced , Reception staff were excellent
313088,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, We were not aware that the property was located some distance out of the town and on arrival in the area it was difficult to locate Fortunately we had a car and were not reliant on public transport Our room was up two flights of stairs had we known we would have requested a ground floor room so as not to have to carry heavy suitcases up the stairs , The traditional style hotel was in a pretty location and the facilities including wifi rooms and parking were very good The meals breakfast and dinner were generous and delicious and friends joined us for meals on several occasions Our hosts and staff were very helpful and obliging The bathroom was modern and the shower excellent and the beds comfortable 
313089,Bilderberg Garden Hotel,No Negative, Lovely location out of the hustle and bustle of the city centre but within walking distance if you enjoy walking Friendly staff and great atmosphere 
313090,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, room had very disturbing red blodish stain in the carpet and bed and after complaining to the manager on duty no action was taken like suggesting another room immediate cleaning etc , Quiet location not so far from the museum area 10min walk max but beautiful surroundings Easy to park on the street Comfortable setting with enjoyable terrace 
313091,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Very noisy room due to separation door with other room neighbours could be heard Very loud while they where talking normal We asked for another room but hotel was fully booked We had to leave at 7 so no standard breakkfast was available therefore we asked for breakfast package Only one was initially made while we onviously were with 2 Had to pay 60 euro for this Very simple breakfast and taxes No gesture from personnel to compensate part of bill ,No Positive
313092,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, This is not a 5 hotel The facilities or lack of are below par and the room quality is equivalent to a 3 4 hotel Room size is okay but everything else carpets wallpaper mattress and pillow quality bathroom finish entertainment system etc are dated and definitely not worth 200 euro per night I wouldn t recommend this hotel to friends , Room size
313093,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The morning breakfasts are a buffet at 23 per day with little to choose from the coffee is nice though But it is better to go have breakfast in the local cafes , The entire place has a luxury business atmosphere me and my partner were amazed by how nice this place was About a 15 minute walk construction at the time may be less is a wonderful park called Vondel Park Close to museums and there are many nice cafes and restaurants near by We mainly just used google maps to get around would recommend that too The hotel may be out of the city center but it is in a very wealthy and clean area and it is lovely to just walk around and enjoy the atmosphere 
313094,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, I had booked the most expensive suite So I expected high quality Bedroom had a temperature of below 17 when I arrived and heating did not work Two of the 4 lamps in the living room did not work because they could not be plugged in a socket Room service menu only had 4 items The salad was not fresh Broken parts in the room had only been repaired by glueing them back and not by replacing them For a room of 300 euro a very poor quality, Staf is friendly which is normal for a hotel Offered me free breakfast because of all of the problems
313095,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Besides the price which might be regular for Amsterdam it certainly is a great place I have to admit that 9 for a beer and an additional charge of 7 50e for room service as an add on to the already high price were a bad surprise , Very friendly and helpful staff The location was great for my purpose unsure if it might be the best place for doing tourism though The room was tidy and well equipped I certainly would return and do recommend the hotel 
313096,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, An exercise facility would have been great but there are parks close and neighborhood is great for runners As always more coffee pods and real milk the little ones could be in mini fridge would be a true bonus but an espresso machine is a must so one can t complain , Although this was our first time as couple my husband and sons have stayed here before on business and leisure Comfortable well appointed business hotel in the Art Deco Neighborhood Rooms are large and well appointed Executive level had jacuzzi extra room and quiet amenities Neighborhood is quiet but close to Vondelpark cool shopping non tourist restaurants and museums 
313097,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Staff on the reception desk is unhelpful We didn t have hot water for 1day of our standing The sink in the bathroom got stuck and wasn t fixed during all our staying even after our complain,No Positive
313098,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Not 5 star quality at all in need of a refresh in the rooms and all other services Stated that it has gym facilities however this was across the road and you had to buy a pass to attend The breakfast was very poor for a 5 star hotel, Bed was comfortable and location wasn t too bad if you were happy to walk Decent restaurants about a 10 minute walk away
313099,Bilderberg Garden Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very helpful and friendly The room was lovely and when we came back after a day exploring the staff had music playing for our arrival Bikes to rent is an excellent service and the iced water available in the main reception area was a lovely touch 
313100,Bilderberg Garden Hotel,No Negative, Staff very friendly and welcoming Hotel was spotless Rooms were spaciousp In a lovely neighbourhood 20 mins distance from Central Amsterdam on tram
313101,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, We stayed for eight days and nights and I were terribly disappointed that they had no bureau in the room to enable my wife and me to unpack our clothes I would not be able to recommend your hotel for an extended stay beyond a night or two We had to live out of our suitcases that was extremely uncomfortable Added to that the elevator was constantly out of service that I can understand for a day or two but beyond that The lack of shelves in the room was not understandable We loved your city of Amsterdam and do plan to return but unfortunately not to your hotel When we travel to a lovely city like this we always come for more than one or two nights , Staff were pleasant 
313102,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Noisy from early morning for cleaning and loud knocking on doors in afternoon for room service and bar refill So if you re having a rest you can forget it , A little isolated but quiet area Short walk approx 10 from Concertgebouw and Van Gogh museum Staff very friendly managed to let me check in a little earlier as soon as the room was ready 
313103,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Concierge was not good Didn t report back on questions we asked when looking for direction Well over priced Bottle of water was over 5 reception staff just ok , Bed was comfortable and room was good size
313104,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, A minor gripe that I have paying for bottled water in my room where many hotels offer complimentary water in the guest rooms , Great location and helpful staff 
313105,Bilderberg Garden Hotel,No Negative, The staff were nice in general The cleaning lady was such a sweetheart Sadly I forgot to ask her name but still would like to say it she only gave us some extra teas but she was sweet and helpful about it Short haired young lady with fair skin and brownish hair 
313106,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The bar area was inviting but could have used more staff Our bartender seemed overworked trying to tend to the needs of his own customers and those of the restaurant and had to leave the bar to serve drinks in the restaurant The bar was well appointed but could use a special cocktail menu to bring it to the level of the food served in the restaurant , Clean room comfortable bed We very much appreciated the turn down service and free mini bar in our room Staff was very helpful and immediately tended to our need when we had trouble setting the climate control in our room The location was nice and quiet in a residential part of town and enabled us to relax after the bustle of downtown Public transportation was convenient and easy to navigate Restaurant food was amazing 
313107,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The hotel lobby and gathering places were not in keeping with a 4 5 star hotel The bar tender in the main lobby made up for it The 5 star restaurant was amazing We loved our stay Will stay their again, Staff was excellent 
313108,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, It was a bit cold in the room especially the bathroom floor was ice cold , It was great for our family that the rooms were connected Beds were fabulous Breakfast was excellent 
313109,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, There was nothing we did not like, The beds were extremely comfortable and the staff were very helpful with advice and arranging transport A bonus for wheelchair users 
313110,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Check in was as always slow and complicated Find that in many hotels that front desk is not able to make the first 5 minutes in their establishment pleasant for the guest , Quiet area of town Parking no problem Great bar tender 
313111,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The staff is ok not very helpful or easy to talk to , The room bed very comfortable and bathroom perfect The cleaning service is very good The decoration inside and outside is very fashionable
313112,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The location is a bit far from downtown and you have to cross all residency areas for reaching it , The hotel is fully refurbished quite classy and the staff is really pleasant and helpful 
313113,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Staff weren t very helpful in dealing with some issues we had We requested a room with one large bed on an upper floor We got a twin bedded ground floor room Eventually they pushed the beds together to make one bed but only after requesting this be done a second time On our second morning we requested an extra blanket duvet as we don t like air con heating on overnight and it was cold When we got back to the hotel from being out all day they still hadn t provided an extra one We requested this again that evening but they never brought it There was some dust in the bathroom on the Saturday and it was still there on the Monday when we checked out On the Sunday evening we returned to the hotel from being out all day to find our room door was ajar Anyone could have walked in and helped themselves to our belongings Luckily important stuff was in the safe Breakfasts are too expensive and are not worth the money On check out we were asked if everything was ok with our stay and we said that Amsterdam was terrific however we had some issues with the hotel The lady on the front desk just looked at us and didn t ask what our issues were or apologised , Comfy bed bartender was terrific
313114,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, We were told there was no room service although it s advertised as 24 hours Finally a porter made us a sandwich He was nice to do so but it was expected to be available , The rooms were made up during the day and towels renewed When we came home at night there was classical music playing a lovely touch Bath with jazucci was a treat and fluffy robes to match 
313115,Bilderberg Garden Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is a little away from the centre but in a lovely area very village like A short walk to excellent cafes and shopping streets with good tram service to the centre and surrounding areas and quiet at night 
313116,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The receptionist was not friendly at the check in I have requested a double bed and when we arrived I was told that I m not getting that It is on a first come first serve basis With a very unfriendly tone This is the first interaction and impression of the hotel and unfortunately it set the tone for me for the rest of our stay ,No Positive
313117,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Maybe as a 5 stars hotel is not enough details oriented in the room there was a desk all stripped the hairdryer didn t work silicon between the bathroom tiles not really well done , I ve booked a standard room but when I was checking in the receptionist told me that my room was upgraded to executive for free so a really good surprise The bed was extremely comfortable I ve never slept in a bed like that Everything was really clean the jacuzzi in the bathroom really good The hotel is situated in a posh residential area very quiet and safe The staff really kind and nice 
313118,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, It would be better for the guest if the hotel would give the prices of the rooms with breakfast and the deposit included , Everything was perfect Clean and nice rooms comfortable beds Breakfast was super Stuff nice and polite 
313119,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The location I thought it would be closer to the city centre Spent a lot of money on taxis , Bed was extremely comfortable hotel was spotless and beautiful Front desk staff where very friendly and food was delicious 
313120,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Receptionist did not speak English very well something quite unusual in Amsterdam and was quite unkind She was lost with our booking and wanted to charge us extra money for our stay Luckily we talked to her and there was no problem , Location and breakfast were really good
313121,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Just some minor things that however did affect our experience Even though our stay was fully pre paid the reception has frozen a sum on top of what was paid in case of any damage Also one day we came back to the room and it wasn t cleaned even though we ve put a sign on the door Another day the cleaning lady has thrown away my shower cap but didn t replace it with a new one so I had to call reception in the night Coffee and tea was also not renewed every day , The bed is amazing the room is nice tv minibar safe bathrobes and slippers everything you need for a great stay The location is good walking distance from the museums square You need to take a tram taxi to get to the city centre Nice outdoor terrace 
313122,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Why are the bath tubs not repaired by using fluent email The rosting spot and flakes of disappeared email can very well be repaired This has been suggested by me as a regular guest several times Do it , The new carpets and refreshing Executive rooms and corridors 
313123,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, I think it would be easier for the guests if the price included breakfast , Everything was great everybody was nice and helpful Breakfast is so nice Everything is clean Perfect place if you are in Amsterdam Even for relax or have fun I will come back 
313124,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Very poor facilities in room fridge not working extractor fan in bathroom not working hole in wall where plug socket removed floor lamp not working no milk on tea coffee tray not enough pillows cold room air con heating ineffective We mentioned the issues on checkout and got no response A very long way from the supposed 5 star rating very disappointing , Nice location close to public transport easy to get around Lovely bar and restsurant
313125,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Staff at the reception was horrible waited over 30 minutes so that they clean the room although I was there later than the check in time , Clean and quite
313126,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, We were in a large group and several of our party were miserable in their rooms because they were freezing The hotel didn t seem equipped to warm the rooms when it was very cold outside ,No Positive
313127,Bilderberg Garden Hotel,No Negative, Booked the Executive room on a private floor and really enjoyed the size of the room and the free minibar that was refilled the next day Had a great stay 
313128,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, While I was there they were renovating the second floor starting at 8 AM Hammers in walls digging holes in walls with the machine while we were trying to sleep I went to the reception desk and reported it but they said there is nothing they can do Seriously This happened every single day while I was there except for Saturday and Sunday The worst experience I ve ever had in a hotel , The ground floor where the lounge and the reception desk is looks great The other floors look like a 90 s hospital 
313129,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, At 9am each morning the hotel turned into a building site Banging and drilling just above our room Would I rate this hotel 5 Probably more like 3 Didn t try the restaurant due to the massive price tags and the fact it s a 90 fish menu but it looked very high end Probably giving it the additional 2 stars , The rooms were comfortable and spacious which made a long day sightseeing better in the knowledge you could get back to the hotel and relax The staff also added nice little touches to the stay like turning your radio on to classical music while you were out to give you a nice welcome back Hotel located just 10minutes from the sights of the city easy to walk to all locations 
313130,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The location is not ideal if you want to travel to dam square as there isn t much within walking distance so have to get trams everywhere Not everything in our room worked and was old fashioned compared to the photos We changed rooms as the whole second floor had builders renovating with bits of wallpaper all over the floor and was very noisy Also on the website it says there are spa facilites but there wasn t and staff didn t offer us to use the spa Last thing don t order pizza to your room we ordered two pepperoni pizzas which were not pepperoni I m not even sure what they were but they was the worst pizzas we ve ever eaten and it cost 37 they also change you service charge on everything would not stay here again , The hotel had a nice outdoor seating area the beds were really comfy and the staff were really friendly 
313131,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The management should consider to 1 get rid of embarrassing deposits Very unexpected surprise at the checkin My booking does not say anything about 50eur of deposit per night The site booking com does have it but in a small letters at the very bottom of the page I hate surprises like this 2 plant the garden to support the name of the hotel I can advice you wonderful affordable landscape architect 3 change the fans at the rooms These Valera fans are out of time and place for sure , I like people working here very customer oriented and friendly I liked the food beautiful and very delicious I liked the comfort of a room and bath gels shampoos lotions absolutely fantastic Hartelijk bedankt
313132,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, It s not a 5 star The room is dated and there was building works going on which I would like to have known about before I got there and had the choice to pick somewhere else ,No Positive
313133,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, There was a bag wrapped around the smoke alarm obviously the previous guests had been smoking drugs and the cleaners had not noticed this a potentially deadly hazard, Bed was really comfy the pillow was amazing
313134,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Nice Hotel but checkin awful didnot get a twin deluxe room with 2 beds like i booked had pay for another room Dont go here or it will cost u more, I asked for deluxe twin and didnt get so i had to pay extra room for my bed the hotel did not give me what i asked for front desk checkin the worst ever 
313135,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Numerous charges we weren t aware of Told reception we heard scratching and movement in the air conditioning vents on our last night we were shrugged at and nothing more was said , The room was excellent comfy bed
313136,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, It was snowy in Amsterdam and the room was too cold Bathroom even worse They fixed it in the end but only shortly before my departure The whole setup made a stingy impression e g the pathetic set up for tea and coffee making in the room Not a good stay I won t be going there again , Friendly staff Good location 
313137,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Rooms are out dated and need a face lift Shower was a converted bath tub that is dangerous even for able people Breakfast was boring same stuff every day, Very friendly helpful staff Always felt welcome everybody had a smile 
313138,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The room was a bit cold the heating system was strange and hard to adjust Besides that everything was perfect , Quiet comfortable hotel near the city center and museums Rooms are clean and spacious and the beds are amazingly comfortable 
313139,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, First room we were given was dirty with crumbles on the side table and dirty dock in the corner of the room The room smelled of cannabis and was freezing When we asked about the heating the maid didn t know how to make it work At the end we were asked to wait After waiting for ages and a few phone calls to reception we were given another room with AGAIN Not working heater Then we just gave up and asked to bring us electric heater instead The heating system in this hotel is terrible and only goes up to 20 degrees so if you like to be warm you don t get that in Bilderberg hotel , Quiet average hotel Bonus beautifully designed ground floor 
313140,Bilderberg Garden Hotel,No Negative, We were on our honeymoon and the hotel gave a suprise by decorating our room in flower petals Love it very much Moreover although the location is not at the city centrum area it is easily reachable with trems number 2 5 or 16 
313141,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Having to pay 50 deposit per night even though you get it back at the end we weren t expecting it so had to put it on a card and had to have it back in euros Would have been beneficial to be told before hand Wouldn t class it as a 5 more like a 4 as no pool and mini bar wasn t complimentary , Lovely comfy bed staff very helpful In a great location tram around the corner takes you straight to centre 
313142,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, My room was noisy it was close to the street after 7 am i could hear the car s engine Also the air conditioner was really noisy if you put the fan in number 2 it doesn t happen like that normally in 5 stars hotel i was surprised , I stayed for a week and i didn t feel like i was at 5 stars hotel maybe maximum 4 stars it didn t have gym spa or something else that other 5 stars normally have it was clean The food at the hotel s restaurant was really really good and delicious 
313143,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, As often in Amsterdam the service does not worth a 5 star at all No water bottles in the room bad quality toilets plastic and a little broken not enough towels no carpet in bathroom and staff helpful but not as much as you can expect from a 5 star , The room was fine and beds are comfortable
313144,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The location is far away from city center It takes 25mins by car to go to central station And bus station is also far away The worst thing is the room is too cold to live Too cold in the winter And when I check out the waitress try to let me pay double service charge and city tax And I need a dapter but the hotel cost 15 euros It s should not a 5 stars hotel It s really awful and not good environment Really not a 5 stars level Couldn t believe it ,No Positive
313145,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, 50 per night deposit taken when you check in in case you use the minibar often standard practice but I wasn t aware of this until we arrived , Good sized room Great location close to museums and shops Lovely area Comfy bed 
313146,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, No pool Restuarant not open on Sunday night , The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed we have ever slept in It was large soft and the pillows were lofty The room was made up each morning and we were visited at about 6 each evening to check to see if we needed any extra towels etc which was a nice touch The reception staff were friendly and knowledgeable 
313147,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, They take a 50 deposit for every night stayed which took a sizeable chunk out of my budget right from the start Out of the 150 deposit i paid i only recieved 120 back as they hit me with 3 different service charges and 3 different city taxes Wasnt too impressed with all the hidden charges I paid enough for the room to begin with , The room was very clean comfortable 
313148,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, I was accused of smoking when I don t smoke and hate the habit and threatened with a fine Also approached by reception after checkout about an invoice which I have no idea about and the staff would not say and was for a different room still have no idea They said it s because my signature is similar Anyway I would definitely go back , The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet and dark Lovely decor Great bar too I would highly recommend and definitely look to go back 
313149,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Exterior of the building could use a deep clean It looks very bad when you initially pull up Upon check in the front desk associate Morena was EXTREMELY rude and refused to answer my questions about why it was taking so long her English was perfect It took 20 30 minutes to check in no exaggeration The bed had a big metal bar in the middle almost like a folding couch bed 50 Euro a day deposit is kind of ridiculous , Good location and a staff that was mostly helpful Good bar and restaurant Housekeepers did an excellent job keeping interior mostly clean 
313150,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, location far from city centre price too high compared to their services , just a normal hotel does not worth 5 stars honestly they have a good pizza
313151,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, It s overpriced and not worthy of 5 stars The rooms and elevators are old The wifi is a total zero Not to mention the shock of witnessing the sight of an exhibitionist man on the first floor He got removed luckily and the hotel is not to blame for crazy people , Breakfast and attitude of the personnel were very good Nice car service 
313152,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, That your not told before arriving that you have to pay 50 each night security deposit just incase you use mini bar ect We should be made aware of this to bring the extra money Also the hotel is in a very quiet location me and my partner would of preferred somewhere not so quiet ands fair away from the centre but easy enough to catch the 5 tram going to the centre , The staff was very helpful 
313153,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Shower was a bit basic Some of the reception staff could be more charismatic, A good hotel for a stay in Amsterdam Good location in a nice area which is either 15 mins tram ride or 40 mins walk to city centre Good sized comfortable rooms with all we needed for our stay Nice lounge and bar areas Staff on bar and concierge were very friendly and helpful
313154,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Booked this property because Booking com adervtised it had a fitness center and on site restaurant The fitness center was off site and closed for the holidays and the restaurant was closed as well Blatant misrepresentation Definitely not a 5 star property more like 3 star , Hotel was clean 
313155,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The do not disturb sign doesn t mean anything to the cleaning staff No privacy respect , Location is just perfect Wonderful neighborhood away from cheap stag parties and teenagers locations 
313156,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Staff, Terrible place to stay me and my partner have never met such rude people Didn t feel welcome at any stage of our 4 night stay and it ruined our break as the hotel staff stressed us out constantly asking for money I wouldn t recommend it to anybody 
313157,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The room was very cold and the temperature could not be increased As a solution staff provided a small heater fan After complaint at the reception desk staff offered to change the room but in the new one the heating was broken completely so had to stay in the one with barely working heating ,No Positive
313158,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, A bit of confusion with the concierge over valet parking but we got it sorted out , Location is excellent in the very civilised Oud Zuid Old South district Easy to reach business district of the Zuidas but only 15 minutes walk to Museumplein and the PC HoofStraat Hotel is unflashy but competent and comfortable It s kind of 1970s style but has all mod cons and works very well Friendly and helpful staff The restaurant is a good one and attracts plenty of custom from outside the hotel although it is expensive not much on the plate and a lot on the bill 
313159,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, No comment required , Nice modern comfortable hotel situated nicely outside the hustle and bustle of the busy city centre The staff are lovely and friendly and really helpful 
313160,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, A lot didn t seem to work First room had no heating it was 1 degrees outside and spa bath was broken Moved to another room and the heating was very noisy all night long and fridge didn t work bit of a shame having mini bar included but warm drinks Hotel was unable to resolve any of these issues , Nice and clean Staff were friendly Nice rooms Pretty good value 
313161,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The ground floor room because of the blue lights on the outside and the fact that one must close the curtains before going to bed , This is a wonderful hotel and a perfect one to combine a visit to Amsterdam whether for business or pleasure with a stay in a relaxed and elegant small hotel located in a quiet and peaceful part of town The tram is close and it is an efficient way to get to the centre of town The rooms are immaculate the breakfasts beautiful and the restaurant world class I have been staying here at least once a year for at least seven years I can strongly recommend this hotel 
313162,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, After 3pm we checked in went to the room Room key worked but the room was occupied by somebody else Took us one hour to get another room, The location is great ample parking and an area without much city noise
313163,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, It wasn t easy to use the digital regulation of the heating air condition , My water boiler didn t work but after calling the reception it was immediately replaced There was a big bathtub and the bed was very comfortable

313260,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Long wait to get into room told it would be ready at 3 but it wasn t while other people who were clearly more affluent than us were getting straight to the room and definitely received a better customer service Then on Saturday night a card was put under the door asking me to pay for mini bar items a bottle of water pringles when I had given 100 deposit on my card when I checked in and we were checking out the next day got the impression they didn t trust us They took the money out of my account the day after I booked which I didn t think this would happen as I booked through this site Rooms dated and air con doesn t work well , The bed was big and comfy

313270,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, I liked all it is a really nice hotel Recommended 100 , Excellent hotel in Amsterdam Very well situated close to the tram that takes you straigh on to the city center in few minutes It has also a private parking so that is very usefull when arriving by car you do not need to get the center of the city by car which is quite complicated in a city like Amsterdam The hotel is very quiet and is located in a very quiet place The room service is very good and the room is very comfortable specially the bed whith a really good matelas 
313271,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, This hotel does not deserve a 5 star rating The interior of the rooms is outdated That includes the bathroom The airconditioning did not work so the room felt hot and stuffy After complaining about it the hotel admitted to a general problem so switching rooms was not a solution I had booked for two nights and had prepaid unfortunately so I could only try to grin and bear it Will never return though , A quiet location away from the hectic centre of town
313272,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The air con wasn t the best and was noisy when on the highest setting , The outdoor patio area was lovely and the the patio heaters and blankets are a nice touch when the weather is a little cool 
313273,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Staff the bar tender is extremely arrogant my checkout experience I did not feel welcome not a good experience for a 5 stars hotel , Location facilities 
313274,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, As I mentioned in my previous stays the quality of the breakfast comparing to other 5 and 4 stars hotels is below poor , This was my 8th stay in this hotel It is located in a quiet place and not very far from the attractions the staff are great and helpful
313275,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The dinner menu was a bit fancy for us and breakfast was overpriced We preferred to eat at lunch time in restaurants near the centre and have breakfast in nearby coffee shops The room service menu was boring , The reception staff were very helpful The location was close to tram stop and quiet The room was nicely furnished and clean 
313276,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, We got charged extra money When we arrived we had to pay for every night we stayed extra 50 eur because of security purposes Of course we got the money back after checking out but it was a really unpleasant experience And it gets worse At the check out they charged us for city tax and service charge Can you imagine that The hotel itself was super expensive and then they dont include in the price service charge Seriously I can lift the towels myself up I dont need anyone to do that for me if I have to pay extra money Another disappointing thing was the staff They seemed to be very judgmental because we were the only young couple in the hotel the rest were businessmen or old people They didnt really felt like greeting us and if they did then it was in a kinda funny way The mini bar had an old wine bottle with mold in it , I did like the room and the toiletries were really fancy 
313277,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, But this is not a 5 star hotel 4 stars maximum We were first disappointed by its quite ugly grey exterior that doesn t match the lovely surrounding Inside all is plain though clean and people are amiable , Nice quiet and pretty location Close to the Museum square about a ten minutes walk To the Central station it s about 20 min by tram We bought a 48h ticket at 12 5 euros right at the reception the price is the same as everywhere The hotel is clean quiet nice beds L Occutane bath stuff good wi fi Bath robes and slippers are provided And a tea pot is a plus

313280,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, the glass panel seperating the bathtub and the flower still allow seepage of water from the shower to the floor it is a design flaw, beds were very comfortable given an executive room decent size with a large enough bathroom

313283,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, We felt that the room for a suite wasn t as luxurious as we would have expected There were a few minor details that could have been finished to a better standard , All the staff could not off been friendlier The food in restaurant was outstanding and the bed was very comfortable We found the location to be perfect for us and liked that it was a stroll away from the the trams and some fab restaurants 
313284,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, No info on how to get to hotel FYI Taxi for 40 from airport or train 3 75 to zuid station then 15 to 20min walk , Lovely hotel Rooms are great Spacious warm comfy and clean Rooms are generally bigger than most other hotels in amsterdam Staff are friendly and helpful The location is not perfect but we are explorer s so this didn t bother us too much It s 5 min walk to 5 and 24 trams 15min walk to Old south station 10min walk to museums and vondelpark About 20min walk to leidseplein 15min walk to Albert cuyp market

313293,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Our bathrobe had blood and though we put it on the floor in order for the people to change they just lifted it up and put it in the bathroom hanger They almost charged us for a meal we never took in the hotel s restaurant , The fact that you could have a massage on the room

313296,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The walls are thin like paper each morning I could very clearly hear a couple in the next room having sex Breakfast was not included nor was it made clear to me that this was the case nor was the breakfast worth 25 euros per person per day as the breakfast NEVER had bacon and was extremely poor I could have obtained a much better meal from a restaurant for less money but kept taking breakfast simply because I believed it was included and for included it was good enough but it was NOT worth paying for , The bed was comfy and the staff were friendly 
313297,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The outside appearance of the building , Very nice and clean room and extremely comfortable bed Staff is extremely friendly and helpful and breakfast is great Trams number 5 or 16 pass very frequently and take you to the centre in less than 15 minutes

313301,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The internal heating system was a bit drying and the safe box wasn t working, We visited Amsterdam for a kid free shopping culture and relaxing weekend The hotel neighborhood is quiet and nice and it is just a 12 minutes walking from Vondel park and the museumplein Rooms are big and well equipped and overall was great value for money 
313302,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Breakfast is not to opulent for a 5 Star Hotel The whole place is more like a good 4 Star facility Parking is expensive , Its clean and the staff is friendly Central location 
313303,Bilderberg Garden Hotel,No Negative, It s a little bit further away on foot from the centre but if you re heading to the museum district it s not that far We did get ubers or the tram back to the hotel after a full day of walking 
313304,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Restaurant is too fancy Expensive and plates are too small Nice for a romantic dinner but not good for travelling on business , Great location great hotel 
313305,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Same as other hotels in amsterdam parking is really expensive, Staff very friendly and helpful upgraded to bigger room Restaurant kersentuin definitely a big plus 
313306,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Couldn t use the balcony but otherwise it was a perfect stay , Enjoyed my one night stay with my husband I will diffinatly be happy to stay their again but prefer balcony apartment I absolutely love the customer service and mini bar 
313307,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, When you check in the take a pre authorisation from Your card but do not tell you it takes 10 days from check out for the pre authorisation to be lifted I was charged eur600 on check in and eur460 on check out but told the 600 never left my account which is not true Be careful and make sure they explain as they didn t to us , Great location easy for the train ride to Dam square Staff great and the room was lovely 
313308,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Missed complimentary water bottle especially on arrival Cleaners knocking on the door several times a day was a bit disturbing Pricing policy somewhat complicated there was a mysterious service charge added to the bill 3 80 per night that we discovered when checking out we did not order any extra services and normal services like cleaning the room should be included in the overall price , Good location near the major museums decent and quiet area Nice big beds comfy pillows blankets 
313309,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, We were very far out from everything however the places near by were still beautiful , Staff were lovely attentive and positive they made a real effort for my birthday wrote me a card and gave us a bottle of wine to share The food was also really good and tasty Would love to visit again we slept really well to extremely comfy 
313310,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The service at the bar is not great The bar man was very rude and unfriendly They should learn to be more customer focused , Rooms are big enough and clean Close to public transport whilst in a quiet area 
313311,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, To be charged 23 50 euros for breakfast which was very poor to say the least I m referring to the cooked breakfast the selection was always sparce the staff had to be asked to replenish the bacon egg etc and when they did they produced about 3 rashers of bacon In my opinion the breakfast was very very poor especially for a very very high price The other gripe I have is regarding the lack of coffee tea etc in my room I presume the coffee milk etc was coming out of the maids wages as she failed to replenish those items Will I return to Amsterdam Yes but I won t be staying at this hotel , The staff were polite helpful and friendly The room was okay 
313312,Bilderberg Garden Hotel,No Negative, Loved the staff always friendly and helpful Location was great as it is just 6 minutes walk to the tram and a short tram ride to anywhere you would need to go 
313313,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, I had a problem with the staff when I arrived I explained that I had 2 bookings one for 2 nights paid for by an organization and then I had my 1 night booking paid for by me and I would be grateful if they could give me a room to be covered for the whole stay they advised that was not going to be a problem and gave me a folder for the key to a room for the whole period of 3 nights However on Sunday morning when I was having breakfast a receptionist approaches me and advises that I have to leave the room as the third night paid by me is a different type of room smaller and less expensive I find this unbelievable first to interrupt the client having breakfast and secondly of course the problem which I had signaled at arrival I would happily have stayed at the less expensive alternative for the whole stay in order not to have changed room It is unbelievable that reception personnel can make these types of errors at a hotel with supposedly a high standard , I like the area which is not in the center but easily reachable by tram a quiet residential area 
313314,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, No breakfast because too expensive, Located in a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of beautiful houses posh shops and really close to the museum district Clean and nice 
313315,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, didnt have a spare uk adapter took me 4 hours to find one at centraal station in the end , Everything was good mini bar a bit pricey but just like all mini bars
313316,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Rate this hotel as 5 star is a scam Hotel lobby is ok but rooms are no more than a 3 start hotel small old fashion and far away from a normal 5 start hotel Awful service and very unpleasant employees More than 30 minutes for check in and check out At 22 00pm there was no food service in the bar and just simple sandwiches in the room I do not recommend this hotel at all , Good restaurant 
313317,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Damage the temperature control of room The shower hasn t good seal then cause oveflood in the bathroom The holder of shower is damage The later check out 1 hour after has additional cost Additional cost was invoiced as cost of environment protection but didn t explain before of the reservation , We liked the bed the location the hotel is very nice and the personal was kind The breaskfast is good 
313318,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, At the time of my stay they had some young personnel on training with some misunderstandings, Food at their restaurant is fantastic All bartenders were really friendly and service in general reception restaurant bar was excellent

313321,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, When checking out i was just told that a sum of money would be taken from my card but it was difficult to get details of the charges and I had to ask for a copy of the bill which explained them it would have been easier if i had been given the copy of the bill first , My room was ready for early check in and was serviced exceptionally well during my stay the staff were pleasant and helpful 
313322,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, We had booked a room with a queen size bed and unfortunately after checking in around 9pm got given 2 single beds however once we bought this to the attention of the reception staff the situation was corrected and our rooms changed at the earliest convenience This happened to be the next morning but 1 night was fine as we were pleased with how quickly and simply they helped us out , As a young couple keen to explore we loved how easy it was to get into the main city of Amsterdam and surrounding buzzing surburbs from the hotel location Just a short leisurely 5 minute walk to the tram with an 8 10 minute journey into the city 5 to the surrounding buzz and 3 to the museum district 10 or so minute walk What s better the beer garden at the hotel was a lovely place to enjoy a morning cup of tea or nice evening drink 
313323,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, No milk in room for tea Air conditioning not adequate but managed to open the windows very warm for November, Exceptional staff and very comfortable hotel 
313324,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, We were a group of friends travelling together to mark a special birthday Beds were not provided in the format requested at the time of booking twin beds expected double bed provided despite calling the hotel in advance of booking Hotel staff were slow to remedy the situation Attention to detail was not what was expected of a 5 star hotel , Location nice reception area and bar area etc 
313325,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Food was exceptionally expensive and the quantity and waiting time was ridiculous The food was good but still the overall evaluation is not good , Staff courtesy location closed to RAI Exhibit
313326,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, My only complaint was that in the street below my room window there was a staff entrance where staff would congregate presumably to smoke and their talking and laughter could be heard clearly sometimes until almost 2 00 am which kept me awake , The room was a very good size and very comfortable and the service staff friendly and thorough Reception staff and porters were extremely helpful and welcoming and there was a very pleasant lounge bar with a friendly barman The breakfasts were very good and I thought value for money The location which was in a pleasant area was about a half hour tram journey from the old town but only about a 15 minute walk from the museum quarter which suited me There were also several nice restaurants within walking distance I shall certainly stay there again 
313327,Bilderberg Garden Hotel,No Negative, Staff very friendly and polite Hotel room was ready on arrival even though we were a few hours early Room service was excellent and catered for our request without any hassle

313332,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The room air con didn t work couldn t get the air con to cool the room by using the controls had to get a fan from reception , The hotel was located in a nice area and worth the short walks to get to the local attractions

313335,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The phone in our room was not working and even after multiple complaints no action over our 3 day stay The mini bar was well stalked but fridge was too small to store anything else Very few options for eating out around the Hotel Most of them close early and very few provide take aways , Restaurant is awesome So are the Chefs and the serving staff Breakfast menu could be better The Hotel staff is very polite and helpful Even during late nights

313338,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Restaurant menu was expensive and not good value and the room was incredibly stuffy even for October I would still stay again but eat elsewhere, Good location and easy for catching the tram to the city 
313339,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, A little dated and small with few on site facilities for five or even four stars The restaurant and bar menus were also a little strange , Attentive and friendly staff
313340,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, the location is not close to city s attraction but you still can go with the tram 5 min walk then about 10 min with tram, The staff were very helpful and hotel is extremely clean spotless 
313341,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The restaurant looked more like a tapis bar and an expensive one at that , Conviently located for visiting the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museums Peaceful quiet area with a number of restaurants near by 
313342,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, It was unfortunate that my visit coincided with the upgrade of the hotel meaning accessing the entrance area was on some occasions quite dangerous, My room was lovely and the breakfasts delicious
313343,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, The hotel is tired and dated has no character Rooms were more TravelLodge than 5 it certainly does not justify 5 based on facilities or comfort bed was very hard A C unit outside window on flat roof was noisy and I SHOULD HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT THERE WOULD BE RENOVATION WORKS BEING CARRIED OUT IN COMMON AREAS DURING MY STAY AS WELL AS A LARGE AND POTENTIALLY NOISY PARTY AT THE HOTEL FOR THE 2nd NIGHT But we checked out a day early early to avoid it This was hugely inconvenient and really ruined our stay in Amsterdam I am not happy , Leaving
313344,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, If you accidentally moved into that hotel be prepared to a lot of comfortableness be consistently offered apples knocking on the door in evening and if not responded still breaking your door to offer a nice apple lack of cold water in the shower only HOT even if you re using only cold the temp is 30C your bath floor will always get wet after taking a shower be careful to step conditioning in the room also miss cold air noise in the room in early morning when service cars stop and unload just under your opened window because you want fresh and cold air during the breakfast there could be no free tables as a space is very limited be careful using a glasses could be broken on top leading your to a mouth injury eggs and bacon too dry there could be conference in the hotel and restaurant could be closed for ordinary inhabitants renovations in the hotel during our stay it was lobby could start at any time on any day and be too loud to stay at the hotel,No Positive
313345,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Functional hotel lacking atmosphere and amenities no gym no indoor lounge bar due to refurbishment Restaurant over priced with unconventional menu Rooms were drab aircon was weak and there was noisy plant close to bedroom window , Pleasant quiet leafy location on the southern side of the city with reasonably close access to the main museums 
313346,Bilderberg Garden Hotel,No Negative, Nice hotel with good sized rooms very friendly staff and ample parking It s just 15 minutes walk from the museum district and center hence a good location to explore the city while staying in a quiet neighborhood Breakfast was a very good spread as well 
313347,Bilderberg Garden Hotel,No Negative, Great location i in the vicinity of two major tram lines ii in the vicinity of a big town park iii in a quiet neighborhood but with a lot of nice cafes and restaurants and iv easy accessible from the airport On top of it rooms are nice and comfortable 
313348,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Extremely poor Internet had to change rooms for better wifi signal the hotel is still on primitive age giving internet vouchers to guest Very Poor Internet connnectivity in rooms Maintenance going on in the hotel with drilling noise during the day Very poor breakfast, Only good thing about this hotel is its peaceful location
313349,Bilderberg Garden Hotel,No Negative, We had a fab time here the staff were amazing The only problem with the location was we never got off the team in the right place so more our fault than the location We didn t have breakfast at the hotel there was a lovely little cafe 2 roads down 
313350,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, There were major renovation works being undertaken and very noisy at times, The hotel was clean and very comfortable Located in a very desirable area although slightly out of the centre but close to the beautiful parks and museums 
313351,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Nothing bad about this place during our stay , Location was really good We like coming back to the hotel with the room sparkling clean and classical music turned on via the tv vy the house keeper Really nice We liked it alot 
313352,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, didnt anticipate or know high cost of breakfast 22 50 euro per day plus gratuity and tax until checkout Not posted and I didn t ask Rooms were so inexpensive it didn t matter I Long run but it was a shock Internet was difficult to connect and remain connected, Location facity and staff were great Food was excellent gourmet as was service but extremely pricey relative to cost of room 
313353,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Although they were very nice and did their job well the room service cleaning service was aggressive and overbearing They start cleaning very early in the morning and if you forget to put the don t disturb sign on the knob they ll wake you up and try to come in One time the cleaner was waiting outside our door when we left for breakfast and asked us to clean the room even though we were only going to be downstairs for 15 minutes or so I felt pressured to allow them to clean There is also someone who comes around 7pm to close the curtains leave apples and prepare the beds for sleeping and although I guess they mean that as an extra touch it feels quite invasive They also knock several times and try to come in which almost lead to a situation where the person walked in on me having a shower Speaking of which the bathroom is unfit for seniors as the bathtub is very high hard to get into and out of and water from the shower gets outside and floods the bathroom even if you re careful , The hotel is in a very nice neighborhood with quiet streets all around There are some nice parks close by and good restaurants within walking distance It s far from the hustle and bustle of the city center but there are tram lines within a 5 minute walk that will take you there in 20 min or less so it was definitely a very good location The staff at the front desk was always very pleasant and attentive going above and beyond to help you with all your needs 
313354,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Poor wi fi At the check out I was informed about the service fee If you want to rent a bicycle you need to pay a tax bigger than at the bicycle rent centres in the town e g 12 5 euro 3 hours The deposit charged at check in is very high 50 euro day , The location is great

313359,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, When leaving we were charged 16 euros for city tax and a mandatory service charge we thought this should have been including in the price or at least we should have been told about it on arrival , Extremely nice hotel on the outskirts of the city centre Located in a pleasant area of the city and only 15 minutes on the tram into the city centre Staff were very friendly 
313360,Bilderberg Garden Hotel, Nothing, Excellent hotel Very clean and comfortable we stayed in an executive room and it was lovely The reception staff were most helpful as was the restaurant staff though we only had breakfast which was delicious If we were going back to Amsterdam we would definitely stay here because of the above and because it is not far by tram to get where you want to be Tram is the mode of transport to take taxis take much longer because of the circuitous route they have to take
