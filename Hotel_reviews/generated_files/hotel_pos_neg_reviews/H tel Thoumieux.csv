245656,H tel Thoumieux, The hotel was perfect , The staff were warm and friendly and the hotel is a true boutique hotel not part of a chain I liked the eclectic decoration and the attention to detail I loved the fact that there were really nice Aesop bath products not little samples but proper large bottles The hairdryer was a proper one not one attached to the wall a pleasant surprise and our bathroom was large and luxurious 
245657,H tel Thoumieux,No Negative, Perfect position for walking to all the main sights staff make you feel like royalty from check in to check out and even after that We dined in both their restaurants and both were exemplary We couldn t have been happier and we wanted for nothing Facilities extremely clean beds extremely comfortable If it s in your price range it s not to be missed And even then the service and meals exceeded places I stayed which cost me much more Thanks 
245658,H tel Thoumieux, The room tended to be stuffy despite the air conditioning Could be very hot during summer Room 15 requires a climb , The bed was wonderfully comfortable
245659,H tel Thoumieux, maybe the day I stayed they had a some unusual situation in the kitchen but waiting to get a drink quite some time during breakfast was a bit disappointing because all table arrived on different time but drinks arrived at the same time as we were at school I think there was unusual situation on that day , I really liked the decor of room romantic wall paper bed cover light cover My room had a bathtub and it was very pretty It helpst to relax after long day walking Paris Also I think the room was quite spacious for Paris 
245660,H tel Thoumieux, The service quality got really bad The people at the reception are rude cant even send a water upstairs before an hour plua the room was cold , I have been stayimg at this hotel since 5 years I love the decoration of the rooms and the Aesop shampoos loved the cookies and cakes they had 
245661,H tel Thoumieux,No Negative, The place is by far the best Traveling to Paris for a 3 night stay over New Years Our experience started with a kind email from the hotel Benoit offering to arrange a limo service to collect us from the airport We availed of this facility with was prompt and friendly and got us to our hotel in superior comfort On our arrival we were met by with a fantastic and warm welcome which set the tone for and exceptional stay Our room was not ready as we were early but they kindly kept our bags and explored the city I did ask for them not to rush the room I m happier for it to be cleaned correctly I m a bit of a stickler on cleanliness in hotels When we returned we were brought to the room and our bags had been brought up there was music playing on the rooms iPad We were presented with complementary gateaux s from the Thouimeux Bakery In addition we were advised of the Dring me service Which is a free phone with Dring me installed providing free international calls so we could ring home on new years The phone could also be brought out with you anywhere in Paris It had maps app not google so we could locate the places we wanted to see and it provided up to date transport options buses taxi metro and walking This information was live so when public transport was free on New Years Eve it told us first We brought it everywhere and were able to make our early new years calls home with out the worry of roaming charges or the worry of getting lost The rooms are as good as they are advertised in every element From the luxurious duvet and pillows to the marble floors and porcelain sinks funky mirrors slippers and dressing gowns provided The air conditioning for me as with all hotel rooms was slightly noisy at night noting that this was the normal operational sounds for this system the engineer in me but this can be turned off from the controller in your room if your a light sleeper 
245662,H tel Thoumieux, Can t think of anything, We were celebrating our 5th wedding anniversary and we were greeted very warmly with a bottle of champagne Our room was wonderful and had a terrific view of the Eiffel Tower We had stayed once before in 2012 and can honestly say we loved it as much the second time round The surrounding neighbourhood is great for shopping and restaurants and we visited the Irish bar downstairs many times during our stay The brunch on Sunday was spectacular Also we had a late train journey home and we re given a late check out time of 1pm at no extra cost If you want a stylish and relaxing trip to Paris stay here 
245663,H tel Thoumieux, Small room I had no view interior shower regulator panel needs some mainteinance , I loved pretty much everything of my short stay This boutique hotel is located in a silent street in a wonderful and central area of Paris just 2 minutes walk from tube station and from Eiffel tower Lots of shops and restaurants around and amazing bakery just in front of the hotel I loved the eccentric decor of the room and the fact the hotel has only 15 rooms Feels very special A winning point was the mobile I was given for the total lenght of my stay from which I could call everywhere in Europe and US at no charge and had internet connection while being around the city I ll definetely come back and next time I ll try the 2 michelen stars restaurant just below the hotel Benoit the front office manager was lovely and very helpful 
245664,H tel Thoumieux, The noise from the heating was a little bit annoying buzzing all night long I tried to switch it off but then it started to be really cold in the room visited in November , If you visit Paris often and usually stay in one of the 3 stars hotels you will immediately notice the difference After entering the building you are warmly welcomed by nice and helpful staff who will help you with your luggage and show you the room Room and especially bathroom is quite spacious in comparison to Paris standard In particular I really like those hot pipes in the bathroom which keep towels warm 
245665,H tel Thoumieux,No Negative, My boyfriend and I had a peaceful one night stay at Hotel Thoumieux The staff were very pleasant and attentive I also appreciated the car service for a fee from the airport No matter how many times I ve visited Paris it s still lovely to see the Eiffel Tower when coming and going to the hotel Great location

245668,H tel Thoumieux, Breakfast is quite pricey and not included No lift so this could be a problem if you are lugging heavy bags and the rooms can be quite small The staff member had to move us to another room for us to be more comfortable and we were 2 people with 2 large and 2 carry on suitcases in total , Great boutique Parisian hotel in a great area close to the Eiffel Tower and metro as well as restaurants and cafes Highly recommend 
245669,H tel Thoumieux, Someone should have given me the manual on how to operate the coffee machine Also I requested for a croissant before leaving the hotel for my flight back at 6 am No croissant materialized , Excellent dinner at the Brasserie
