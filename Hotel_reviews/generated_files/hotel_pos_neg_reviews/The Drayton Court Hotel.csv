92729,The Drayton Court Hotel, The photos advertised on the pages showed nice vintage bath tubs What I didn t know was that there were only a select few rooms that had them The shower rooms I had in my room were good but I was expecting a bath tub I asked reception and they said that it should have been stated in the requests section during the booking At least I know for next time Some of the lighting for say the dressing table was obscure and difficult to find , The customer service at reception and the restaurant were good Great selection of refreshments in the room from teas and fancy pods for the coffee machine The mini fridge for the small pint of fresh milk was an adorable touch The quirky decor definitely lived up to the description on the booking page Lovely view from my room of the big beer garden Unfortunately it was raining heavily when I stayed so I couldn t visit 
92730,The Drayton Court Hotel, Windows bedroom was difficult to open all the way for air , Excellent breakfast Fast service by friendly waitress Outdoor terrace for breakfast Quiet room Near restaurants and shops in Ealing Broadway 
92731,The Drayton Court Hotel, Nothing , Lovely comfortable bed and the shower was great I particularly loved the fact that they ve actually placed a hairdryer where you can easily find it that it s right by a mirror for styling Seems insignificant but I can t tell you the amount of hotels where the hairdryer is nowhere near a mirror We even played table tennis in the garden in the evening and drank cocktails served by a knowledge barman If you have to away from home on business hotels like this make it really enjoyable I ll be back 
92732,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, I couldn t fault the hotel Great staff that couldn t do enough for me their receptionist even went as far as to offer to lend me her husband s cufflinks when I discovered I d left mine behind 
92733,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, The staff were incredible at this hotel very friendly courteous and helpful I do feel however due to the price of the room I expected a little more Stayed in the lavender suite which was lovely however does need a little upgrading e g crack in bathroom sink slight fraying on carpet tiles in shower area look tired They are only small details but I do think these things could be looked at and improved 
92734,The Drayton Court Hotel, Reception was in a difficult location as you have to move to allow guests access to the lift , Close by to the train station with a regular service to central London Plenty of shops in the surrounding area Room was nicely decorated as was the whole of the hotel The staff were very friendly and helpful 
92735,The Drayton Court Hotel, The rooms could have been cleaner especially the carpet and bathrooms which looked as if they needed more of a deep clean to get the showers and grout sparkling The sink in our room was also cracked Our TV didn t work and despite telling them on the first day that it wasn t working it wasn t fixed Parking was very limited so we had to leave our car on the street one night and move it before 9am which wasn t ideal The staff at the desk whilst friendly didn t seem to know how much breakfast cost as it wasn t included in our rate and we were simply told to go and ask at the bar We ate there on the second evening and whilst by two boys enjoyed their kids meals which were reasonably priced I had a salad which was awful no dressing fatty meat etc The bar area could also have done with a clean the tables and bar had a lot of drink spills which nobody seemed to be bothered about and we had to ask them to clean our table before we sat down We would also have liked to have gone to sit in the lounge area which looked really nice but it had been booked by a private party so we weren t able to use it The downstairs entrance from the car park staff entrance could also have done with a really good clean not a great first impression The garden was huge and would have been nice to have sat in but again looked rather neglected The most disappointing thing was that none of the staff asked us how our stay was or if we d enjoyed our meals etc , Rooms were well equipped and comfortable There was good soundproofing so we weren t disturbed by the thunder storms or traffic It was good to find a dog friendly hotel in London The location was good and right next to West Ealing station which would have been useful had we needed to go into central London Our boys enjoyed playing on the table tennis table in the back garden 
92736,The Drayton Court Hotel, Bathroom looked like it needed a scrub in places For example mould starting to show in between tiles nothing bad but the sort of thing you might have at home and keep thinking you need to buy some mould spray for , Service was great and food was fine
92737,The Drayton Court Hotel, The bathroom was huge which was great until we saw the shower curtin We haven t seen a shower curtin since the early 90 s Not only was it ugly but the bottom of the curtin appeared to have yellow urine stains on it and mould It needs to be bleached or thrown out There was no bar fridge which was extremely frustrating There was a little cooler box sitting on the desk which could hold no more than a few cans of soda The restaurant was over priced Breakfast made us laugh as it was 6 pounds for a few bland cereals a couple of small cakes and ONE piece of toast When checking out we asked the man at reception to organise a taxi for us instead he called a chauffeur company next door to the hotel I can t remember the name which was frustrating as a taxi would have been much cheaper When it comes time to pay the chauffeur we are told cash only which is fantastic when all we had were our credit and debit cards , The staff 9 points The beds were very comfy 9 points The beer garden was HUGE 9 5 points The ice machine 10 points Ealing West station is a 2 minute walk away 10 points 
92738,The Drayton Court Hotel, The room was a bit brown decor wise Lots of really grubby fingerprints on the walls from a previous occupant could do with scrubbing off Yuk I had to hunt for a receptionist which meant I had to queue at the bar before we could check in Bit irritating , It s a pub with rooms Nice pub with a lovely garden and a friendly ambience Good value for London The food looked nice but we didn t eat there as we were going to a party Staff friendly Room was compact but had nice bathroom and also good tea teapigs and coffee nepresso and real milk Impressed Bed very comfy It was a hot night so we had to open a window and thought it would be noisy but actually it wasn t Would definitely recommend if you want to stay in West Ealing at a reasonable price and in somewhere nicer than a travelodge 
92739,The Drayton Court Hotel, Half an hour tube journey from central London didn t really bother us too much and wouldn t put me off from staying here again , It was very clean and comfortable I slept very well and I don t usually in a hotel It was also very quiet Beautiful freshly cooked breakfast with plenty of choice I would highly recommend this hotel 
92740,The Drayton Court Hotel, Very limited parking General manager was not helpful at all Out of date milk provided to us in our room which meant we could not have a tea or coffee We did not have breakfast as we were told the incorrect information Such a same as the room was beautiful , Room was nice and clean
92741,The Drayton Court Hotel, Pillows were poor quality and the coffee machine in the room temperamental Would gave preferred some instant coffee as a back up The cost of our stay increased dramatically due to Adele playing at Wembley but this was in line with all the hotels , Staff were friendly and helpful the room was clean and fresh when we arrived Food in the restaurant was good Fresh milk was really appreciated Close to Wembley where we were going 
92742,The Drayton Court Hotel, Staff waiters in bar in evening could put a little smile on and be a bit more friendly like the reception bar and breakfast staff , Reception staff were very good room clean comfortable restaurant evening meal was excellent 
92743,The Drayton Court Hotel, Air conditioning not cold enough Rooms needed a touch up Passport to Pimlico Shower leaked Bed coverings worn Walls and trim needed fresh paint Didn t feel like it was cared for fresh or new , Rooms designed beautifully 
92744,The Drayton Court Hotel, Location of our room was not the best Room 8 at the entrance of the corridor leading to all rooms so constant opening and closing of door outside our room and clients that are less thoughtful than others in how much noise they make disturbing your sleep which is never good I would also comment that there were quite a few marks on the walls and not sure what they were but several were higher up the wall near the tv so really not sure how that had happened After being served what seemed like a nice breakfast bap the tomato sauce bottle exploded upon opening it all over my face and glasses and fresh clean t shirt which I was less than happy with and the contents of the sauce bottle looked like fizzy tomato sauce which was very unappetising to be honest I did report it and whilst a couple of staff were surprised to hear it their apologies seemed pretty disingenuous to me Unfortunately the damage was done already and it really did put a dampener on the morning I didn t feel the breakfast layout was the best either and it certainly wasn t overly clear as to where the milk was kept and upon returning to my seat and asking we were informed that the milk was kept in a large metal bowl on the bar along with the juices that were kept there too it could do with being a little clearer for my mind , The daytime menu was good being able to order several starter plates to share at a slightly better rate and the food was good quality Nice selection of drinks there too and nice atmosphere in the bar very busy bustling place I didn t expect to have aircon in the room and I would say that it was quiet and most welcome too as the room was hot when we walked in 
92745,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, Lovely staff and excellent location for us being near friends and 2 minute walk from West Ealing Station Quiet location too Beds very comfy double glazing and lovely air con so slept well 
92746,The Drayton Court Hotel, Far away from London center Need 30 40 mins from London center to here and need to transfer at Ealing Broadway by under ground, Good location hotel location close to West Ealing station where is one of stop of Heathrow airport express
92747,The Drayton Court Hotel, Couldn t find directions for car park on website and the entrance is easy to miss Room smelt of greasy food e g takeaway Told reception not sure if they investigated Smell went after a few hours with window open , Romantic decor Opening window Coffee machine High quality products in bathroom on tea tray 
92748,The Drayton Court Hotel, It started raining during the night and some of the water got into the room and the carpet was all wet in the morning, The beds were great clean rooms beautiful terrace and friendly staff 
92749,The Drayton Court Hotel, Very busy with long wait at the bar restaurant in the evening , Coffee machine garden terrace The food in restaurant was mixed the steak pie was excellent and piping hot but the sweet potato curry was hardly a curry just potato with maybe a bit of curry powder served luke warm the fish and chips looked great though so maybe one bad choice We would stay at this hotel again if in the area 
92750,The Drayton Court Hotel, For a start the AC wasn t working and the heating was on full Our bathroom door was broken and staff kept coming into our room about 4x when I was sleeping and when I came out the shower On top of that I paid extra to check in later than 11am and still got woken up by staff coming into my room When I told the guy at the checkout all I got was an apology but no refund or anything offered Not happy with the service of this hotel at all, The atmosphere in the garden and bar and the decor of the hotel
92751,The Drayton Court Hotel, There s nothing not to like, This hotel was excellent throughout The room comfort facilities and excellent staff were second to none We will definitely be back 
92752,The Drayton Court Hotel, Room was very hot and the air con even though on was not very effective In the end we left the window open throughout our stay which worked fine but in summer I would imagine the room temperature would be unbearable , Nice to have the lounge area to sit in a nice bonus which meant we could relax away from the room 
92753,The Drayton Court Hotel, The hotel no longer has the swimming pool facility contract with the local spa but this is not reflected in partnered booking site deals This loss of facility did not change the price and nor did it bother the manager that I had specifically chosen a hotel with this facility to find out on the day of arrival with a nonchalant approach that the contract no longer exists I would have chosen a different hotel closer to the centre with a built in pool for less money , The decor was very nice 
92754,The Drayton Court Hotel, Nothing , The room was lovely and clean with an extremely comfortable bed A very homely feel to a small but cosy hotel Very good staff our room had a problem with the bathroom on night one of our stay and when we informed the staff at reception they offered us a free drink at the bar and had the issue dealt with within 10 minutes 
92755,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, So simple to get to centre of London with tube so nice to get back to hotel and put your feet up or take a drink in the pub It is clean friendly comfortable Thanks We all really enjoyed our stay see you soon
92756,The Drayton Court Hotel, There wasn t many things I could say in this section however if to be a bit picky the bathroom sink was blocked so water wasn t going down as well as it should and the safe was locked out so no access to it however I did not needed it and all of the above has been reported on the check out therefore I m pretty sure it s already sorted , I really like the fact that the hotel it self does not look promising from the outside just a regular accomodation house with a pub in it however you can be nicely suprised once inside I ve been to a few hotels in my like and this one trull made a really good impression Room was very spacious and well equiped coffee maker with coffee biscuts to go with it very clean toilet definately strong 5 out of 5 On top of it all amazingly good value for money will definately visit again 
92757,The Drayton Court Hotel, Breakfast service was a bit long , The bed room and bathroom were very spacious The place very quiet There is a big garden behind the hotel with a playground for kids 
92758,The Drayton Court Hotel, Being double charged by the hotel Late checkin time of 3 PM Early checkout of 11 AM , Excellent bed Nicely decorate room Excellent breakfast high quality food and drinks Very helpful and nice staff Lovely beer garden Great location right across from west Ealing train station 
92759,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, We got a free upgrade for an amazing suite The Blue Lamp so my review is for this room The suite was stunnig we got free water coffee Nespresso tea hot chocolate and shortbread It was very clean beautiful and individual The room was very quiet we didn t hear any noise of other rooms or the streets The bed was big and comfy good blankets We loved the shower and the very big bathtub The free Wifi worked well All in all we had an awesome stay in this lovely hotel and will come back for sure 
92760,The Drayton Court Hotel, Nothing at all to possibly find fault with Keep doing what you all do , Laura the receptionist was genuinely welcoming and very professional I work as a Night Porter so like to think that the level of customer service I give my guests is of the quality I like to receive myself when visiting other hotels Laura was so helpful and kind and extremely good at her job A pleasure to stay in such a lovely and well run establishment and my Ladykillers Room was wonderful
92761,The Drayton Court Hotel, It was a little noisy overnight with lots of people walking past our room to get to theirs , The staff were very friendly and helpful Our room was spacious and comfortable even with a travel cot next to the bed The posh coffee machine and tea pigs teabags were a nice bonus in our room as was the free parking The hotel is a 15 minute walk from Ealing Broadway tube station so perfect for exploring the city centre 
92762,The Drayton Court Hotel, Unprofessional staff at breakfast Put us on the spot and kept hammering on about whether we allready paid for breakfast or not We didn t due to a misunderstanding when booking So they kept on hammering the issue until I settled it with reception We appreciate a tranquile atmosphere when just out of bed Not the kind of borderline harassement we experienced here The breakfast wasn t even worth it , Nice and quiet room Kettle and coffee machine in the room 
92763,The Drayton Court Hotel, We asked to change room as the first room smelt horrid They were quick to accommodate despite the hotel being full Second room was much better , Accommodating staff comfy beds Nespresso coffee machine in room 
92764,The Drayton Court Hotel, It was a hot weekend aprox 23 degrees and our room was in the sun for the majority of the day but the air conditioning room temp unit wasn t great and as such we were quite hot throughout the night Can t be helped though except maybe an upgrade to the temp control and shouldn t complain when we got to spend the weekend at such a lovely hotel in the sunshine , Brilliant overnight stay for family attending an event at Wembley Bar Garden was great for such a sunny weekend Rooms were very clean and beautifully decorated and stocked with Nespresso machine and Tea pig tea bags just little extra touches that made the whole stay so wonderful
92765,The Drayton Court Hotel, There was someone s half bottle of water on the counter The waste basket in the bathroom was not emptied Two walls had wine stains on them The bathroom door did not lock You hotel room book does not explain how the lights work so the first time in the bathroom was a bit interesting Your on line advertising says the room has a tub but that is not the case Being a first time in England I did not know how the lights or heating worked I slept in a cold room the first night I left the bathroom lights on all night so the bathroom would be warmer in the morning I would have appreciated more shampoo for the second night I don t normally complain but if you change a few things maybe I can help someone else from experiencing things as I did Allan,No Positive
92766,The Drayton Court Hotel, Been here eight times now Always been welcomed and looked after , Staff really friendly Rooms clean and spacious Good food selection at the restaurant Real ales available 
92767,The Drayton Court Hotel, Was initially given a room that we liked but within about half an hour just enough time to unpack was told that we had been given the wrong room and had to move Second room was not as nice in terms of layout Air conditioner did not work on cool despite reporting it so we had two fairly warm to hot nights Room was a little dirty in places with stains on the walls , Breakfast was good 
92768,The Drayton Court Hotel, Milk portions in the room instead of the silver flask with milk in which although tasted ok smelt disgusting and maybe normal coffee to as a choice alongside the coffee machine option , Lovely food in the restaurant Black out curtains were great and I had a free upgrade to a beautiful room too 
92769,The Drayton Court Hotel, Disappointed that the room only had a shower website shows some nice bathrooms Tv in the room was in a poor position for watching it in bed, Nice and welcoming atmosphere good breakfast
92770,The Drayton Court Hotel, Room temperature a little warm for us , Room was very quiet bed comfortable and shower great Parking very useful the best hotel of this price range I have stayed in in London I would stay there again 
92771,The Drayton Court Hotel, Minus Wifi irritating Fuller ads popping up all the time Not suitable for those who wish to be in central London in no time because it takes about 30 minutes to get there, Plusses Located in Ealing away from the worst tourist traps we had a chance to see a little bit local life Clean small friendly service Nice pub downstairs serving good local meals friendly staff
92772,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful the room was beautifully decorated and well heated the bed was very comfortable The room and surrounding area was also quiet to stay in which was nice and meant that I got a very restful sleep Perfect location too close to everything I needed 
92773,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, Upon arrival we were greeted by a lovely lady who made us feel so welcome The bar staff were just as lovely The room was clean and comfortable and such good value for money So happy with our stay and will definitely be returning 
92774,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, Handy for the M40 A40 Space to park Lovely staff Tastefully modernised whilst retaining its original style Good breakfast and enjoyed the evening meal we had there E1 bus then tube into Central London no problem 
92775,The Drayton Court Hotel, Breakfast service was very slow and the young waitresses got the order wrong again this happened last time we stayed perhaps they should write the order down , The room was a good size liked the chairs in the window good shower Very quiet
92776,The Drayton Court Hotel, No staff on reception at both arrival and departure as no means to call attention had to weight at reception until staff arrived , Good clean and comfortable room 
92777,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, Food was great but the one price breakfast for all options seemed a bit ham fisted Regardless the garden pub and lounge were great spaces The double room was also quite large 
92778,The Drayton Court Hotel, On this occasion I have no complaints at all, The whole atmosphere of the room hotel and pub utself was amazing Great value for money very clean and staff very helpful and professional especially at reception 
92779,The Drayton Court Hotel, Receptionist was not particularly warm and seemed surprised at the end of her robotic spiel when we asked what room number we were in as she had told us everything but , Beautiful and full of character Loved the coffee machine and decor in the room 
92780,The Drayton Court Hotel, Only slight criticism was the wait at breakfast juice running out frequently but it was very very busy with a wedding party 2 X girls rushed off their feet still managed to stay v polite, Lovely room traditional but modern so quiet excellent d glazing as no road noise at all Big shower great toiletries conditioner which is a real plus quite often not given Really big place with amazing garden balcony area plus 2 X bar areas drawing room Great breakfast choice a real bonus as many hotels just offer continental Coffee machine kettle in room too
92781,The Drayton Court Hotel, I didn t like that a bowl of porraige was charged at the rate of a cooked breakfast 12 pounds sterling and was nt well cooked My mum did not eat and was charged this very high amount Every thing else was very nice , Rooms very comfortable and quiet at night Nice big bathroom with great shower 
92782,The Drayton Court Hotel, A teapot at breakfast not a teabag in a cup would have enhanced the breakfast experience for me Shower cap needed in bathroom , The staff were exceptional Nothing was too much trouble The bedding and bathroom toiletries were luxury standard The reason for booking originally was the provision of a car park which was easy to get to directly behind the hotel and was free Being able to park there before we checked in was so considerate and started the stay in an exceptional way 
92783,The Drayton Court Hotel, Honestly nothing , Everything was great here from reception service to the standard of the room which was quietly luxurious Plus the great pub bar downstairs who do a mean black pudding scotch egg great wines beers to choose from Again really friendly staff And the complimentary breakfast in the morning was not only continental buffet style but a cooked brunch style coffee on top Perfect thanks 
92784,The Drayton Court Hotel, Firm mattress and pillows way too soft, Excellent staff very helpful Room good had flat screen tele coffee machine Good shower Good location for tube to London 5 taxi to tube station or walk 15 20mins 
92785,The Drayton Court Hotel, Our room was freezing cold as the heating hadn t been turned on the electrics fused a couple of times and the room could have been cleaner Windows very dusty black marks round the bath and under the loo rim , We liked the assistant manager George who was very helpful sorting out our heating and generally being very polite and concerned 
92786,The Drayton Court Hotel, Room was too hot usually I m always cold so for me to moan about this is unusual even tho I turned the temperature down it was still too warm , Lovely place very nice staff were lovely too price wasn t bad for where it was either 
92787,The Drayton Court Hotel, I liked everything about the hotel so can t really complain, Relaxed environment have stayed at the Drayton several times and will stay here again soon
92788,The Drayton Court Hotel, Nothing at all It was a great experience for us I will be returning next time I m in London , The hotel was a great value for my money Rooms were very clean It even felt like we were staying in a more fancy hotel with how lovely the room was 
92789,The Drayton Court Hotel, It was extremely dirty everywhere in the room the most expensive room in the hotel In the bathroom the floor was like in public toilet There was a trash and hairs among our clean towels It seemed that house keepers made cleaning by our new towels and left them for us In the bedroom everything starting from bed covers to curtains was stained Unfortunately we had to leave the hotel earlier than had planned , Professional boys at the Pub downstairs They were very helpful while a Receptionist was out Very good breakfast 
92790,The Drayton Court Hotel, Breakfast seemed disorganised and not sure why so little butter given for toast it wouldn t even be enough for 1 slice, Great location great staff comfortable beds spotless Booked again for May
92791,The Drayton Court Hotel, The hotel was experiencing heating problems which they said as been all winter However we had no heating and was freezing which made the stay unpleasant We notified the staff who gave us a plug in heater but didn t do much didn t have heat coming off so was left very cold with a 2 year old This was booked for my birthday and liked refit was a roll bath but couldn t use this has the bath was freezing Quite disappointed I feel hotel should tell the guest so we could of been aware and had the option of cancelling ,No Positive
92792,The Drayton Court Hotel, Breakfast was ok Bacon could have been better but overall good Service was good , Excellent comfortable room with everything Lovely bathroom and shower Location was good 
92793,The Drayton Court Hotel, Quite far away from London center more than 1 hour with Tube Tube Bus Poor breakfast everything was based on eggs bacon salmon plus some yogurt No EU adaptors available WiFi was a joke extremely poor connection and I also got numerous malicious traffic messages from my antivirus , Old hotel with a classic British pub Pretty average room clean bathroom 
92794,The Drayton Court Hotel, For some reason the extractor fan in the bathroom was very loud and kept us awake waited for it to turn off but it didn t so rectified by locating the fuse board and switching off the power too it Quite inconvenient and would definitely need changing to a much quieter unit , Comfortable bed room had all the essentials you might need and was very clean and tidy lovely staff who allowed us to leave our car when arriving early in the morning and also to leave the car the following day after check in so we could head in to London again Very close to the central line about 10 15 minute walk which was brilliant and then only 20 mins in to town from there Central line also on the Night Tube service so runs all night on the weekend Would definitely recommend staying here parking was also especially handy 
92795,The Drayton Court Hotel, Location is far from central london located in zone 3 the nearest tube station is 15 20 mnts walk while the closest train station closes on sunday , Room was nicely decorated comfortable bed and clean staff were helpful and friendly
92796,The Drayton Court Hotel, Windows didn t open and the bed was too soft Reception felt cramped as you tried to check in and out , Good location not too far from Ealing Lovely walks around the area and good for as a West London base Room was quirky and nice enough Useful to have bar and food downstairs Great to have free parking 
92797,The Drayton Court Hotel, Unless you need to be in Ealing there s no particular attraction to the location It s a brisk 15 20 minutes walk to the nearest tube station or a 6 cab ride Noise from the floor as guests arrive late and no sound isolation of room door at all Bed a bit narrow , Good room Complementary nespresso biscuits and water Excellent wifi Good value for money 
92798,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, Great rooms and stylish Comfy beds and friendly receptionist Luxury suite was fab and spacious Although internal heating in the rooms seemed absent or non existent Food was good but full English breakfast needs a little makeover 
92799,The Drayton Court Hotel, taps and plumbing probably above English Standards but below European , really nice Hotel spaceous rooms functional but with traditional flavours quiet environment for such a close to centre location
92800,The Drayton Court Hotel, If I had to it would be the lack of Orange juice on both mornings could excuse 1 day And the reception to hotel could be less cluttered , Free upgrade amazing room bed was so comfortable Guinness was best in London could not fault it
92801,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, Nice clean room with parking facilities Train station 2 mins walk away The Subway station is around a 20 min walk from the hotel Will definitely stay here again 
92802,The Drayton Court Hotel, Breakfast service was slow and a couple of orders were slightly wrong but good food Wifi slow, Close to rail station and bus for tube Despite being a busy pub the rooms were quiet Pub food was good
92803,The Drayton Court Hotel, It was all great, Bed really comfy Very spacious beautifully decorated room Teapigs Nespresso machine powerful shower plus a roll top bath in the bedroom Altogether a Fab experience 
92804,The Drayton Court Hotel, There was no dresser for our clothes We stayed almost a week and would have liked to unpack our bags , The room was small but comfortable and the shower was great The location was convenient for walking to catch the bus or train The food in the pub was very good and we enjoyed eating breakfast and dinner there 
92805,The Drayton Court Hotel, Service at breakfast was very slow and the full English was not as good as the Ulster Fry , Had a lovely room Attending my daughter and husband s wedding reception which was absolutely superb 
92806,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, Comfortable rooms and a good breakfast Very good coffee nice touch with a nespresso machine in each room friendly helpful staff and an excellent well stocked bar 
92807,The Drayton Court Hotel, The staff I was greeted by was hardly helpful in fact rather rude The wifi is supposed to be free and hassle free but you have to fill in a application form for fullers just to get on and then are bombarded by their advertising over and over again , The location was perfect 
92808,The Drayton Court Hotel, The prices at the pub were steep The location is definitely not central While close to a tube station it s a bit of a journey into central London , This was a lovely place to stay The room was great spacious and with all the amenities that you could want There is a huge outdoor garden and a good pub with nice food 
92809,The Drayton Court Hotel, , Charming english hotel 10 minutes walk from Ealing Broadway Fast Wifi traditional english lounges pretty garden friendly staff Everything was good price value rate is excellent Hyde Park is about 20 minutes train metro ride from the hotel 
92810,The Drayton Court Hotel, The sound insulation in thre rooms with interconnecting doors is poor and the ventilation does nott prevent the smell from the kitchen to spread into some rooms , I like the the style and the quality of the recent renovation It is very clean well designed and managed hotel 
92811,The Drayton Court Hotel, On checking out I asked for a VAT receipt They said the standard receipt is the only they provide though when I got the to airport I could not claim back the VAT as they didn t give me the required form So in summary cost me 80 that I should have been able to get back On top of that one of the ladies on reception was rude to my wife on morning , Room was comfy parking good pub nice
92812,The Drayton Court Hotel, Room was quite dark and there is not always a staff member on the desk so you don t always get calls answere and are left waiting around too much Also they don t communicate with each other very well , Great selection of teas buscuits and coffee machine Room was smart and came with everything we needed 
92813,The Drayton Court Hotel, Though the neighbourhood of Ealing is nice it is a bit of trip from the hotel to the City You either have to walk 10 minutes to Ealing Broadway to take the underground or take the overground back to Ealing Broadway from West Ealing Station which is the next stop and right across the road The District and City Line will get you to the city in roughly 30 minutes Still that is very doable And as for the hotel itself no complaints whatsoever , It s a beautiful old but refurbished hotel Staff were very friendly our room looked nice and was spotless A lot of attention to detail They also have a very decent bar and a beautiful beer garden Would definitely recommend 
92814,The Drayton Court Hotel, Breakfast finished really early on the sunday We d been at an event in the hotel the night before till late were turned away at 10 30 rather rudely as paying customers breakfast wasn t included in our room rate 8 of us too, Coffee machine and tea making was excellent
92815,The Drayton Court Hotel, Milk problem in room need some long life as back up Coffe machine excellent idea but no instructions and not ver clean Room needed instructions Some parts of room dusty Service at breakfast Only because staff under pressure Gardens could be tidier , The food at the function was outstanding The bathroom and shower excellent The bedroom well decorated stylish Staff very helpful Breakfast choice amazing 
92816,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, excellent variety of ales ciders drinks with a menu serving quality produce in a good variety of choices Huge beer garden for all ages nice restaurant bar tap room and quiet comfy drawing room Comfy bedroom decorated well and train station end of the road free drink if you register on fullers site 
92817,The Drayton Court Hotel, Not the hotel s fault but TV is so crap ended up watching re runs of to the manor born and bullseye Why don t they have a house tv channel showing Ealing Films Missed a trick there , Rooms were comfy coffee was good and location was great Free parking and quiet at night too 
92818,The Drayton Court Hotel, The bathroom needs a few little touch ups here and there There was black mould on the silicon sealant in the shower the sink had a few little chips , The bed was really comfy the d cor in the bedroom was really nice too 
92819,The Drayton Court Hotel, Service in the bar area was hit and miss nice people but not a lot of care , We had the Whiskey Galore suite it was quiet comfortable lots of room and a good location in the hotel Altogether I would stay here again 
92820,The Drayton Court Hotel, Rooms rather on the small side Bulbs not working and not being replaced Several emails sent and never been responded to , The accommodating front of house staff Fabulous beer garden 
92821,The Drayton Court Hotel, The manager was totally awful He was extremely rude and confronted about his conduct he was more than willing to put me out and return my funds There are a few decent staff members but the manager was totally awful , The location and proximity 
92822,The Drayton Court Hotel, The location was very time consuming to reach on underground train system The local station is also closed on Sunday s meaning we had to pay for a taxi, The room was lovely and had small annex with a writing desk The breakfast was also very good 
92823,The Drayton Court Hotel, There is no restaurant which was not a problem but the bar was very busy so no where to sit to eat and we thought we had booked a table as it asked what time we were eating on the check in card , Room was super amazing we had a suite and it was just as shown on the pics and breakfast was lovely
92824,The Drayton Court Hotel, While the bedrooms were very clean the downstairs not so much Tables were always very tacky as if they hadn t been washed thoroughly Weren t given clean cutlery for each course at night had to keep cutlery from starter to use on main course Breakfast menu was very good but horrified when we came down to breakfast one morning to find the seat we were going to sit in was completely covered in dog hair which means hair could very easily get into the food In Ireland dogs are not allowed in eating places unless it s a guide dog and that should be the case in all eating establishments, Rooms were very clean could have been doing with air con or even a fan as it was very warm when we stayed Bathroom was very spacious but the heat coming from lights round mirror was unbearable They were needed when using the sink for shaving or putting on make up as single Iight was not bright enough The bottle containing the water did not seal tight enough was also warm and the milk in thermos was off when we went to use it Perhaps a fridge would rectify these problems
92825,The Drayton Court Hotel, Cleanliness in room was poor with some areas looking like they d never been dusted Throughout the hotel and room the decor is looking tired with stained carpets and damaged wallpaper , Bed was comfy 
92826,The Drayton Court Hotel, Breakfast should be included in the price charged for a small room when in twin room, Location perfect for train station Excellent rain shower Comfy beds Stored bags for us before we travelled We have stayed twice and would stay again
92827,The Drayton Court Hotel, Tea and coffee facilities were not replenished had to ask twice for this to be done, Location was great it was easy to get in to central London for a day sightseeing The room was very comfortable and staff very helpful Will definitely stay at the Drayton Court again 
92828,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, The bed was amazing The bath in the middle of the room was so romantic and I loved being in the middle of an amazing pub Also the beer garden is literally the biggest in London actually had ping pong tables 
92829,The Drayton Court Hotel, the bathroom needs a little TLCc mould in between the tiles , liked the friendly welcome of us and our little dachshound nice pub where we had dinner 
92830,The Drayton Court Hotel, Room key was continually being refreshed perhaps a batch of new cards should be ordered , There is nothing about this hotel that deserves criticism other than something trivial Staff food facilities comfort cleanliness and location were equal to the best we have been to 
92831,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, Of all the places we stayed on our trip this was the best as far as value and comfort They also had an excellent bar restaurant attached we a huge outdoor seating area It was really nice and a great way to end our trip 
92832,The Drayton Court Hotel, Gave us two singles pushed together when we d booked for a double which lead to an awkward night s sleep for us We also had to wait at the bar for absolutely ages to let someone know that there was no one at the front desk and to have someone come and check us in ,No Positive
92833,The Drayton Court Hotel, We had to complain about the aircon which was apparently faulty Unfortunately it was particularly hot weather so we suffered a sticky night especially as the windows don t open either The staff were very sympathetic though , This is a lovely hotel with a beer garden ideal for the summer The room has extra touches for luxury and comfort like fluffy towels rainfall shower fresh milk and biscuits There is free parking if you can get a space The E1 bus stops outside to take you to Ealing Broadway 
92834,The Drayton Court Hotel, There was a light bulb missing in one of the floor lamps , Extremely welcoming and helpful staff both on reception and in the bar Room was well decorated interesting and provided all that is required for a comfortable stay Helpfully advised to use their car park behind the hotel We were a late arrival but assured we were able to order food which arrived quickly and was good 
92835,The Drayton Court Hotel, Some of the d cor in the rooms needs looking at paint chipping in room , Train station within lunging distance and extra helpful staff Food done in the bar was very nice 
92836,The Drayton Court Hotel, Room service option would have been useful Prices for breakfast were not clear enough Housekeeping not available to provide iron at 8am , Despite being a busy pub restaurant establishment as well as a hotel the rooms were very quiet Mine even looked out over the busy garden area and I got no noise travelling up I actually liked that it was at the opposite end of Uxbridge Rd to the main area of Ealing Broadway it avoided the noise of that main road from cars and sirens fire and police stations are there which could easily be heard in one of the other hotels along that main stretch of road apparently 
92837,The Drayton Court Hotel, I would have liked a fan and a top sheet There was no air movement and the blanket became hot , The curtains did an excellent job of filtering noise The bed was comfortable and the shower was very nice We had milk available for tea and coffee 
92838,The Drayton Court Hotel, far far away cosmetic products were not even changed once whereas we stayed 6 days 5 nights we left our luggage in the hall to be watched over but when we came to pick it up it was left alone unattended so anyone who would like to have could have taken it, Hotel personnel was friendly Quite area
92839,The Drayton Court Hotel, Breakfast a little poor staff a little slow Not a good location if visiting central London via train tube bus , Room decoration and facilities sound proofing 
92840,The Drayton Court Hotel, At the bar no eye contact with customers as they have to look at the touch screen till They just can t ask what you want pour it serve it and take the money They are unable to take more than one order at a time and keep asking for one sec when given a task At breakfast they were understaffed in the area for food at 915 there were no breakfast bowls for cereal no yoghurt and or no pastries left Teething problems I think It was the same in the Kent public house also Always going to til first before pouring and serving a pint Touchscreens are great for education not in hostelry and hotel businesses ,No Positive
92841,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, Lovely breakfast at a reasonable extra cost and nice to be able to eat on the terrace overlooking the garden Pleasant room excellent shower and the bed was really comfy Excellent location close to rail and underground transport Overall would definitely recommend this hotel 
92842,The Drayton Court Hotel, The bathroom was a bit small so it didn t have a bathtub although everything in there was of a very good standard , Definitely a hidden gem of a hotel worthy of its 4 star rating Sumptuous if not a little small rooms fitted out to a high standard and boasting very good quality toiletries Clean and comfortable Fantastic towels The pub downstairs is lively and social with a decent menu There is also a drawing room if you want a bit more peace and quiet Location puts it only 15 minutes into Paddington on the train 
92843,The Drayton Court Hotel, Nothing , Amazing hotel and fabulous staff Parking available and awesome setting for a good pint and a laugh Restaurant has delicious food options and breakfasts are good also Highly recommended we didn t want to leave 
92844,The Drayton Court Hotel, Fixed rate taxi service to Wembley could have included a return journey at a cheaper deal Not important for most but was the reason for our stay The orange juice ran out at breakfast so maybe put two jugs out or ensure it gets topped up , Nicely decorated rooms very modern and cosy Comfortable bed and the tea coffee making facilities were good Shower was huge and very nice Good to have the Fullers pub just downstairs which had a great selection of drinks Breakfast was lovely Its right across from West Ealing train station and not too far to walk to Ealing Broadway Lots of shops and restaurants just down the road 
92845,The Drayton Court Hotel, Liked it all, Stunning hotel with lovely down to earth staff a fantastic location for Wembley we had the room whisky galor this is a stunning suit
92846,The Drayton Court Hotel, Nothimg, Quiet affordable very friendly staff booked it 2 months ago online room we booked was unavailable upon check in we were offered other favourable options Upon check in very pleasant stay Would recommend it 100 
92847,The Drayton Court Hotel, Breakfast is a steep extra cost option go across the road to the excellent cafe instead, Unusually stylish comfortable and thoughtful for a london pub 
92848,The Drayton Court Hotel, It should include breakfast in the rate 12 per person is an expensive extra and the room rate is not cheap , Lovely furnishings Comfy bed Nice coffee in the room Friendly and helpful staff specially Lucia 
92849,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, The staff were extremely helpful from warming our burritos up to making cocktails that didn t even exist Really appreciated it We weren t really in the hotel for anything other than sleeping but we did have a meal on the first day and it was lovely Would definitely stay again 
92850,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was redecorating the main entrance restaurant and garden but informed us on forehand The new interior looks very promising The rooms are good and the distance to the centre of London is good with the train and tube within walking distance We will gladly come back to see the results of the refurbishments 
92851,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, we were greeted by pleasant and helpful staff the rooms we had booked were well equipped and very comfortable We had evening dinner and breakfast which were both very good would recommend the Drayton Court Hotel 
92852,The Drayton Court Hotel, Two people staying twin bedded room unavailable So had to book double could only afford one room on company allowance Second put up bed was very uncomfortable and VERY expensive So only one person had excellent nights sleep , A hotel with character clean bathroom with complementary goods Tea coffee etc good selection Large good quality towels Very quiet room large high standard 
92853,The Drayton Court Hotel, We tried to add our evening meal to our room bill but we couldn t do that from the garden bar The main bar was really busy that Saturday evening so we had gone outside as the barstaff had recommended we do so A bit confusing but we were pleased with the meal when it arrived , Very good breakfast plenty to choose from and I loved the pancakes with berries Comfortable bed spacious and quiet room the hotel is on a quiet road but has double glazing and great blackout curtains we nearly missed breakfast as we slept so well Lovely bathroom and great shower with free toiletries provided Sunny beer garden was very pleasant in the evening The hotel is in a quiet residential area but there is a range of shops cafes and restaurants nearby Ealing Broadway station is a 15 20 mins walk away but there are buses that pass nearby 
92854,The Drayton Court Hotel, We heard the noise from the trainstation and the planes going to the airport The staff in the breakfastroom was not friendly During our stay 3 nights it was not possible to eat in the restaurant and also we could not get any drink in the bar, We like the Room and the bathroom The room was a bit small but is was every thing there you ned 
92855,The Drayton Court Hotel, We were told that the bar and restaurant were being refurbished As we weren t eating or drinking there that wasn t a problem for us However They lied it was also the function room lobby and garden as well being refurbished We basically walked into a building site I even had to wipe dust off the counter Annoyed that I had to pay 120 to spend a night with a baby in a building site my temper wasn t tempered when we arrived for breakfast in the function room or should I say the highway for builders The hotel didn t even have a high chair for the baby Thoroughly disappointed and a waste of money , Room and staff were great 
92856,The Drayton Court Hotel, We have been told lies about the free private parking facilities and most importantly didn t mention about their current refurbishment on the website To be noted that the manager and the staff were so useless I also got a penalty charge of 110 because staff gave wrong information about the parking in Manor road where I have been told to park my car during my stay there Overall it was the worse hostel I have attended in my entire life , None
92857,The Drayton Court Hotel, Unfortunately during my stay in the hotel it was undergoing a refurbishment and the bar was not available but please keep windows clean front and back Otherwise Ideal for purpose , Rooms were very clean and comfortable Staff were also helpful and friendly Will definitely be using it in the future as close to tube and some good restaurants
92858,The Drayton Court Hotel, Too much noise next morning the car park was not in use they shouldn t say they have car park while you can t use it the reception area was very dirty doesn t look like hotel it s like a pub the bed was not comfortable , The room was nice friendly stuff and clean bathroom clean towels coffee maker on the room good size enough space 
92859,The Drayton Court Hotel, Sadly the downstairs inside looked like a building site This was due to a major refurbishment down stairs This initially this made us think what the hell have we booked But the room and the ombyance more than made up for it , We stayed in one of the Suite s and it was AMAZING Reception were very friendly and accommodating 
92860,The Drayton Court Hotel, Firstly it is misleading on the site about the building works as this had a massive impact on the our whole stay Walking into the reception which is your first impression Dust and builders No attempt had been made to clean areas of reception after builders finished for weekend and temporary floor protection had been left No dining room bar And breakfast in a very tired windowless dark function room with rickety on furniture not an idea way to commence your day Managers attitude was that rates had been reduced to reflect the impact and this was highlighted so not very concerned Gym and pool location not on site Another misleading fact , We stayed in suite which was nicely laid out and furnished with a comfy bed although was a bit tired and could do with freshen up Staff more than helpful and attentive 
92861,The Drayton Court Hotel, We were advised that there was renovation work being done that took the restaurant out but no mention was made that included the bar That was the only negative when the work is complete this should be an excellent place to stay , Breakfast was excellent
92862,The Drayton Court Hotel, Staff member that checked me in was rude The gym and pool has a lot of restrictions what isn t stated clearly on Booking com as I needed the pool for my son which made me book this hotel 20 min walk to gym and pool , Nice rooms the entrance and check in area is tired Nice and clean 
92863,The Drayton Court Hotel, unfortunately the car park was closed off and being able to park on site was one of the reasons for booking there luckily I managed to park on the street nearby it would have been nice to have been told in advance about the car park, nice tea and coffee in the room
92864,The Drayton Court Hotel, Misleading with the pool gym facilities need to make clear on here the building does not have them , Spacious room lavender hill suite free standing bath in room massive bed short walk to local high street
92865,The Drayton Court Hotel, Staff were excellent however there did not seem to be enough to wait on both the restaurant and main bar area , Rooms were modern and comfortable Food was very nice 
92866,The Drayton Court Hotel, Nothing , Absolutely loved every second Gorgeous building and room I stayed in the Blue Lamp Suite the rooms were so clean and tidy and the fresh milk delivered to our door was a nice touch The bed is unbelievably comfy Can t wait to come back The walk from the tube station is about 15 minutes but it s a lovely walk Breakfast was delicious and filling Staff very attentive and helpful 
92867,The Drayton Court Hotel, Things could always be cheaper but I think it s reasonable cost in that location and state of room There was nothing that I did not like, I liked the general ambience of the Drayton Court easy relaxed but efficient Its location was perfect for my needs on that trip
92868,The Drayton Court Hotel, Staff could have been a bit more knowledgeable about the works going on at the time during my stay, Being on top of a great pub was very convenient Ealing railway station was practically across the street Ealing has great shopping and restaurants Good parking facilities The fitness center vouchers are for an AMAZING gym about 10 minutes walk away 
92869,The Drayton Court Hotel, Really couldn t find any fault but maybe the bed could have been a bit wider , Very pleasant comfortable room Well equipped and great attention to detail Very quiet room Fab coffee machine Wished we could have stayed a second night 
92870,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, Hotel with style Room was quite small but very very comfortable and beautiful Only 1 km away 10 min walk from Ealing Broadway underground station Easy to get there from Liverpool Street station Staff was very welcoming even at 2 00 am in the morning We booked room with breakfast included Breakfast was delicious and quite big cereals juices tea coffee and warm breakfast available including Full English breakfast We lowed our stay definitely worth staying 
92871,The Drayton Court Hotel, Little bit of noise from a wedding party staying at the same time as us but didn t bother us at all Not central but only took us half an hour to get to the city and that s reflected in the prices, Very stylish rooms Lovely tea and coffee facilities in the room Breakfast was wonderful Good parking and very laid back friendly staff Day pass to pool and spa facilities made the stay extra special
92872,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, Bedroom was nice and quite bed was comfortable and they served pancakes for breakfast Oh yes It is NOT centrally located but by public transport you can reach Paddington Station and the City in 15 20 minutes 
92873,The Drayton Court Hotel, location of the hotel was a little bit far outside, typical and beautiful furnitured British Hotel Very comfy bed Very clean room and bathroom Great to have a fully equipped gym close by with pool sauna and jaccuzi 
92874,The Drayton Court Hotel, Could have done with a little bit of TLC Chipping paint and wallpaper scratched and peeling off the walls This did not detract from the stay just needs some attention , Loved all of the little extras such a coffee machine and water in the room
92875,The Drayton Court Hotel, Windows were unlocked in my room when I arrived Room took a while to heat up Free WiFi requires registration for each device Required to swipe keycard for elevator but not the stairs , Nice place clean and nice amenities Three electrical outlets at the desk Metro Underground Rail stations nearby and several food options I had a great stay and would stay there again 
92876,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic room for a great price We were really impressed Staff were friendly breakfast great and location was perfect for us we were down for the rugby at Twickenham Will definitely stay here again when we come back to London 
92877,The Drayton Court Hotel, I prefer a breakfast selfservice but this hotel gives you a very nice breakfast a la carte The only real minus the toast which came with my eggs was cold by the time is was served , Very nice rooms Hotel at 1 minute walk from West Ealing trainstation The staff is friendly and helpful Bathroom had a nice rainshower Coff Th in the room The pub connected to the hotel serves a few classic British dishes 
92878,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, Victorian style own pub with a nice fireplace super friendly relaxed room s interior cool recommended room Kind Hearts Coronets Ealing is close to the city but a wonderfully clich brickstone suburb
92879,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, The room was spacious and clean the beds very comfortable and facilities were very good The rooms look luxurious and are very well maintained Although we didn t use the breakfast facilities or got in touch with the hotel staff a lot the staff we did speak to were very friendly and professional There is a train station next to the hotel but we preferred to walk to the nearest tube station which was a 10 15 minutes walk away There runs a bus too so the hotel is easy to reach So far the best hotel I have stayed in in London 
92880,The Drayton Court Hotel, I find The Drayton to be overpriced Breakfast is plentyful but of average quality Bar prices are high It sconvenient for my needs otherwise I wouldn t stay again, Locality for my needs
92881,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, Lovely hotel Although I had to move rooms due to the heating system not working in the first room I also did not get a complete food order for room service The rooms are small cosy and comfortable However the bathroom in room 31 was small and hard to navigate The only reason I don t think its value for money is because the rooms are so small and the location 
92882,The Drayton Court Hotel, The price is a bit expensive but on the other hand it s part of London A decent hotel room for 134 is not that easy to find , It s about 15 minute walk to Central line which gives you access to downtown area after about 30 minutes It s extremely interesting as the free parking allow to spend a pleasant day without worrying about time and parking fee The sound isolation was extremely good room 20 as we couldn t hear anything from the party downstairs 
92883,The Drayton Court Hotel, Breakfast was very average poor choice The entrance to car park was dirty and needed some care OveralI I don t think I would stay again , Picked Drayton Court because my son lives next door at Dominion House Room was very nice and comfortable and car park was included in price 
92884,The Drayton Court Hotel, Bed is a bit hard and too many cushions, Tea coffee facilities and a bottle of water provided The pub is just downstairs but we hardly hear any noises
92885,The Drayton Court Hotel, Awkward to park as not many spaces it would appear Food was good but menu not what I would have expected , Impressive building from the outside suites were decorated to a high standard and well cleaned by housekeeping Food was good and reasonably priced Easy to get into London as this was the purpose of our trip
92886,The Drayton Court Hotel, The heating wasn t working in the room reported it and I was told I could have a plug in radiator for the room It obviously is an ongoing problem No apologies were made either The room was cold The only heat we had was from the towel rail in the bathroom Highly unacceptable for the price of the rooms Also domestic staff start cleaning early So we were woken early There was also some one drilling into the wall next door and wallpapering They all chatting to the domestic staff at full voice right outside the door The noise of that brush banging off the skirting is enough to drive anyone insane at 0730 am Despite having the do not disturb sign on the door housekeeping still knocked at 0930 This all occured on the same morning Safe to say there was zero lay in , Very comfortable bed Great coffee and tea making facilities Speciality tea s too Fresh milk delivered to room each morning Perfect shower and samples to use Ice machine down the hall is nice touch 
92887,The Drayton Court Hotel, No way to cool the room down other than open the windows fortunately its a quite area breakfast too expensive cafe opposite very nice lovely staff too, very nice rooms good size comfy bed fluffy towels kettle Handy for Ealing Broadway shops and tube 
92888,The Drayton Court Hotel, Nothing , As far as value for money goes absolutely top notch Rooms were clean had all amenities and were better than I d expect at big chains like a Marriott or Hilton Would highly recommend 
92889,The Drayton Court Hotel, i do not like the smell in my room maybe the reason is i got a cold , clean and quiet room kindly staff if swiming pool spa gym are in the same building with hotel that s will be great

92892,The Drayton Court Hotel, Inexperienced front desk not exactly service oriented it feel more like a clean motel with pub attach to it Kitchen smell filled upstairs hall way , Location closes to airport 
92893,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, Beautiful hotel room elegant and stylish carefully mixing old and new Really comfortable bed great products and super bathroom What more could you want 
92894,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, Great hotel but they need clearer pictures of the Luxuary Suite We had a really lovely stay but the Suite I thought I was booking was not the one I got

92896,The Drayton Court Hotel, Waited over 10 minutes to check in before someone came to help us, Lovely room bar restaurant manager amazing reception staff good very accommodating with any requests Good location good bar and restaurant
92897,The Drayton Court Hotel,No Negative, The room was v spacious with a beautiful bathroom Very clean and very quiet Onsite parking with lift access to bedroom floors from the car park Bus stop just around the corner to Ealing Broadway tube and into centre of London within the hour very convenient and well below central London prices 
92898,The Drayton Court Hotel, Limited parking spaces For the style of hotel and being 4 star would have expected a more generous menu for evening meals , Room furnishings and sound proof was very good 
92899,The Drayton Court Hotel, Nothing Everything was great , Everything is perfect A wonderful Hotel not too great Very friendly staff nice room perfect shower good breakfast car park direct at the Hotel atmospheric Pub 
92900,The Drayton Court Hotel, It was more expensive than the budget hotels but it had more character with nice touches like biscuits toiletries and fluffy towels , We stayed here because it was close to our daughter s flat and convenient to get into central London We got a bus to Ealing Broadway then the tube into the city West Ealing station is very close too It took about an hour The staff were very friendly and the room was comfortable if a little small We paid extra for breakfast and it was very nice There was a free car park which saves a fortune in London 
92901,The Drayton Court Hotel, Would have been better value for money if breakfast was included , Location close to main train and tube stations Accessible to shops Good bar below Comfy bed and hot shower 
92902,The Drayton Court Hotel, Nothing would return , The best accom In uk fabulous big room with great ensuite very cmfortable close to rail and tube easy to get to London Everything was great 10 out of 10 highly recommended

92904,The Drayton Court Hotel, The hotel could have been closer to the city center but then we would never have received this quality for that price So great choice especially if you stay more than one night in London , Especially the service and the quality of the beds were excellent The room was also very quiet We couldn t even hear the trains nearby 
92905,The Drayton Court Hotel, Would have liked a bath , The room was lovely the bed was heavenly and when the curtains are closed its so dark for a perfect nights sleep Delicious breakfast Great location Great shower
92906,The Drayton Court Hotel, It s about 20 30 minutes walk to the closest tube Station Train station is close but closes on a Sunday Not so close to London center, Good infrastructures the rooms are very good Very good attention to details with the decoration Staff is very friendly and helpful Free Parking although with limited spaces

92908,The Drayton Court Hotel, The room would have been perfect if there was a holder for the hand soap and some hooks to hang towels , The room was beautiful very comfortable bed and clean Nice staff and very good burgers 
92909,The Drayton Court Hotel, Too far from London downtown you have to change from train to underground then maybe more than 10 station to reach downtown Also it needs to renew the paints of the ceiling, Good decoration and furniture Also breakfast was excellent
92910,The Drayton Court Hotel, We liked all aspects of this surprising hotel , The Drayton Court has been redecorated and updated The bathroom is a tub with hand held shower marble and tile Lovely cabinetry in the bath be wardrobe Queen sized bed with crisp bedding Our room was small but comfortable I believe they have larger room available We will return there and would not hesitate to recommend it They are above a pub which we worried might be noisy but it was not Great air conditioning 
92911,The Drayton Court Hotel, A good choice of breakfasts but they fell a little below par in terms of quality ingredients in comparison to the evening meals , The staff were very friendly and helpful There was complimentary water in the room and plenty of milk to have with tea coffee The room was spacious with lots of storage and plugs We found the room comfortable quiet The building was very secure with a swipe card system in the lift and through internal doors The pub offered a good menu with excellent food Only a 15 20 min walk to Ealing Broadway underground You can get into Central London within 25 mins Our stay was excellent value for money enhanced by ample on site free parking
