425364,Le M ridien Barcelona, The bathtub was peeling and scratched The carpet in the room and in the hallway was dusty and old looking There was a hair in the bathtub upon arrival, The bad was very comfortable
425365,Le M ridien Barcelona, I got fined 200 Euros for smoking off my balcony I told them there wasn t any signs and staff told me about a small note that s left on the desk never saw it other than that nothing And later I noticed that they also charged me for Internet that was suppose to be free ,No Positive
425366,Le M ridien Barcelona, Photos are totally different it was the worst accommodation ever it is old towels and bed were not clean AC switches off automatically at night food is bad and rude staff, nothing
425367,Le M ridien Barcelona, a soulless experience even the room service food looks so international that did not give me the appetite to try something when i was hungry , staff is nice but i guess this is the catalan hospitality anyway 
425368,Le M ridien Barcelona, food was poor and would not recommend eating at the hotel , staff were very friendly and helpful excellent location in terms of being able to walk to most attractions very touristy area but worth it if on a sight seeing holiday shame the hotel does not have a pool 
425369,Le M ridien Barcelona, We got there after stating we was 3 males staying to arrive to a double bed sofa bed then were charged 100 for a upgrade which we shouldn t of paid as the mess up was hotel fault and to pay 130 a night to sleep on a sofa bed then we had charges to r room for things we hadn t order we paid them just to get out there, The location was excellent
425370,Le M ridien Barcelona,No Negative, Family Suite was superb staff were exceptionally friendly and welcoming I would not hesitate to return to this hotel when next back in Barca or indeed to recommend it to anyone wanting a central location from which to explore the city
425371,Le M ridien Barcelona, The fact that there was no free wifi in the rooms Which is annoying especially that all the laptops nowadays and devices need wifi And if you stay in a 3 star hotel in Spain in general or rent an apartment you get free wifi And for the price we have paid you don t get one this is very strange and redicolus During our checkout something very strange have happen to us we had a late flight on so we booked for 3 nights and during the checking out they told us you have booked for 5 nights which we didn t do and the mistake we didn t know from which side even though we have made our booking for 2 rooms within the same account and they told us one room is booked for the same day we are chekcing out and the other room after 2 nights which we found it very strange and after checking the system they told us no its ok and we never understood from where this mistaked happen if it was booking com or their mistake , Great place and location food is great and the room service is amazing 
425372,Le M ridien Barcelona, They reserve for me a room for hand cap without notifying me They did not prolong my check out regardless that I am gold member and I deserve it ,No Positive
425373,Le M ridien Barcelona, Still thinking Maybe the price per night I needed an extra night to watch Barcelona PSG and the rates jumped to over 400 , Everything Location eateries around Places to see Shopping Area is simply perfect
425374,Le M ridien Barcelona, The maid removed especially requested top sheet from the bed on our last night , Damiano Curra was our waiter He was excellent We enjoyed quiet room and the roof terrace 
425375,Le M ridien Barcelona, The staff at the reception registered a new SPG membership for me without prior notice I only found out by email one day after Well I do have a membership already , Good location nice staff 
425376,Le M ridien Barcelona, There is no lock in the toilet and also they need to change the carpet inside the rooms or do more cleaning The free wifi is too bad If you want more speed you have to pay There is no much channels in the tv especialy english one There is no kids channels or Movie channels , The beds are comfort The staff are friendly The breakfast is acceptable and there is choices The Location is excellent 
425377,Le M ridien Barcelona, Pricing, The location is excellent with very modern designed rooms that is absolutely comfortable Although it s a bit pricey for me I definitely appreciate the excellent service of the hotel staff from the door man to the very professional concierge Rica Richard 
425378,Le M ridien Barcelona, A quote of 95 euro for the shuttle to the airport which is only 15 minutes away when they advertise a shuttle service, Great position very well presented and very comfortable
425379,Le M ridien Barcelona, I knew the Meredien Barcelona from earlie visits the hotel changed now to a kind of boutique Hotel the beautiful oldfashioned breakfast room doesn t exist anymore the bar But that is my opinion the location is the best direct to the ramblas our room was absolutely quiet staff very friendly ,No Positive
425380,Le M ridien Barcelona, Curtains in suite had fallen off the hook and could not close properly at night thus affecting our sleep , Large room and location on Ramblas as well as the porters and concierge staff Main restaurant also serves excellent food at excellent pricing 
425381,Le M ridien Barcelona, Everything was so perfect that the below bothered me My son drinks special milk which I was carrying It needed to be warmed Didn t expect to be charged every time I asked for it to be heated for a minute max once a day Stayed for 4 nights in a family suite Paid good money for the suite Didn t expect them to charge me anything albeit 3 euros for warming a mere milk It s not about the 3 euros but when one is paying thousands then such a genuine request should not have been charged Otherwise everything else exceeded my expectation , Amazing suite Great staff Great location The check in staff and concierge were very helpful Cleanliness of high quality Room size for family suite was decent Overall will highly recommend it Will certainly come back 
425382,Le M ridien Barcelona, The reception meet and greet staff barely acknowledged us If we needed anything they helped to resolve in an efficient way but just could have been more friendly and welcoming when we walked through , The housekeeping staff were friendly acknowledged us every time we saw them 
425383,Le M ridien Barcelona, Front desk service was far below the service levels and hospitality i have enjoyed in comparable hotels This includes poor communication misinformation and a nasty surprise about check out just an hour before i was due to leave Although it was resolved i still left 30 mins ahead of plan and didn t appreciate the way it was managed I was also in a room which smelt of paint which couldn t be rid off It seemed like the room was recently refurbished but clearly not ready for occupancy But through out my stay i repeatedly heard the front desk mentioning the property was overbooked so this probably explains it , The location was great and a very well informed concierge Gil made our time in Barcelona amazing he understood what we were seeking to experience and clearly is well informed and updated on the local scene 
425384,Le M ridien Barcelona, HI I just want to say two things that I didn t like 1 breafast is very poor for such 5 star hotel 2 the bed are very soft fat couses a back pain, I like the clean and good location
425385,Le M ridien Barcelona,No Negative, Ours was a forced stay because the thieving rats that infest Las Ramblas stole our passports The hotel staff were genuinely sympathetic and tried to do what they could for us We had stayed there on 7 April prior to our scheduled outbound flight on 8th Perhaps a discounted rate for our enforced stay would have endeared us more to the hotel but all too often chain hotels do not give their management sufficient discretion in such matters 
425386,Le M ridien Barcelona, We tried to order room service in the early hours of the morning really disappointed with the experience Rang the phone a number of times and there was no answer in the end my partner went down to reception to find 2 inidividuals there who were sat ignoring the phone Not great but the food was good when it arrived , Room was amazing Spacious clean everything we needed The majority of the staff were fantastic Breakfast was great on site omelettes made for us Loved it Location was also fantastic Fresh flowers delivered by our wonderful house keeping team too 
425387,Le M ridien Barcelona, They seems don t recognize booking com They didn t provid anything I requested connecting rooms as I m traveling with my kids higher floor one hour late check out The lady front desk manger was too rude and said why you didn t book directly with us , Location
425388,Le M ridien Barcelona, pricey and little not to charmy as could be , quiet but central position high standard as is by le meridien expected clean functional rooms big advantage comparing to other la rambla hotels is orientation of 90 rooms to quiet side street as rambla and underground is noisy nightmare at 1898 or bagues for example 
425389,Le M ridien Barcelona, The front desk staff was horrible A woman named Gabreilla was downrighr rude doesn t deserve to be dealing with customers Overall a totally insensitive hopeless front desk staff, The concierge staff was helpful
425390,Le M ridien Barcelona, The roof restaurant and work out areas were closed We could not adjust the temperparture in the room It was extremely warm and uncomfortable to sleep ,No Positive
425391,Le M ridien Barcelona, 1 There is no communication between management and staff 2 facilities very old AC system was bad in winter there is no AC inside the room 3 staff not polite with the customer 4 there is no specific way for trolley in the main gate you have to carry your trolley to get it up, Location was perfect Management tray to satisfied us with suite instead of normal room Perfect caffe cafeteria in the lobby
425392,Le M ridien Barcelona, Rooms are small could hear people in next room could not sleep first night because of noise outside but the staff readily changed our room Even the premium wireless was not strong enough to permit us to download movies but the staff refunded the premium amount we paid , Good staff Rooms were clean and modern
425393,Le M ridien Barcelona, Nothing but it does not have bathtubs The shower was gorgeous and huge Beautiful dark slate , Location and style of hotel Concierge and staff were extremely helpful and cordial Doorman was par excellence 
425394,Le M ridien Barcelona, Nothing , The hotel was ideally situated in Barcelona close to everything The personell where very helpful in every way The breakfast however a little expensive were lovely and you could sit and watch the day start at la Rambla wonderful will be back 
425395,Le M ridien Barcelona,No Negative, I was very satisfied with the staff of this hotel I arrived early before checkin time It was very organized I was given a number to text over WhatsApp when my room would be ready This was very convenient as I did not have a local telephone number 
425396,Le M ridien Barcelona, My bathroom flooded completely due to a blocked drain I used every towel to stop it from flooding further into the hallway while it was attended to quickly giving me dry clean towels etc the shower was still blocked the next day There was no offer to move me to another room for the night And the shower flooded again the next day , Loved the close proximity to La Ramblas 
425397,Le M ridien Barcelona, NA, Beautiful roomy hotel Bruno the concigiere and Anna the PRmanager were especially helpful with some car related trouble we had They went out of their way to take care of us
