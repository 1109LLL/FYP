495826,Atahotel Linea Uno, Our room was at third floor and we asked to use elevator for going to 2nd floor then walking through corridors and ride elavator again for going to third floor Our cups was left unwashed and during our 3 days stay the room and bathroom not washed only arranged I wondered why there is no lobby at entrance , The room is large with luxury facilities
495827,Atahotel Linea Uno, There is nothing bad Of course its not the perfect place but for the price you pay absolutly ok , Friendly staff the room was quiet big with a little kitchen including a freezer The hotel is only a few steps from the metro away 
495828,Atahotel Linea Uno, It is an old hotel We were 3 persons and one of us had to sleep in a sofa bed which was very uncomfortable to sleep in The bathroom is ok The walls are thin so you can hear others from the hotel which is disturbing , The metro is very close to the hotel so it is easy to get to the city center The breakfast is good 
495829,Atahotel Linea Uno, The bath has no stopper The apartment 101 floor 2 is near the air conditioner big engines and during the night if you are not so tired you will hear them a permanent noise Also this apartment has the windows to the court of hotel not good view I booked the apartment with breakfast included and there the receptionist told me that I haven t breakfast At check out the receptionist took me 8 euro night for 6 nights 48 euros When I booked this apartment it never says anywhere that I have to pay this town tax , The apartment is big good for families it has a big garderobe room and many cabinets 
495830,Atahotel Linea Uno, The outside look of the hotel is just horrible definitely in need of a facelift , We had an exceptionally big room with a kitchenette for a special offer via booking which was great usually it s vice versa 
495831,Atahotel Linea Uno,No Negative, Very American Hotel I love it They are open for visitors not compare to all other hotels in Italy that visitors are not allowed on your room The best our second home 
495832,Atahotel Linea Uno, Wifi signal is weak in our room The outside bathroom has a foul smell when you first enter the room , Breakfast is great and our room is big and very clean Near the metro and shops 
495833,Atahotel Linea Uno, Pillows were not fluffy Only 4 English speaking channels with news only on tv Runny scrambled eggs , Convenient location to the Metro market bank Close by Metro to the Duomo and Train Station Good sized room Nice variety of choices at breakfast Friendly and helpful staff 
495834,Atahotel Linea Uno, Plastic shower curtain was yellowish brown at the bottom My guess is it hasn t been washed in a while Humidity stains around the bath Most probably because there is no extraction air fan in bathroom No slippers Room felt a bit old Definitely not a 4 start hotel but would choose again because it had a fair price A minus note goes to communication with hotel I ve repeated a request for a twin room a few days in advance via booking com I did receive a reply for my request only when I ended my vacation and arrived home I did have though my twin room as requested via the booking com , Best thing about the hotel is the proximity with metro station Just a few steps away From there direct connection in 10 min to Duomo square Large rooms with kitchenette if you plan to stay longer 2 small bottles of water offered in the room Friendly staff Cleaning lady did a very good job everyday Quality thick linen Quick check out luggage storage 
495835,Atahotel Linea Uno, The studio is dark located very far from the reception different wing of building Access from lobby to the studio is really confusing and iritatiting Changing 2 elevators long walking and using of safety card 3 times The staff was polite but not very helpful , Studio is big comfortable quiet and clean we were on 3rd floor Very comfortable bed Hotel is not close to the city center but it s very close to the red metro station Supermarket and restaurants are nearby WiFi and Breakfast are acceptable 
495836,Atahotel Linea Uno, Decoration is a little tired but everywhere is very clean , We were in a self contained room i e facilities included kitchen separate bathroom comfy bed T V table chairs and a sofa As we were self catering the room was serviced every other day with clean bed linen and towels There is a good supermarket close by Ideal for our purpose as we were visiting family nearby 
495837,Atahotel Linea Uno, Even though it stated that there is air conditioner in the room it was not operative due to the time of the year but it was pretty hot outside they didn t have any blankets but the regular hot one so as for temperature convenience it wasn t great finally we managed to open the windows to allow some fresh air to ventilate the room no comfortable hangers in the bathroom and no ventilation from it , The location is not central but a red metro station is just outside the hotel and makes it very easy and fast to travel in the city breakfast was very nice and diverse though not enough vegetables we were upgraded without saying that it was upgrade so we can t say about the regular rooms but our bed was comfy 
495838,Atahotel Linea Uno, Fitness room is open 10 22h I arrived after 22 and had to check out around 8am so I had no chance to see it It should work 24 7 really I did not like the idea of extra charge for the kitchen utensils because it is possible to get a dinner for about the same price I did not like the shower curtain a shower panel glass would be much nicer considering the rest of the hotel The croissants could have been better , Fantastic room with sofa and decent TV kitchen big table very nice furniture huge wardrobe Big and comfortable bed Free water in the fridge is a nice touch Wifi and staff were OK I generally liked the breakfast There is a coffee machine our you can ask the nice serviette to provide you a real one Red line Metro is about 20m from the entrance 
495839,Atahotel Linea Uno, Needs a little refresh and smells oldie not a design hotel but really convenient, The furniture end facilities in the room are a little old but the rooms are very big and comfortable ours had even a kitchen and a big terrace Not close to the city center but the position is stategic because it s very close to turro subway station and from there you can easily reach almost any place Parking was 10 euros a day tha s very convenient if compared to other hotels closer to the center that ask you 30 Breakfast was not included but for 10 it was very variegated and of good quality Staff was very nice and helpful
495840,Atahotel Linea Uno,No Negative, Our room had more than enough space and commodities to fit us Breakfast was simple yet complete and good Location is great 50m from the subway station and very close to pharmacy and a 24 7 supermarket 
495841,Atahotel Linea Uno, It doesn t have a restaurant or at least a bar That would complete the range of provided service , I ve been several times in this hotel and I can say It s every time better in terms of service quality This time the most significant improvements were with WiFi internet and breakfast For the rest as always the room matter a fact an apartment was perfectly clean well suited for resting and computer working if travelling for business I appreciated also the hotel security level that allows safely leaving stuff in the room Comparing with the nearby hotels in the same class I would place it on the first place as value for money 
495842,Atahotel Linea Uno, very bed smell in the room and not so clean We had kitchenette but we could nt use it as not cutlery and kettle all empty and when we ask for plats and some stuff for kitchen there was a charge of 10e per day , so close to underground
495843,Atahotel Linea Uno, Access from lobby to room was really complex 2 elevators walking and using of safety card 3 times was needed , Large convenient room with excellent access to metro station Satisfying breakfast and quite polite staff 
495844,Atahotel Linea Uno, The Air conditioner is turned off after 10pm which is quite unusual cause that s when you need it bed and pillow are not standard at all poor breakfast don t even provide drinking water forget about tea coffee facilities in room , not much
495845,Atahotel Linea Uno, Cannot smoke in the room and city tax is very expensive , The hotel is barely 5 mins walk to the Turro metro station Right opposite of the hotel theres a halal turkish restaurant which is delicious Front desk staff very helpful and responsive Easy to communicate in english as well Theres laundry service which cost 6euro which is very cheap Room was big and comfortable Near 24hr supermarket ATM bank right beside the hotel 
495846,Atahotel Linea Uno, The traffic noise from the busy road, The room was super clean and very large Excellent bed as well A very large terrace was also accessible from the room
495847,Atahotel Linea Uno, Why breakfast in a 4star hotel served with plastic plates and cutlery 3 nights for Milan is a little bit too much , The location was not very central but the tube was right there The room was spacious there was a balcony as well 
495848,Atahotel Linea Uno, The lack of kitchenware , The metro station is so unbelievably close and there is a supermarket 2 minutes walk from the hotel and it is open 24 7 You also have many restaurants nearby a good turkish restaurant in front of the hotel and an ATM machine just next to the hotel So yeah perfect location 
495849,Atahotel Linea Uno, The air condition system is switched off between 1am and 6am Room Got pretty hot soon after and had to open window Which was a bit too noisy, Friendly stuff Right next to metro station 
495850,Atahotel Linea Uno, Just a bit noisy in the morning And the breakfast is not worth 10 eur in my view , Clean spacious room nice staff 5 seconds away from the Turro metro station Carrefour and other shops to be found less than 400m away Use the metro until 1am to go anywhere in the city 4 5 eur for a 24 hour subscription I d definitely stay here again 
495851,Atahotel Linea Uno, External noise traffic because of poor insulation, Excellent location for my business destination Very easy to get to the city centre thanks to metro station in front of the residence Kitchenette very useful an good market in the surroundings 
495852,Atahotel Linea Uno, we spent 8 days in the hotel but our room has been cleaned only 3 times insects in room ant cockroach non soundproof walls missing vault poor internet connection, comfortable beds close to metro 
495853,Atahotel Linea Uno,No Negative, I really enjoyed this hotel Great location it is very close to the train station it is almost right at the entrance and there is a very close 24hrs supermarket The apartment was great with a comfortable bed complete kitchen and a good balcony Great value for money 
495854,Atahotel Linea Uno, the room on 6th floor quite noisy from the street and railway I think the rooms on the lower floors should be more quiet , Spacious room close to the underground a few places to eat nearby 
495855,Atahotel Linea Uno, Breakfast is awful better skip it , Convenient location good connection to city center by M1 few fair restaurants near by friendly helpful staff big and clean room 
495856,Atahotel Linea Uno, The staff was not very helpful we were at hotel 13 30 and heard that the room is not ready chek in time 14 00 she proposed us go for pizza or sth not even proposed to store our luggage The wifi was working so so The corridors and the room itself are very stinky smell of cleaning chemicals or some other stuff is overhelming The studio room is located very far from the reception in different wing of building lot of walking and easy to get lost The studio is dark rooms are located under roof windows which are unable to open stinky And the worst of all the description clearly states that the room includes dishes and cutlery nothing about extra payments but when we came we found empty cupboards and a note that dishes are available for the extra payment 10e night What use of having a studio with annex without dishes , Very close to the M1 metro station the entrance just nearby Very close to Carrefour petrol station pizzeria and some nice cafes The studio room is quite spacious and should be good for family with children or two undemanding couples The room includes fridge and separate freezer 
495857,Atahotel Linea Uno, would have liked an utensil scrubber and more kitchen linen The dining table was broken and had to be replaced , Big spacious rooms with old world decor Lot of table space Very well located near the Turro metro station Carrefour supermarket within about 100 meters from the hotel open 24 hours 
495858,Atahotel Linea Uno, The staff blocked my door at 12pm even if as genius I am entitle to check out at 2pm and they insisted that I had to check out at 12pm I had to show the reservation to convince them and they were still not happy,No Positive
495859,Atahotel Linea Uno, A renovation of the older rooms would be something good but it s not necessary yet, The location is excellent so is the size of the rooms Tasty basic breakfast Clean 
495860,Atahotel Linea Uno, All breakfast utensils were disposable which was disappointing on two counts environmental and comfort Our hire car had a window smashed with a rock and concealed valuables stolen from directly outside of this 4 star hotel We had reserved parking but were assured by staff that it would be safe to use the street park directly in front of the entry Milano has a problem , Very close to metro Well furnished though lacking in essential cutlery and cups Very helpful assistance when car broken into 
495861,Atahotel Linea Uno, Beware The place is luxurious but not safe at all I was robbed during my stay there and I strongly feel that a hotel staff must have been an accomplice in the theft My luggages were broken and most of my valuable belongings were taken away And most awful of all The receptionist was dealing with me alone despite the hotel manager was informed of the incident The robbery was not treated serious nor as emergency the manager did not turn up or bother to face me after what happened I was very much disappointed by such behavior ,No Positive
495862,Atahotel Linea Uno, A bit cool in the room Seemed to take ages for heating to work Had to get into bed it was so cold Room has a kitchenette but not a single pot glass cup or utensil and charge 10 day to borrow If you re able bring these with you Have never seen this before Excellent restaurants around , Friendly helpful staff Recommended i book online for cheapest rate when i wanted to extend our stay Turro Metro station was right outside the door so transport was easy 
495863,Atahotel Linea Uno, No fan air in room neither bathtub or sink drain worked properly only one English TV channel smoking neighbors in hotel very long walk to room poorly labeled , Great cappucino at breakfast

495867,Atahotel Linea Uno, breakfast is served in plastic disposable tableware which is extremely sad and dissapointing it looks like you are eating at the train station pillows are a bit too tough and small, very spacious room clean with a balcony good quality of matrasses close to subway 1 minute 
495868,Atahotel Linea Uno, When I arrived my booking went wrong with number of guest I booked a double bed room for 2 persons but booking only showed 1 guest in the email Then they asked me to pay the other guest which was unreasonable reason and price So I had to cancel the former booking and rebooked again Even though the problem was solved I don t think it should be a problem at all some stuff became helpful n kind later , the location is good Near train station and next to the metro station Easy to go expo and downtown
