260324,Thistle Hyde Park, Not enough tea milk in the room and being charged twice on my card for the roomis is wrong way to do things and I have to ring up from another country for you to put it right If this is about a security payment down until you check the room then do it as people leave for that I won t stay there again ,No Positive
260325,Thistle Hyde Park,No Negative, We only stayed for one night but the staff were excellent and location brilliant to the event we were attending also the hotel was very peaceful even though we overlooked a road at the back of the hotel

260327,Thistle Hyde Park, Hotel needs some serious upgrades including enhanced air conditioning as ours set at the only temp cool was a whisper From the photos the rooms look quite boutique with the dark neutral palette and bleached wood finish clearly this was a relatively recent visual upgrade effort Other aspects of the room and overall shortage of staff let the room and experience down The building and location is promising but truly needs more staff For example There was a single mattress propped vertically outside my room the entire 2 days of my stay by the service elevator in room dining trays from night prior seen when leaving hotel for evening were still there by 10 am the next morning and were then stacked by said service elevator for me to navigate getting my luggage around upon departure Room must of been the lowest class available with a view to the AC shaft and walls steep stair case to room and down again to bathroom Shoddy caulk repairs to the ageig marble bathroom looked really badly done I am used to more of a luxury hotel experience so was very off put I thought I was getting a last minute bargain but truly got what I paid for , Location near to paddington and opposite Hyde Park Beautiful walks and runs in the park and very close to the Italian Fountain grden and the Serpentine Gallery Outside tables and chairs were a nice bonus especially since the it was very little ambiance or atmosphere inside the hotel bar Staff were friendly Felt sorry for the woman who was managing front desk as she had to juggle phones check ins and check outs without enough support 
260328,Thistle Hyde Park, Payed 506 for 2 nights in a junior suite and thought I was getting a bargain I would rather have stayed in a travel lodge it wasn t value for money at all Promised a drink on entry which wasn t offered It was 30 degrees outside and the in room air conditioning was broken so the room was like a sauna Shower had no pressure at all to it and barely washed the shampoo out of my hair and the hot water would cut out mid way though your shower as well When we reported the problems we just got told the duty manager would be informed when they came in but nothing ever happened ,No Positive
260329,Thistle Hyde Park, Room on 4th floor NO Hot water yes the Hot water tap was dry in both the Bath Shower and Basin staff was aware No fun rushing to catch a train and having to have a cold shower Also on checking out they took the fee twice and can t refund for several days don t know if this was just incompetent staff or a business strategy Did not expect this standard from the Thistle Group, Excellent location fantastic for attending the BST summer music festival

260332,Thistle Hyde Park, Bar staff had an attitude problem He was doing us the favour not the other way round No help with luggage on arrival or leaving , Front Desk staff efficient and friendly Car Park expensive at UKP 24 day but this is probably average for London Lovely room overlooking Hyde Park
260333,Thistle Hyde Park,No Negative, The beds were very comfortable We really appreciated being allowed into our room at 9 am after a long flight We thought we would have to hang around London for a few hours until check in time Thank you very much for this service as we were exhausted Thanks to Guido and Maurizio who were extra helpful Also the lady at the desk but we didn t catch her name Inna and Inna Smith Australia 
260334,Thistle Hyde Park, unfortunatelly it was 30 degrees and air conditioning wasn t working in our room Staff didn t behave like it should in a situation like that They knew about it from the beginning and probably just hoped that we wont complain We felt like a customers of the second category I thought that hotel like that should have certain standards and offer us a different room right away , localization nice view from the window
260335,Thistle Hyde Park, Room was very dirty with only obvious areas being cleaned Beds very uncomfortable Bathroom was hideous with broken tiles everywhere that had unprofessional attempts to fix Toilet seat and taps very loose No hot and cold markings on basin taps which could pose a hazard to young children I wouldn t put a room with these issues into service , Staff were friendly
260336,Thistle Hyde Park, The shower pressure was poor but we re aware of the fact that the plumbing is old Also a hairdryer would be great Thank you , The graciousness of the hotel it s comfort and homely feeling and it s amazing location We would definitely stay again

260340,Thistle Hyde Park, Warm room but it is the way it is set up , When we arrived early the reception staff member was incredibly kind and very welcoming He gave us a room straight away at no extra cost after he learnt that the previous night we had had no sleep He was professional but also very warm including my child in a conversation The room was great though my only issue was it was too warm because they run the heater as a whole However a staff member came up to open a window straight away Breakfast was fresh and plentiful We were given a room facing Hyde Park which was fantastic as we were across the road For a twin room in London it was double the size and the beds were very comfortable 5 8 min walk from Queensway Station We would return to this hotel 
260341,Thistle Hyde Park, Rooms are a little dated Fits with the style of the hotel but extra plugs are needed in the rooms in this day and age Junior suit with only 2 U K Plugs is an issue when we have phones tablets watches and several cameras to charge , Location and open areas very nice Superb location Great parking Awesome staff

260343,Thistle Hyde Park, Not a complaint but the bathrooms although very clean could maybe do with an upgrade in the room I was in just starting to look a little tired Only other point is could do with a plug socket near the bed but not the end of the world , First time staying at this hotel as my usual hotel was too expensive due to half term I will return to this hotel as from start to finish my stay was catered for Parking was easy staff very helpful and friendly Rooms where of a high standard and the breakfast was a high quality I held a meeting in the bar area and the staff were helpful and delivered tea and coffee with ease

260350,Thistle Hyde Park, The shower was not working properly The water was just dripping out and then it would just stop the water was either scalding hot or freezing cold there was no in between It was reported to reception and they did offer an alternative room However we were on our way out and wouldn t be returning until 1 am in the morning The receptionist said they would look into it that evening which they did however the shower was still faulty the following morning and we were unable to use it It was quite dangerous ,No Positive
260351,Thistle Hyde Park, decor is a little tired Bar man kept disappearing would have bought more drinks had he have been there , Staff were super friendly happy to go above and beyond

260355,Thistle Hyde Park, My only complaint was we could hear a lot of noise from the room above us not sure if we were just unfortunate with a guest stomping about or if perhaps the hatch in the ceiling was a little looser than what it should of been , Breakfast was excellent beds were comfy and staff were very helpful It was also nice for us to be able to park onsite instead of a public car park 
260356,Thistle Hyde Park, Plumbing in need of an overhaul needs some tlc to fix needed repairs chipped paint grout missing or dirty etc Expensive for the value, Friendly and helpful staff who made things right when there was an issue
260357,Thistle Hyde Park,No Negative, Unfortunately the toilet in our room didn t flush the shower dropped continuously through the night the generator was very noisy right outside our room The bed was up against the wall which meant you had to crawl out of the end if you needed to get out in the night very hard We appreciate that this an old building but surely that is no excuse for old plumbing
260358,Thistle Hyde Park, didn t get the type of room booked the first night but got upgraded after that nights which was nice water temperature in shower a little difficult to control but else worked very well It s exactly half way between Lancaster Gate and Queensway station 8 mins walk , free upgrade to junior suite room nice big room overlooked the Hyde Park nice helpful staff comfy bed Good location for Queensway foods plenty of restaurants 
260359,Thistle Hyde Park, The room was very narrow and I didn t like the positioning of the bed against a wall also the bathroom was very tight The breakfast could have been warmer and was little overpriced at 12 per head , The hotel was ideally situated for a weekend touring London also the staff were very friendly and helpful 
260360,Thistle Hyde Park, More shelf space in the bathroom and some light globes blown in the room The car service recommended by the Hotel to Waterloo station was expensive and less than helpful he couldn t drive in to taxi area and then almost ran us over I would just use a taxi next time , Generous amount of space in the room Staff very helpful with directions and suggestions for restaurants
260361,Thistle Hyde Park,No Negative, We received an upgrade and the staff were so accommodating We even had a slightly late breakfast due to a late night and the Italian staff made every effort to help while clearing up and getting the dining room ready for the next meal Impressive all round

260364,Thistle Hyde Park, This is the 3rd time in staying here over the past 6yrs hence nothing has changed I feel it has been left behind There are many issues to address such as noise heating to hot in some rooms or to cold in others loose tiles in bathrooms broken toilet seats creaky floor boards windows don t close properly We moved rooms 3 nights out of the 4 This is a shame as it is a lovely hotel I just hope they start addressing these problems , Location
260365,Thistle Hyde Park, stayed at the hotel about 12 years ago and not a lot changed since Booked a junior suite for additional room but it was old and worn out Breakfast was very expensive and we only did it on day 1 as I had breakfast for the same costs in the Ivy , Location and staff

260367,Thistle Hyde Park, More power sockets and better wi fi connection or some form of entertainment system suited to watching films in bedroom with kids Had hoped to see Harry Potter first film in room before visiting studio but wi fi not up to it unfortunately Very good otherwise , Staff and location size of room for two extra beds for family 
260368,Thistle Hyde Park, Room was cold because the only heating was an inadequate electric oil heater and the room air conditioning didn t give out much in the way of warm air The plumbing is weird no cold water for at least a couple of minutes After running the cold tap for this long the water gets hotter then finally cools down This doesn t seem hygienic and isn t environmentally friendly No breakfast on the last day but we weren t informed that the chef hadn t arrived until after we d gone through the rigmarole of first being turned away to get a voucher from reception then sitting waiting ages for just a coffee This didn t leave us enough time to try an alternative venue around the corner Only when complaining at reception were we told why there was such poor service but it was already too late , Staff were very friendly and helpful Location was excellent for Hyde Park and London museums

260376,Thistle Hyde Park, It s not air conditioned It has air cooling but when the weather is hot as it was during our stay that is not sufficient The manager was very understanding and did his best by switching us to the cooler side of the building and providing a floor fan , A beautiful old building Lovely moldings high ceilings good view of Hyde park Breakfast was excellent with a very attentive and friendly staff Eggs were made to order the side dishes were well prepared fresh fruit and good pastry were available The hotel is in an upscale neighborhood with great access to the tube snd busses Out room was cleaned very promptly amenities were always replaced and we had a mini fridge 
260377,Thistle Hyde Park, See above, Check in was fine room not ready but that s ok it was a big ask for it to be ready in the am Bags stored staff pleasant Returned later in the pm and went to room disappointing junior suite It simply lacked appearance and wow No time to check much out quick change and out to our main event purpose for being in London Back late evening In the am noticed a collection of things that were just not right On check out was asked whether we enjoyed our stay Explained what we thought and had a very helpful discussion with Barbara Her response was excellent and I have to say went a long way toward making us feel we hadn t been completely robbed 
260378,Thistle Hyde Park, Nothing, I loved the care the staff took to make you feel like a valued customer Pleasant friendly and nothing was too much trouble We got the rare thing of a personal service and we really felt like they value us as guests

260386,Thistle Hyde Park,No Negative, Nice comfy beds and good size rooms peaceful location cafes and restaurant nearby and within walking distance of Paddington Station also other stations close by Staff very helpful Would stay here again
260387,Thistle Hyde Park, We were disturbed by cleaning staff no less than 3 times on one day walking in without knocking first This felt very uncomfortable as we were not dressed and one of us got woken up sleeping in the afternoon from jet lag And the next day when we DID want them to clean the room not only did we leave a sign to clean up but we also told the staff at the front desk that room 201 was ready for maid service When we came back 6 or 8 hours later it was not done Then the staff insisted that the sign said do not disturb and an argument ensued When we returned to the room the sign read very clearly please clean room The 2 sides of the sign should be vastly different colours and design as they are easy to misread The shower temperature was so unstable that I got burnt several times as it kept readjusting , The bath tub was excellent so roomy and the water flow was so fast to fill We appreciated the large room as well Jo at the front counter was extremely professional and helpful The location was beautiful right across from Hyde Park 
260388,Thistle Hyde Park, There was a long steep flight of 20 steps from inside our room door up to the bedroom area No porter available Air conditioner didn t work Tiny reception which was severely understaffed , Comfortable beds 
260389,Thistle Hyde Park, The hotel is not designed to be antique it s an old hotel everything is broke The bathroom is a mess everything is just so cheap and the safe is broke as well Where can people put there personal belongings The electricity went off in half of the cables Like honestly even 3 stars is too much for this hotel I m Done Plus there s only one elevator that gets stuck every now and then you can t fit more than 1 bag and 3 persons What kind of 4 stars hotel is this , NOTHING 
260390,Thistle Hyde Park, The overall appearance of the hotel is somewhat tired and certainly needs modernisation, Very Peaceful and quiet given that we were there over a weekend in August we only saw one other couple

260392,Thistle Hyde Park, The facilities in bathroom are old and bad Water can only be adjusted to very hot or very cold Water drop from the ceiling of corridor outside the room Very annoying , Natural wind
260393,Thistle Hyde Park, Once checked in and up in the room we did understand why other people have mentioned how the rooms seem tired They are but for us it didn t take away from the experience and my friend described it as shabby chic Aside from that we really don t have any complaints about our stay although the cleaners could probably do with paying a little more attention to cleaning on top of things like mirrors and doorframes something we probably wouldn t have noticed if it hadn t been for the fact we watched Ramsey s Hotel Hell during our stay , Upon arrival at the Thistle Hyde Park we were greeted by an extremely cheerful member of staff on reception As it was only 10 45am we d stopped in to see if we could leave our bags there but were informed that our room was ready for us and we could check in straight away Not only that we d also been upgraded to a deluxe twin which was a lovely surprise after a tiring morning travelling The room itself was wonderful and extremely comfortable with a view out across the park even if it was mostly tree tops We both slept fine and the hotel was very quiet Upon check out the following day the staff also offered to keep our bags for us while we went out into the city something I haven t experienced before without having to ask myself 
260394,Thistle Hyde Park, The prices at the bar and having to pay for the breakfast separately after paying for the room , Staff were nice and helpful the breakfast was cooked nice and plenty of it
260395,Thistle Hyde Park, We came at night and there was no one at reception ended up waiting ages for a very grumpy and rude man to check us in My boyfriend wanted to play the piano in the lobby and the man look irritated by this For such a nice looking room it was a real shame that the coffee making facilities were that of a cheap B B, Really big rooms with lovely decor Great location Good shower bath facilities Lots of storage space
260396,Thistle Hyde Park, The air con was not strong enough when the weather was really hot Extra fan was supplied though , The room size was excellent The room safe great Very quiet at night Bathroom good size and supplies 
260397,Thistle Hyde Park, The air conditioner does not work in most of the rooms because I saw a ton of people complaining about it The days of my stay were really hot so it was impossible to stay without AC I left after one night to another hotel , The manager was nice when resolving our issue

260405,Thistle Hyde Park, Although breakfast was nice it would be nice to have some vegetarian options , Great location ideal for Hyde park concerts Lovely room Good car park would recommend to anyone wanting to go to London 
260406,Thistle Hyde Park, Poor air con room boiling hot next to noisy air ducts outside not enough sockets, Perfect location helpful staff Good breakfast comfy bed good wifi
260407,Thistle Hyde Park, On arrival they had no confirmation of booking we then had to re book and was put in room 217 which is great if you love the drone of the air conditioning main vent going all night long We was given a complimentary breakfast which was a nice gesture but I m glad as would not have paid 16 00 for it as the eggs solid beans dry and bacon not cooked,No Positive

260458,Thistle Hyde Park, By their own admission the heating struggled to cope on a very cold night not helped by some secondary glazing which was less than adequate However the hotel is due to be refurbished in 2016 and this should be put right , Great location The hotel was very elegant and the staff were very friendly and helpful The breakfast was excellent We would return 
260459,Thistle Hyde Park, On arrival not told till I checked in that the twin room I booked was not available Then transferred to sister hotel up the road with reassurance that it was a beautiful refruishbed hotel After checking in again and on entering room which was smaller than expected there was a smell of damp and mould No porter to help with bags despite 4 star hotel Returned to original hotel and was promised twin room the next day Twin room nice but noise from heating system reported to stuff and not sorted out despite request After moving rooms again finally managed to get some sleep Noise from AC heating system and road terrible if you are looking for a rest and a quiet break Hotel nice but needs total refruishbment , Staff were nice and tried to sort out our concerns Great location and rooms big for London
