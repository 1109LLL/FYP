212179,Chateau Frontenac, The one piece of music on repeat loop during breakfast Some variety would be nice , The location is perfect breakfast each morning exc d d expectation the staff were very accommodating can not fault the experience 
212180,Chateau Frontenac, We had to leave , This stay was for a break away having recently been married to my partner a few days before the hotel is amazing and outstanding with its luxury feel to it The staff were all warm friendly and made us feel very welcome at all times 
212181,Chateau Frontenac, Nothing everything was perfect Please be careful with the taxi drivers prices From gare du nord train station to the hotel 6km should be 20 euros and we got stung for 45 when we arrived but the hotel staff told us what taxis to get and how much it should be From our hotel to Roland garros no more than 15 euros so if you go please ask first and don t be afraid to walk away , The staff were amazingly friendly and nothing was too much trouble The room was beautiful and the beds were honestly like sleeping on clouds The location being in the 8th was excellent a 5 minute stroll to the champs de lyses or the seine a beautiful area to stroll through with lots of lovely restaurants and bars We went for Roland garros and it was a 15 minute taxi ride from the hotel 
212182,Chateau Frontenac, Nothing, Great location Reception ready to help and give useful information My family had been stayed 6 nights here We are very impress this hotel upgraded my daughter room to privilege room help me to print some train and flight documents The rooms are spacious and spotless Very near to shopping area Nice portugese restaurant pedra alta is about 2 block from the hotel 
212183,Chateau Frontenac, We were out for the day returning at 3 30 but our room was still not serviced They tried about 4pm but but then it was inconvenient for us , Lovely room and bar Helpful staff 
212184,Chateau Frontenac,No Negative, Perfect location for Turisim very nice staff services and staff I went there with my Family We were always excited to come back to have rest at the hotel 
212185,Chateau Frontenac, Room was not ready at 15 00 Staff let us wait but nothing happened Room was very noisy inside and outside Room was very small old infrastructure temp inside very cold , After all cour complaints staff tried to improve ambiance Location of hotel good 
212186,Chateau Frontenac, There remodeling so there is a bit of noise, The location is perfect Everything is a walk away restaurants shops bars bistrot champs elysee all you need is money 
212187,Chateau Frontenac, furniture and premises in need of a bit of renewal, great location comfortable in general the lobby and bar area a good addition in paris size of room acceptable breakfast area and food very decent 
212188,Chateau Frontenac, The room that the hotel gave us was very dark and was all the way to the back In the reception they sold the room as it was very good however it was very small and dark and claustrofobic But it always happen when we book through booking com the hotels prefer to give the better rooms to their own clients When it is booked through here they always give the worst rooms My experience in Barcelona was the same Praktik Rambla hotel did the same thing , The location of the hotel was very good the room was clean and bathroom was really clean and beautiful 
212189,Chateau Frontenac, The last night I was there they must have been doing some improvements and there were terrible fumes like paint coming into my room I was able to open the window but it was chilly , The location was excellent and the staff was attentive every time we entered and left the Hotel The room was really comfortable for two of us to stay in and I loved the bathroom Everything looked brand new I extended to spend some time with family on the weekend and they went out of their way to make the transition into two rooms easy They upgraded my accommodations that I had booked online this was a nice surprise Check out was a breeze 
212190,Chateau Frontenac,No Negative, Wonderful location Every part of Paris can be reached walking Excellent room service Nice and cosy rooms 20 m2 room we stayed in was spacious and provides a thought out comfortable design We spent 6 nights there and felt as we were staying at our own place free wifi is high speed 
212191,Chateau Frontenac, A staff came into our room without knocking the door and entered without doing anything, The location is good and the staff in the bar and reception are good
212192,Chateau Frontenac, The bed as noted previously , The location is superb and the staff were really friendly and helpful The only slight downside was the bed was a little firm but some may like that 
212193,Chateau Frontenac, Room by the service elevator is VERY noisy up to midnight It was also very small Correspondence by email was horrible Kept calling me Madam despite being corrected twice and never answered my questions The morning I left the front desk seemed annoyed when I asked for my car valet parking He pointed and said it s at the other hotel you can go get it but never gave me a name for the hotel I came back three times asked him where it was and finally in a huff he said Look I will show you then and walked across the street to a hotel that had NO name on the outside How the hell was I supposed to know that was a hotel Also got a parking ticket as a result of their valet parking The hotel did pay it eventually Overall I d look elsewhere but it will do in a pinch , Just off Champs Elys es so location was good 
212194,Chateau Frontenac, There wasn t anything negative about our stay, Beautiful room very clean staff very friendly and helpful Location just perfect for a short stay with its close proximity to the Champs Elyses and surrounded by restaurants bistros and cafes 
212195,Chateau Frontenac, The hotel has undergone some renovations but I could tell I was in an older room It was charming but knowing that I paid the same for my room as someone paid for a renovated room hurts a little Make sure you request a renovated room upon check in , The beds were unbelievably comfortable all premises were clean the location is great and the lobby and bar d cor is very inviting Oh and the staff are very accommodating Because of its location you will pay a bit extra here It s great for a first or second visit to Paris but if you re familiar with the city I would suggest staying farther from the Champs Elysees merely based price value I would recommend this hotel to others 
212196,Chateau Frontenac,No Negative, I fell in love with the hotel from the minute I walked in The location the warm welcome and the rooms were just spectacular We stayed in one of the Privilege Rooms and it was just fantastic Nice and spacious and lovely interior However it was the staff that made our experience at the hotel unforgettable They were just amazing Super friendly and extremely helpful For 3 days they went out of their way to assist us with bookings and reservations They definitely made all the difference in the overall experience Great job I will be back for sure 
212197,Chateau Frontenac, Looks old hotel although some renovation is still running out there Staff not cooperative at all as we have to ask for every single thing Even room service I asked for late check out but once was 12 pm they called me to get out of the room because the hotel is fully booked Rooms are not isloated at all i can hear the others room talking or dancing in the midnight And sounds of loud songs from street is all heard till 4 am sometimes although i got 5th floor out of total 6 floors but i felt like i was staying in the street Breakfast is not full of choices I wouldn t recommend it at all if you are going to paris as firts visit, location is great almost 2 3 min walking to champs elysees street
212198,Chateau Frontenac, When I asked the hotel for airport taxi I wasn t informed that it would cost an extra 7 because taxi was called through the hotel , The hotel was very clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful especially Antoin 
212199,Chateau Frontenac, The check out timing , I liked everything starting from the location of the hotel up to the little details of the furniture The staf were so helpful and professional The breakfast buffet could add more varietys but it was delicious The hotel is definitely my home away from home in Paris

212202,Chateau Frontenac, More staff, The staff very honest and save the day I checked out I lost my money 2600 euro I do not now where I left it I went back to my room I found one lady cleaning the room I asked her at the time super user came to me and took me to the front desk then they asked me how mutch then they gave to me
212203,Chateau Frontenac, overpriced but i understand it has to do with the location being in the 8eme lots of renovation noise staff used guest elevators old fashioned heavy keys with huge key chains you had to leave at reception wifi was awful in standard rooms Got better wifi in my mom s privilege room Cleanliness and room amenities not that great Cleaning personal did not restock teas and coffees as often as they should , Good Lobby rooms are reasonably sized pleasant furniture beds were comfy and the staff was helpful and friendly

212217,Chateau Frontenac, The wifi is a disaster you need to reconnect every time u re enter the hotel and even then the connection is weak and slow I complained to the staff but they couldn t do anything about it , Staff are friendly and the location is great
212218,Chateau Frontenac, The room while spacious wasn t well furnished There were no drawers outside the closet and few tabletops to place belongings which made it awkward to unpack for an extended stay , Amazing location One block from the middle of the Champs Elysees and a mere 15 minute walk to the Eiffel The concierges were ok but one was outstanding William He helped us with all our booking requests and even followed up with us to confirm them The bed and room were very modern and comfortable Great space in the room Perfect for longer stays Close to several metro stops
