247299,Derby Alma, the breakfast was okay not worth 13 50, Amazing location the FRIENDLIEST STAFF Patricia was the best Good clean rooms We loved the Samsung phones in the rooms that you could use for booking activities navigating the city and calling taxis 
247300,Derby Alma, As the weather is warmer now we found that the bed cover was too warm When asking for a blanket we were informed that the cover was a blanket and therefore nothing else was offered The Doona was far too warm for the warmer nights something lighter to sleep under would have been more comfortable , All good breakfast good as well 
247301,Derby Alma, The room we were staying in was tiny but it doesn t matter a lot if you spend most of the day outside , The view form the rooms is amazing The area around the hotel is awesome Very helpful staff The design of the room and the bathroom was really nice 
247302,Derby Alma, Their restaurant is a bit small , I knew a receptionister his name is Fred He was so helpful and easygoing employee He did his best and he could do whatever I wanted He was absolutely fantastic character I will never forget his attitudes towards me 
247303,Derby Alma,No Negative, This was an excellent choice The location is ideal close to an RER station and just 8 minute walk to the Tower and Champ de Mars The staff was incredibly friendly and with attention to detail The room is impecable and the bed is very comfortable I was there on Easter Sunday and they even left me a note and a few chocolate eggs as a welcome souvenir This is a 300 a night room and I was upgraded for free to a 400 a night room and only paid 186 due to a promotion on Booking com
247304,Derby Alma, The female staff member with red hair sitting at the front desk needs an attitude adjustment The other members of staff were OK but nothing impressive overall , I requested a room with a view of the Eiffel tower and what a view I received It was a dream come true The bed was incredibly comfortable and although the room was very small it was furnished beautifully and intelligently for functionality 
247305,Derby Alma, We had a room for three the third bed was a pull out which is fine but it came with no blankets We asked for blankets then left and when we came back hours later still had no blankets and had to ask the front desk I found hair in the food the bed and on the bathroom floor Our tv did not work and we had to ask for it to be fixed multiple times One of the lights did not work and in fact the plug was sparking we showed the individual who came to the room when we called to have our tv fixed again We told her we would unplug it so it didnt start a fire and nothing more was done about it we were just without a light In regards to the food in the buffet the cream and the pastries were great The eggs were cold and somehow powdery and runny at the same time and the drinks were all warm Basically if it was supposed to be cold it was warm and vise versa I would stay here again as I dont go to Paris for the hotel but for the price it was I was expecting much more , The location and the staff were great I wish I could remember the name of the one girl in particular who was so wonderful The hotel is located right between the river and the Eiffel Tower Very easy to walk to everything 
247306,Derby Alma,No Negative, Great staff Also needed an iron and ironing board and it came within minutes after requesting it Fantastic location and comfortable rooms Can definitely recommend 
247307,Derby Alma,No Negative, Derby Alma is in a very safe and comfortable location with amazing restaurants nearby Staff was extremely accommodating and even offered complimentary champagne upon our arrival The rooms were extremely spacious exceptionally clean and had the perfect view of the Eiffel Tower We had a wonderful stay at Derby Alma Will absolutely be staying here for our next trip to Paris 
247308,Derby Alma,No Negative, For a four star hotel next to the Eiffel Tower the deal given at the time was outstanding value for money Excellent overall location with a metro and an RER station nearby The quieter seventh arrondissement is great for those looking for fewer crowds than St Michel or the area around Opera Stylish hotel with decent service Good WiFi 
247309,Derby Alma, Returned at 3 00 pm to rest and room had not yet been prepared But they did so within 20 minutes of my complaint The price after having booked and paid I looked again at the Booking com site now prices was 50 00 less for the same room I felt like I had been taken , For my visit perfect location 
247310,Derby Alma, Th pillows For us who need softer pillows there was a lack of pillow selection , Great customer service from opening the lift for us to recommendations for places to eat at dinner breakfast Taxi was ordered for us nothing was too much trouble Had a nice hand written thank you for staying from the manager too 
247311,Derby Alma, The staff during our breakfast got a bit annoyed when my daughter spilled her juice on her plate She could see her following look every time she moves It made her a bit concious , Everything was really good My children loved it 
247312,Derby Alma, Breakfast is continental style and overpriced took more than 15 minutes to get coffee and tea Had one coffee and tea in lobby which was priced at 12 00 found out at checkout Quite excessive When checking out the lady at the desk tried to pull a fast one I gave 50 Euros and she returned as if I gave her 20 Good thing I paid attention, Location
247313,Derby Alma,No Negative, The rooms were very clean and cozy the staff was friendly and helpful the breakfast was tasty and the location was great There were 7 of us in a group and we easily walked to the Eifel Tower the Louvre and the Christmas markets The metro stop was just a block away and easy to figure how to get to the Notre Dame Cathedral It was a wonderful stay with hassle free arrival and exit with the shuttle to and from CDG I would definitely stay there again 
247314,Derby Alma, Not that it s the hotel receptions responsibility but on checkin the receptionist help translate my Paris Passlib package and saw that we had a reservation for the Eiffel Tower for the next morning The next morning I asked for late checkout by which by no means is a guarantee but they understandably couldn t accommodate due to an incoming guest We check out early and head to the Eiffel Tower for our scheduled reservation time but the Eiffel Tower was closed due to worker strikes that had been going on for the past couple of days If the receptionist would of given us some kind of info that the tower was closed it would have changed our whole day and we could of planned accordingly before we checked out of the hotel early Instead with my 66 year old mother and 5 month old daughter we were essentially left out in the cold To top off our trip we decided to just head to the train station earlier then planned and just wait for our train Since we were at the train station ahead of our schedule we witnessed an attempted mugging and we were all inadvertently sprayed with pepper spray Luckily my daughter was in her stroller and was not directly affected as we were A little heads up that the tower was closed or could possibly closed would of went a long way especially considering the proximity of the hotel to the tower is why I chose this hotel to begin with Without a doubt in my mind if the receptionist would of given us the info concerning the tower closure we would have not witnessed the mugging and been pepper sprayed Paris just isn t what it used to be , Location was nice and the room wasn t too small because they gave us the handicap room so we could fit a crib 
247315,Derby Alma, The breakfast is too expensive and there was not a big variety of food maybe because we came in the last 30 mins of breakfast closing , The hotel was really nice The rooms were quite big and comfortable They have a coffe machine inside each room for free so in the morning you can enjoy a great cup of coffe As well the minibar was nice and for free We liked the small details from the room for example good quality and large towells amazing hermes shower gels shampoons and body cream The best thing about this hotel was the location The effeil tour was just 4 7 mins walk As well across the bridge were a lot of restaurants and shops The receptionist guy was really nice and helpfull 
247316,Derby Alma,No Negative, Superfriendly multilingual staff and a tub for a hot bath after a cold but beautiful day in Paris We asked for a room with view on the Eiffel Tower and got it 
247317,Derby Alma, Nothing at all it was great, We had a wonderful time staying here The staff could not be more helpful They were just great It was so close to the Eifel Tour which was so beautiful Beds very comfortable Can recommend this hotel very highly Thankyou for a wonderful stay Kathy G
247318,Derby Alma,No Negative, Our junior suite had a view of the Eiffel Tower and was very spacious for 3 people The king size bed was so comfortable The staff were very accommodating You could walk to the Eiffel Tower in about 3 minutes There were many cafes and restaurants close to the hotel and metro stops with a few minutes walk If I ever visit Paris again in the future I would definitely book this hotel again 
247319,Derby Alma,No Negative, Well located hotel near the Eiffel Tower and essentially a block away from a metro I loved the location and the hotel and staff was wonderful I will definitely stay hear again 
247320,Derby Alma, Nothing specific expcept the wifi in my room was little bit unstable , Everything is perfect and satisfied I had a great And enjoyable stay especially from the stuff i would like to thank Agathe for wonderful welcoming and smiling she was really helpful 
247321,Derby Alma, Nothing, The location is amazing The rooms space is good specially the corner room with the big window There was unavailability of single bed rooms which I reserved so they give us a complimentry breakfast and solve the issue next day The staff are super welcoming specially Aziz They will help in many thing they are there 24 hr They helped in printing all my tickets The lobby is small but it is okay and comfy Nice Indian resturant adjacent to it and a pharmacy nearby One day it was my sister Birthday and they left for her nice gift and warming card in her room I will choose it again and recommend it to my friends and family 
247322,Derby Alma, No parking had to park the car a few blocks away at public facility Expensive to do so , Great facility extremely helpful friendly staff excellent location next to rue Cler and the Eiffel Tower
247323,Derby Alma, Nothing , This was our honeymoon and we had an exceptional stay We were upgraded to a superior room and everything about the room was perfect There were a few things that really impressed us 1 We saw your hotel as a boutique hotel in that we estimated there were only around 25 30 rooms which was small enough to make our experience and interactions with your staff very personal 2 Having access to a mobile phone which made searching for information and navigating around Paris very easy and convenient 3 The condition and layout of our room was top class and overall 4 The price of the hotel with the discount and the quality of the room and positive experience we had gave us good value for money 
247324,Derby Alma, We don t have any complaints , The hotel was very nice bar area great lobby area great our room was clean and very cozy The beds were so comfortable that it was hard to wake up because we were in such a deep sleep Bathroom had all the regular amenities needed ALL of the staff went above and beyond and truly exceeded our expectations The location was perfect we could see the Eiffel Tower from our room No parking on site but that wasn t an issue there was an affordable parking garage around the corner a 3 minute walk from the hotel The hotel has an area in front of hotel to drop off or pick up your bags so no need to drag them from the parking garage We would highly recommend staying at this hotel Great value for your money too 
247325,Derby Alma, Rooms were slightly smaller but comfortable , Staff was amazing and very helpful Good location to the C line metro which is great for going to all major sights Bathroom size was large compared to most Euro hotels 
247326,Derby Alma, There was no milk with tea in the room , It was a nice peaceful breakfast good room for family excellent location good location on the 6th floor good breakfast
247327,Derby Alma,No Negative, We enjoyed our stay at the Derby Alma so much The staff were extra friendly and helpful contacting people even by phone that we needed The room was large the bed the most comfortable of any we had slept in for a while The view of the Eiffel tower from our window surprised us and the location was the best I felt that we got a great deal with the level of this hotel and its location So great 
247328,Derby Alma, The fact I asked for a quite room and got a room on the 1st floor that had busy street noise Also housekeeper throw out a graduation booklets I want to share with other family members Breakfast wasn t worth 15 pounds , Not much it wasn t worth the money
247329,Derby Alma, Totally satisfied No complaints , Tastefully decorated Luxurious Spacious and comfortable Staff was helpful and friendly Affordable View of Eiffel Tower Many restaurants in walking distance Bakery next door Free use of mobile phone during stay Highly recommend 
247330,Derby Alma,No Negative, All the staff was very welcoming happy to help Location was great one block from the Eiffel Tower We arrived at the ORY airport we took the Direct 1 Bus to the Eiffel Tower stop drop was very close to the hotel There is a safe in the room Rooms were very clean There are many restaurants close by 
247331,Derby Alma, Bed was a little hard and you could only use free wifi on one device at a time , staff was great friendly and helpful Great location for us to explore Eiffel Tower very close Loved that I had a tub in our room 
247332,Derby Alma, The room is quite small bed area and there were no available plugs we had to either unplug the lamps the phone or the clock to charge our mobiles , The location is perfect The bathroom was really good in size and water pressure was perfect Service is excellent and we truly recommend that you enjoy a coffee or a drink on the terrace outside the hotel to do some people watching It is a much better option than to go to the restaurant cafe that is in the corner in front of the hotel 
247333,Derby Alma, Wifi was slow And I really don t like the trend of architecturally interesting bathroom sinks that don t work as well for travelers as the perfectly good and ordinary kind Oh well , Nice room great bed bedding nice lobby very clean like new We like the location quieter than most centrally located places lots of good walking near the Metro river 
247334,Derby Alma, Our only suggestion is to have 2 milk and coffee sachets pp only thing I can think of , The staff were as usual extremely helpful and pleasant Our 4th stay here and we ve been completely satisfied on each occasion Breakfast is excellent rooms comfortable and clean Position near Pont de L Alma metro therefore RER to Versailles and in the 7th makes it very handy We arrived from Australia at 07 00 after 27 hours in transit I d mentioned we had an 84 year old with us and a room had been made ready for her to refresh without us asking Last trip a snap pilot s strike meant we had no where to stay they fitted us in even though they were overwhelmed That s what service is about We have been visiting Paris twice per year for many years and this has proved to be our most comfortable and accommodating hotel to date 
247335,Derby Alma, Nothing needed improvement for me , Room was spacious bed was cozy neighborhood quiet for a good night s sleep great location near the metro staff was warm and inviting Complimentary robes and slippers in the room Lobby was a perfect place to relax with a drink and reflect on the day 
247336,Derby Alma, I wish the hotel was closer to the metro station We had to walk a distance to get to it and we went in March when it was still cold The walk was pleasant because it was close to nice places but it would have felt better to be closer , The location of the hotel for the price is great We were lucky enough to be in one of the rooms where you can catch a glimpse of the top of the Eiffel Tower from the window The room felt very warm and was clean They provide a small refrigerator and room service The location is not too far from a local shopping street as well as the Eiffel Tower 
247337,Derby Alma, Had promble with elevator bathroom light and phone But when reported they where fixed right away So not really a promble , Very nice Europe breakfast Good location A lot of little resturants in walking distance 
247338,Derby Alma, Slight draught in room But if I had mentioned it to the staff I m sure they would have done something about it , Location staff and facilities are perfect 
247339,Derby Alma, The hotel could have some lunch dinner items otherwise guests have to go out for every meal , Location is the best if you are in Paris to visit the Eiffel Tower Other tourist spots are walkable 
247340,Derby Alma,No Negative, Our 4 night stay in this hotel was fantastic from start to finish The room was lovely so modern and clean and tidy The hotel itself was also very clean and the location was brill It was about 5 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower and so close to the canal Staff were all very nice and helpful too couldn t fault a thing Would stay here again if I return to Paris and would recommend this hotel to everyone great value for money and breakfast included and it s a lovely breakfast 
247341,Derby Alma, Breakfast was very poor , This hotel is just opposite Halal Indian Restaurant Jawad Five min walking distance to Eiffel tower Good comfortable hotel

247343,Derby Alma,No Negative, Excellent location near Eiffel Tower Metro subway RER railroad and upscale shopping the interior designer did an excellent job Great breakfast buffet 
247344,Derby Alma, The 5th floor family suite room rate was quite expensive and we could see only the top of Eiffel , Nice staff and reception I stayed here with my family during New year They gave us warm welcoming nice gifts and a glass of champagne

247349,Derby Alma, We arrived late 11 30 pm Would have been nice if at check in we d been told that Room Service food had to be ordered before 12 midnight Although it is advertised that you can have food until 1 am it doesn t say that you have to order before midnight We rang at 1210 and had to go hungry Also we asked the hotel to organise a cab for us from and to the airport From the airport 75 Euros but the driver reception had no change so it cost us 80 Euros Going back to the airport with a side trip via Arc de Triomphe cost us 58 Euros We d expect it to be a standard cost to and from same place or a heads up that it would be more expensive getting there Hotel looks like it could do with a new coat of paint Esp doors ceilings , Loved the location Soooo close to the Eiffel Tower
247350,Derby Alma, Very poor breakfast we left breakfast room hungry Carpet very dirty I couldn t sleep all nights because i have elegy from dust Wifi wasn t working at all so we ve been without Internet all the time I had a argument in reception because they wanted to charge me twice for my breakfast And when we asked them to call taxi for us to airport they refused and we had to take them on transfer which one it s cost 60 when normally cost 30 And when we went to airport driver charged at 70 for 17 min drive I am very disappointed by this hotel we stayed in loads of places and this one is the worst this hotel Disappointed our weekend in Paris , Very good location quiet room and very comfortable bed
