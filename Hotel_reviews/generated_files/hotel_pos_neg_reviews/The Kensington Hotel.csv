30320,The Kensington Hotel, The hotel staff were not bothered to check an earlier promise by one of their managers two years before to upgrade me whenever I came again They said they were anyway fully booked But it would have been nice if they at least checked , The comfort level the cleanliness and primarily the great location 
30321,The Kensington Hotel, The superior category rooms are tiny and the bathroom minuscule found it to be extremely poor value Rooms need refurbishment Turn down service in spite of specific request was irregular , The public spaces are attractive and inviting The terraces make for a comfortable space to relax outdoors whilst being indoors 
30322,The Kensington Hotel, Had to request the mascarpone cheese missing from my breakfast Requested olives to be told that they were coming and then needed to ask someone else because of time it was taking Maressa was excellent Group of people watching a LOUD video on their phone to which I had to ask them to turn it down to hear my conversation I wouldn t stay here again it s really not a 5 star , Good breakfast Lovely tea room George helpful with bags and good conversation
30323,The Kensington Hotel, We didn t get our room cool enough for the heat spell , I splurged on this part of our trip with our stay at the Kensington It was lovely and added to our time in London 
30324,The Kensington Hotel, We have emailed the hotel and passed feedback on check out We were allocated room 416 and it was extremely noisy due to the elevator position constantly through the night you could hear it being used Opposite our room was also a Storage cupboard for House Keeping so Saturday and Sunday Morning again constantly awoken by housekeeping entering and making noise using this cupboard For the amount we paid I was disappointed as we specifically chose a 5 hotel hoping it was going to luxury I am also disappointed that we have highlighted this to the hotel and they haven t responded I certainly think this room should have been discounted or highlighted as an issue with the closeness of the elevator and the service cupboard , We liked the location and the decoration of the hotel Staff were also friendly 
30325,The Kensington Hotel, Breakfast options were limited and while we didn t have a chance to try the dinner services they seemed to be priced unusually high , The staff were attentive and accommodating the downward facing shower nozzle in the bathroom felt amazing and the station was right near South Kensington Tube Station so we could go anywhere in London relatively cheap

30327,The Kensington Hotel, Room we booked was advertised as a superior however our room was tiny and when I told the reception staff we had booked a superior room we were told that was their base room meaning it was standard Thought they would upgrade us as it s really a little bit false advertising but they didn t although they did move us to a slightly bigger room , Room service food was very good 
30328,The Kensington Hotel, Nothing , This is a lovely boutique Hotel in South Kensington beautifully decorated very clean with very comfortable beds and very friendly and helpful staff They will do everything to satisfy you and make your stay unforgettable The hotel smells very nicely and there are candles everywhere Stay there when you visit London You will be in one of the best London neighborhoods

30358,The Kensington Hotel, I booked two Junior suites at the same time One was on the 1st floor and one was on the 5th floor They were within your standards for rooms but not comparable The 1st floor room was elegant with full length windows curtains and a chandalier and the 5th floor room was attic in design with small windows no curtains and the lighting was inadequate Really the suites need to be called something else to differentiate them apart , The lovely rooms and furniture Staff were just fantastic a pleasure to talk with

30381,The Kensington Hotel,No Negative, All of the staff were exeptionally courteous friendly and helful Vido at the front door and Dean at the bar were true professionals The hotel is a short walk 5 min to the South Kensington station where you can tube it anywhere in London 
30382,The Kensington Hotel, The room was fairly small but acceptably so The bathroom was a microdot and even when only one of us was in there it was a bit of a puzzle how to get around Also clearly there had been a change of furnishings in the room because there was a bank of outlets with no particular purpose on the wall not doing anything but marring the elegant appearance of an otherwise lovely small room , This is a very elegant and beautifully appointed hotel with lovely common rooms on the ground floor and very charming and helpful staff The breakfast is excellent 
30383,The Kensington Hotel, Rooms aren t huge often corridor noise from other guests, All round fantastic hotel The only place I ll stay in west London quiet clean great location and staff
30384,The Kensington Hotel, The room was too small for a 5 star hotel the basic room is actually very bad With 2 people carrying 2 bags you have no place to put your bags or clothes I asked for a bigger room and they gave me one near the air conditioner machines which make being in the room like being right near a refrigerator In the end I had to pay extra for an upgrade and the room was much better This is the only bad point on this hotel , The hotel is amazing great common areas with excellent taste Staff was great always available for help The location is perfect more residential are which is nice to get away from craziness of down town But at walking distance from some main interesting areas

30387,The Kensington Hotel, Standard rooms are small but cozy complete with amenities and a Nespresso machine Because it s an old Victorian manor turned boutique hotel sometimes the rooms have an awkward shape Make sure to ask for a room facing the street view , Great staff and service Comfortable beds 
30388,The Kensington Hotel, Rooms are a bit on the small side View from the room wasn t great we were at the back looking onto an alley , Hotel is in a great location everything is spotless the bed was really comfy and the shower superb Great toiletries as well 
30389,The Kensington Hotel, How small room was difficult to move around each other and we are slim Bathroom tiny and poor lighting for shaving, Staff lovely checking smooth and easy
30390,The Kensington Hotel, My room was extremely small although I had booked a double room for 2 adults I could hardly move in the room And it was impossible to watch TV in bed since the TV screen is fixed at the right hand of the bed so i had to watch TV sideways, Great Location Friendly staff Very good concierge
30391,The Kensington Hotel, Giving us a room specified in our booking no comfortable chairs in room no drawer storage extractor in bathroom didn t work , Location to visit museums

30393,The Kensington Hotel, The cocktail bar could have been better managed the evening we were there , We love staying at the Kensington Hotel and have stayed often The welcome is warm from the moment you walk up the steps and into reception until you leave particularly from the staff who greet you and help with luggage and the receptionists The lounge space has been beautifully decorated and the Cocktail bar looks great since the refurbishment last year
30394,The Kensington Hotel, The tone of the carpet could have been a little rosier Kidding , The Staff were friendly and remembered us with our comings and goings The restaurant served the best pancakes ever and the bed was more comfortable than mine at home The location is in a beautiful part of town and is three blocks from the Tube station 
30395,The Kensington Hotel,No Negative, We enjoyed the whole weekend the staff were wonderful the bar area was really relaxing and the restaurant and staff were most welcoming as were the reception staff Room was comfortable and lounge area so nice to come back to for a relaxing sit down after a busy day 
30396,The Kensington Hotel, Nothing , Small room but beautifully maintained really comfortable bed and luxurious bedding The lounge restaurant areas of the hotel are delightful like living in a more gentile time The staff are exceptional their customer service skills are awesome and made me feel very welcome The hotel is only 5 minutes walk from the South Kensington underground station and there are many restaurants nearby 
30397,The Kensington Hotel, The bathrooms were a little bit small for a long stay We only stayed 2 nights and so it was not a huge concern , The customer service was top notch We were treated very well during our stay We also loved the breakfast afternoon tea and the decor feel in the common areas The location is great as the Kensington is right around the corner from a tube station and lots of bars restaurants 
30398,The Kensington Hotel, The bedroom was the smallest most cramped and claustrophobic room we have ever stayed in and that was after my wife complained and got a bigger room NEVER again , Bar and lounge areas excellent very friendly and helpful staff

30401,The Kensington Hotel, Breakfast rates were very confusing as to what was included and what was not A better way would be to have one inclusive rate for Continental Breakfast and one inclusive rate for English Breakfast We were quite puzzled regarding the English Breakfast rate and we were unsure if this included cereals drinks toast as is normally the case Our room was rather small with no view Also the rooftop immediately outside the bathroom window was very unpleasant with chicken bones cigarette butts etc all visible , Beautiful d cor and flower arrangements 
30402,The Kensington Hotel,No Negative, In order to attend a daylong course in London I needed to stay in town for a couple of nights By basing ourselves at the Kensington not only could I walk to UCL which is just round the corner but the proximity to the tube meant we were only a couple of stops from the Westend for the couple of shows we crammed in and the Heathrow Express to return home after a super time The Kensington is relaxed characterful and elegant and the staff are both friendly and proficient We would happily return just need a good excuse 
30403,The Kensington Hotel, Small room as usual in London Little more room than what is occupied by the bed , Very nice hotel warm atmosphere nice decor with a luxurious feeling both in common areas and in the room Very attentive staff Perfect for both business and pleasure 
30404,The Kensington Hotel, The rooms are very very small Too small that you can hear things from other rooms and people walking outside The lights weren t working and so someone had to come to fix the light It was kinda awkward , The place is really nice from the outside and its in a great location near the metro Nice boutique hotel Everything is nice except for the rooms 
30405,The Kensington Hotel, The room especially the bathroom was very small and a bit outdated for a 5 star accommodation I think with a bit of renovation it would be better value for money, The location is good The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful The hotel welcome is very thought through and unexpected really nice Even on the second floor facing the street the room was silent enough 
30406,The Kensington Hotel, My room was tiny The plug socket came out of the wall the entrance light didn t work and the room smelt of deep fried food in the evening , The public rooms were lovely and so were the breakfast staff 
30407,The Kensington Hotel, Nothing, This hotel is a perfect place to land in London We lived in London for a long time and still have a rented flat in the South Ken area This hotel offered us a perfect place to host old friends for tea or a cocktail and then progress for dinner The grand and well appointed lounges are perfect for quiet conversations but remain bright and airy The service is impeccable 
30408,The Kensington Hotel, The roaring fire at breakfast was very cosy and homely but felt a little warm , Very welcoming hotel lounge and town house area very comfortable and relaxing English style beautiful Lovely smelling toiletries and helpful friendly staff Location great for the Royal Albert Hall and South Kensington station

30419,The Kensington Hotel, The room itself was very small and disappointing other members of the party were allocated to far superior rooms however paid the same amount, The staff were exceptionally helpful and pleasant communal areas lounge etc very relaxing
30420,The Kensington Hotel, The lighting in the bedroom we could not have the bedside lamps on without the overhead downlighting although it was on a dimmer switch, Very friendly and helpful staff especially Olivier in the Restaurant and George the doorman

30424,The Kensington Hotel, The corridor was very noisy could hear everything that was outside the room , The suite was amazing the staff were brilliant and room service was fast The staff put extra touches making the stay special 
30425,The Kensington Hotel, My daughter Mrs Joanne Downes made the booking on our behalf but when arriving at the hotel on Friday 18 Dec the Duty Manager implied that she had insufficient funds to cover the cost of the room booked despite being shown documentary evidence of the fact that more than enough funds would be available on the day of her departure This caused a great deal of distress to my daughter and granddaughter who was reduced to tears It was agreed that my card would be used as surety on arrival on the Sunday Although I was happy to do so it showed a distinct lack of trust in the integrity of your customers Once the agreement had been made that should have been the end of the matter until my arrival but the same duty manager raised the subject with my daughter on the Saturday a totally unnecessary action causing further distress I understand that the Duty Manager was following hotel procedures on the Friday night but would suggest that your Duty Managers be given greater authority to use discretion in such circumstances There is absolutely no excuse for his behaviour on the Saturday and if he wished to pursue the subject further he could at least have found somewhere more private than the hotel lobby where any other guests could have overheard what was being said , The door staff and the concierge were extremely helpful particularly arranging taxis for us We were in the company of family which meant that there were times when 5 seater cabs were not enough they made all efforts to arrange multi seater cabs for us 
30426,The Kensington Hotel, Not really 5 star and pretty expensive Knocks on door too early and at other inconvenient times in evening, Nice stay in a great location Staff very friendly and helpful 
30427,The Kensington Hotel, Need to improve their restaurant Town House which is acceptable for breakfast with attentive manager but not for dinner the bar and lounge are good with ample sitting area for afternoon tea and evening drinks, Staff are friendly and hotel location is ideal for South Kensington museums Imperial College Christies etc
30428,The Kensington Hotel, Booking s and Kingston s info did not correspond We had booked a Supperior Doubleroom which turned out to be a beautiful but miniature box with no windows and a very small queen size bed no space for two We had to seriously pay up GBP 120 per night to have what we expected a Supperior Doubleroom which Kingston identified as studio , Beautiful Continental British Blend combining all advantages Perfect Living and Tearooms perfect furniture perfect decoration and perfect foods 
30429,The Kensington Hotel, Felt we were rushed out of restaraunt when we dined late there one evening This was so it could be prepared for breakfast Also Staff were under pressure on eve night shift due to under staffing room service bar reception etc , Top location and top class hotel Beautiful decor and facilities with friendly staff 
30430,The Kensington Hotel, The first room we had was very hot almost impossible to cool down and had a very noisy ceiling We could hear people walking around all night and hardly slept We requested a different room which was much better Both rooms were small We expected a little more for the money , The rooms were clean and had a good layout We had a great view The personell was friendly and the hotel is located quite close to many London highlights 
30431,The Kensington Hotel, Nothing, Hotel was great Room was very nice and bed comfy Special thanks to the staff who left a small tray of chocolates with a hand written birthday card for my girlfriend in the room 
30432,The Kensington Hotel, The only thing that we did not like is that we were unable to stay longer due to other commitments , Absolutely everything except the room was cold and we were unable to get it up to a satisfactory temperature This did not detract from a very satisfactory stay 
30433,The Kensington Hotel,No Negative, The staff were excellent a lovely atmosphere Changed our room due to noisy air conditioner outside window with no fuss and made effort to ensure quiet 
30434,The Kensington Hotel, Very small bathroom and hard to understand how the bidet is still not part of the standard facilities of a 5 stars hotel , Good location with easy access to transportation links and close to many attractions such as museums shops and restaurants The hotel also offers a lounge and breakfast area very welcoming and cured in style and details Very friendly staff 
30435,The Kensington Hotel, Not a great start to a night away with my mum Initially room very small and pokey room smelt of stale cigarette smoke Shown 2 other rooms but not much better Ended up in family room with disabled facilities so no bath after a long days shopping Martin the doorman did manage to sort out a complimentary bottle of champagne which was appreciated Dinner was slow due to the supervisor manager being pretty much on his own and was taking orders making cocktails serving food But food was great I am returning in 10 days time and will give them another chance as I have had previous good experiences at the hotel Fingers crossed they get it right ,No Positive
30436,The Kensington Hotel, My booking was very odd and smacked of a fraudulent scam this necessitated a lengthy phone call from Ireland but a promised email of confirmation never arrived If the bedroom was superior I would have hated to see an inferior one While well appointed it was much too small and looked out on roofs and air con units Also 9 for a large bottle of water and 10 for a Jameson whiskey is simply outrageous and your breakfast prices were such so as to have me not even consider dining at the hotel I feel its such a pity to sour a customers generally good impressions with gross overcharging Even by London standards your margins for such items are something in the region of 1500 and of course while not your fault all of this is compounded by the Euro being worth 0 70c making the bottle of water 13 the whiskey 14 30 etc etc Perhaps I m not the kind of customer you want at your hotel but I will be telling many who may be , All staff with whom I engaged were very pleasant and the hotel generally is nicely decorated the lounge is particularly nice and my superior room while tiny with a terrible view was nicely appointed
