481624,Grand Hotel et de Milan,No Negative, Authentic hotel located in a heart of Milano city Good hospitality tasty treats Located close by the most fancy shopping areas walking areas nice restaurants and coffee shops Quite suitable for a travellers with small children 
481625,Grand Hotel et de Milan, the breakfast area very small and very uncomfortable , This Hotel has a great location and the rooms are very nice and the staff very accommodating The Breakfast arrangement to sit very uncomfortable for a Hotel like this 
481626,Grand Hotel et de Milan, We got to pay for the breakfast I would have thought after paying a high rate the breakfast would be complimentary and included in the room rate , Service is excellent
481627,Grand Hotel et de Milan, Bad vallet parking my car was damaged Hotel claim Not their person the garage people handled the car WILL SEE how will be the follow up by the hotel The concierge promised they will make sure the garage owner will cover the damage I do hope so ,No Positive
481628,Grand Hotel et de Milan, While the breakfast buffet was extensive 35 euros is still too expensive , Excellent bedding Nice amenities in the room which many other properties are eliminating Very friendly and helpful staff all of whom spoke perfect English 
481629,Grand Hotel et de Milan,No Negative, The staff at Grand hotel et Milan are amazing They are kind friendly and so courteous We stayed at the superior suite which was beautifully decorated and impeccably maintained Would definitely return to this hotel if I were to come back to Milan The location is perfect The Duomo and Vittorio Emmanuele galleria are a short 5 min walk from the hotel 
481630,Grand Hotel et de Milan,No Negative, This is an excellent hotel Comfortable and quiet Our suite was spacious enough for a family with a teenager son Free and fast wi fi The breakfast is not included so one doesn t feel sorry when sleeping it over Many thanks to the wonderful staff friendly and professional 
481631,Grand Hotel et de Milan, Rooms at front of hotel suffer from traffic tram noise as the windows are not soundproofed , Understated charm and very comfortable Great location Beds are amazing Great coffee at breakfast Staff are super attentive but not intrusive 
481632,Grand Hotel et de Milan, Concierge desk unhelpful and unprepared They were uncertain about the validity of the UK EU driving licence as as a valid ID We had to debate the issue for far too long They were surprised by the fact we booked with booking com it felt booking com clients got treated as a lower category type of client we were given a room on the basement with limited access to light and view on the internal courtyard I was on my way out with luggage in my hand when i was offered an upgrade As my wife just had an operation i didnt fell like searching for another hotel For an euro800 overnight stay i was extremely disappointed The breakfast was served in a tiny place extremely uncomfortable next to a veranda overlooking a parking lot Only positive note the Don Carlos service Charming maitre ,No Positive
481633,Grand Hotel et de Milan, Nothing but I would have loved a little garden or open air space where to sit During the day it was 27 Dec and it would have been nice having the opportunity to enjoy that , Perfect location excellent style and very friendly and helpful staff 
481634,Grand Hotel et de Milan, The breakfast could have been a little bit more luxurious Now it was ok and everything was good but not really up to the general standard expected , We loved the location 300 meters from La Scala and the historical and traditional but extremely functional facilities of this leading hotel in Milan What an honor to stay at the same hotel where Giuseppe Verdi lived for 20 years 
481635,Grand Hotel et de Milan, Not many selection at Breakfast , Great Location Short walking distance from the main shopping street the Galleria and the Domo Great old style hotel Excellent Room Toilet and Lobby 
481636,Grand Hotel et de Milan, The only slightly negative aspect was our bed The mattress was not the same quality as everything else we experienced during our stay It would also have been great to offer spa services such as in room massage , Excellent service My wife and I chose to celebrate our wedding anniversary over a long weekend and were very pleasantly surprised as we had not experienced this level of service in Western Europe for quite some time We would even compare their level of perfectionism to one our favourite hotels in St Barth s The front desk staff were not only attentive but seemed to anticipate our needs One of the concierge Massimo was exceptional in his choices of restaurants for us from perfectly authentic Northern Italian gastronomy to exceptional fresh fish The other obvious luxury was of course the prime location so close to everything yet far away enough to avoid noise and concentration of tourists We had a fantastic stay and will look forward to returning to Grand Hotel et de Milano 
481637,Grand Hotel et de Milan, For this kind of room rate and given the high cost of living in Milan the room should have been with breakfast , Staff are very friendly Hotel rooms gives you an excellent ambience for being in Milan Very clean and luxuriously furnished Excellent central location 
481638,Grand Hotel et de Milan, My room which was on the third floor was a little noisy as there were roadworks outside at night , The staff throughout the Hotel were excellent Friendly but always professional The location is first class 
481639,Grand Hotel et de Milan, We like to sleep in a cool room The temperature controls didn t work consistently , The service is superb The front desk staff welcoming and able to help with any request The room decor had old world charm with modern amenities Room and bathroom spotless And very comfortable When we return to Milan we ll stay at the Grand 
481640,Grand Hotel et de Milan,No Negative, the location could not be better the staff and service was great also Linens towels everything I liked the detail of having apples in the reception desk for us to have one The only thing was that the room was a little small but it was compensated with all the rest I m looking forward to return to the hotel on another trip to Milan 
481641,Grand Hotel et de Milan,No Negative, Our stay couldn t have been better We were upgraded to a large suite looking out over the square and the staff were incredibly helpful and personable 
481642,Grand Hotel et de Milan, No view Narrow hallways with fire extinguishers all down the halls Does not give you a feeling of confidence , The hotel is situated in the center of the shopping district and a short distance from the Duomo The sheets and pillows are wonderful Other than that this is an old facility that has been refurbished The bathrooms are a good size with a double sink We had booked a Junior Suite ad were upgraded to a small suite The staff is very nice and helpful The staff in the bar Lou Gehrig were exceptionall nice 
481643,Grand Hotel et de Milan, tired simply old not antique forniture in room arranged without taste or sense of proportion small room packed with it, friendly staff good location
481644,Grand Hotel et de Milan, The concierge desk and front desk were not very well informed on things in the area The hotel still has these clunky old outdated keys They could do a lot more with advertising their history and pictures of the apartments that once housed Verdi and maria callas It s nice but short of what I consider luxurious , Location was great The bar restaurant staff were very accommodating after we came back late from an opera performance 
481645,Grand Hotel et de Milan, Don t remember anything short of my expectation , Great room good food nice bathroom and amenities Services were very personal intimate and professional A truly great hotel which Mr Juseppe Verdi should have loved too My best compliments
