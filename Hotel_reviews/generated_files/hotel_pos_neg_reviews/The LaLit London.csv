78918,The LaLit London, The hotel is newly opened The building is nice The location is good They are aiming for a 5 experience but were let down by their general staff who whilst friendly still have no idea what they are doing really , Lovely building Good rooms Stylish Very professional senior staff management 
78919,The LaLit London, The hotel claim they have parking but when you arrive it s a ten minute walk away which was very stressful after A 11 hour flight from Johannesburg then a drive from heathrow they should make this clear also they wanted to keep 79 off my credit card for a week for no reason at all when I complained they put it back in my account straight away this was all so very stressful when checking out if they hadn t have done this they would have got top marks as a stay , Staff were so lovely nothing was to much trouble it was lovely and quite we got a great nights sleep having a heated toilet seat was pure luxury Complementary crisps drinks chocolate biscuits was such a nice touch the room was very clean We had trouble with our tv but they came and fixed it while we were out at dinner would stay here next time when I m in London 
78920,The LaLit London, Not too happy with being on the groundfloor but that is just my preference , The Indian food variety and excellent service Very impressed with the hall where the restaurant was located the decor the beautiful blue glass chandeliers etc and then the Master s room where you could sit and enjoy a drink just perfect and private 
78921,The LaLit London, Absolutely nothing , We stayed at the LaLit for the night of our wedding party and the staff made us feel so so special They really went out of their way to provide us with exceptional service 
78922,The LaLit London, The breakfast buffet had very little choice for what was charged There was no compromise on the quality of the food though This is a boutique hotel and is very very quiet inside There is no common lounge area but has a newness factor to it as it has been recently opened , Rooms and bathrooms were very clean as it is a new hotel which is less than 6 months old Location was also excellent It was very near to good eating places bus stops and underground station 
78923,The LaLit London, We interacted with the concierge on several occasions and I think he could have been more knowledgeable All staff are pleasant and courteous but they are still getting their feet under them as the hotel has only been open since last February so they are still a bit green Food choices in the hotel are limited so if you don t like Indian food your selections will be limited I have to say though my family are big fans of Indian cuisine and they loved the restaurant in the hotel Also the bar is amazing and there is also a lovely outdoor terrace There was very little we did not like about the hotel We will be back , The hotel is gorgeous It is in a former school building and the designers of the hotel have scrupulously maintained the character of the original building while transforming it into a top notch hotel You cannot ask for a better location close to transit and Tower Bridge Plenty of dining options close by Staff are professional and pleasant Our room was spacious and comfortable 
78924,The LaLit London, Nothing, Every staff member approaches you with kindness Free minibar and the quality complimentary snacks are very appreciated The building which was renovated from an old boarding school was simply amazing All through the hotel the design theme is very consistent Feeling a bit like in a Harry Potter film The gym is small but very well maintained 
78925,The LaLit London,No Negative, clean climatically cool and close to our intended destinations and a truly pleasant change from the usual brand offerings A glass of iced water and comfortable chairs for check in luggage whisked away to the very comfortable room We didn t sample the cuisine on this occasion but will certainly return when needing to stay in the area Oh and we has a glimpse of the river and across to the square mile which was a bonus 
78926,The LaLit London,No Negative, I really liked the entire school theme and the personal attention that you receive by the friendly staff Great restaurant serving nice Indian dishes 
78927,The LaLit London, Background music in the bar at times become a distraction , Staff were very welcoming and couldn t have been more helpful right down to an extra umbrella for the awful weather
78928,The LaLit London,No Negative, From start to finish the staff were excellent even going as far as making my partner a cake for her 40th while the facilities were excellent with a stunning dining room Would recommend to anyone the location was very good too 
78929,The LaLit London,No Negative, Very unique property extremely friendly and professional staffs If it was closer to central central London it would be my residance during all my trips to London 
78930,The LaLit London,No Negative, Beautifully decorated room in a modern hotel with lovely design Very comfortable with all amenities required The staff were very accommodating and couldn t do enough for us They took the time to make the first night of our honeymoon extra special Would definitely recommend this hotel for location and experience 
78931,The LaLit London, The toilets are the best but the heated seats really are a bit to warm , The staff were absolutely amazing so polite and very friendly this hotel should do really well if it keeps the standard up And by far the best price for a London hotel
78932,The LaLit London, Few doors made lot of noise closing down in the hall reaching upto the room , Ultra modern facilities Spacious rooms Indian snacks Classic looks they have maintained
78933,The LaLit London, We ordered breakfast in bed which was good but the order wasn t correct ie ordered 2 full English breakfast without Black pudding and one without eggs We received 2 full English with eggs and black pudding We also asked for Brown sauce to be brought with the meals which did not arrive so we called down to get this along with butter for the toast When the waiter came back up he brought brown sauce and mayo which was slightly annoying as the breakfast with service charge came to 46 , The accommodation standard was fantastic very warm welcome upon arrival 
78934,The LaLit London, Nothing we could find not one fault at this hotel although we were made to feel really special on our anniversary so we weren t looking for faults really , The property is a stone s throw from Tower Bridge on the south side of the Thames The hotel is relatively new it was an old grammar school and the feel and ambience of the old building has been retained and it works beautifully The room we had a superior room was excellent with a free minbar superbly comfortable bed and in room amenities that befit a 5 star hotel A nice touch there is an internet enabled mobile phone in the room for you to use Breakfast was fantastic with a choice of continental traditional English or indian breakfast The staff made us feel at home were very helpful and attentive without being in your face 
78935,The LaLit London, The airconditioning did not seem to be working no matter how much I lowered the temparture and the windows could not open for fresh air it was bank holiday weekend and very humid and warm The complementary minibar fair use was not restocked as promised I only used one small bottle of sparkling water and I had to buy my I own water I stayed in room 120 but it was very noisy upstairs not sure what was going on but wooden floors and shoes not good idea and from the nearby bar restaurant as well as exit doors slamming The shower door leaked water all over the bathroom There was no complementary nespresso despite the machine standing there Unclear charging policy of my credit card Booking com placed authorization on my card and upon arrival so did the Hotel which ended up almost 1000 in authorization on my card but no idea what I have been charged with as TV view my bill wasn t clear and not receipt was received Lastly I stayed for two nights and while staff was friendly each time I came back from town and entered the front door I was asked can we help you Word of advise especially for US customers who are not white this can be taken the wrong way as in are you staying in our hotel Nice new hotel but clearly lacking in many areas and likely would not return , Great location near tower bridge very clean and very friendly staff who allowed me to check in early 
78936,The LaLit London, Unfortunately the spa facilities were not open on Sunday when we hoped to use them , My wife and I were staying as we had a wedding to attend nearby The property was a stones throw from Tower Bridge The hotel building was stunning to look at and the interiors extremely high quality and well executed The bed was really comfy and the bathroom was really nice It had ones of those hi tech Japanese toilets which was an experience We loved it 
78937,The LaLit London, Nothing , Classy hotel just excellent courteous service at a perfect location right by Tower Bridge and less than 10 minutes walk from London Bridge station The staff couldn t do enough for you polite but never pushy Perfect experience and a great balance between cost and luxury You will not be disappointed booking here 
78938,The LaLit London, Small bed very inefficient staff breakfast not 5 Maybe because the hotel was only open since March Service on terrace inadequate Poor English of all staff we have seen Dirty towels we put on the bathroom floor were hung back Tried to contact reception by telephone from the room had to try 11 times Great potential but i am not goingback , location design size of the room quality of the bed 
78939,The LaLit London, WIFI IS FREE FROM 10MB THEREAFTER IS PAID LACK OF SUFFICIENT STAFF AT CHECKIN AND THROUGHOUT THE STAY REPEATED WAITED FOR A STAFF MEMBER TO SHOW UP NAMASTE GREETING FELT INAUTHENTIC, COMFORTABLE BEDS GOOD SHOWERS QUIET ROOMS COSY BAR 
78940,The LaLit London, Beeakfast is quite limited Same problem with shower gel as in many other hotels too small for one normal body Why shower gel has the same size as shampoo as we need much less liquid for washing hair , Impressive hotel with an amazing dining room which you should absolutely see one day Rooms very comfortable and calm offering all the luxury you need Next to Tower an London bridges abd to the very animated thames riverside

78943,The LaLit London, Room could have been bigger although we realized it would be smaller than other suites in this hotel but still but it is more so about the bed rather than the room as I am almost 6 5 and it was a bit hard , Great staff excellent location nice in hotel restaurants and amenities Room was equipped top notch 
78944,The LaLit London,No Negative, Absolutely stunning property in a very attractive location I was celebrating the birthday of my girlfriend and the staff really made our stay a memorable one We got upgraded to one the suites which was beautifully decorated with a great personal touch I have stayed at several 5 star hotels in London but must say that this hotel is my personal favourite so far The staff who were very friendly and helpful looked after us during the entire stay The bar is amazing serving Indian and Nepali beers you won t usually try elsewhere Most unique about this hotel is the building itself Previously a school building the rooms and restaurant are very unique with high ceilings and chic design Really enjoyed our stay and I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to experience Indian hospitality at its finest
