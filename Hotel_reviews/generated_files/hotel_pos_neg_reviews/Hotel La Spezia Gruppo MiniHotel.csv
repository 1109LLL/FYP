478361,Hotel La Spezia Gruppo MiniHotel, Away from main attractions Finding a good restaurant in that area was difficult , The bed was comfortable Breakfast was good Staff was courteous and helpful 
478362,Hotel La Spezia Gruppo MiniHotel, Nothing it was a pleasant experience, the hotel is modern and clean I was well aware of the location as I had a business meeting in the same area It was a very pleasant staying The room was modern and clean the wifi worked perfectly and the breakfast was good and abundant I am very happy with my booking and I ll go back The parking lot is easy to reach and the staff helpful 
478363,Hotel La Spezia Gruppo MiniHotel,No Negative, The location is very good easy to get to the highway close to the metro station and walking distance to Navigli touristic area Room was very comfortable and clean and staff polite and willingness 
478364,Hotel La Spezia Gruppo MiniHotel, It s quite far from the city center and the way to the underground for pedestrians is a bit scary I think a lower price would have been more fair , Clean and tidy Small rooms but with everything in place Continental breakfast nothing special but OK 
478365,Hotel La Spezia Gruppo MiniHotel, If went to breakfast at 09 30 limited selection of options as not restocked up very well, Excellent customer service and helpfull staff after issue with booking resolved professionally and without any fuss 
478366,Hotel La Spezia Gruppo MiniHotel, It is outside the city center and the metro is not super close about 600m still well within walking distance but it still require 7 8 minutes to get there , Good business hotel no frills but all you need for a comfortable stay Car parking is very convenient 
478367,Hotel La Spezia Gruppo MiniHotel, The hotel is far too expensive for the services they offered There was no help with heavy luggage The room was fitted with one large bed and a sofa bed whilst I had booked a triple room Room decoration looked spartan for a 4 star hotel Situated by a main road noise traffic is perceptible day and night Nothing to see outside the hotel as the neighborhood is popular so you have to keep the windows shaded The closest metro station is at 10 minutes walking distance Parking lot offers small parking places so you cannot open doors decently if two cars are parked adjacently Staff seemed more embarrassed when seeing us than welcoming Breakfast was poor fresh juice would be most welcomed ,No Positive
