160150,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, The receptionist lady charged me twice with my credit card and one is still on provision I am trying to contact with them and gave them to cancel it with the relevant provision number but they are as lazy as elephant They don t even bother to respond my e mails They are unskillful about even the swaping card Act like I will get loose before paying thus forced me for that In addition to that they didn t have any adapter for european plug to the UK They say every room has it one but some might stole the one should be in my room Didn t find any for me The worst hotel experience I had in the UK ever They are thief ,No Positive

160152,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Room interior and corridors are dated good be freshened up Bathroom was however although small excellent and renovated Price is even for an expensive city as London too high for the small room you get for it You mainly pay for the location and the breakfast and service staff , Staff very good and attentive Breakfast very good and elaborate 
160153,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, The room was very small and the bed was definitely not a usual double bed size It was very small , The breakfast was great and the room was clean The staff was very nice Our stay didn t start out very well Our room wasn t ready when we arrived at 3 pm because the were overbooked we were told We had to wait in the restaurant until 5 pm They didn t offer us any compensation while we waited We were getting really nervous because we had tickets to concert and had planned to leave from the hotel at 5 pm When we saw the room we were also a little disapointed We have stayed many times at Radisson and always liked it but this room was very small and tight The bed was not even queen size and that bothered us a little bit during the whole weekend But everything else was good The location is perfect the staff was willing to help with everything and the breakfast was good 
160154,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, The view room711 from our room was straight into Debenhams staff quarters , Loved the excellent location as we were going to the American embassy early the next morning Location was important for this visit and it didn t disappoint 
160155,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, The bathroom could have been bigger , Fantastic breakfast with a rich selection of food and beverages served in a beautiful breakfast restaurant Great location next to Oxford str and friendly staff Comfortable bed and soft large towels 
160156,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, The lifts are tiny It was an absolute chore getting my wheelchair in and out of them and I ended up damaging my chair due to the size of the lifts in the end , Very central location fantastic for access to central London for work
160157,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, 1 I think you need to give a more accurate description of your location on your website While you may officially be at 350 Oxford St your entrance is on another street and is not easy to see from Oxford Street It s fine for those taking a taxi but if you come by tube it is not I spent a 1 2 hour walking up and down Oxford Street looking for the hotel 2 Elevator dirty same dirt over a 48 hour period Spilled liquid dried and with dirt attached 3 Key cards faulty had to go back downstairs 4 times because they wouldn t open the room door 4 Shower floor very slippery so should have a rubber mat I felt unsafe using the shower especially since I am older and have arthritis Provide mats , Location staff and breakfast were good 
160158,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, The only downside of the property is the lack of a lounge Waiting for a cab or transport after checkout means sitting in the bar area ok but not the most comfortable for a four star hotel However this is outweighed by its location , Reception staff were excellent It was a real welcome matched by the friendliness of all the staff we met Despite its location opposite Debenhams and a minute from Oxford St we had a very comfortable and quiet room 
160159,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Very Disappointed with the breakfast certainly not as I was expecting and not as advertised in your statement even the staff had to apologise for it and would like to offer us a complimentary one next time we stay at any Radisson hotel can booking com help in this regard and take some responsibility for this, Condition good rooms small but well presented staff are welcoming the disappointment was the breakfast little things missing no loose sugar and side plates and menu was not good we stayed because of the breakfast it was not as sated this made the hotel not value for money when it was included in the price compensation for this would be helpful can booking com do anything in this regard the hotel as offered a complimentary one at any of these hotels
160160,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire,No Negative, I am blown away by your housekeeping department Beatrice head housekeeper was amazing as I had left clothing in a drawer and a necklace in the safe she located them in the lost and found dept a few days after my departure and I got everything back I must also thank the housekeeper who gave the articles in such honesty receptionists and concierge were also fabulous 
160161,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, The first room we were given 514 was very tiny unlike the photo in the internet and noisy close to Oxford street I recommend that this information will be clearly indicated in the hotel s home page Booking web page to avoid unnecessary frustration, I was very impressed by the management s approach to address an issue we were facing the room was very noisy very close to Oxford street and tiny I have travelled with my pregnant daughter and we were about to book an alternate hotel However the shift manager during 25 5 17 evening Alex if I am not mistaken has offered us an alternate room in another part of the hotel and made any effort to ensure it was convenient for our needs Eventually we have decided to stay in this hotel until the end of our vacation I was also very impressed by the staff s friendly approach and by the breakfast menu 
160162,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, The overall service was bad Lost sunglasses when room was left for cleaning and the staff front desk did not take the compaint seriuously Almost lost my package which was sent to hotel because the staff did not deliver it right away to my room nor inform me to pick it up Asked my room to be changed to without breakfast but they said it could only be done by booking com In fact I ve tried to put this inquiry right after my booking but booking com responsed was the hotel is already notified It seemed that the hotel preferred the booking made directly through their site They tried helping by calling booking com but booking com said it could not be done because i m arrived already Gosh The breakfast itself was not satisfying Not so many option for halal food even if all of the foods were halal they didn t look compelling , Free wifi and free restaurant vouchers

160187,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Only thing I would say is that due to location you have to expect some noise during the night which did keep us awake a bit , Great room and bathroom free upgrade to suite Staff very friendly and attentive Breakfast good as was food in bar Food reasonably priced Excellent location for London shopping 
160188,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Pillows were hard but can t fault anything else , The staff are amazing Ana checked us in and couldn t do enough for us Perfect location When we are in London this hotel will always be our first choice Delicious breakfast 
160189,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Being very close to Oxford Street sometimes I hear a very loud noise by some music bands which makes it really disturbing , I liked the variety of the breakfast especially the fruits and the croissants 
160190,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Breakfast was very good however it was the same dishes all days Also the lobby area was very small and no sitting area , Staff hospitality and location of the hotel were excellent It was in the center of oxford street Staff smile and lovely attitude by all 
160191,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Your ad photo of the standard twin bed room showed the room is big so i booked it When i arrived the fron desk representative told me the room will be too small for us and it was not what shown in the ad and adviced me to upgrade to a different room which i did so your ad was misleading One point i want to add The rooms need more outlets specifically between the beds to charge phones ,No Positive
160192,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Breakfast time a bit stressful too busy quite a wait Room quite small carpet looked old There seemed to be a problem with our booking on arrival and despite I called to say we were arriving in the morning hours due to a delayed flight the night staff seemed to be unaware which created an awkward situation It was resolved quickly though , Very clean room special thanks to the housekeeping team comfortable bed Quiet we had a good sleep Excellent location Quick check out 
160193,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, NOTHING EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT , LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION the best hotel in Oxford st 1 min away from Bond tube station I was pregnant when i visited so it was important for me to find a hotel with a great location and it was The moment we got there everyone were super nice we got upgraded to bussiness for our anniversary without any extra charge Everything in the hotel was perfect This is my 9th time visiting London and it was the best hotel i ever stayed in Thank you so much everyone we will definitley come back Breakfast We didn t include breakfast so we can t say anything about that

160196,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, No gym facilities lobby is too small , Best Location directly to Oxford street Bond station is few steps from the hotel all shops restaurants are close to the hotel I love the idea of the apples they put at the reception in the morning and candies in the afternoon Staff are very friendly and helpful 
160197,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire,No Negative, 10 out of 10 for location rooms are tiny but nice bathroom could have been cleaner staff were very nice There was a building site right outside our window which started at 8am on the Saturday morning I tried to ring reception to complain but the phone was broken and we were awake anyway at that stage I complained when we left and they gave us a complimentary lunch which was fab Overall a nice hotel but you are really paying for location If I was to go again I would stay in a nicer hotel further out near to an underground train 
160198,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, We would have liked to have dinner inside of the hotel but there is no restaurant, We stayed 3 days with my mother it was our second time in the hotel and we LOVED the location in central London the hotel is very close to the best oxford street s shops The staff is welcoming and always ready to help us The breakfast is delicious Every morning we were very welcomed 
160199,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Place needs an upgrade Does not feel like a top end hotel Place is next to a building site and therefore noisy Breakfast is at best chaotic, Place is close to the shops 
160200,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Huge pillows my neck hurt all night On the first morning there was no breakfast table available for 6 although we had booked breakfast in advance We had 3 tables of 2 very complicated with our 4 kids The bathrooms are much too small only one person can fit inside Decoration of room is a bit old it should be refreshened carpet curtains shower , Excellent breakfast Nice and comfortable beds Excellent location
160201,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, The hotel is pretty old and need to be renovated Not very clean I ve found shopping bag from previous guests behind the sofa and some hair in the bathroom Room is not soundproof I ve heard all noises from the corridor during the night and that was annoying Price is too expensive about EUR 350 for single room per night , Good location close to the shopping street Nice and helpful staff 
160202,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Hotel didn t offer even a slice of cake on Christmas morning breakfast It would have been a good gesture during festive time to put an extra effort for guests staying with you on Christmas No staff made an effort to greet Merry Christmas it looked like they were just rushing to do their job The bathroom was very small congested Creaky room floor though carpeted Wardrobe door constantly hitting the fridge which was popping out each time No hair dryer in the bathroom, Good location most staff were friendly 
160203,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Not made aware that we were entitled to 15 a night Told our room was the last available not given the option of a larger room Delux, The locality couldn t have been nearer Oxford Street excellent Was on the 8th floor not disturbed by noise Lovely and warm 
160204,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, The fact they they left me without money for my trip I have a 700 limit on my visa and upon the check in they blocked 400 of them as a precaution for any room service At checkout on Saturday Christmas eve I was told that the money will be transferred back in 2 days time because it s the weekend forgetting 26th is a bank holiday too So now I m back at home for Christmas with no money at all , I liked the location
160205,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, We booked a bussiness room it was small The hotel is not kids friendly Its very tight the escalator could not fet a stroller The breakfast lakced the verity Its not worth the payment at all The staff doesnt know how to smill or either help a customer ineed I HATE IT the place and could never ever go back to there ,No Positive
160206,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Can honestly not think if a single thing this time Maybe The meals in the bar can be a bit smaller , Evething was absolutely perfect and the staff were amazing they were friendly and helpful in every possible way Well done Radisson It was my third Christmas stay in Radisson and I could never swop it for a cheaper hotel 
160207,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Breakfast chaotic cold eggs and beans rubbish toaster, They made a very special fuss of my mum as she was 80 and all the team at the front of house were wonderful
160208,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, when we arrived at 4 30 pm our room was not ready and altough we had had a couple of mail exchange about our room before because we had a child with us even after waiting for the room to be cleaned they could give us really a bad room Although it was a king deluxe room But the staff s approach was really helpful and apologatic and to compansate this they transferred us to a suite next they and we had complimentary breakfast suite room was big for london standarts and comfortable but there were some technical problems Blinking lamps dripping sink broken hairdryer etc after experiencing the room we stayed first night we decided that in case we go to london again we d stay in this hotel only if we can afford the suite room which is quite expensive , Hotel s location was really convenient Oxford street is full of shops and subway station and bus stops are just few steps away from the hotel Staff was always very kind and warm We experienced some problems at hotel but their approach was what make the experience better anyway Breakfast was good 
160209,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, rooms a little less spaceous and have not much space cupboard drawers to keep things, Excellent staff willing to help out if d way wonderful location
160210,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Considering I had booked a Deluxe Room for one night for 280 in aid of my Partner s birthday I at least expected cleanliness I couldn t have been more wrong and we were so disappointed The first thing that we noticed when we walked in was a giant dirty stain that looked like washed blood on the large cushion on the bed The bathroom was not clean and the shower had someone elses hair in it Disgusting We had a dinner reservation so I didn t have time to complain about the state of the bathroom at the time I just had to get ready given the importance of the occasssion However I was so dispointed My Partner did however go to reception and made a complaint to them with the receptionist advising that they would look in to the matter And it was his birthday I then mentioned the issues and my disappointment myself when I came downstairs to reception on our way out again I was offered an apology and advised that someone would look in to it for us There was literally no concierge service which for a hotel like this in the location the hotel is based is ridiculous We had to walk in the pouring rain in evening dress to the high end restaurant that we had a reservation for There was only one member of staff to be found on reception and they couldn t source a cab for us at all Central London When we came to check out the following day I was waiting for someone to acknowledge the issues that we had raised the previous evening which had really put such a negative edge on our stay Apart from anything else do you think I could sleep well wondering if the sheets and pillows were as dirty as everything else However absolutely nothing was mentioned not even an apology I was too angry to say anything after I was even charged for the two drinks we had had and left thinking that there is no way that I would be staying there again Absolute disgrace for a Radisson , The breakfast and location was good
160211,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, My partner found the bed too firm for him and the room was quite hot at night even though we had the heating on 18 degrees Also the fan in the bathroom was quite noisy room 804 however overall I would stay here again , The location of this hotel is fantastic right on Oxford Street next to Debenhams We were away for my birthday and on arrival we had a gorgeous chocolate cake and a bottle of chardonay along with a plate of chocolate dipped strawberries and a balloon as we arrived late it was a lovely surprise The room had everything that we needed and was very clean All the staff we had contact with were very helpful and polite The breakfast was lovely and the staff there were also very helpful and accommodating 
160212,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Nothing, Perfectly positioned hotel for shopping on Oxford Street We got an upgrade on our room and everything about the hotel and the room were just fantastic and couldn t have asked for more Great breakfast selection and taste 
160213,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, We left an ipad in the hotel which they kindly informed us about We informed them we would return at a certain time while on a break from our conference only to have to wait 20 mins Any other time it would of not been a problem but we then ended up dashing however this is a minor gripe and more our fault than theirs So 9 8 out of 10 Perfect , We got a free upgrade which is always nice Breakfast was lovely staff who checked in really fantastic
160214,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, The room was not as I was expecting I think that the hotel needs a renovation with brighter colors inside the rooms and more confortable beds , The breakfast and the location
160215,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Mini bar kettle etc was in the corner of wardrobe next to the bedside table which made access difficult , Quality choice of breakfast was excellent Location is fantastic Most of the staff were helpful friendly but one lady at breakfast looked miserable fed up 
160216,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, I liked everything Nothing to complain about, Room was a lot bigger than expected Amazing staff and location already looking to book to stay next month
160217,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, The room although very clean could do with some upgrading such as new carpets , Unbeatable location where else can you witness the Christmas adorned Oxford Street yet not get swamped by the masses of shoppers The friendliness of the staff deserves to be noted too 
160218,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, As above, Being from South Africa I m used to the rooms being quite big and this one was a bit small Being a business traveler I would also like CNN ON TV Otherwise all was great
160219,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Dirty glass in my room with leftover wine and lipstick Cleaning should be better They do not tidy up your stuff Like cosmetics in the bathroom if it islaying all over you will find them exaclty in this position Furniture is very old ,No Positive
160220,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, There is no sitting area not unless you consider the restaurant , This is our favorite hotel for a shopping weekend in London The location of the hotel is in the middle of all the shopping which is great for dropping of your bags and then continue on 
160221,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, My bedroom was a little on the cold side and unfortunately as I don t sleep well anywhere the air conditioning was a bit noisy Housekeeping brought me another duvet and I was toastie the second night , The position of this hotel for shopping is second to none and considering its position amazingly quiet The staff are friendly and helpful and I love the flavoured water and sweets 
160222,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Poorly designed rooms with very small bed shower with only shower head and toilet with no toilet brush The bed and room was definitely not designed for 2 people as there is a bed of 1 40 length and the reading lights light up half the whole bed I am staying in room 408 If one of the 2 guests decides to read a book both should better put on a pair of good sunglasses If a lady decides to use the shower she better be prepared to rinse her hair as there is only a fixed shower head If she also decides to wash her private sector she better start somersaults against the wall to get exposure The lack of toilet brush is a strong default as well The hotel itself is clean and the stuff friendly , Great location terrible hotel 
160223,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, More staff and a larger facility for breakfast , Breakfast room to small for size of hotel Shortage of waiters to clean the tables food containers empty 
160224,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, The sound proofing offered by the room door was non existent and a large gap between the door and the floor allowed light to fill the room from the hallway at night We used the bathmat to seal the light out and wore earplugs to drown out the hallway noise Not sure if this issue affects all rooms but the doors in our room could certainly stand to be addressed , I cannot praise the staff more On several occasions over a 4 night stay we had staff go out of their way to help us including finding us a last minute Afternoon Tea reservation and arranging for a surprise free dessert at the restaurant to allowing me into the breakfast room 30 minutes early on the Saturday for some Muesli and Coffee to allow me to eat before an early group bike ride the staff were excellent Breakfast was standard fare and was hot and fresh Eggs made to order was a nice option other than just offering scrambled eggs like some places Location was excellent directly across from the Bond Street Underground and with excellent bus service right out front All the tourist hotspots Soho Piccadilly Hyde Park etc reachable within minutes 
160225,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, the furniture was bad quality the reception rooms hallway and left are too small , the best thing about the hotel is the location as well as the breakfast was very good also the bed was so comfortable 
160226,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Room and toilet on the smaller size but very clean upgraded and practical elevator capacity low as one of two out of order , Perfect location excellent breakfast complimentary water bottle per day surprisingly quiet room given traffic at Oxford street wifi worked without disruptions in the whole building
160227,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Lack of power points in the bedroom kettle hair dryer stuck in a drawer which makes their use quite difficult , Wonderful attentive staff especially Jorge Alonso Nelson They made our stay just perfect are really the stars of this hotel Fabulous location great breakfast 
160228,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, We had booked a bus to pick us up at the airport which did not show up On arrival some of the rooms given to us were not the category we had requested We were informed that when booking via booking com the category of the rooms is not guaranteed There is no reception area where you can sit and wait , The location is very central and convenient The staff except for one person were very nice and tried to help and gave us better rooms after two days and helped us in a very friendly way make reservations at several events The breakfast was very good 
160229,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, There were problems lights not working room service was cold and some hair around the sink This was all dealt with very quickly and a bottle of prosseco thrown in but its always a shame that this happened in the first place , The location was excellent staff very friendly on the whole and anything that was an issue they sought to quickly deal with Breakfast was effortless and had everything you could want a shame the croissants were not hot but then there are limits to what can be done in a relatively small space for a hotel 
160230,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, The scrambled eggs were soggy The room serrvice and housekeeping staff were very helpful and freindly However that did not apply to the reception staff When I asked to keep my luggage at the concierge while doing a short 2 day trip north of London the hotel receptionist said How do I know you are not a terrorist I was offended and actually regretted my whole stay There are 1 6 billion Muslims living peacefully in the world Educate your staff please , The rooms were clean and comfortable 
160231,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Room too small More plug points pls There s only 2 in this room and at same location , Clean room comfy beddings Requested for a late checkout as flight at night Very please as i was granted the request 
160232,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, the elevators took forever to come housekeeping weren t really cleaning they just changed sheets and towels but cleaning NO my toilet was not cleaned even every other day they just put TP shampoo and stuff but didn t clean, the staff is so hospitable 0
160233,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire,No Negative, Good morning and evening the hotel one of the best hotels that you have housing where the best reception staff and special employee or director named Carla was cooperating with me in everything and another employee named David and I would recommend it to housing
160234,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, Room is too small all though I booked a deluxe room with space of 21 I did not like the lobby You can say there is no lobby only front desk I didn t like the area in front of the hotel could be arranged for better looking , Located on Oxford Street obove Disney store 
160235,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, When we arrived the hotel staff told us that the hotel is over booked and they will send us to another hotel for one night We were disappointed with this as we booked this hotel 3 months prior our trip We argued with them and told them we will not go to another hotel and they had find rooms in this hotel , The staff were very friendly and enthusiastic to book for us afternoon tea and theatre
160236,Radisson Blu Edwardian Berkshire, I want the deco of the room the carpets sply to be done up The hotel is in such an excellent location and the staff is so excellent I think the room deserves this rejig , The Staff was excellent and friendly They were very helpful loved their eagerness to help the guests
