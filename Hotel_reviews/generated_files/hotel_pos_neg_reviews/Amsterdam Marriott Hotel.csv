461157,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Poor service at the restaurant and confusing charging of wifi, Location was awesome Cleaning crew did a great job Front Desk staff were very friendly and helpful
461158,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The bikies You have to be careful They think the bikies are the king on the street not just pedestrian has to give away to them even the cars has to give away to them and also there s path way for bikies but they still ride the bikes wherever they want so annoying, The location close to everywhere I always walk from the hotel to everywhere and the map was easy to read 
461159,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Cleaning service only showed up once A bit expensive for what it was , Room was spacious and the bed quite comfortable Hotel has an amazing location 
461160,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Not a friendly reception staff Normal Queen Size bed No free wifi and breakfast included at room even i pay 350 per night Bad Water pleasure for the shower head Not reach in 5 start hotel standard , Location near to the shopping street Quick easy check out system 
461161,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The lifts were really annoying they weren t registering our cards that s well and caused us to miss our level quite a few times , The bed was amazing and the food was lovely The staff are very helpful and friendly 
461162,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, you should close down this hotel thieves they are 55 Euro for one day parking they charged extra and they did not inform us in advance and booking com was not clear either , Nothing except location
461163,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, No pool, Tim the concierge was excellent Provided fantastic restaurant recommendations Nothing was too much trouble and he remembered my name which was a lovely touch Great service 
461164,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Very disappointed that breakfast not included in price especially for a family as it is an additional cost on top of cost of stay Would recommend that breakfast should be included in price There is tea coffee making facilities in the room however there is an additional charge should you wish to avail of same this at least would be included in most other hotels , Beds were very comfy and room adequate for family of four Room clean staff friendly helpful Relaxed atmosphere and nice ambience in hotel 
461165,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Crowded like a refugee camp and dusty like a moon crater Overall it feels like a 3 surely not 5 Dull breakfast Super tiny rooms with bleak design I could understand this size provided hotel was on the Dam Square But here My conclusion is never to come back to this place irritating in every aspect , One thing on the upside you still could get a free umbrella here 
461166,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Wifi in the rooms included in the price would complete the package for this hotel to be rated as 5 5, The location was excellent and the staff were very friendly The rooms were very clean and a good size for a family of four 
461167,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The check in Too long of a wait Staff didn t follow through the requests Didn t like the room had to be changed Bathroom didn t have have a magnifying mirror lighting was bad Dirty glasses not picked up Elevator cards didn t work most of the time , Location Adequate breakfast Complimentary executive lounge by Cynthia the receptionist 
461168,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Construction outside Not close to city centre , Friendly staff We booked Staxi to come to airport 25 euro for 6 bags snd 4 people Very reliable and reasonable Book online 
461169,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Service wasn t great with two young kids we were in the family room which ended up being much smaller than it looks in the photos Staff service levels and professionalism were also not great On the plus side the location is excellent,No Positive
461170,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Since it was a Saturday night it was very expensive , The location was brilliant for our purposes and also very close to the Vondelpark for morning walks close to canal boat trips if you want them and very near the Rijksmuseum There are always roads and pavements being repaired in Amsterdam but this wasn t a problem Our room was overlooking the courtyard with trees and was nice and quiet 
461171,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Couldn t get into the room until 2 30 pm on day of arrival from USA I know they are not obligated to get us in in early but it has happened in other hotels, room comfortable clean
461172,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The images of my room and the pictures had nothing in common When I asked to change the room because it did not even have a bath tub I was given the same type but with a bath tub The cleaning did not happen at all When I tried to point that out all I got was Sorry for that we will pay attention to your room well thanks but I already was leaving the next day The photos of the dust and dirt are attached The sound protection is non existant I heard the snoring and slamming doors throughout the stay The breakfast is salty and very poor served at the bar I wouldn t advise eating there if you would like to keep a healthy diet All in all I ve paid 200 Euro for two nights using the group rate and 400 Euro using the Booking com that advertises it as a 5 star experience If you ask me the value for money questions well less than a 100 would do for a 2 3 star hotel located in such a nice city as Amsterdam Marriott has spoiled the whole experience from the city And I am not even saying about a separate Wi Fi access not working key card and no compliments from the 5 start hotel and by this I mean a simple still water in the room you won t get it I was though charged a 75 Euro night deposit as if there was anything worth spoiling like hairdryer that was not working after 1 minute of actual work or iron desk that was literally pouring with foam rubber when I tried to iron my top once I would not advise staying in this hotel to anyone planning to visit Amsterdam especially not for pleasure I was lucky to have business in the city otherwise I would definitely ask for my money back Indeed this still can happen dear Marriott you have my card number Next week I am staying in Marriott San Francisco God I am already horrified , Nothing
461173,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Suite was not value for money For 800 plus Euros a night you expect better service The beds the Cleanliness the kettle the housekeeping were way below par and you had to repeatedly call for help Not at all worth Also no previledges provided as SPG Marriott gold member The bar service was a disaster , The breakfast was good and the steakhouse was also very nice Also the staff at front lobby not front desk were very courteous and helpful and carried around genuine smiles 
461174,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel,No Negative, Extra helpful and professional staff reception concierge housekeeping outstanding Excellent breakfast in executive lounge City view from 10th floor
461175,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, No negatives , The location was great near public transportation restaurants and the Van Gogh Museum Courteous staff and free WiFi Beds were very comfy and a nice family style table and seating that we all could sit at or place our belongings We were booked for two nights and easily were able to add a third night 
461176,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Not up to the standards of marriott Very expensive for the facilities provided Room was not spacious , Good breakfast very friendly and helpful staff
461177,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, the room very expensive and small i changed to another room no balcony i go every morning outside the hotel to smoke the bar was modest old fashion i didnt like it and theere is no outdoor coffe or restaurant the hotel is very sombre not going again,No Positive
461178,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Breakfast area was not big enough for number of guests Over crowded and food was not restocked fast enough kept running out of food bowls Not a very extensive breakfast selection for price and standard of hotel Check out procedure was slow Had to wait for mini bar to be checked and was then charged for items that we had not consumed they did not make me pay after I explained that the items were most definitely not in the room when we arrived Fitness area very small and lacking enough cardio equipment and mats Cleaning staff came into vacuum the gym at the busiest time of the morning when gym was full of people We came by public transport because parking was ridiculously overpriced , Located close to centre of city park restaurants public transport tourist attractions and shops Good sized room with very comfortable beds Room was nice and quiet 
461179,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, I found the front desk staff to be very abrupt and lacking interest in us as guests We were spoken to very sharply and were made to feel slightly unwelcome No chance of returning to this hotel Booking com also lead us to believe there was a swimming pool by displaying a pool icon in the amenities when there was not a pool , I liked how comfortable the beds were 
461180,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Room too cold reported it but no help had to report again Not enough drawers for clothes Too much water on floor after a shower shower door leaks , Location Breakfast at hotel 
461181,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, I think the breakfast cost a little excessive for me I only have cereal and fruit for breakfast not offered a continental breakfast at lower cost Good value for my husband who has a full breakfast I think some options would be good , Loved the location so close to everything public transport and within walking distance to a lot of the sights
461182,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, This is our third visit to this very hotel On our previous occasions there was always a jug of water ready in the lobby after a long day of cycling This wasn t there this time this merely a tiny critique , Lovely hotel with ideal location Genuinely great experience
461183,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Had to wait over half an hour for pre booked taxi Rideways driver to turn up at the meeting point, Clean comfortable room Good location within easy walking distance of both the old town the museum district
461184,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Booking com had only stated that one person was staying when there were 2 of us meaning that only one breakfast was paid for My brother had the same problem which shows the booking process was floored , Nice sheets quiet room excellent staff 
461185,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Shower in the bathroom badly designed one shower session drained into the outside hall , Location good restaurant food drinks very good Staff was friendly efficient 
461186,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Rooms were small , Perfect location close to most of the tourist attractions nice facilities Would recommend for older couples but not for young people 
461187,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The price of breakfast was high and paying for internet is an unnecessary expense , The staff was very professional and helpful The room was beautiful and clean The location was close to the tram So getting around was easy 
461188,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, No complaints staff was helpful no question or concern went unanswered with my satisfaction their primary goal Clearly a service oriented staff , Staff was helpful location to activities was convenient always felt well attended to by staff Convenient breakfast to start my day and handy bar to end my day 
461189,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Nothing really , Crispy bacon I live in a Muslim country I can comment that the breakfast staff were absolutely on top of their game Anticipated needs 
461190,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, I found the internet reception poor I would like to have a stronger and faster internet , The hotel was recently refurbished and everything was new and clean The staff was very friendly and the location ideal 
461191,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, very noisy location eg building work inside hotel that we where not informed of also noisy air con had to turn off at night but could not open window at night due to traffice lights outside and tram alerts, Food good staff excellent handy for transport links
461192,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, No milk in the rooms tea bags in the rooms I booked this through booking com nothing was mentioned regarding 5 tax we had to pay on arrival We had 2 rooms I paid 75 deposit on each room I checked out yesterday morning nothing has yet to be given back No damage on any of the rooms , Very clean beautiful hotel staff are very helpful 
461193,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Some rooms at second floor are under construction I think that they should close all floor because there are not clean and very noisy I scattered coffee by accident and they were not cleaned only from the floor but not near the safe Such an expencive hotel has to provide a complimentary bottle of water and free wi fi , Prefect location and nice staff 
461194,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The floor I was put on had about 8 or more units on renovation As my room was last on the floor Every morning I have to pass through those rooms being renovated n the air is very polluted There wasn t even a bottle of complimentary drinking water or toothbrush or cotton buds that a normal hotel of such rating would provide , I like the location
461195,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, breakfaxt a little bit disappointing coffee simmering in a big jar for hours salami was sweating next to the hot dishes very noisy breakfast room even prepaid we had to sign documents before enting the room not just checking the room so there was waiting time ,No Positive
461196,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, breakfast disappointing coffee comes from a cauldron that is simmering for hours so the coffee smells and tastes burnt salami was sweating next to the hot dishes very noisy breakfast room No bath in the room only shower my wife had to go begging for a showercap the second day small amanities soap shampoo not repleted Not the quality level of a 5 star hotel ,No Positive
461197,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Staff was the most problematic Everybody too stressed and not really giving the actual attention to us as clients Also the fact that you have to pay for internet in the room and that the public one in the lobby did not work once for the time i was there it was incredibly annoying Definitely something I will consider if one day I decide to come back , Location is definitely the strongest near Leidseplein it is easy to walk around the city and come back especially on a winter snowy day 
461198,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, A lady called Taisha wasn t welcoming at all and we felt belittled during the check in Thanks to the GM who put her in her place, The hotel was very nice great location and the general manager Peter was a true gentleman
461199,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Hotel undergoing refurbishment noise started at 7 30am everyday My room hadn t been refurbished yet and so was dated and tired although still clean and comfortable Obscene price for Wi Fi considering the price of the room should be included at a 5 hotel , Excellent prompt room service Fantastic staff very friendly polite and helpful Great location close to shops bars restaurants casino park museums etc 
461200,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Our room was very cold all day Heating did not work properly In the middle of the night we have a strong cigarette smoke smell enter our room Still not sure where it came from Unfortunately, Really helpful and attentive staff Delicious selection of food for breakfast Really nice bar Great location
461201,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel,No Negative, I loved the large slab of chocolate in the breakfast buffet right next to the chocolate infused donuts The club lounge was also nice with a good range of drinks and coffee Very short walk around the corner to the museums 
461202,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Had to take a downgrade we reserved a suit for our 10th wedding anniversary because hotel messed up our booking then told lies to cover up their mistake Very disappointing claimed all suites were being renovated yet were still bookable the next night And as it was prepaid non refundable we had to accept a credit in their restaurant for the difference Very sneaky , Location
461203,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, We were not informed of the building work on booking and when we arrived our room was directly below very loud drilling and banging from refurbishment and there was scaffolding right outside our window, The staff were very friendly and the newly refurbished room was lovely Bar area was great 
461204,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, We could hear drilling throughout the night which seemed to be coming from the hotel somewhere , The location of the hotel was perfect the staff were wonderful and the room was very comfortable 
461205,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel,No Negative, The staff at the Marriott are AMAZING They made me feel at home and their Everything is possible attitude is commendable I can t wait to visit Amsterdam again and stay at the Marriott 
461206,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, There was construction in the hotel that was not mentioned in booking They charge advanced payment apart from the room charge and it was 168 per room It was not mentioned in booking I asked the reception the reason they told me in case of accidents I asked what kind of explanation is minibar restaurant etc I stayed in many hotels I never faced this kind of behaviour I find it humiliating ,No Positive
461207,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Wasn t told about the renovation work being done until we got there and when we got to our room we could hear it and it started very early Also that room was not one of the updated rooms and looked dated , Staff were very friendly and helpful The updated rooms are very nice and comfortable 
461208,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, I didnt like the way how the receptionist talked to me when i checked out She asked me to wait till she check with the mini bar what i have used and i was waiting however she started to check in other people and left me stand alone and when i asked her to check again she was unhappy for my requeat since she was busy in helping others i paid the amount that i had to pay However i asked her for a receipt She said you have to wait then since i am checking in for other people although i came first , I like the location It is near everything No need for a taxi You can walk 
461209,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The beds are too soft , The breakfast was amazing and the staff we very polite and extremely friendly The hotel was always clean and had everything we needed and worth every penny There are plenty of shops and restaurants walking distance but also a restaurant and bar in the hotel so no need to go anywhere if you don t want to Plenty of useful facilities including a gym which is equipped with clean towels water and mats Overall a very pleasant stay 
461210,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, ON THE DAY I WAS LEAVING PRESSED FOR TIME THEY DECIDED TO CLOSE BREAKFAST SO THEY COULD TAKE PICTURES BAD PR DIDNT ENJOY BREAKFAST FELT HURRIED I HAD A PLANE TO CATCH , GREAT BREAKFAST MUCH VARIETY COMFORTABLE ROOM EXCELLANT LOCATION GREAT VIEW 
461211,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Family rooms not renovated and very small dark and dingy asked to be moved spent 30 in taxi to come back and said no other rooms to be moved to Friends stayed in a hotel closer that was much nicer for family rooms,No Positive
461212,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, There was a further city tax charged at 5 that was not included or mentioned until I came to check out I don t know why this wasn t included in the price of the room with the other taxes , The bed was comfortable with a good bathroom and shower 
461213,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The space seemed dated The wifi said free to upgrade but I got charged the rooms seemed very basic and the neighbours were very very noisy in the Saturday night , Staff were really nice 
461214,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Room service very limited Wifi not included in price of room Hotel takes a 70 deposit on check in in case of room service or damage thisvwas not stated on booking, Great location Staff very friendly Great room comfy bed Safe area Close to tours museums and attractions
461215,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, There were major roadworks outside the hotel which went on all through both nights we were there When we arrived the staff should have advised us of this and arranged a room on the other side of the hotel They didn t so we had to listen to work all night We moved rooms the next day but they took far too long coming to move us Even then the concierge just sauntered along the corridor ,No Positive
461216,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Roadworks right outside for 3 days but didn t really cause a problem, Friendly service chicken scewers with satay sauce were gorgeous I d stay again just for the sauce 
461217,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, We have faced the sutiation that the hotel pre reserved amount on the creadit card more than double of our total cost of room and meals for the period of stay Staff could not provide any explanation to the sutiation and have seen only part of the amounts blocked , Clean and comfortable room Good restaurant in the hotel for both breakfast and dinner Location is very good although currently there is construction work on the bridge and road in front of the hotel so there is some noise if room is with view on the canal 
461218,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Outdoor works were hyper noisy that we couldnt even sleep the first night There was no even a single information before and teh room price was hight and not a single word of apologies afterwards we were really disappointed Wifi was for extra charge ,No Positive
461219,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Directly at front of hotel massive Tram track refurbishment taking place level of noise in the day and continued all night was horrendous I was not made aware of this on checking in to hotel Not the hotels fault I know however my self and children were kept a wake most of the night due to the incredible noise level of the drilling taking place all Night long , The staff were so friendly and the interior of hotel lovely and room spacious and comfortable Very clean and modern bathroom 
461220,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, new suite cost me 600 odd per night the bathroom was cramped and insignificant wardrobes open plan bed not very comfortable business centre was in my opinion below average , location bar food and grill room
461221,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Hotel was looking tired Wifi was extra at that price it could have been added Would have thought if you book a family room it would be larger than a standard double room Both families were in consensus that they would never book the Marriott again in Amsterdam Rude staff but that could be cultural ,No Positive
461222,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Wrong invoice charge of a bottle we die not receive which I told to the staff but still was charged For , Comfort of the executive lounge staff kind and helpfull
461223,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel,No Negative, Had a wonderful time at the Marriott The location was amazing close to everything The staff were very helpful and friendly We ate in the restaraunt and had a great breakfast every morning I would recommend any one staying there to include it in their package The dinner menu was great different every night Our waitress Claudia made us feel special with her kind and excellent service Would stay here again 
461224,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, we stayed in room 261 The shower attachment had a big leak due to which there was no pressure at the shower head There is no wardrobe okay for 1 night but the space is inadequate for longer Also the space is uncovered so whoever enters your room can see anything you have kept on the shelf Wifi is not free we were asked to purchase a wifi package at the reception Since I had a EU data bundle I didn t bother with the wifi No water bottle No information on mini bar rates Finally someone had smoked pot in the corridor or one of the adjoining rooms so the smell was horrible outside , The room was very clean and the bed and pillows were soft and comfortable The food was very good They provided umbrellas when it was raining which was really nice of them The staff were very polite and courteous The location couldn t have been better for a foodie like me 
461225,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Mattress was hard in the middle and indented on either side clearly time for an update Hair dryer didn t work so maintenance checks need to be improved, Friendly warm welcoming staff good environment clean and easy check in out 
461226,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, This is not a five stars hotel Not anywhere near one The room was ridiculously small given the price of it The AC did not work correctly which was a problem since I traveled during the heat wave in the Netherlands When I asked if it could be fixed I was just replied that nothing could be done about that so much for a 5 stars hotel The bathroom ventilation system s heavy noise kept me up almost all night They even have put toilet paper inside the device to limit the noise which does not work at all So much for a 5 stars hotel Dear Mariott If you want to receive better ratings and comments better stop pretending to be what you are not Live with what you are a decent 3 stars hotel and stop fooling people I am not going to name any but there are plenty of 3 stars hotels in Amsterdam that are three times less pricey and three times better than this hotel , The location The staff s professionalism That s about it 
461227,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Wi fi access policy It s 2016 not 2006 in this day and age and in an upmarket hotel like this it s crazy that free wifi is not provided in room And the free lobby wifi access requires an awkward sign in Get real I intend returning to this marvellous city and i d prefer to stay here again but not until the Marriott s wifi policy is reformed Also awkward process for signing in to breakfast too lengthy , Vey pleasant friendly efficient staff Great location couldn t be bettered if you want a pleasant area close to key museums and a fine park plus access to a good shopping area eg Apple Store excellent range of shops especially shoes and travel luggage nice cinema 5 minutes walk Canal and trams are just across the road Quiet and peaceful
461228,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was fantastic Great location beds so comfy and breakfasts were delicious We requested an early check in and were so impressed that our rooms were ready for us when we arrived at 10 30am 
461229,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, There were very few negatives, The hotel is centrally located and close by to trams walking distance to park cafes restaurants etc The room service is 24 hrs which was great since my son is a diabetic and the time difference we were still able to stick to our routine and still have meals sent up after all restaurants and cafes were closed so that was a major plus for us 
461230,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, One staff member named Karl was absolutely pathetic and should not be working in front desk of any hotel I saw him continiiusly making things difficult for customers over four days I stayed there They need to re look on new designs of rooms as they didn t impress at all , Excellent location in Center of shopping areas and you can walk 20 minutes to dam square through shooing alleys
461231,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, No free wi fi in guests rooms , Breakfast is excellent with many different choices Spacious rooms comfortable beds easy check in and check out Staff very friendly polite and helpful Close to all the major attractions in Amsterdam 17 mins from airport and only 40 in a taxi fast and cheaper than train bus for 4 adults Will definitely stay here again 
461232,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The staff at the restaurant was not warm and friendly Each time they seemed very aloof and not especially friendly In fact at times they seemed rude and bothered by a question , The care and concern and efforts of the staff at the front desk and administrative desk to help and to secure our needs 
461233,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Wifi should be available everwhere and not an extra , Very good choice at breakfast Something for everyone Air con in rooms made them comfortable Staff were good with kids Easy to access many attractions by walking or tram The airport bus 197 drops and collects just outside very convenient 
461234,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, We wished they had free wi fi throughout the hotel including the rooms , Loved the service the staff and the hotel was fantastic Conveniently placed from the city centre and very easy to access 
461235,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel,No Negative, This Location was perfect for our family of 2 adults and two teens The room size was the family room with two double beds The breakfast had many options for everyone and even when we arrived towards the end of the service time they had plenty of food ready 
461236,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The first bedroom was small with filthy windows overlooking a side wall of the adjacent NH hotel And that s the reward for being a Marriott Rewards member for 20 years Joke , The location was perfect for setting off in any direction 
461237,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Only booked in for one night as a special treat after a concert in Maastricht Awoken by housekeeping at 8am to service room even though we had 2 young children and were checking out that day Our daughter left her most special prised comforter in the room and despite informing the hotel within hours this was never handed in even though we were able to give a specific description of where the item was left No pool or anything special to offer and breakfast was 30 each which we didn t explore Overall very disappointed with the Marriott and won t avail of their hotel again ,No Positive
461238,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Breakfast at the executive lounge is so poor it does not meet the Marriots well known breakfast standards Very poor varieties and unsutable seats and tables Understaffed lounge We found out later that you can order omelets from the other Resturant Took them 30 minutes to deliver the omelet ,No Positive
461239,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Nobody waited on our table on our first day at breakfast we weren t offered tea or coffee or additional items that were cooked individually Fortunately we were looked after very well on additional days And enjoyed the waffles and omelettes on offer Unfortunately all the family rooms consisted of double beds for siblings not always appropriate when travelling with teenagers of the opposite sex I would like to have been offered a double and two singles , Best waffles ever delicious 
461240,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Price was high and that was without breakfast Didn t realise that the sweets and drinks in the room was charged after my stay Hotel could of at least gave us some free sweets for my young children Over 20 just for one kit kat Toblerone and a small tub of pringle, The location was excellent and staff were good 
461241,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Thought wifi and breakfast should be included for the price paid Plus only had coffee creamer in rooms UHT milk would be good Would love biscuits too Think it s a bit tight given how much it is to stay Little bits that would make a difference Especially as Marriott is a huge MN , Staff were lovely and helpful lovely hotel and great location 
461242,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Overpriced for size and comfort of rooms Breakfast was very overpriced for what was There to have, Location was good not to far away but not to much in hustle bustle
461243,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, It is a little overpriced The rooms are small , The concierge is probably this hotel s greatest asset Not very large rooms And then lobby is small But the location is very good and close to the museum district I would come again 
461244,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The bed was well beyond being comfortable The mattresses springs had collapsed on both sides of the bed Not having free wifi was a surprise Even basic chains like premier inn have free wifi , Staff were friendly very clean hotel excellent location 
461245,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, On my last day the cleaning lady kept following up to ask what time I was checking out It was annoying and surely poor service , The bed was very comfortable breakfast was great
461246,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Nothing in particular Only realized stationery was no longer provided which is fine But the concierge whom l asked to provide me some paper n envelopes and promised me to deliver to the room did not keep up his promise , As part of American chain Marriott is very service oriented The staffs were all in American accent and cater to the guests well Everything was solved n done in split seconds 
461247,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The housekeeping and maintenance of the bathrooms needs to be improved , An excellent location The beds were good and comfortable The staff very polite and helpful 
461248,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel,No Negative, Location great staff excellent aircon in room and non stop bathroom extractor fan a little noisy no free wifi except in the lobby bar Set up mainly for American visitors very popular and I would guess 70 guests were US Not a problem with this Just the food was a little too tailored for them but hey i was in the minority The on site restaurant is excellent top 50 on trip advisor and a fantastic steak 
461249,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The restaurant was small and they need the room number with signing and they charged us for the breakfast even though we had a room including breakfast but the employee in the reception was so gentle and she removed the breakfast charges and we didn t pay for that , Very nice location for the hotel at the center The stuff was great with comfortable valet parking 
461250,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The bell hop are extremely impatient Rushing you at the reception The moment they see you with your luggage they are trying to move you Not a nice feeling of being herded like cattle Did not appreciate it one bit Had the same problem with check in and check out , The location was good and quiet Close by to the museums The reception was good So was the restaurant service 
461251,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Absolutely disgusted with the room 265 for a room plus tax and deposit on top with no breakfast The room was NOTHING like the pictures Looked like it had been decorated in the 80 s We had a dirty bathroom and found a half eaten apple left on the floor Was completely disgusted as when we did raise this with the staff the lady was extremely extremely rude to us It was a one off joint birthday weekend away for myself and my sister and we were gutted tbh , Location was the only positive
461252,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, My credit card was debited for the consume of the new guests that checked in after we had checked out I dont know if it had something to do with the express check out but it was good I checked my credit card bill on the internet and contacted the hotel They transferred the money back ,No Positive
461253,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel,No Negative, The friendly very helpful professional staff Nothing was a bother to them especially marcin at front desk and sayat bernardo in the bar Breakfast was amazing especially the bacon Location very good The staff make the hotel 
461254,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location for access to old town and the museums The street cars stop nearby making it convenient to access old town The departure for Blue Line canal cruises is in easy walking distance Near the outside canal ring so out of the noise and conjestion of the inner city and red light district 
461255,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The parking fee is outrageous as was the room cost Sadly I would recommend visitors to use the NH next door I stayed because as a platinum member I expect a certain level of hotel Staff was very good Cost for the room not worth it,No Positive
461256,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Bed sheets were not clean The breakfast area hostess could be better You had to wait and first give your room number before you could get to sit at the table, The Staff and especially guest services was fantastic Centrally located in the heart of the city
461257,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The room was very dated and quite tatty The carpet was very worn and dirty and the decoration for example around the door was shoddy , The location is great and very central especiLly for the nearby museums 
461258,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, We had no wardrobe just a place to hang clothes with a long mirror behind which was unusual so a few drawers to put bits and pieces in would have been a good addition from a female point of view, Our Superior room on the 4th floor was very comfortable and a reasonable size It appears to have been newly decorated and everything was pristine We were very happy with the room and the hotel itself Also the hotel was in a very good location and had a cosy bar and restaurant It was a lovely place to return to each night after walking and enjoying the streets Amsterdam
461259,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The renovated suites smells paint and since we have a kid we asked to change the room They changed our room from a junior suite to an old style suite and made us pay the difference that was unacceptable The cleaning of the suite was not done very good A dirty coffee cup was on our balcony since we checked in and stayed till we checked out But overall it was a pleasant experience would recommend this hotel, Location is excellent Best location in Amsterdam The suite is spacious and comfortable The executive lounge is a great idea
461260,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Free Wifi only available when you sign up for membership Also no change given when I ordered Room service so if it was a tip they were expecting it worked out to be around 25 , Location was great bed was comfy nice refreshments in the lobby
461261,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The hotel took a 50 deposit 10 days prior to our stay Our reservation on Booking com said no deposit required and cancellation available up until 48 hours prior to stay Personally for a hotel of this price I do expect breakfast tea coffee to be served at the table We had to fetch our own from a machine Just a pet gripe of mine , Excellent location We booked an executive room which gave access to a private lounge Well worth considering as 5 30 9 30pm drinks and snacks are included Hot and soft drinks available all day Concierge very helpful Rooms comfortable Breakfast very good 
461262,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Staff are not helpful Before I arrived I have paid for the hotel through booking com and they have charged me again I was charged a higher price and had to ask more than once to be given the money back So any traveler booking through booking com be careful when you arrive at this hotel They may charge you again , Nothing in particular 
461263,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Breakfast should be included in the price My dad s bag with his wallet inside was stolen from the lobby of the hotel from right beside him This was badly handled by both the staff and the security persons who also told me that this happens all the time ,No Positive

461265,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Working TV Advised that not yet upgraded to digital Confusion with choices at breakfast Lady in charge of restaurant gave different descriptions of choices on different days to different people resulting Separate choices also close together so unable to determine what was supposed to be included with which package Food excellent though , Location was very convenient for City access Majority of staff were very efficient 
461266,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, This hotel was VERY expensive for what you get but I guess it is somewhat normal for Spring in Amsterdam , Full service hotel in a convenient part of the city with very friendly and accommodating staff 
461267,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, The hotel is very good but doesn t worth their rate On top of the exaggerated price there is no free wifi If you want free wifi in the room it costs This is really old fashioned since most hotels nowadays give away free wifi in your room , Clean Good location
461268,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, I payed 850 for 3 nights stay which I thought was really expensive a steak in the hotel restaurant was 70 which I think is overpriced too my room always seemed to be a wee bit cold even though the heat was on, Really helpful staff and there is a hair dressers in the hotel 
461269,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Housekeeping was poor Room was not cleaned so no clean towels etc and we had to ask several times just to get something as simple as tea bags milk , Clean hotel Polite friendly staff Great location for Museum Quarter Centre

461276,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Only slight problem was the location about a 30 35 min walk to dam square as i travelled as a group of friends this proved hard after a few drinks , Lovely hotel really polite staff nothing was too much trouble really helpful Rooms were spacious and clean also beds really comfortable Great hotel bar to relax and enjoy a drink Mini bar little expensive however personal choice weather or not to use 
461277,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, only disappointing thing was that there was a mouse in the bar area we did alert the staff in the bar who advised housekeeping who then came and hoovered up the area that is the reason for the low score on cleanliness also feel wifi should be freely available in a hotel of this calibre and price , The staff were excellent the breakfast was lovely The room was clean and comfortable the area was perfect for us visiting as a family 
461278,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Breakfast was a little chaotic special orders when they are busy take a long time and were not delivered in a great way Special orders on a quiet morning were excellent as was the buffet especially the fresh fruit Check invoice before check out as there were some extras added to ours in error but were removed immediately and without issue when highlighted The excellent location is reflected in the price , Great location ask for canal view staff are excellent and helpful Huge selection buffet breakfast with the best fresh fruit of any hotel we have stayed in recently hotel is perfect for tourist connections canal bus shopping etc 5 mins walk from Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum which is a must for any visitor Rooms were very comfortable and hotel is quiet ensuring a good nights sleep

461283,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Breakfast I had to wait longer than 20 minutes to get a table And it was not a special event day The room was served by very poor powder coffee I think is very disappointing for a 5 stars hotel to provide such a poor coffee The douche was leaked not enough water from the douch head and zero pressure Generally speaking very old fashioned hotel Bath rooms and lift require immediate renovation And the breakfast can be more diverse and less waiting time , Location and fitness facility
461284,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel,No Negative, They really looked after the whole party of us it was my cousins 21st birthday during the trip and they even surprised her with a bottle of champagne all on the house

461295,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Overpriced drinks in hotel bar 9 Euros for a glass of Prosecco and 6 Euros for a large beer however this seems to be typical of large chain hotel bars so not really a surprise We booked a corner executive room for a touch of luxury over Xmas mainly because it was a bigger size but it had THE smallest bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel Free wi fi very hit and miss all over hotel although you can pay to upgrade it , Overall a very nice experience Great location and a team of very friendly attentive staff makes this hotel Nothing is too much bother for the staff all you have to do is ask We had a corner executive room 1045 which had a balcony with lovely city view Very comfy large bed Executive lounge access was a nice bonus

461314,Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, Wrong advice from Reception staff that the Van Gogh museum was a five minute walk without considering that the guest was a 71 yr old man The poor old guest was exhausted at the end of the walk and if we had more correct advice we would have booked a taxi One snobbish receptionist who said breakfast depends whether it is free or not when I knew well that I had booked a fare with free breakfast Very cheap behaviour for a 4 5 star hotel where a 15 Euro breakfast is hardly going to be a topic for haggling This receptionist was particularly unfriendly no smiles made me feel unwelcome Then she appeared to teach me English when as you can see I write and speak perfect English Was it because I had brown skin was this racism The Hilton Amsterdam just a few months ago had provided us with bathrobes and slippers in the room Is this too much to have in your hotel The floor was cold , cleanliness lobby area boarding pass printout was free
