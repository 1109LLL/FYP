480375,Ca Bianca Hotel Corte Del Naviglio, Walls are very thin you hear what s going on outside of the room and next to your room Hopefully people just did noise 10 mn before going to bed it was never all along the night , Staff was all nice from the receptionnist to the cleaning house maid Very easy to reach city centre the old style tramway 2 cross all Milan city centre passing through Navigli and make you feel as a local You find easily a sit in the tram as the line starts at the hotel great for my pregancy You can also walk along the canal and catch any bus or tram as soon as you feel tired 
480376,Ca Bianca Hotel Corte Del Naviglio, Two twin beds pushed together Maybe it s a European thing Also I would recommend taking the hotel name off the room key This way if you lose the room key the thieves have room number and hotel number I just put it on my keychain until checkout time , Amazing breakfast Clean nice room Working hd cable Reasonably priced mini bar Friendly helpful staff 
480377,Ca Bianca Hotel Corte Del Naviglio, Very loud The cleaning ready in the morning came in without even knocking at the door The concierge was very rude We arrived late at night after informing the structure that we were arriving very late and the person welcomed us saying I already put you under NO SHOW because you could have informed us that you were arriving late instead of saying HELLO At least on the other hand the guy at the reception in the morning was very gentle and seemed very mortified about our bad experience during the night , Location very close to the tram station to go to the city center
