149031,Plaza Tour Eiffel, Nothing, Hotel is walking distance to the Eiffel Tower view point You can get onto the hop on hop off bus there Quiet street there are restaurants close by and also a large grocery convenience store within easy walking distance The staff are very friendly and helpful Organized taxi and suggested good restaurant Breakfast is good lots of tasty pastries and croissants The room was spacious enough to move around in and the bathroom also a good size enough space to put down toiletries Everything very comfortable no complaints and will definitely stay here again 
149032,Plaza Tour Eiffel, When checking out I got an unfriendly lady No buffet with respect to bread just a basket Bed sheets inside coating were very dirty Wifi was extremely poor , Personnel two men during first day was extremely friendly Nice fruit juices during breakfast

149034,Plaza Tour Eiffel, Breakfast is very limited and plain for this price range Noise of garbage trucks from 5am onwards audible in the room , Clean room convenient location for OECD meetings
149035,Plaza Tour Eiffel, The breakfast could have a bit more variety The price was pretty expensive as well I know it s Paris but it was a little pricey , The staff were warm and helpful The room was big enough for three people to fit comfortably The beds were comfortable 
149036,Plaza Tour Eiffel, no toilettries provided apart from the set for the 1st day no tea making facilities but you could ask for hot water at the reception no fridge annoyinng if you stay longer, location great breakfast more than satisfactory with very good staff

149038,Plaza Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Comfortable room of reasonable size clean and comfortable bed Adequately bug breakfasts Perfect for a couple or business trip no go with children not my case 
149039,Plaza Tour Eiffel, the procedure to check out is too outdated You still need to wait at the counter for invoice etc Not like that many 4 star hotels e g sheraton invoice will be sent put the day before check out or there is a quick check out A waste of time Room is too small , location cleaniness
149040,Plaza Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The service is of above all expectations The rooms are very comfortable with pleasant design and atmosphere as well as the reception and bar zones The staff is polite and ready to support you The director Inna organising the hotel life participates in it personally with kind attention to the questions of the guests Thank you very much for our beautiful stay in your hotel 
149041,Plaza Tour Eiffel, Hard to control temperature of room , Everything was of a good standard Useful to have a fitness room unlike many Paris hotels Great variety and quality of breakfast offer 
149042,Plaza Tour Eiffel, Asked for dinner with room service the dinner was a little cold plate etc was in plastic beer was not very cold The reception later explained that it is a take away arrangement with a company because the hotel has a bar but no kitchen I would like to have been warned about this A dinner with soup and main course costed 40 euro , Beautiful hotel Got a free upgrade to a spacious by Paris standards room Very clean and elegant Staff extremely nice and friendly
149043,Plaza Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Cleanliness and comfort Safe area close to were my work shop was keeping either walking distance or with easy convenient bus service Walking distance also to the main attraction of Paris the Eiffel Tour 
149044,Plaza Tour Eiffel, There was no BBC news channel other than French spoken channel We reported to the staff that told us the engineer had checked our room We couldn t get BBC channel in our room because the location of our room The staff didn t think an alternative way to solve the problem which I found slightly disappointed I do stay in the Paris for holiday watching TV isn t a big issue however I do like to know what s going on in the world early in the morning before I get out of the door Especially all the disasters have happened in Paris recently I do recommend the hotel to solve the TV problem out for foreign travellers , The location is brilliant 
149045,Plaza Tour Eiffel, When we arrived to the hotel it was overbooked They did not have an available room even tough we made a booking couple of months in advance We had to stay the first night in a hotel nearby , When we moved after the first night to this hotel we were given a small present fancy chocolate and a letter of apology We were given also an upgrade to a better room Hotel is OK for Paris standard but I can not understand that you accept a booking and then you do not have an available room 
149046,Plaza Tour Eiffel, Very very tight rooms and simple furniture I don t understand the French rating system but this one should be a good 3 stars hotel on international standards The breakfast was very small , Location staff and clean
149047,Plaza Tour Eiffel,No Negative, We arrived early at the hotel due to our flight schedule and the hotel staff was able to get a room for us without extra charge Also the hotel is few minutes walk to Eiffel tower restaurants bars cafes supermarkets train and taxi stations

149049,Plaza Tour Eiffel, Would be nice if there was a lounge bar area to get a drink and sit although the front desk made available a few basic selections , Beds were comfortable rooms were clean staff was helpful in a good part of town near the sights we wanted to see Didn t take advantage of the breakfast but we did take advantage of the fitness facility which was basic but enough

149051,Plaza Tour Eiffel, As far as we could tell the hotel only offers breakfast for lunch dinner or an evening snack you will have to go in the city However being in Paris that is probably something you should be doing anyway , The location is fantastic close to multiple Metro and bus stops and on about a 20 min walk from the Eiffel Tower The room we had was not big but very clean and the bed was very comfortable There was plenty of storage and the bathroom had all the facilities required The breakfast was delicious with enough choice and the staff brings you fresh pastry as soon as you take a seat They also have a small but functional fitness area Staff was helpful polite and friendly Definitely a great hotel to stay
