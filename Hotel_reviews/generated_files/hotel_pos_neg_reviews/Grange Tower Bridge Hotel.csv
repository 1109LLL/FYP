191814,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Staff a little abrupt on check in I requested early check in and was told 40 mins which was fine great as I know this was a special request Reappeared 50 mins later to be told it is another 20 mins Came back after 30 mins and was told another 10 mins When I advised them what was happening I was told well this is a special request and it s up to our supervisors when the room is ready I think the staff were completely missing the point that actually my loan was about the fact that I could have not wasted over an our and a half of my time waiting around if I had been advised that a room would t be ready and that would have been fine Not the best of starts or first impressions Assist from that a good stay , Lovely luxury hotel close to tourist spots
191815,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The pool can be used by non guests so sometimes I felt in a gym club instead a leisure place Some guests were a bit rude not the hotel fault I know and don t know how to use the lift common sense stuff The central heating makes noise all night bearable , Staff extremely helpful Very nice bedroom and good spa The bar is a good place to relax and have a drink good value for money 
191816,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Heating in the room was poor even at 30degrees over night the room was still cold in the morning Shame our double bed was noticeably two single mattresses put together , Lovely room very clean and accessible Room service and food was perfect Staff very welcoming no request was too much and spa facilities beautiful clean warm and well maintained 
191817,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Not a five star hotel good but not that good very pricey for what it is Plus you can t use the mini bar to store your own stuff they charge if stuff is moved Plus 3PM check in 11AM check out means if you staying one night you there for 20hrs but paying 24hr rate For a hotel that charges for moving items in the mini bar I think it s only fair that I get a refund for the 4hrs I was unable to occupy my room Plus watch out for special rates they don t include breakfast which costs an extra GBP36,No Positive
191818,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, Great location near known sites and good restaurants and bars nearby Nice size of room even bigger than most I stayed earlier in in this part of town Nice quiet room 
191819,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Air Con was very noisy I actually tried to cancel the booking However it seems that the word exclusively after the permissible date of cancellation appears to mean it is the day before The Hotel blamed Booking com for the wording ,No Positive
191820,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, They should refrain from entering the room when your out We left our room for 2 hours in the early afternoon and when we returned there was new dinner information and leaflets left on a made bed i called reception and they told me that they had enterd the room to make the beds and tidy why i still dont undestand i was told its a 5 star treatment , Nice staff and facilities and location 
191821,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Please take note if you would like a mattress in a cot for your baby you have to make a special request prior to hotel stay If you don t then your child will sleep on a thin sheet on top of the slats of the cot Had this not been a 5 hotel I would not be so irate about this situation We were verbally offered a full refund by the acting GM for one of our rooms for a 2 night stay However as I provided my honest reviews on there FB page and twitter this has since been rescinded This speaks volumes about our stay and Grange as a brand Pictures are below for your reference if you would like to see why I was so disappointed at this 5 hotel , Unfortunately as our stay was ruined by the customer service we were unable to use the facilities However they looked good online 
191822,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The facilities was good as per a 4 5 star hotel but the service level was at best 3 star The staff had difficulty communicating English level poor considering we are in England We paid extra fr my son who is 10 year old 20 per day fr a sofa bed The bed was so bad tht you could feel the springs coils under the mattress We had to ask twice and wait 10hours to get an extra duvet on the sofa bed to make it more comfortable , The facilities in room New modern design clean
191823,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Full breakfast was a little pricey even though it looked lovely we opted for a pub breakfast in the morning , Beautiful room in a lovely location Staff were very friendly and helpful 
191824,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, room was dull and needed a re deck it was meant to be an executive room would only give it 4 star rating but the toilet and shower was 5 star breakfast was far too expensive , the bed was very comfortable
191825,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, A bit dissapointing was that when we returned to our room after a long day walking around the room was cleaned so we were forced to go to the bar But not even a complimentary coffee was offered , Sauna and pool
191826,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The facilities and service weren t up to scratch for a 5 star hotel Lots of little things added up to a poor experience long queue for check in temperature controls in the room were faulty dressing gown and slippers for the room were missing TV screen was tiny and the furniture decoration in the room was getting a bit tired , The location was round the corned from the Tower of London and the views from the upper floors looking out over London were great 
191827,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, high prices No parking, swimmimg pool and gym so much cleaning love that love seeing at gym after checkout just spending time at there and greats lobby big bed room big bath room very cleans easy for walking to tower bride ans super market lotus express so close value for paid prices breakfast many foods and fruits
191828,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, It is a 5 star hotel but I can t suggest anyone to go there Do you know the feeling when you experience that the system and or the rules are more important then the guest I felt that My bad feelings At the check in I was on a business trip but for any reason unexpectedly I had to bring my 6 year old child with me Although the child slept with me in my bed I had to pay 20 GBP extra night for the child I felt it unfair I had to pay for the accommodation in advance at the check in In the room By my surprise I couldn t open the minibar it was closed centrally When I looked out the window of my expensive room I could see backyards of untidy houses enclosed the picture I switched on the TV and I couldn t enjoy the program because the picture was just colour pixels and unrecognisable forms We went for dinner When I wanted to charge the bill to the room account they said that it was closed I had to pay cash or credit card Finally I paid cash We went into the room and to bed at 10 30 pm the in room phone ringed and waked up my son and myself A male voice told me that my bill at the restaurant was wrong for any reason and I had to go there immediately I kept my manner and politely told him morning During the night there was cold in the room although I adjusted the system to 25 Celsius In the morning than the system started to warm up the room but the next night it was could again Probably the heating didn t work at night Morning I went to the restaurant I asked what was wrong with the bill They said it was a mistake sorry Can you imagine I didn t have breakfast there Check out was smooth I didn t look back I never will , The bed was really comfortable The bathroom was really nice The hotel was clean 
191829,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, The room staff and location are excellent This is the second time we ve stayed at the Grange and we have been extremely happy on both occasions 
191830,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, i was put in a room that looked nothing like the picture so i asked to switch the staff gave a vibe that did not want to help the pool was covered in used towels there were not enough chairs the beds were hard the gym staff gave me a key to a used locker had to get a new one I wold rate it a 4 star instead of 5 and that is just for location mainly , the rain at one end of the pool was a nice feature
191831,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Breakfast seemed a little expensive there is a Wetherspoons opposite , Large comfortable room quick lift beautiful pool area which was complimentary to guests Beds were very comfortable twin room had two queen beds sofa TV blackout curtains and minibar tea coffee with a very nice bathroom An excellent night s sleep A 5 7 minute walk from Tower of London 
191832,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The only problem I could see is some inconsiderate guests who left their towels left and right after leaving I also feel that the staff were a bit lenient about letting kids use the pool in the evenings even though they are not supposed to , This hotel is of exceptional quality for my high standards Every member of staff were extremely accommodating from the receptionist to the cleaning lady The hotel room was immaculately clean and spacious the bed was comfortable and large The shower gel and other goodies were of superior quality and the shower was satisfyingly strong We spent 4 nights in quiet bliss not a sound to be heard even though the hotel looked generally busy The swimming pool and other spa facilities were lovely too There is a certain ambiance of relaxation 
191833,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Definitely far away from 5 Stars Poor intercontinental breakfast old furnitures in the room lobby is somehow stylish On a second view cleaness is very poor toilets at the bar elevators tables at breakfast area Staff is not very attentive Don t get me wrong but a 5 star accomodation is different , Location near Tower Bridge public transport nearby 
191834,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, 3am We had ordered food but the delivery didn t bring utensils Room service brought up some forks for us and everything was right again Great service 
191835,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, the shower faucet kept falling off the water went every where over the floor bathtub floor was very slippery even when we used the rubber mats My daughter did slip in the bath shower tub Had to ask for more towels on the first day because there was three guests in the room The lift was broken but it was eventually repaired we had to walk down 12 flights of stairs no problem with that but the signage saying the lift was out of order was slow coming , The beds were very comfortable even the pullout sofa bed The room was clean Plenty of teas coffee and milk but no third cup 
191836,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The staff where very helpful and the hotel apart from the bed sheet was great , The Staff and hotel was great the only thing wish I was very disappointed about was the bottom sheet was to small for the bed and it was not fitted which caused the comfort mattress to show They must have run out of bottom sheets 
191837,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Drinks were very expensive a cocktail was 10 and a small bottle of coke for a child was 3 breakfast was expensive but there s a Wetherspoons across the road that does a lovely breakfast, The room service menu for kids was very reasonable and lovely food good that the pool facilities could be used with kids up till 10 pm at weekends my kids loved it cocktails were lovely but bit pricey
191838,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Our bed was not that comfortable and also hadn t been hooked together properly which resulted in me falling between the beds I will contacting the hotel about this personally On booking I had requested a view of the city but on arrival we had a room with no view at all just a curtain concealing an inside walkway The hotel staff said they could not change our room , Cleanliness Bathroom of a good standard
191839,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Had no idea how to use lights in room or shower sink drain did not seem to work Staff did not explain or offer to explain lights or shower until we asked for help Concierge admitted that these features are unusual so it seems that an offered explanation would have been appropriate , Food was excellent and staff was very professional and helpful except with respect to anticipating potential problems with lights and shower 
191840,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, Modern very pretty hotel with a great pool and spa Beautiful bathroom with nice robs for everyone Fastest elevators ever Bellmen took our heavy backpacks and luggage as we entered 
191841,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, Absolutely loved my stay at the grange tower bridge hotel the staff were so helpful and attentive Upon arrival we were upgraded to executive suite view was amazing Thank you Unfortunately we couldn t use the pool or spa as we were feeling a little under the weather but we will be coming back again to do just that Can t wait 
191842,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, There were no bathrobes in the room The pillows were uncomfortable Room wasnt child friendly Felt uneasy with inter connected room View wasnt too good just buildings opposite , I liked the professional and friendly manner of all staff The room was cosy and warm as we had temperature controls in the room The whole hotel had an elegant feel about it Loved the pieces of art everywhere 
191843,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, I honestly couldn t pick out a floor other than check in and out times being so specific it meant that if you stay for one night you didn t even get a full 24 hours in the hotel, The staff were so lovely and really made the stay so brilliant The spa was incredible and the rooms were even better than imagined with a perfect view and gorgeous bathroom there wasn t anything more we could ask for Would recommend the wetherspoons by the hotel instead of hotel breakfast as its a lot cheaper and you get more for your money but thats personal preference 
191844,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, Rooms were excellent Staff very helpful The hotel is excellent really well furnished rooms excellent size and great furniture and comfort nice and cosy
191845,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Staff are quite rude not very friendly You also get charged 4 everytime for room service or I was told or you can come get it yourself from a member of staff I didn t realise I was working at the hotel either , Really lovely hotel Spa was amazing and the beds are super comfy Not a great view from our room Considering it was my boyfriends boyfriend looking out to scaffolding sites wasn t great Prices for drinks at the hotel are a rip off so expensive if you like a cheap drink there is a wetherspoons next door 
191846,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Requested a late checkout which was turned down immediately unless paid for Unlike at other hotels where this is often accommodated without any additional costs , View from our corner room on the 11th floor was amazing 
191847,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Noisy seemed to be a lot of parties hens and stags No iron in my room when I asked for one it never arrived No bottled water in the room Minibar locked , Pool and leisure facilities Shower and beds were comfortable 
191848,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Nothing, From the moment we entered the hotel we were more than pleased The Staff were really friendly and couldn t do enough to make our stay enjoyable Would definitely stay at this hotel again Faultless 
191849,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Quite a walk from decent transport hub Away from main entertainment areas of London central if you want to be in and around leceister square oxford street theatres etc , Plush great gym and spa area I was tired after a long day so appreciated a nice gym session and an amazing relaxing spa Very quiet room Floor 9 room 921 Slept soundly all night comfortable warm lovely Staff were great really nice greeting on arrival and plenty of help around if you need it I would stay here again without hesitation for a business trip 
191850,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, Great location Only a few minutes walk from the underground Tower of London and St Katherine s Dock Spa facilities really excellent and made our stay special 
191851,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, Great spa would suggest more loungers as some people were on there for hours and would be fair if had a rota i e Max time on one as not fair on any one else 
191852,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, There was nothing to dislike only that I didn t book two nights lol , Absolutely amazing spent one night here for my birthday and it was just perfect the rooms are lovely The hotel is in a excellent position to everything you could ask for Will a 100 stay again I would highly recommend 
191853,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Only one lift was working out of two which led to some delays but nothing major , Very friendly staff very clean and comfortable room and excellent leisure facilities 
191854,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, One of the two elevators was not working for the duration of my stay 15 mins wait for an elevator not cool , Well appointed room Nice views from the top floor Great gym 
191855,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Terrible shower sprayed the floor everytime reception staff bit robotic along with services they could think outside of the box didn t clean my room until late, Bed comfy Clean nice large rooms Concierge very helpful and professional
191856,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The lifts take a while to arrive as they re going to so many floors, Spa area was very clean and the pool very spacious Steam room was a lovely bonus Our room was perfect on the 14th with spectacular views over London
191857,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Would have been nice to have the option to buy bed and breakfast Spa facilities are very small for the size of the hotel amount of rooms No chance of getting a bed to use or even a space to put your towels Showers full of hair rinse down showers didn t work properly , Great location
191858,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, I paid pretty much the same as a lone traveller as I would with a partner Don t know if they do singles as not available when I booked on booking com at last minute , This is a four star London hotel with a genuine friendly welcome Restaurant prices are very reasonable with a good range of food available I didn t use the leisure area but would next time The room was peaceful with pretty good sound proofing Very shiny and new bathroom 
191859,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, View from the room wasn t great Not a problem to us but could be for other people Drinks in the bar were expensive, Efficient check in Great quality and value for money
191860,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The staff where rude from the moment we got there The staff where smoking in front of the reception outside the hotel when we arrived The check in the staff where rude When I ordered breakfast the coffe was cold and I scrambled eggs on toast came with no toast and was cold Then they changed it for me and brought up some cold toast with no butter and hot coffe 20 mins later it was a mess Then I used the spa where the receptionist was extremely rude and I had to pay 20 pounds cash to use the pool I had no ID to give to receive a locker key in the end I was allowed one I was called back after leaving the hotel being accused of stealing a locker key which I was offended at The hotel staff don t speak English properly and have a very bad attitude I was disappointed We paid for a nicer room and was given a disabled room with a wet room bath room and no bath was very ugly , the facilities and spa had a good massage and the girl was lovley 
191861,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Unfortunately I couldnt stay the whole night and had to check out at 2am But will definitely go back to stay again , The whole experience was outstanding and have already started planning my second trip The room facilities were amazing especially the shower The spa was out of this world as well as the service from the staff throughout the hotel The tower grill restuarant was satisfying and the room service the nachos and pasta to be precise was just a dream Felt like kevin McCallister from home alone 
191862,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, On our second day we came back to only one clean cup 3 clean bath towels for 4 of us , Our family room was a great size with 2 large doubles which is much better than having to put one of the kids on a sofa bed The spa pool facilities were amazing enjoyed by us the kids Dressing gowns delivered to our room was a lovely touch 
191863,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The cost of the breakfast was extortionate we opted to get it in weatherspoons which was next door Every other 5 star we ve stayed in breakfast comes with the room , The bed was amazing nearly asked what kind it was It was great location for the tower of London and London bridge 
191864,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The bed was quite hard and the pillow was lumpy For the amount of money the place is meant to be things were not as good as I expected The view was of an office block The television wasn t even all the freeview channels I got the room with about 50 off and it definitely wouldn t have been worth the extra There was no fridge that you could use , The pool was really nice and the whole fitness area seemed good The shower was really good and the bath was very big The bed and room were a good size 
191865,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, Staff were unhelpful and difficult to communicate with I do not like the presumptuous service charge on cocktails excessive And service charge in restaurant has in my experience of many years of fine dining only 10 not 15 also there should be complimentary water in the room 
191866,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Be careful there are quite a few Grange Hotels The Grange City overlooks the Tower of London The Grange Tower is somewhere else A little confusing when booking , Very helpful staff Especially the girl on booking in Great views of the Tower of London if you get the right rooms Good sized rooms 
191867,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, We didn t have robes for the pool in our room so had to go the the spa and ask for them then got sent to reception, Everything was lovely food in the restaurant was amazing too The steak was awesome
191868,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The computerized mini bar is full and charges you if you move things around to accommodate your own things I could not chill my duty free champagne or any perishable items which I had purchase outside the hotel , The hotel is efficient clean and perfect if you have business in the vicinity 
191869,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Only 1 bar of soap for basin bath and shower Quality and quantity of shampoo and conditioner very very poor No blankets for the cot Had to ask housekeeping and got a single duvet 41 for 3 G T s too much , Clean quiet very friendly staff Baggage drop off for last day Early check in was appreciated 
191870,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, pillows were dreadful no substance 1 was too low and 2 were too high hardly slept Room had a lot of lights in it hat needed to be covered up the TV standby light the 2 phones Kettle was broken Toilet was too high and hurt my legs when using it Not enough lighting in the room I had to use my mobile light to see to switch the air conditioning up or down In the end it was too noisy and I had to turn it off Quilt was too thin for winter use with no air conditioning on Breakfast was barely warm with overcooked bacon which had dried out No ordinary tea bags provided and not enough milk cartons Towels were scratchy and hard, extremely comfy bed Lovely shampoo conditioner magnified mirror in the bathroom Thick curtains to create a dark room super comfy couch separate shower Iron and board and hairdryer already in the room
191871,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, On arrival staff couldn t find my booking I also did not find them to be incredibly welcoming I also was not able to be given an umbrella which I would have though that in a city with wether like London they would have more then enough for all their guests Very nice hotel I just think the service was not up to the standard of other hotels I have stayed in of similar quality and price, Bathroom was very well renovated Warm beds were comfortable Good amenities and really nice complentary chocolates 
191872,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The staff No English for room service which meant trying to enjoy my Christmas dinner in my room wasn t delightful at all having to wait for the right desert and for them having to phone back cause they didn t understand English I also didn t really enjoy the food too plain and also expensive Also the jacuzzi was very cold on Christmas Day , The room was extra cosy and comfy and the bathroom was amazing with the shower and bath Also I did enjoy the sauna and steam room and jacuzzi when it was warm To be fair I liked the looking of the hotel inside and outside Very clean too 
191873,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Airconditioning choosing and getting the desired temperature is not easy, Location location location Very nice and modern the design is rather cold 
191874,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Breakfast Always seemed very busy with queues for tables and is not worth the 20 GBP price full or the 15 GBP continental Finishes sharp at 10am weekdays okay if you re there on business but as lazy tourists we often missed it We either ate at the Weatherspoons across the street where a full English is about 5 GBP and available until 12 or in the hotel bar area where you can get scrambled eggs for a fraction of the breakfast price , Our room 1016 was possibly the best we ve ever had in London for our family of two adults and a 13 year old Very spacious with two good sized double beds Nicely decorated Decent bathroom Excellent value Location was fine Ten minutes walk to St Katharines Docks and the Tower about 7 mins to Aldgate tube and 5 to Tower Hill A couple of good express supermarkets a Starbucks and other facilities within 5 minutes walk Staff were very helpful at all times Informative concierge service Bar area was useful for out of restaurant hours snacks and drinks We didn t try the spa or pool facilities 
191875,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, I have dietary intolerances and when I made a request for noodle stir fry the noodles were substituted for penne pasta I wasn t asked and it was not really what I wanted but because I was hungry and late I ate it I did bring it up with the staff and they just said it was because the noodle had gluten which was is fine but I would have preferred to have been told so I could change my order , Reception staff welcoming and friendly
191876,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, There could have been more information about the street parking I e Reference to using pay by phone app for meter parking There could also have been a better choice on the supplementary milk in the room i e Semi skimmed,No Positive
191877,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Nothing Breakfasts a little pricey but it s london , Booked it as a present for my mums 60th birthday They left a little cake for her and a requested a top floor room with views which they accommodated for me This is the second time I ve booked with this place and they don t dissapoint Rooms huge amazing location and great views
191878,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Room service food was not so great , The staff were excellent and the room spacious modern and clean One of the best hotels we have stayed in in London and much cheaper than usual 
191879,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Queueing for the lifts at peak time 11am was my only down side as with a pram we couldn t use the stairs Easily avoidable though, Excellent hotel in great location Rooms were nice and clean and staff helpful Nice to have access to pool etc for such a reasonable price
191880,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, There is a smoke scar on the bath tub in room 301 The receptionist looks pretty but lack of patience maybe because I can t speak English well , Facilities location tub
191881,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The heating was on all night We was sweating And we couldn t control it , Location good Train station round corner Wetherspoon restaurant next door
191882,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Shower not cleaned hairs on handshower old water left in the electric kettle Not working water temprerature adjustment in the bath so children were not able to use it only hot water , Wonderfull location Close to the underground makes your trip around the London very easy 
191883,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic hotel very nice big room great bathroom superb wiev very happy with our stay the location was a bit unclear until we found the right busses near the hotel then that was great aswell
191884,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Nothing, Birthday trip away and staff made it even better by giving us a fantastic room on floor 12 and even left a little birthday cake too Spa was fantastic Such a lovely hotel and highly recommended
191885,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly staff explained everything clearly professionally The room was clean comfortable very well presented I enjoyed my stay would stay again
191886,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Arrived to a poor reception I felt like I was waiting to purchase something at Argos I was greeted with a next No eye contact no warmth or feeling or customer service At breakfast they run out of food and queues waited for them to replenish Xmas trees were shown no love they couldn t be bothered to make them pretty They offered complementary robes and slippers but you had to call down for them to be delivered Room service was an automatic 4 charge So I have the money to the person delivering the food until at the end of my stay they added the delivery there Basicallly I paid twice Shower settings come with three dials Pls use the top one for head middle one stomach lower body I turned the middle one first to find myself and floor soaked Oh well I they must like guest to guess They have a mini bar in room but no room for your personal stuff or a separate fridge As a result I was knocked at 13 30 but a very hostile person stated he s come to check mini bar When challenged he stated there was movevement in fridge which triggered alarm downstairs I soon told him to go away Be careful when putting your own stuff in mini bar Wouldn t use again this hotel even if they gave me a 50 discount Gutted as i said there for four nights over Xmas thinking it would be the best , Room service food was good arrived hot Location perfect 
191887,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Only one thing is we stayed for 2 nights on our first night in the morning the cleaners came into our room which wasnt pleasant , Best hotel i have been too Great service and staff are always very helpful the rooms are great and the facilities are great too especially the swimming pool and jacuzzi I would recommend this to anyone it is worth the money as soon as you step inside staff are friendly and want to always help you with everything 
191888,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Room curtains had to remain closed as this particular room was in an internal corner so windows were overlooked from the lift lobby on the floor , Room and bed were both comfortable Good luggage storage after checkout Pool was a bonus 
191889,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Check in felt more like airport security rather than arrival as a guest at a luxury hotel I would expect robes to be in the room rather than having to request which took 2 calls to chase up Also there was only 1 pair of slippers in our room and none in our dads room would expect 2 pairs in each Rather frugal with teabags bottled water and would have liked a small fridge to chill water and allow fresh milk for tea No body wash in bathroom Shower cubicle doors didn t close properly and water seeped under and completely soaked bathroom floor so had to lay down towels to soak it up Phoned for room service and was passed around to several places before reaching a slightly grumpy staff member who didn t seem too happy to take our order definitely not what I would expect especially in a 5 star hotel The pool and facilities were great but unfortunately far from peaceful or relaxing due to screaming children and a group of men dive bombing and being very loud There was also a woman straddling her partner in the whirlpool which was highly inappropriate and the discomfort of others was obvious The lack of a lifeguard or some kind of patrol definitely allowed for behaviour to get out of hand which personally spoiled the whole pool experience for me , The rooms were beautiful and a birthday slice of cake was there on arrival which was a lovely gesture Room service was lovely pancakes with bacon and maple syrup were perfect Bed was huge and so comfortable
191890,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, If the staff knew that sterling is valid and the same value as pound it would have been much easier Had to wait 15mins just to check in so they can call the manager to confirm its ok to take , Bed was comfy
191891,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Think the price for breakfast if not included in the room rate on the pricey side , The convenience of having Spa facilities on site The complimentary birthday cake was a surprise and lovely addition Friendly staff concierge helpful and made us as a family feel welcome 
191892,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, Cleanness of the swimming pool and the sauna is really good In the room you don t have bath robes but you have to ask for it from the reception 
191893,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Reception Spa staff polite and professional But in their bid to maintain this no warmth or smile behind the welcome Check in was a little slow via a tablet at the front desk Photo ID needed and all the room guests had to leave details and sign in rather than the lead guest More staff available at check out around 11am as a busy time This was quite an expensive stay but comparable with other London hotels within this rating and I would stay again, Great location just a short walk from Tower Hill tube and DLR station Requested a high floor allocated room on 14th floor with wonderful views over the City of London and The Shard Spotless rooms bathroom Lovely pool and spa facilities Weatherspoons next door ideal for a reasonably priced breakfast
191894,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Tube station is a bit of a walk away But Taxi s passing on a regular basis , Great facilities Attentive staff Nice Pool Steam Room open late to unwind after a long day in London 
191895,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Bed was uncomfortable concierge was nervous and shy and didn t welcome us well Reception smells like chlorine Staff were not great ie the bartender drank the dregs out of the cocktail shaker he made our drinks in in front of us Breakfast staff confused and hard to communicate to Dirty room service trays still outside the corridor at 10am Lunch buffet was terrible beige bland and uninspiring , The shower and Receptionists on check in and check out
191896,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, A staff member entered room with one knock and walked straight in at half 9 in the evening and we had a baby and was in bed asking if we wanted tea or coffee quite loudly, Very friendly and clean
191897,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, Could write for a long time explaining how perfect this hotel is first time here Inside and out was beautiful hotel spa room and the view was perfect and staff were so polite friendly happy and helpful Highly recommend 10 10 
191898,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Room not initially set up with 3 of everything cups etc Despite booking for 3 Slow response to our request for another mug , Room size and thickness of curtain Comfortable and easy to sleep Ideal location

191907,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Mattress was a little too firm for my liking , Lovely big beds shower was lovely nice view from the 7th floor Staff very helpful Room temperature was perfect 
191908,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, For the cost and everything else that s good about the hotel the cooked breakfast buffet style at 20 is a real disappointment can t even choose how to have your eggs Had a much better breakfast at Premier Inn for less than half the price , It s a very nice hotel comfortable clean Good room service

191910,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The food was not so great However we complained about the food and gave us a refund Other than that there was nothing we did not like, Great value for money Same class as Hilton hotels etc Never had such accommodating and friendly staff in a hotel before We were extremely impressed with the staff We also got upgraded to the executive room View was great had a view of the Shard and Gherkin Big rooms twin room had 2 double beds Great spa and gym We were allowed to use the spa on the day of departure 
191911,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, There are so many rules and regulations that the hotel felt more like an expensive holiday park They seem not to be able to handle the amount of guests Waiting lines at reception elevator and breakfast Even the staff had difficulties in dealing with their own rules I had to make a big effort to pay for breakfast and I found them sometimes impatient and too agitated , The view is beautiful and the pool is fantastic 
191912,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, Check in was very well done and enjoyed having bonus of an upgrade Leisure facilities were superb Complimentary hair body products nice quality Magazines in room bathrobe slippers nice extra and useful for using leisure facilities Overall lovely stay Thank you 
191913,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Group of four friends meeting in London but not travelling together The room was booked in my name We arrived at separate times and although they had the booking number my details and confirmation email were unable to check in without me Eventually sorted out with great difficulty by a 15 minute phone call on the train as I had no signal to email them as they had informed my friend she had to get me to do in order for her to check in Disappointing given the star rating of the hotel the fact that the room was booked for 4 people and my pregnant friend was made to wait in reception whilst all of this was resolved Perhaps an email prior to arrival asking for other guests names would be useful if this is the policy as obviously not all groups arrive together , Good location Great views Good option for room of four 
191914,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The breakfast was great but I just felt there could of been better However it may be due to the fact that we arrived a bit late , Everything was perfect the staff were so friendly

191918,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The room was far from clean and there was stale milk left in the mini bar The area surrounding the hotel is not great , Close walking distance to City 
191919,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, We were thrilled when we received an unexpected upgrade on arrival The room was very nice we both slept very well Lovely pool area in the basement The staff were all very kind and responsive to any issues or requests Great place to spend our anniversary Will recommend to others Thank you

191921,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, We stayed for one night and we can t fault it Staff very friendly and helpful hotel clean and the room was excellent I will defiantly be recommending this hotel and we will be staying here again 
191922,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The immediate environment is not great it is not surrounded by shops and restaurants but a short walk away you will find them , Friendly reception at the door also at the desk Bag taken to the room for me Luxurious decor comfy bed 
191923,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The menu is not so good and very expensive I have paid 20 00 pounds for a breakfast very expensive I have got a terrible room 704 facing other ones without any privacy , Very close to my meeting point 
191924,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Baggage ticket was not passed from reception to concierge so we had to chase for them to be delivered to the room as we had to get to the theatre so ended up being a rush to get ready as we didn t get our bags for ages and because concierge didn t have the ticket they couldn t figure out which bags were ours which delayed it longer although concierge was very apologetic , Bed was so comfy shower was lovely great fire great location near Aldgate station
191925,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, It doesn t have much character perhaps due to the location and I feel that five star warrants a bit of character However it was five star in terms of service, Comfortable bed excellent quality of food from room service excellent 25m pool with child free hours efficient clean 
191926,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The location is not quite as near to the amenities as the hotel makes out the tube tower bridge etc, The room was excellent spacious and comfortable the gym and swimming pool were excellent and the staff were efficient and friendly 
191927,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The bed sheets and bin bags were not cleaned out while me and my friend were out I find it wrong that you charge 50 to use the fridge in the rooms to just store things such as yohhurts That price is disgusting Other than that it was all good , The room was perfect everything was already prepared and clean I would recommend this hotel 
191928,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The only think i didnt like was the breakfast The food wasnt good enough for the money we had to pay , Ive loved the staff they were all very friendly and very polite Also i loved the pool area its beautiful 
191929,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Pillows weren t the best , Great location Staff very helpful especially Vicktor Lucifier Andrei The accessible room was fantastic very spacious and plenty of room to move a hoist around the room Bathroom shower tray flush to floor Just a very small lip to get into the bathroom 
191930,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, There were only one slippas provided in 2 rooms I usually stay with New Grange St Paul s and this hotel did not matck up with the level or comfort of St Paul s I will probably stick to New Grange St Paul s from the next trip , Location is relatively good 
191931,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, View was a little obscure but could just make out certain landmarks guess being higher might have helped On departure waiting for the lift was a joke spent 10 minutes watching it go up and down past our floor, We were celebrating our wedding anniversary Cake on arrival was a nice touch Bed very comfy Bathroom very nice
191932,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The bar food was awful Everything was very bland and tasteless Couldn t finish my food Dont get the tapas it all tastes the same The pool was very very cold and wasn t very relaxing as there were kids and parents being quite loud Robes and slippers were not given to us in the spa so we had to go up to our room in just a towel There was only a few people eating in the main restaurant which made us feel a bit uncomfortable it wasn t a particularly good atmophere so we moved to the bar area Also the food and drink looked quite expensive , The room was a good size clean and comfortable The staff were very friendly helpful and attentive Also had lots of extra features very good tv settings iplayer and youtube etc and the shower was amazing It was a calm and relaxing atmosphere in most places Quite good value for money They let us check out later 12 free of charge which was very good of them The sauna foot spa jacuzzi and steam room were all really nice and relaxing Overal good facilities in the spa Also the changing rooms were a good size and had hairdryers 
191933,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Good was absolutely disgusting all of it I had to send it back Then I ordered breakfast and it never came Room service never answer the phone , Easy check in That was about it 
191934,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, We were told we were on level 13 then level 9 then we got level 10 next to the staff lift awful all night and morning the lift was going If the deal was to include breakfast then let s say it would have been better , The room was nice but the location of the room 1023 was next to the staff lift 
191935,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Breakfast was quite expensive but it looked nice and plenty to choose from We always like to go out for breakfast and there are plenty of good places in the neighbourhood , The pool and spa facilities were very nice a 25m lap pool with 3 lanes and a nice jacuzzi Kids are only allowed in the pool at certain times which we liked as it allows for a nice relaxing swim The free wifi was very good and extremely fast Best hotel wifi I ever encoutered Location was great in a nice neighbourhood with enough shops pubs and restaurants and close to the subway so it s easy to get around London 
191936,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, There were three of us staying in the room but there was only two of everything so we had to ask for more towels etc There were only two mugs initially and two sets of tea and coffee The rooms could benefit from more storage space , The staff were very helpful and attentive We stayed for a birthday and they surprised us with a birthday cake in the room when we returned The hotel was spotlessly clean and very modern We ate breakfast in the bar area and this was much better value than eating in the main restaurant The food was excellent and drinks in the evening were reasonably priced for a hotel in central London The location is brilliant for visiting the Tower of London and is close to tube and rail stations Views from the room were excellent 
191937,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Too hot rooms No windows can t be open and aircon can t be adjusted My 3rd and last time at this hotel as each time same problem with too hot temperature in rooms Insane,No Positive
191938,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, We did not buy the breakfast too expensive and actually did not eat at hotel at all I had to ice my ankle every night and had to go down one floor for the ice machine , We stayed here before a cruise and saved lots of booking through Booking com Lovely spacious room and very quiet We used the pool hot tub sauna which is complementary I discovered their neat swim suit spinner in the changing room so our swimsuits dryed overnight A short walk brings you to Tower of London and we got there early and beat the summer crowds Lots of nice places to eat nearby A great breakfast place is just across the street we ate there twice 
191939,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, 2am 4am Saturday morning drunk people banging doors down along the corridor on level 5 No security Been woken up several times , Facilities were fantastic 
191940,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The bottom sheet on the bed did not fit as it was a lovely pillow top bed but a normal sheet Annoying though with the sheet pulling up all the time and it looks tacky when you can see the mattress Plus my daughter had a baby cot and they did not change her sheets or even fold her sheet for the three nights we were there which I thought was not good enough I could have called about it but it was too late each time we got back and I had to just put her to bed Baby cots should be serviced along with the rest of the room , The room was lovely and big The beds were excellent The bathroom was nice and modern with a great shower Great location for Tower of London and tower bridge A very enjoyable stay 
191941,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The shower cubicle door didn t close fully and some water escaped onto the floor of the bathroom The door just needed an extra tug , Spacious room very comfortable bed spotlessly clean
191942,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, After having a mix up issue in which I booked the hotel for the same day when I meant to book it for the month after for my girlfriends birthday I decided to call the hotel in hopes of them being able to change the dates of my stay They told me this was not possible and blamed the policy of booking com even though after speaking with a representative of booking com myself who called the hotel and was told they would not allow me to change the dates They then told me to call in the morning when I told them I was a student and this was for my girlfriend However I know it was just an excuse to make sure the time passed and I came up as a no show on their accounts and was charged anyway I was told basically to jog on in the morning and am now 150 down because of it Absolute scam , Nothing
191943,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The cocktails are very expensive which we didn t mind paying but they were the smallest ones we have ever had and they weren t that good , The spa facilities are excellent The cleanliness was second to none 
191944,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Staff Shocking the entire week Most could barely speak English Pool only available to the kids at certain times and constantly being used as a lap pool which was a problem Breakfast was like a student canteen Hotel used for Hen parties and not at all what we were looking for as a family friendly hotel not happy at all , Location was good for a start of the week and seeing London Tower and Tower Bridge 
191945,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, They forgot to give us a luggage ticket before we checked in so finding our luggage was a mess They told us on the room phone that they would order is a taxi for 7pm and when we went down there there was no taxi ordered and we was nearly late for the show , Facilities were clean room was clean and everything worked was a nice place
191946,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, The staff were all very friendly I would also like to thank the hotel for taking note of my request I stayed at the hotel with a friend who had a special birthday and I asked if there was anything the hotel could do to make it an extra special stay On arrival there was a birthday message and a piece of cake in our room This was much appreciated Thank you
191947,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Breakfast could have been included for the price , Good location near to St Katherine s dock with good restaurants etc Close to the Thames and Tower Hill tube Great view from room on 12th floor Nice pool
191948,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, We had noisy children running round above our room at 11 30 pm I phoned reception and they dealt with it but they did it again second nyt unbelieveable people so inconsiderate to others , Leisure facilities

191950,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, If you don t book breakfast it will cost 15 for continental or 20 for full English Even if you just want a bit of bacon for a sandwich , Good location nice staff good size room clean and tidy excellent wifi service 
191951,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Nothing really , Facilities were very good for leisure Rooms were excellent and we were offered a larger room when we requested this thank you We would certainly look to use this hotel again and would like to know if you have deals at any time 
191952,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is in an excellent location Close to the Tower of London and tube For a hotel in a busy city the room at night was very quite Which lead to a good nights sleep 
191953,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, It was tough to end the stay on a difficult note We had arranged with the hotel a few days earlier to have a car to drive us to the airport Pick up time was early due to the early departure of our flight The car never showed So of course there was much stress Ultimately we were on our way in a taxi Communication and verification by the staff that scheduled this for us would be a critical suggestion for future guests of the hotel , The hotel facility was very nice The room and bed was very comfortable The breakfast was good quality The pool and spa were especially nice The location was very good 
191954,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Food was expensive, Comfortable beds very clean and smart interior Lovely gym and pool Nice smart tv and media system where you can plug in your own devices via usb etc Near tube line tower bridge and tower of London Great for relaxing and visiting our capital 
191955,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Nothing , My stay was absolutely brilliant Would have loved to stay longer My party lived the place and would definitely love to visit again it was so clean and staff were very friendly and helpful 
191956,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Some of the staff were rude and unhelpful Swimming times for the kids not great only allowed to swim between 10 12 2 4pm so if they wanted to swimanyother time not allowed despite being accompanied by parents On our last day it was disastrous phone and Internet in our room did not work even the water pressure was low could not have a bath had a Luke warm shower Complained to one of the managers who told us there s not much he could do offered no explanation until later on when we spoke to the duty manager who said the server was down but did not make sense as there was internet on the other floor and reception , Facilities great great pool and spa location great due to close proximity to the train station walking distance The duty manager on the 16 07 forgot his name was great we had some privacy issues managed to resolve them and upgrade our room which had great views of the gerkin and tower hill bridge 
191957,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Got confused with the Grange City Hotel thought that was where we were staying when we booked the Tower Grange Had nicer views from the window in other hotels, Location and comfort of room 
191958,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Ability to check in earlier we did request at booking but weren t able to at arrival, Bed was huge room was roomy shower was special and staff everywhere were friendly and helpful
191959,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, We like to have a nightcap after a long day of sight seeing There was no ice available for us to get on our own We needed to call room service for a bucket of ice They acted as if this was a strange request If there was an empty shelf in the fridge to use for personal use would be nice I found it difficult to use the fridge without knocking things over A wash cloth supplied with the towels is a good idea An extra luggage stand would be helpful , The bed was comfortable Liked the drapes they kept the room dark the way I like it 
191960,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The wifi on the tv kept going off There could be more activities for kids like pool table or table tennis or other activities , The swimming pool and massaging really liked The beds were very comfortable 
191961,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, the minibar wasn t open to use , the room was excellent I went out part way through the evening when I returned there were chocolates on my pillow 
191962,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Nothing , Right next to Tower Bridge nice restaurant next door walking distance to Underground prompt service nice facilities and the SWIMMING POOL 
191963,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Lifts weren t reliable They didn t always stop at your floor Loud hen parties that woke us up at 3am going to their room , Rooms were sparkling clean as they should be Not all hotels meet this level 25m pool and well stocked gym 
191964,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Nothing , Excellent fab hotel Great location Loved everything about this hotel Only a few mins from Tower Hill stop really great staff Great food Definitely stay here 
191965,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Would have liked nibbles such as olives to be available after 10pm to accompany drinks , The views and staff were great Brilliant to have a 24 hour bar 
191966,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Noisy group of friends between 3 30 and 4 30am kept us awake and I had to report the noise to the reception twice V disappointing as one of the reasons we booked in was for a good nights sleep, Facilities Location
191967,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The breakfast was overpriced so we tended to use the wetherspoons pub next door , check in was efficient on arrival the room was spacious with good facilities We used the pool in the leisure club which was great after a long day sightseeing location of the hotel was a short walk from the Tower of London and recommended for sightseeing 
191968,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, TV channels were limited but not a TV addict There is a 12 5 service charge added so no need to then tip I assume the staff get this shared out , Location ideal for getting to Tower Thames or the Tube Service top notch afternoon Tea was extravagant but hey u only live once Meals both in Bar Grill were excellent Room and bathroom area was clean bed was mega comfy we switched off the aircon Use the stairs down at peak times as lifts were full Used pool sauna steam room never got round to the gym but looked pretty modern Staff were all helpful and smiley 
191969,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, In a 5 star hotel I would expect bottled water gowns in the room The wait for the lift was long as there only two lifts servicing the guests in this large hotel The pot plant looked tired on the 11th floor Rather don t have plants if they can t be pristine in a 5 star hotel , The Happy Birthday slice of cake was a lovely touch Room was sound proof quiet everything very clean Staff at reception very polite and friendly Didn t use the spa gym etc so can t comment Also didn t have breakfast so can t comment on the food service Nice hotel but no WOW factor really 
191970,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, I was a little disappointed that when I booked I booked an executive that was suppose to come with complementary robes which I never did get when we tried on numerous occasions to contact reception from the room phone there was never an answer no matter what number we tried we only had one plug socket working in the whole room which was nobodies fault and was rectified when we went out and let them know down on reception The lift waiting on check out is a little long there is only two and took a while but a bit of patience goes along way Spending the amount I did would ve liked a higher up room with a better view could ve really booked a cheaper room and pretty much had the same , The room was beautiful hotel staff very friendly on arrival Good location too 
191971,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Not much the only thing I can think of is that the bathroom floor tiles were really slippy even when they weren t wet and the shower is a bit teeny , The bed were really comfortable Had the best sleep both nights Location is perfect 
191972,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Hotel Car parking would be useful as had to pay to park it round the corner so could become costly if stayed more that one night , Fantastic staff very polite and great facilities
191973,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, I had booked a couples massage however it was very rushed I paid 90 for both and my back is still in agony I think she may have been a trainee but I wont be using the spa treatments again , Very clean bed was comfortable all was as expected 
191974,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Only two lifts could do with more , Excellent Hotel in a great location Very clean very polite staff and the such a quiet comfortable room For such a large Hotel we very very surprised at how quiet our room was Just what we needed after a very long day out The lovely Spa facilities are a definite plus also 
191975,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, A bigger room for a quadruple and slightly closer location I thought I had booked the City Grange hotel by Tower Hill , If was a very quiet room as requested Pleasant staff
191976,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, We stayed for one night having travelled down to see family in the London Marathon the hotel was great the staff were friendly and couldn t do enough for you the room was clean the bed was so comfortable and all of the facilities are second to none We ate food in the restaurant and the bar and on both occasions were excellent Would stay here again and definitely recommend to anyone 
191977,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, the receptionist told my driver I left already the hotel in order I was obliged to take one driver of his Thanks God my driver phoned me on my mobile phone and I informed him I was still in the room , the position of the hotel
191978,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The mattress was too firm for my liking For a 4 hotel I think they could provide better tea and coffee facilities in the room Four little containers of milk for a couple is barely adequate And don t say I can always ring for more I really shouldn t need to , Lovely to find a 25m swimming pool at a hotel The room was spotless The room was a good size and didn t feel at all cramped like some city hotel rooms do 
191979,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Booked a room for 4 but had essentials for two people we had to keep calling for the extra two The hotel was so busy once they forgot we had to call again , Location location was good I loved the bathroom and shower kkkkk The staff were marvellous too
191980,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Reception Staff very regimental no interaction sign this name etc Not very polite When we checked out it was did you enjoy your stay never looked up from the screen Then just said your room is all paid up No thank you , Comfy room
191981,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The one thing was that at busy times it can take a little wait for the lifts as there are only two but nothing so bad , Can t say enough about this place they have and think of everything you need Incredible location and value for money so many nice hotels in London are just ridiculous prices and it s nice to see such a great hotel that people can enjoy and is still affordable Not just catering to the rich Love it and will always stay here 
191982,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, I stayed in the Grange Tower Bridge last weekend and while it is comfortable and clean lets be clear that it is certainly no luxury 5 star hotel by any regular standards of those who travel frequently for business or leisure and there are many 4 hotels I have been to throughout Europe that equal or exceed it However by average London standards it is passable Areas where this hotel really fell short for me are 1 Invasive room services We came back to the hotel in an evening and it has been cleaned and the beds made Great I then made my bed comfortable in the way I like it with untucking the duvet and removing all of the excess cushions etc and went out to dinner However during the time we were out to dinner the hotel staff AGAIN came into our room and re made the bed and put a survey paper on top of the pillow Not only do I find it ridiculous and that hotel staff feel the need to come back into our room while we are out to dinner but to then re make the bed and put dirty paper on my pillow after I had already cleared it away and made things how I like it is a step too far and have never known of any other hotel to do this I was extremely unimpressed In fact I find it invasive and intrusive that people repeatedly came into our room outside of the usual cleaning hours without our request 2 Breakfast is an extortionate 20 for a cooked breakfast buffet DO NOT BUY IT Typical London 5 hotel rip off prices for what is a mass cooked buffet breakfast of distinctly less than average quality I know a certain purple budget hotel chain whose breakfasts far exceed this in quality There is a Wetherspoons pub around the corner that do great fresh cooked breakfasts for 5 and I highly recommend you go there instead 3 2 of the 3 lifts were out of order for most of the 2 days I was there , The location is good and they upgraded us to an executive room for no extra charge
191983,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Staff were at best civil and the breakfast was very poor for the price The food was cold and tea was served from jugs rather than individual pots , We got a good rate and the rooms were very comfortable The spa was also good and the location whilst boring in its surroundings at the weekend was central enough so it was easy to get everywhere 
191984,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, If I had to find something it would be the lift issue Bit difficult at busy periods , Everything was on point Room service beds comfort staff special requests etc were all met and exceeded Cannot fault the hotel at all apart from the lifts taking ages during busy times but this was expected Very well done to all staff in my opinion 
191985,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Consierce was a little slow when we arrived to put our bags away we explained we were in a rush they did not seem happy about this and on return to check in and collect the bags was told I may have to fill out a lost property form It was all a mountain made out of a molehill but in their attempt to be efficient they just weren t and were jumping the gun before we had even explained there was only two bags to collect, The views were stunning and the facilities very nice We were upgraded as soon as we arrived to a superior double room on the 12th floor Staff extremely friendly We ordered room service and the food was amazing couln t fault it 
191986,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, In particular reception were not helpful and we often had to ask several times Example 4 bed room with 4 people only 2 towels and two cups Had to phone down 3 times for them to bring extra towels and cups , Hotel rooms were good beds comfortable
191987,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, 20 00 per person for a cooked breakfast is appaulling especially as there are so many other places in the area to have a breakfast more in the same street for 1 4 of the price , Beds were great we asked for a triple room and got 2 x double room instead not ideal Spa was lovely 
191988,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, The staff were so lovely left us a birthday cake in our room for my boyfriend and gave us a room with the most stunning views of London The hotel is immaculate and I will definitely be returning
191989,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Nothing , We were made to feel so welcome the room was great with a stunning view nice little touches like the slice of birthday cake in the room for my Mum were much appreciated Will definitely return 
191990,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, I asked for a high floor room but ended up with 3rd floor room and a view of a brick wall Spent just over 300 in total for the room and the spa Bluetooth Wifi and TV didn t work , the interior design was lovely and the staff were very friendly
191991,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Clearer details on the parking would be useful It was really close and easy to find but details could be on the website, Wonderful room friendly staff who wanted to help and great feel to the place Felt it was great value and enjoyed by both of us
191992,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Nothing to report, The staff were really welcoming rooms were clean and tidy and spacious The swimming sauna facilities were brilliant Food was excellent and bar prices for beer was reasonable for this sort of hotel 
191993,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Slightly far from the tube station but I use Uber so wasn t a problem , Such a great hotel the swimming pool was great to start your day I forgot my toothbrush etc and I just called reception and someone brought some bits I needed to me Really comfortable and quiet Recommend highly 
191994,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, My only slight complaint was the bar area could have been a little more comfortable, There was a mix up with the room but the staff actually turned it into a positive by giving us a better room with a better view than I had initially payed for Very good service
191995,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Spa staff very unhelpful and unwelcoming I felt uncomfortable accessing the spa area and requested information regarding treatments availability staff struggled to understand me and were very abrupt , Rooms and reception staff great views from room amazing Staff put a happy birthday cake in the room for my daughters birthday such a lovely touch 
191996,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Bed was a bit hard and duvet cover was thin Swimming pool water was very cold and the steam room as not that steamy , Great location friendly staff clean well appointed room

191998,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The location of the hotel is long if going by public transport as it not easy to find however driving there will be fine Check out is really early not so great meaning you can t go use the facilities again in the morning unfortunately, The Service is excellent as well as the greeting from the staff as soon as you enter right up to reception facilities i e The Spa was amazing and really relaxing 
191999,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Staff where rubbish especially in the restaurant where we did complain about the poor service There was a mistake in our booking we somehow booked for the Friday and not the Friday We were shown no sympathy and had to pay for the two night at normal rate At breakfast we were included to have continental as we did only to learn that everyone else was helping themselves to full English and not be challenged Would not return , Location Porters where very helpful
192000,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, I like everything, I took my daughter to the hotel for her 12th birthday I emailed the hotel prior to our stay they left a cake in the room and gave us an upgrade the staff are wonder the hotel is in a perfect location for site seeing and we had an amazing day would defo re book and stay again 
192001,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Not being able to have the option of booking breakfast, It would be great if you could book breakfast at the same time as booking the room for a reasonable price 
192002,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The price of the breakfast although you can get a great value breakfast from the Chamberlain Hotel on Minories a short walk away, Very clean and quiet room very helpful staff It s a short walk to either Aldgate or Tower Hill tube Good location for most of London s main sights 
192003,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, We had difficulty understanding the girl at reception who checked us in she had a really strong accent and spoke very quickly after asking her to repeat herself several times we walked away with only 50 of the information she d told us , How close it is located to London Tower and the cleanliness of the hotel everything was sparkling 
192004,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, No parking but minories car park good only 100M away Quilts thin on beds, Nice clean rooms comfortable Pool excellent for kids although Water cold in main pool Breakfast excellent although expensive
192005,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, 80 for 4 breakfasts was a little steep and so weatherspoons next door had us and I am sure many more have chosen this option It was very expensive for breakfast especially when we ate at a celebrity chef restaurant the night we were in London for 4 course for 30 and he is a tv chef etc We thought 80 was not money well spent on this occasion and did not reflect other restaurant breakfasts in compatible hotels Waited 1 5 hours for our dressing gowns to arrive as we had asked at the reception As we wanted to use the spa They did not arrive so we went to the spa anyway in the end and they phoned for us and they arrived within a few minutes Wish we had known rather than wait for 1 5 hrs , all the amenities and the staff were great lovely clean hotel spa nice addition to our trip Lovely hot choc in the bar on a cold winters day Express check in The spa and gowns and slippers Conceige for storing luggage while still being able to do the tourist things Overall a lovely stay and would use Grange hotels again

192008,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Cost of breakfast was expensive could it have been included in room rate , Bed was comfy curtains thick and dark Love extra facilities of pool and spa and the staff were all very polite and helpful 
192009,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The hotel send you an email allowing you to express check in when you get there this is pointless and not even recognised by the check in staff not a major problem just a little niggling annoyance really , Great hotel good location just a 5 minute walk from Tower Bridge set back a little from the main roads Check in was easy enough wifi was good we didn t have the breakfast but there looked to be ok with a good choice rooms had a good contemporary feel bathroom was nice and the bed was very comfortable 
192010,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The only dislike was the lift service I definitely believe two additional lifts would benefit the facility , My stay with my partner was absolutely amazing From the moment we walked in the intensity of the establishment really took us away The friendly staff whom welcomed us upon arrival Booking in was fast and efficient Staying in one of their many superior double rooms we were amazed once open the door The first perception was 10 out of 10 The room was very modern with up to date technology and a business type aura The bed Heaven We also used the luxury spa which we cannot wait to return to A beautiful swimming area jacuzzi sauna steam room and more Such a relaxing end to such and amazing getaway 
192011,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, Everything was very good i enjoyed the stay and extremely happy to have an upgraded room All the team were very polite and friendly The only moan i have was that the house white wine was absolutely vile i ordered two large glasses expecting it to be a nice wine considering the standard of the hotel was actually very good Shame 
192012,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, There wasn t anything I didn t like Maybe better smoking section for the cold weather, the bed was really comfy and I had a excellent nights sleep

192016,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Lighting in swimming pool rather sad especially at the far end which looked dingy Would have liked a continental breakfast to have been included in the price , Wonderfully comfortable beds in a decent sized room We were delighted to be upgraded to two queen size beds rather than the standard twin we had reserved Polite helpful staff 
192017,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, When busy the lifts weren t great had to use the stairs a few times as lift kept going past our floor even when I ve been pressing the button, Room was very clean and comfy staff were great spa and pool was second to none
192018,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel,No Negative, I loved how accommodating the staff were and the fact you could use the hotels facilities both before and after check in out The staff were also exceptionally helpful and friendly Very reasonably priced and will definitely be staying here again when next staying in London 10 10 for me cannot be faulted
192019,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, I think there should be more spaces for spa facilities such as massages If that means spending more money on staff and rooms that would have made my stay even better , Bed was comfy Food was delicious but a little over priced for a continental breakfast when I only ate some fruit and a pastry 
192020,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Nothing , Fantastic value for money Wonderful hot breakfast super comfy beds lovely view fab facilities very pleasant and helpful staff everything was top quality and spotlessly clean 
192021,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The bed was a bit hard however some people prefer different things but me and my partner prefer softer beds and the pool was a big cold so we just stayed in the hot tub most the time However it didnt bother us this hotel is beautiful and great for the money , Ii stayed here with my boyfriend as you come in they are very welcoming easy to understand the rooms are very spacious and the bathroom is very well done out nice big bath and a lovely mirror The big window is beautiful to look out of a night as were we at the top floor very clean very modern Tesco and Sainsbury were just around the corner easy to get to from tower gateway weatherspoons pretty much next door which was easy to go eat there and a few drinkkypoos P the spa was beautiful and clean all in all was the best hotel ive been to great vaule for money I would stay here again
192022,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Nothing really not to like but just note Breakfast expensive not a problem with a Witherspoons next door Just a few more beds in the pool area when only 6 to start with , Large clean modern hotel Lovely free to use of gym pool jacuzzi sauna even after checking out Free upgrade to double twin with double beds even on st vals night 
192023,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Bar area is very basic and if seated in the lounge opposite the bar there is no waiting service A la carte menu not available the excuse was Valentine s weekend and the set food menu had limited choices nothing special in taste certainly not 5 star cooking Breakfast was also overrated with very limited choices for its price Hotel location does not give it an advantage especially on the lower floors we stayed on the 2nd and there wasn t even a hotel car park or at least a service to drive our car to and from the car park , Pool Sauna
192024,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Hardly any toiletries in the bathroom barely enough shower gel for 1 person Hotel does not even provide bottled free water in room Bit stingy for London Early check out time on a Sunday No flexibility at all on this, Great spa Central and super convenient location 
192025,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Water didn t need to be 5 Swimming facilities were a lot smaller than the pictures a but decieving Restaurant staff seemed bland no emotion , The bed was very comfy Rooms thoroughly cleaned Homely Crossisants were extremely nice at breakfast 
192026,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Location is great for Tower Bridge area but getting to and from theatres etc was very difficult I felt sorry for the cab drivers as journeys were horrendous I cannot fault this hotel it is great but the location score is determined by what you are planning to do during your stay , The room was lovely exec double with very large bed and great shower Very comfy Spa was better than expected including steam rooms and long pool Treatments were also available 
192027,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, I didn t really like the fact that there were only two lifts The establishment is on 12 floors and there were only two lifts which meant you had to wait for ages especially when checking out I m not a fan of dark chocolate although it was a great gesture I also did not like the fact that the mini bar was closed You had to go downstairs to ask for it to be open and pay the entire fee whatever is not used would be refunded I m not impressed with that practice at all My view was terrible although having requested to be on a higher floor we were given the 5th floor facing the main road and my view was basically of the premier inn hotel For 100 per night I would have expected more , I liked the location as its close to Tower Hill and Tower Bridge 
192028,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, If we could of stayed longer, From the moment we arrived everything was perfect staff were lovely room was clean and had everything we would of needed the bed is huge and just right could of done with a firm pillow but that s personal preference and total black out curtains thickest I ve ever seen we ordered room service which arrived in about 25 30 mins huge big burgers that tasted lovely bathroom was very clean and lovely big bath and a rain drop walk in shower we ate breakfast across the road weatherspoons but hotel breakfast smelt lovely and many people were enjoying all in all a lovely hotel and defo worth another visit Very happy

192030,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Didnt like the sweet on pillow not the chocolate as in past stays not as classy 20 is far to much money for breakfast , Didnt have breakfast this time as it wasnt included but eaten it on previous stay always lovely

192036,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, The bar was abit on the small side when busy it put us off going there for the lack of available seating , The rooms were pristine condition comftable luxurious We couldn t hear any noise outside of our room wether it be from other guests or from the road below The bed was also amazing Had such a good nights sleep we missed breakfast 
192037,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Quite simply where was the rooftop bar , A warm greeting on arrival from consierge staff bags were collected immediatly and swift check in process Lifts were quick and accessible rooms were spacious clean and furnished to a good standard Customer service was good after making a coffee in the room staff knocked our door to replenish stocks 20mins later at no request of our own Shower was exciting didn t know where the next squirt was coming from perks of a power jet wash system Room had a sofa and lounge area which was utilised well Finally room service available 24 7 which proved tasty at 3am for a burger chips late night munch

192043,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Didn t feel like a 5 star experience but was a nice hotel Reception staff didn t speak the best English and the bar staff could do with drinks training as they didn t know what chambord was Struggling with translation he came back with actual fruit strawberry and raspberry which wasn t what we wanted , Great location and clean hotel
192044,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Breakfast a little disappointing I didn t expect tinned fruit at a 5 star hotel DIY toaster not set up properly after 4 passes through the bread was still white although very crisp Bar food very poor flaccid processed ham and a dollop of sweaty cheese on barely toasted bread does not constitute a croque monsieur , Very comfortable room well furnished and spotlessly clean Staff great very friendly and helpful Lots of bars and restaurants in the vicinity 
192045,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, We had to ask 3 times for champagne flutes and a charger They didn t have a choose of chocolate they only had kit Kat which was 2 50 3 00 A few dirty marks in the shower and hair all other the floor in the ladies changing rooms With a broken bin lid so bin was open with bits hanging out , We got upgraded which was nice Room was lovely and spacious Nice facilities and location is great only maximum 10 walk from fenchurch street

192055,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Not the best location for tube travel as a lot of changes are needed to get to the more touristy parts of London However this is down to where you d like to visit if you wanted to see landmarks such as the Tower of London the tower bridge and the embankment it s a Great Location also fairly close to St Paul s For food etc it s a great place with a 15 min walk to the embankment and places just over tower bridge , Great Value for money attentive staff and very clean

192063,Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, Atmosphere It was like being in a Vegas Hotel with large groups of Hen Parties Corporate Groups and other Party Groups dominating the bar areas and hanging around the lobby with luggage Food and attitude of restaurant staff My son was served a burger on a wooden board which was not clean When I complained the response was to blame me for some food I had shared with him I know the difference between strawberry jam and raspberry dressing The staff were rude and confrontational I preferred not to spoil our evening and so let it go to our cost The next day our son was violently sick , Facilities and location
