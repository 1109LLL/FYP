309843,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Great location within 5mins walk from Metro train station Next door to Ajax Stadium My second time staying at this hotel so it must be good Hotel is very modern with lots of high tech features Breakfast is good with plenty on offer Hotel bar and restaurant is also very good with a nice selection of beers etc There are plenty of nice restaurants near by and also an excellent IMAX Cinema I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quality mid range option 
309844,Jaz Amsterdam, Having to get ready in my car when the hotel room wasn t ready wasn t fun The cost of parking was high as well , The design of the suite was tastefully decorated Loved the modern feel to the room Loved the fender guitar and CD wall The bed was extremely comfy 
309845,Jaz Amsterdam, The way the rest of the personnel behaves Wearing a tshirt with a smooth operator does not really fit their behaviour The hotel should try and live up to their wannabe status and instruct their personnel, The way Wouter helped us out with the check in incident He is very customer friendly 
309846,Jaz Amsterdam, Location was a bit far from central Amsterdam you had to take a train that took around 20 minutes to get into the city other than that it was excellent , Staff were extremely friendly and welcoming The hotel was a 5 minute walk from the train station nearby It was extremely clean and modern The shower system in the room was out of this world it had electronic controls to set temperature and could have water come down from the roof rather than the shower head Bed was really comfy and everything about it was just nice
309847,Jaz Amsterdam, Door of the bathroom was broken half of it was missing We could have done without the dj at the checkin desk because it made communication difficult It s simply not a good idea to play loud music at a service counter Note that breakfasts are not included Paying for the breakfast was a big hassle , New and modern design hotel with attractive styling Spacious room Great amenities Nespresso coffee maker in your room USB charging points Large beds 
309848,Jaz Amsterdam, The taxi from city to the hotel was quite expensive in the night and they only take cash Get your own supplies of water and some snack as there is nothing really around , The room was spacious and very nicely done I liked everything in there and wish I could enjoy it more In comparison to other rooms you can find in Amsterdam this is absolutely great 
309849,Jaz Amsterdam, No bottled water in the room , Modern room with comfy seating area powerful shower and nespresso coffee maker Super clean hotel feels brand new Easy location near to Ajax Arena with easy direct metro to central and train directly to airport 
309850,Jaz Amsterdam, We couldn t regulate the room temperature and it was really cold Also the sink wasn t comfortable at all great looking and super modern but uncomfortable to use , Amazing room crazy comfortable I loved the bathroom design the shower was magic and the colours are wonderful liked a lot the coffee and tea machine 
309851,Jaz Amsterdam, Even though the hotel knew we ll arrive in a group of three people there were only two towels in the room They brought more when I asked but housekeeping took them away and again left us with two towels for the rest of our stay Shower has touch control sometimes I had to spend a minute to turn it off probably because of wet fingers Mobile app for some reason uses Bluetooth I expected NFC and sometimes fails to open a lock with various error messages , Room is nice There is a huge bed nice area near the window to relax with a cup of coffee btw Nespresso coffee machine is in the room and the capsules are refilled daily Food in the restaurant is good prices are slightly above average Metro station is just 400 meters away and a railway station which can take you to the airport is in 700 meters 
309852,Jaz Amsterdam, The location of the hotel was farther from the city center than anticipated It s a great place to stay if your stay is around a sporting event It s also not a comfortable walking distance to any restaurants if you re unfamiliar with the area , The hotel and rooms were cute and modern A lot nicer than anticipated 
309853,Jaz Amsterdam, Location is not very convenient but it do have close accesses to public transportation, It is a very styled hotel with nice design and good quality It suits my taste well 
309854,Jaz Amsterdam, The worst checking in experience in my life Zero organization very chaotic Took like 10 15 minutes per guest , Everything not related to the staff was excellent 
309855,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast was 15 bucks and altho it was good it could ve been a little more versatile Then again the Banana Milk they served was delicious , The bed is incredibly comfy and the Staff super nice and always willing to help and make your life even more comfy at Jaz I LOVED the room the bath room and shower NICE the TV as well as the windows I rarely give reviews like this but I honestly can t reakky think of anything they could ve done better They even got a free Sauna and Fitness Area The Train and Metro are running basically right outside the door and take you to Amsterdam Centraal in about 10 mins The trains and or Metro are running all night so you don t have to worry about not getting back to your Hotel Loved it 
309856,Jaz Amsterdam, The app and the communication that sounded like you could only use the app for checking in after 20 minutes I successfully checked in but not knowing if I had given my creditcard for payment or guarantee I was so happy to be able to speak to persons at the reception Would have been much easier and less frustrating, Nice hotel comfortabel bed good breakfast
309857,Jaz Amsterdam, The one and big drawback are dark walls in rooms There are black grey and dark orange The colours maybe are good for jaz concert but not to rest after work Everything was amazing but because of this darkness next time I will choose another hotel , Comfortable furniture in room place where you can sit and read close to windows and customized coffee application was the best 
309858,Jaz Amsterdam, air conditioning can only be switched off after calling the reception 3 times Then still a remaining sound of the installation remains all night long, nice modern rooms with view 
309859,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast was basic 7 30 breakfast on weekends was no good if you are catching a plane, Convenient to train metro station Dinner at hotel restaurant was good
309860,Jaz Amsterdam, Air con needs to be a bit colder other than that the hotel was amazing, The room was amazing Had A beautiful shower and sink Staff made the hotel feel like a home would go back again in a heart beat
309861,Jaz Amsterdam, The breakfast was not very rich in terms of variety of foods However what was offered was with very good quality and tasty Also thanks to booking com I knew that the breakfast was standard so I was not disappointed , The hotel has very nice and original interior It is well organized with friendly staff and great rooms The bed is big and comfortable the bathroom is modern I liked that instead of expensive ironing service the hotel offers a free iron so you can do your ironing yourself Also the location is close to metro and train station so you can easily reach the city centre or the airport 
309862,Jaz Amsterdam, Checking in took quite some time There was no clear queue and both people at the desk were not communicating about this queue , Very nice room They also have allergen free rooms Everything looks new Breakfast was good but not very special 
309863,Jaz Amsterdam, I found the hotel staff a little rude at times numerous times I had to ask to get things done not sure if the Dutch people understand manners, Shower was amazing as was the breakfast
309864,Jaz Amsterdam, Location was not central Amsterdam however 5 10 minute walk to metro and a 20 min trip and we were in the city , A modern innovative hotel they made our stay most enjoyable Friendly staff all do willing to help with any request 
309865,Jaz Amsterdam, Shower gel bottle was empty when we arrived and wasn t refilled during our whole stay Choice for breakfast could have been better Wifi wasn t very fast , Very nice and modern rooms great location 
309866,Jaz Amsterdam, Screen sharing not working in tv due to date time settings , Very nice stay in Jaz great and very helpful staff Original design great shower big and comfortable bed spacious room 
309867,Jaz Amsterdam, Female receptionists were not friendly and did not smile Not a great welcome for travellers , Beautiful room fantastic huge bed with coffee making facilities Breakfast was delicious the girls working there were friendly So easy to catch the train to the Airport We will stay again 
309868,Jaz Amsterdam, Parking place for you car is expensive in the parking space direct under the hotel 24 50 per day and you have to pay with your creditcard No cash accepted there , We had a Suite with a balkon which was very nice The king size bed was comfortable as well You need your Roomkey card in the elevator to reach your room This is a security plus Reception over 24 hours is perfect with really friendly and helpful personal Breakfast was good and enough to choose 
309869,Jaz Amsterdam, No room service and housekeeping is poor, The staff are great very attentive and friendly and the food is surprisingly very good for the Netherlands However the room is not cleaned properly and the sheets are not changed even when it s obvious that it needs to For the price of 354 you get not room service and when l asked for an iron there had not bothered to turn it down and l burnt my trousers Also it looked like someone had previously had the same experience as the surface of the iron plate was unclean 
309870,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast was a bit basic processed meat and limited selection of bread and pastries I am gluten free and although the hotel had been informed of this in advance I had to ask for gluten free bread and wait 15 minutes for the barely edible rolls that eventually arrived The hotel is described as being 15 minutes from the centre of Amsterdam In reality it was 25 30 minutes by taxi hardly convenient , Rooms were comfy and well designed An excellent shower 
309871,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Very welcoming staff who were really helpful printing off train times to Amsterdam central and passing on local knowledge of the city centre The room was excellent comfortable bed with great decor 
309872,Jaz Amsterdam, I didn t like the fact that my mini fridge did not have a freeze compartment I would of preferred to purchase and bag of ice and placed it in my room so that I didn t have keep going to the bar asking for only large cups of ice , The bed was larger than expected and very comfortable A free bottled water was provided to me twice during my stay The bed was very comfortable and I was provided with an extra pillow in addition to all the pillow I already had I love lots of comfy pillows on my bed The staff was nice to hold my luggage when I checked out so that I may continue to tour the city at no additional cost There is a bar and restaurant down stars which is convenient for me when I required ice for drinks I had purchased at a supermarket and placed in my mini fridge They have an app the allows you to unlock your room in case you forgot your keycard in the room or prefer not to hassle to carry around a keycard 
309873,Jaz Amsterdam, Very disappointed that we booked a room with a double bed and got 2 singles pushed together There were 2 quilts and every time we rolled over we would become uncovered or the beds would push apart To make things worse when we went to get into bed one only had a sheet folded and placed on it so we had to make our own bed at 10 30pm when we just wanted to sleep This was raised with reception in the morning and noted but no discount or anything was offered We didn t raise it with them at the time as we were unpacked ready for bed and didn t want to have to move rooms , Great location easily accessible great vibe loved the keyless access and being able to check in over an app
309874,Jaz Amsterdam, Out of the city No closet No door to the bathroom Cushions too light , Very good breakfast Nice rooms Good coffee machine Can quickly get to the city center by train 
309875,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The hotel was clean comfortable and equiped with a lot of modern technology Public transport is very close and handy to take in and around Amsterdam The restaurant and bar were great It was right next to the concert venue 
309876,Jaz Amsterdam, The hotel is in the middle of no where The bathroom was not clean The furniture was very dusty If you want to do any of the touristy things you should stay closer to the major train station downtown Amsterdam , The beds are comfortable The hotel is close to the football soccer stadium so there are plenty of ways to travel Metro Train Bus Taxi There are several small shops near by because of the stadium 
309877,Jaz Amsterdam, Checkin via app doesn t cover use of elevator that needs a key card that also is key for room and has to be asked on reception no sense to use app checkin lowest floor on backside allows people from street best view to your bed room Shower is preadjusted in a way that you flood the room with water when pushing the shower button and not first protect the area with the plastic curtain No possibility to store or hang your clothes , Very friendly staff clean and modern
309878,Jaz Amsterdam, At night the aircon didn t seem as cool however you could open a window , The room was very large lots of space to sit your luggage and hang clothes The bed was super comfortable There was a sitting area near the window with good block out blinds Our room had views The TV had a good mix of English channels first we have come across in Europe so was a nice change to be able to watch a movie at night after sightseeing all day Coffee making machine in the room Close to the metro and only 9 stops to Centraal station The trains run regularly every 10mins The hotel is next to the Stadium and there are lots of restaurants around and the cinema Breakfast was extra with good choice of breads meat cheese eggs yoghurt fruit cereal and pastries I preferred staying just outside of Amsterdam and getting a large comfortable room rather than paying for a small room in the old town 
309879,Jaz Amsterdam, there was no information about free parking space we needed to pay for a parking even that we saw that no all the parking spots was taken, very nice room
309880,Jaz Amsterdam, The club right in front the hotel was quite noises even with all the windows closed you can hear the music till 2am but only on Friday and saturday night , Room was very modern new clean with a huge double bed 
309881,Jaz Amsterdam, Ryrhyms restaurant had good food but extremely slow service Although the city centre was easily accessible by Metro about 20 minutes and the station is just a brisk 6 minute walk away this hotel is a bit far out If you leave in the morning to explore the city it does not make sense to come back to the hotel unless you are not going to go out again Being in the city would make it much more convenient to come back to your room should you wish to rest or change , Very comfortable bed and extra fluffy pillows Great shower easily regulated Helpful and friendly staff 
309882,Jaz Amsterdam, Hot drinks machine dispenser in communal areas was broken so had to stay in room to make free coffee , Great room very clean and good bed and blackout blinds Very trendy decoration 
309883,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, A lovely hotel in a good location Ideally located near the train station Less than a 5 minute walk to afas live Staff were friendly and helpful Overall a good stay 
309884,Jaz Amsterdam, The bathroom did not have a door The shower curtains did not close completely resulting in bathroom floor being wet my wife slipped on the bathroom floor Taxi vehicles had trouble accessing hotel location due to road barriers Incoming taxi dropped us off far from hotel resulting in us having to drag two heavy and two small suitcases over 100 yards Outgoing taxi came closer to hotel after obtaining access codes for road barrier from another user or else we would have had to once again drag suitcases a long distance , Hotel is in good condition Breakfast was good value for money 
309885,Jaz Amsterdam, They need to have their own multi cuisine restaurant , Very Clean modern and comfortable hotel with excellent staff the location is slightly off the town centre 
309886,Jaz Amsterdam, The only complaint we had which is very minor is the very soft pillows Too soft for us personally and although we did ask they couldnt be changed, The hotel was very modern and had lovely facilites Breakfast was very good with an amazing iPad coffee machine The room was excellent Great shower and lovely to have a kettle in the room Staff were very helpful We only had one evening meal in the bar and it was really good 
309887,Jaz Amsterdam, On some tube construction in the room were layers of dust the result of weeks not cleaning that particular spot The receptionist welcomed my feedback and ensured it would be inspected right away The rest of the room was clean though , It s right next door to Ziggo Dome which was very comfortable for us It s kinda cool atmosphere like although the prints on the carpet are rather boring It s OK with a rather mid standard image Nothing classy about the hotel The hotel comes with a nice bar with great local beers and with very friendly staff 
309888,Jaz Amsterdam, the kitchen closes way too early, Nice place to stay after attending events at Ziggo Dome Friendly staff Asked for a quiet room and indeed it was quiet It was my second time here 
309889,Jaz Amsterdam, at check in 14 30 room was not ready yet But not a big deal had some beers at the bar that was great , Location next to ZIGGO Dome ideal for concerts etc 
309890,Jaz Amsterdam, Everything was perfect, Very friendly staff clean rooms with a lot of space comfortable beds excellent Wifi connection I really felt very well at Jaz Hotel
309891,Jaz Amsterdam, 1 Internal phone service very poor Operator or concierge do not answer phone calls 2 Poor directions to dial outside or none at all 3 Lack of electrical plugs from plain square to round local sockets , Very nice staff and very helpful always Congratulations 
309892,Jaz Amsterdam, too much money for a hotel like this But then again ask any Amsterdamer they would say Well this is normal otherwise don t come to Amsterdam go to Berlin or Paris if you are not happy with the prices This is not customer friendly at all But in Amsterdam you pay three times the price of a Paris hotel plus you always pay the city tax bloody rip off I hope they really consider it one day which I am skeptical they never will knowing their mentality , Clean friendly staff good facilities nice room no complaint in that aspect
309893,Jaz Amsterdam, Pillow were very soft, Staff are very helpful and friendly The entire hotel ambiance is awesome Easy to reach the hotel via train from the Schiphol Airport I would highly rebook it again in my next visit 
309894,Jaz Amsterdam, The elevator went out one night and had to climb stairs to 9th floor It was fixed by the time we needed it again , I loved the modern design especially the bathroom and the in 78thceiling rain shower 
309895,Jaz Amsterdam, price of the parking and the fact that as a guest of the hotel you cannot reserve parking at the facility , Jazz Amsterdam is at Ziggodome so access to the hotel while concerts are going on is almost impossible We had to park our car on a parking spot and pay 12 Euro After the venue we had to move the car as the parking spot would close and we parked the car in the underground parking of the hotel which is very expensive 
309896,Jaz Amsterdam, maybe could be in a better location more open maybe some garden type area for people who aren t there for the arena but I came knowing that is where it would be so can t grumble, Comfiest bed I ve ever stayed in nice to be away from the hustle and bustle great shower and nice coffee in the room great room overall
309897,Jaz Amsterdam, A bit of a walk from Train station safeish area I arrived very late in the evening aprox 11pm so wasnt the best walk but in the morning all looks great , The room itself was great Shower was the highlight Comfy bed Bar area nice good decor and a plus the coffee machine in the room 
309898,Jaz Amsterdam, We got charged on leaving the hotel for city tax that we had not been told about previously The charge should have been included in the price It was an unexpected and unnecessary charge on our last day , I loved everything about the hotel The staff were so friendly and helpful The beds were extra comfortable The breakfast was beautiful The hotel was close to the metro so it was easy to get into the city centre 
309899,Jaz Amsterdam, Unfortunately the only problem we had was an unexpected charge of 73 when we were leaving for breakfasts We had assumed breakfast was included in the price considering how much we paid there was no indication that we were going to be charged 15 each per day when booking or when we arrived To us it was sly and unfair, The style and design is amazing modern but maximum comfort we really loved it Most staff were lovely especially the bar man and waiter we had on Friday night Food and drinks were amazing quality 
309900,Jaz Amsterdam, It s out next to the Amsterdam Arena so wouldn t suit everyone but was very near where I needed to be The gym is very well equipped by hotel standards although the weight mutli gym is overdue some maintenance , Comfortable modern rooms Friendly helpful staff and great breakfast The offerings at the restaurant are limited but very well executed 
309901,Jaz Amsterdam, A little bit far from center, The room space is large enough and makes us feel very comfortable to stay I love the decoration style Rhythms restaurant on the ground floor is quite wonderful 
309902,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing at all , Excellent location amazing decor we really felt like rock stars staying in this hotel It was so close to stadium you could almost tough it but It still wasn t loud inside hotel at all It was only a quick 10 min journey to central area but we also had some great shops and bars restaurants on doorstep Would definitely stay again 
309903,Jaz Amsterdam, the hotel s website should mention the route to the parking lot as it was hard to find had to call the hotel for directions comment of receptionist was that they were working on that for months already idem for Booking com should mention the route to the parking lot as it was hard to find music in the bar area of the hotel s restaurant was too loud the hotel s restaurant is rather small with no possibility to make reservations we had an early diner but this could be an issue at normal diner hour as there are no other restaurants in the area , within crawling distance to The Arena sound proof rooms with window you can open for airing breakfast was excellent especially with the live music breakfast area is large 2nd floor young friendly cheery staff within the parking lot designated parking close the lift to the hotel as the parking lot gives access to other destinations no wide range diner choices in hotel s restaurant ground floor however it s good value for your money and of good quality hotel s website booking com describe the atmosphere accurately
309904,Jaz Amsterdam, The staff on checkout After paying in full for my stay with confirmation upon checkout the staff tried denying receiving any payment After asking for the manger i discussed my situation and he confirmed the payment was successful Not really the best experience to have on your holiday travelling alone , The room was great nice art with an incredible bathroom 
309905,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, We attended a Music venue at the Ajax this hotel is right opposite the entrance great location if you are using the Ajax Otherwise it is a train journey into Amsterdam about 10 15 mins away
309906,Jaz Amsterdam, We had two very good nights but the last one there was a concert in the place next to the hotel All the crowd then stays around the hotels in a couple of bars including the one in the hotel and make some noise The music in the hotel bar was very loud and I could really hear it from the room The breakfast was really less than average The problem is there isn t much options in this neighborhood in the morning you better just take something from the metro train station You need to walk 7 minutes to the closest metro station then it takes 20 30 minutes to get in the city center depending on your luck , The room is quite big The bed was nice and very big that s very rare The WiFi was very good in my room but my friend in the room next to mine had a very bad signal The sauna is simple but good maybe a little too hot I know that s the whole point but this is more than it should If you are here on business it s a good option If you want to visit the city it s a bit far 
309907,Jaz Amsterdam, We think that there is a little bit expensive and you don t have many choices of restaurants or a nice view the breakfast was standard too many eggs in the menu every day poor rate quality of products in the bathroom, We liked the bed and the space of the room fantastic Also the location for us was the best cause we came in Amsterdam to a concert at AFAS Live we liked the technology for coffee for room entrance for elevator bathroom etc
309908,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Unfortunately the booking confirmation did not state that there was fitness room so I did not bring workout clothing with me Had I known that there was a fitness room I would have definitely used it 
309909,Jaz Amsterdam, It was a bit unlucky that the P R in the ArenA is closed due to a concert the second day If I knew it already maybe I will book another hotel close to another P R And because of this inccident we have to park under the hotel which cost 25eur a day , The neighbour district around is very convenient restaurant cinema shopping centre And the metro to downtown takes 20minutes 
309910,Jaz Amsterdam, Rooms are big AC is working poorly but acceptable bathrooms are great No noise and break fast is OK , Everything is perfect however it is about 18 20 miles away from city center Metro station is only 10 minutes walking distance 
309911,Jaz Amsterdam, cleanliness could be better asked for room to be cleaned and towels were just left inside the door no bin emptied no sheets changed Some staff mainly later in the day didnt really want to do anything when you asked the morning staff were way more helpful , location and some of the staff
309912,Jaz Amsterdam, The internet connection was a bit flakey this time around and they ran out out of their nice smelling shower gel but their liquid soap is just as nice , This is our second stay at the Jaz hotel situated close by the Ajax arena at Biljmer Amsterdam You can reach the hotel from either the Biljmer arena stop Metro tram 54 Gein or by Airport train or from the Strandvleit arena Metro 54 Gein stop It is around a 10 minutes stroll from either of the two tram stops to the hotel It is about 15 minutes by fast train directly from Schiphol Airport to the Biljmer Arena train stop and for the return journey the trains are at 16 28 46 58 minutes past the hour The rooms are very comfortable with good air conditioning and a very nice walk in shower with either the ceiling mounted rain effect or using the normal shower head There are lots of space for coats clothes and luggage The bed is huge and extremely comfortable to sleep in The room also has a good sized quality LCD TV plus their are coffee and tea making facilities and fridge with complimentary water The double glazing is very effective as you are next to the main music venue the Ziggo dome but we heard very little noise from the crowds entering or leaving during our stay The breakfasts are self service with ample cereals milk juices yoghurts soft crispy breads croissants butter jam or meats and cheese if you want a more continental style breakfast and teas and coffees Omelettes are cooked from fresh by the staff The advantage of living just outside of the city centre means that it gets you out of the hustle and bustle especially at peak holiday times 
309913,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Perfect place for attending an event at the Ziggodome couldn t be any closer Very nice room comfy bed very clean Will certainly stay there again for a next concert 
309914,Jaz Amsterdam, I can t get connected with the hotel wifi somehow but no worries there are plenty free wifi around the city , Easy to find and near the metro station so we can easly go the city centre by metro and leave the car in parking are but have no idea how the area during ajax match since the position is exactly front of ajax stadium
309915,Jaz Amsterdam, The restaurant were not very accommodating We arrived about half an hour before official opening but were made unwelcome , The bedroom was fabulous Nice room to relax in Huge bed Nice view very modern 
309916,Jaz Amsterdam, We had problems to find a charging station for our electric car Staff couldn t help us , Lovely modern designer hotel near footbal stadium Ajax Perfect service good food in restaurant 
309917,Jaz Amsterdam, nothing , Very near to ZiggoDome and Arena but no inconvenience with noise or whatever Hotelroom was quite large large good bed nice sofa near the window we had a great view nice and modern bathroom and good breakfast live music included We really recommend this hotel 
309918,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast is fine but would be better if more varieties , Close to the train subway stations very convenient to get to the airport or other cities 
309919,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Samaro don t quite remember how to spell it the receptionist was incredibly nice and attentive Always joking and smiling and he made himself available even though we got there late 
309920,Jaz Amsterdam, Not keen on the foam mattress The wash hand basin is daft Watch out for the shower controls you might get an unexpected deluge on your head, Clean and quiet all modern
309921,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Liked great bed lovely breakfast beautiful decor Disliked long walks and travels to everywhere in town younger staff members were not that willing to assist the tourists 
309922,Jaz Amsterdam, this hotel is mostly for guests who attend sports events at the AJAX amsterdam stadium or concert goers to the ziggo dome however if this is not the primary reason for your stay dont book here the location is a bit far from the city youll have to walk 10 mins to the station and take a 15 min train into the city , loved the hotel the room is well kept beautiful and very comforable the beds are super comfy and the nespresso machines in the rooms are just the cherry on top however this hotel is mostly for guests who attend sports events at the AJAX amsterdam stadium or concert goers to the ziggo dome its a great location for that purposes only yes
309923,Jaz Amsterdam, There was nothing I disliked about our stay The first night we hired a taxi from the station to the hotel as we were unfamiliar with the area But as across the whole of the Netherlands taxis are expensive compared to the UK Learning the 5 minute walk from the friendly and helpful hotel staff saved us the 10 taxi fare for less than a 2 minute drive and enabled us to enjoy the beautiful and quiet walk to the station , A modern vibrant hotel with exceptionally well decorated and equipped rooms consisting of hidden storage space wonderful coffee machine quirky paintings on walls an amazing touch button shower and THE best toiletries I have ever had in a hotel room A combination of well fitted blinds a luxury supersized bed and absolutely NO noise due to the soundproof room I can confidently say this is THE best night s sleep I have ever had in a hotel anywhere in the world The Jaz is in my opinion particularly appealing to younger adults with its location being just a stones throw away from the Ajax football stadium and just a simple 5 minute walk from Duivendrecht station which is just a few stops from Centraal Station Serving simple food cooked and presented to a very high standard A very reasonably priced hotel for such high quality of standards throughout our stay 
309924,Jaz Amsterdam, The prices in the bar were expensive which is the only negative , Rooms were such a high standard Staff were so helpful and always willing to help Coffee machine in the room was a great extra touch Breakfast selection was great especially the pancakes 
309925,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Room is big and clean Staff are friendly and helpful When the coffee machine was broken they fix it right away It was a good service Breakfast was very good especially the life music one love it The train is easy to access and goes directly to city center and airport
309926,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The location of the hotel was excellent you couldn t get any closer We went to an event at the Amsterdam Arena The room was comfy and we had plenty of room The touch controls in shower was cool concept The decor of room was fun and funky The restaurant in the lobby was convenient We liked the open space since we had a big group getting together before the event And the added touch with the DJ was nice 
309927,Jaz Amsterdam, I couldn t fault anything , Extra comfy bed very cool hotel my 2nd visit to this hotel I wouldn t book anywhere else now when I m back in Amsterdam close to the music arenas 
309928,Jaz Amsterdam, Room had strange smell and it looked like it hasn t been cleaned for a while Staff at the restaurant a bit confused and it looked like they don t have much experiences in their job , Bed very comfortable Bathroom and toilet really nice especially I ve liked the shower and separate toilet Breakfast very tasty and lots of options to choose from Close to train metro station and to Arena Fast and easy check in check out 
309929,Jaz Amsterdam, nothing to report, great room spacious modern clean lean Very huge bed and comfortable A very good value for your money Staff superb and breakfast was excellent 
309930,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Fantastic hotel couldn t find fault with anything Staff friendly and approachable Hotel is within easy reach to Amsterdam Centraal via train or metro and around 20 mins to the airport also Very modern bright and upbeat hotel Spotless clean We had a fab view s from our room of the surroundings of the Ajax stadium Places to eat and bars within walking distance from the hotel as well as the train station no more the 5 8 mins walk The bar area with Dj in the evening and breakfast room on a Sunday with live band playing Jazz music was a nice touch Will definetly be returning and would highly recommend 
309931,Jaz Amsterdam, Not very clean Greassy windows smelly room and why do they put the bed linen in the corridor see pictures This gives the impression you are sleeping in a youth hostel ,No Positive
309932,Jaz Amsterdam, Couldnt find the hotel for 15 minutes Navigation was wrong and no signs or marks that hotel is there Also no sign for hotels parking 24 5 eur per 24h so i had to go to reception and ask where to find a garage , Evertyhing Location 15 min to city center vith metro 54 which station is 300 m from the hotel Stuff was very polite room perfect interior of the hotel and the room was great Recommend to all 
309933,Jaz Amsterdam, The location superb if you re visiting one of the music venues or football stadium However a little far out for tourists to the city Saying that the transport was great There is no clear entrance for the hotel we spent 5 mins walking around trying to find the way in On site printing facilities would be a good idea we were unable to check in for our flight until 48hrs before travel We wouldn t have minded paying a small charge to use a PC printer Luckily one of your receptionists helped us out and let us print using your own facilities , The hotel was really modern and clean Our room was fresh large enough for two guests and I loved the long windows for extra light The split shower toilet areas were great for a couple and the shower was to die for The breakfast was sufficient and I appreciated the soya milk alternatives The hot drinks machines were a dream and take away cups were a really good idea for heading out for the day 
309934,Jaz Amsterdam, The parking is quite expensive, This hotel is very new and modern The room was really nice clean and well equipped Breakfast was extremely good Nice variety with good quality of food and coffee The hotel offers a payed parking for 25 euro per day There is an IMAX cinema within a few minutes walk The hotel is located in the south eastern part of Amsterdam directly next to Ziggo Dome and Ajax arena making it a bit far from the real heart of Amsterdam There is a metro station about 500 m away and from there there is a line going directly to the center In total it took us about 20 30 min to travel to the center of Amsterdam For us it was a bit too far especially when we wanted to go out after a long day of sightseeing But on the other hand this area is more quiet and away from all the commotion 
309935,Jaz Amsterdam, Hotel surrounding is not that pretty and when is concert or soccer at the Arena stadium or Ziggo dome it gets crowdy and loud , Good location easy to get there from the airport and also to the city Nice rooms with nespresso coffee machine and awesome shower Good breakfast and really good food in Rhythms restaurant Staff was friendly and helpfull
309936,Jaz Amsterdam, the rain shower in the ceiling was not very good most of the holes were blocked with limescale and water pressure was poor, The room and the bed were great clean and comfortable Breakfast was also very good
309937,Jaz Amsterdam, No parking available in underground under hotel because of football match etc Ridiculous they should reserve spaces for hotel guests No roomservice went downstairs myself to order it myself in the restaurant bring it up but if you give enough tip they will bring it to the room Why not offer roomservice then with a charge for that The food usual is very nice there but they brought it up in boxes which made it really bad Why not on plates food got cold because they forgot to write down the room number We requested and paid for a late check out had a do not disturb sign up but that did not stop housekeeping to knock on our door twice that afternoon Overpriced for a hotel so far outside the city centre rooms are very basic no service, Location is great if you are going to the Ziggodome or Arena or HMH But that s it Very overpriced for a hotel outside the city centre
309938,Jaz Amsterdam, A small fault for us ladies The lights in the room were not in the right places to put on our makeup This could easily be fixed by putting a ligt over the mirror at the back of the door in the room , The room was spacious and had everything that a good hotel room needs to have TV fridge good space for our luggage and clothes The beds were excellent and the shower also The staff was very friendly and helpful The hotel is not in the center but it is very easy to take the train it takes 15 min 
309939,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, We loved the new modern interiors The upstair s relax fitness are was fabulous The location was better than expected lots of big box shops nearby Breakfast was to die for Everything was fresh and delicious Train station is very near 15 mins and you re downtown
309940,Jaz Amsterdam, Not many local restaurants in the Arena area but easy to get to town to eat , Everything Calm super friendly very helpful staff excellent breakfast large quirky rooms quiet and excellent location Train or metro to Amsterdam in 15 minutes and same time to get from airport Six or seven minute walk from transport hub 
309941,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, First time at JAZ Excellent hotel Comfortable rooms very good beds nice breakfast Metro station at 5 min walk It takes about 15 minutes with the metro to Amsterdam Central Station We had a some problems finding the right parking You need to follow the signs Arena and then take the P Dome entrance and keep right to find the parking space for JAZ 
309942,Jaz Amsterdam, The trip was toooooooo short , I loved the messages i ve found all over the room bathroom soap body cream even sugar They made me smile each time i ve read them And really everything was perfect The smooth operators food room and location 
309943,Jaz Amsterdam, The staff at breakfast was unsympathetic and kind of appalling We chose to not eat there the second day The cleaning staff made us wait to get dressed for our appointment The balcony in the penthouse was not covered and it rained the whole time There was no room service There were no reservations possible for dinner even though we were guests in the hotel , The room was great The staff reception staff took responsibility for mistakes and accommodated us well 
309944,Jaz Amsterdam, The spa was very basic and there was no shower cap in the bathroom , The room was very big and I loved the window seat It was fun to have a Nespresso machine in the room The bed was very large which was great and very comfortable The pillows were good The shower was amazing and really hi tech The breakfast was very good I would have liked some tomatoes and cucumbers but otherwise there was plenty of food 
309945,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The room is perfect hotel is really nice just a little far from centre but access to centre is really good and fast and easy to understand would really love this hotel if it was a bit closer
309946,Jaz Amsterdam, Bar staff serving food totally inefficient chatting to each other and dancing 90 minutes between arriving and receiving a hamburger and the place was virtually empty, Breakfast and breakfast staff
309947,Jaz Amsterdam, Service in the bar of the hotel can be slow , This hotel is conveniently located not too far from the metro stop from where there is a direct line 12 min to Amsterdam central station It was nice to have a live jazz band during breakfast on Sunday 
309948,Jaz Amsterdam, Mini bar was not provided and empty with only one packet of water when we had two persons Only one plastic cup Tea box without anything inside Noisy at nite No bedroom slippers No toiletries like toothbrush and Colgate, Property was nice and new
309949,Jaz Amsterdam, One thing we disliked very much was that the fire alarm went off one morning The sound went off and being that the message was stated in many different languages it took a while before we clearly understood what was going on Also as we made our way down to the lobby the staff acted as if they didn t know why many people were down in the lobby When they asked if we were responding to the alarm they stated that it was a false alarm and that we were able to return to the room Not a great start to the day , The beds were extremely comfortable My friend and I rarely wanted to leave the beds in the morning which is the main reason we missed our free breakfast each day The hotel is very tech savvy If we forgot our key in the room I could unlock the door with the app called Hotel Bird The staff was very nice and tended to all of our needs The rooms were cleaned each day and the shower is turned on through touch buttons This hotel was amazing and located near the rail station via an easy three to four minute walk Restaurants are nearby and in the hotel as well I would definitely stay here again 
309950,Jaz Amsterdam, The showers had touch screen buttons we liked them but unfortunately they didn t respond too well and it was difficult to start the shower Once going the next challenge was stopping it , Well thought out design in the rooms very creative The windows all had black our curtains for an enjoyable sleep in The staff were great and were happy to assist all our needs 
309951,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast room a bit overcrowded and service not very smooth during breakfast first had to wait for a glass a bit later for a plate at some point for pancakes not for long but it was still slightly annoying , Great location for visiting AFAS Live or Ajax stadium Good metro connection to the city Huge bed and soft pillows Tea and coffee in the room even decaffeinated Fancy shower 
309952,Jaz Amsterdam, It would be great to add a normal wardrobe in the rooms , Great modern hotel with an amazing location Staff is very friendly and helpful Very good breakfast Definitely we ll come back
309953,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast was a bit of a disapointment thought the coffeemachines were quite scifi There was ingredients for a constricted healthy breakfast but no bacon and no veggies minus for that , The room was big and especially the bed 
309954,Jaz Amsterdam, we didn t like at all the policy of the hotel to charge parking Moreover the pricing of the parking looked very expensive to us about 24 euros per night , the facilities the breakfast the sauna the personnel the room
309955,Jaz Amsterdam, Only a small thing the options for breakfast The food was lovely but there were signs to say ask a member of staff for an omelette or additional food etc but didn t really see anyone to ask who to ask Apart from that I couldn t fault my stay , The bathroom in the room was brilliant especially the shower Bed sheets towels and rooms were kept clean Staff were friendly The hotel is situated a little out of Amsterdam but great transport links 
309956,Jaz Amsterdam, There was absolutely nothing I didn t like about Jaz It was perfect , The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and I couldn t find a flaw on anything the entire trip 
309957,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Extremely lovely staff excellent facilities easy to get to and from the hotel Very quiet location I will surely be staying in Jaz again Jazz band playing during Sunday breakfast Pointless maybe highly entertaining and enjoyable yes 
309958,Jaz Amsterdam, Couldnt figure out how to use the coffee machine and no milk Lighting was quite poor in the room and there wasnt a plug near a mirror to do hair Struggled to do makeup in the light Drinks at the hotel bar was very expensive go into town , The bed was huge and very very comfy The room was so modern and yhe black out blinds worked a treat 
309959,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Great hotel Spacious rooms which come with a yoga mat and free water Very modern with a great vibe Staff are friendly and helpful the suites have the best views 
309960,Jaz Amsterdam, 1 The always blocking locking keys we were staying for sometime and not for the first time and they re always a big problem they randomly stop working or allow You to enter places You shouldn t be in 2 Clarity and intentions of some of the staff could use an improvement This was the last trip of mine to Amsterdam without the magical card 3 I wish I parted ways in a more friendly manner with the management of the hotel, As always the meals were fantastic most if not all of the staff was very supportive they understood and listened to the customers that would be me needs I always recommend Jaz Amsterdam but would advice to plan in advance that way You get the best of the best worlds Also if You plan on seeing the City it s good to take more nights as it s not mentioned but longer stays give You reductions and que free experiance of stuff like Adam Lookout or Madam Tussauds 
309961,Jaz Amsterdam, Lighting in the bathroom was poor for makeup purposes Not near much unless you are there for the arena or the concert venue Hard for Uber Taxi pickups I was charged more than the booking price for the room , Rooms were very spacious and clean Bed was comfortable great atmosphere 
309962,Jaz Amsterdam, Staff in the Bar were not overly friendly hence why i gave the staff a not so great review but the girls up front where you can check in were very helpful Rooms i think are a bit small and the food menu could be bigger only so many times i can eat a Burger while delicious at lunch , The express checkin was great Music in the lounge was AWESOME but then again i do like old school Hip Hop and that was always what they were playing when i was in there The hotel was very modern so i really enjoyed that beds were SOOOOO comfortable and the rainfall shower was an excellent touch
309963,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Housekeeping needs to be improved I m allergic to dust On the 3rd day I developed hives There was a feather beside the bed on the floor that was there for 3 days withouth moving Easily seen and would have disappeared if simple vacuuming was done Tested with a small piece of plastic beside the bed which also remained after the cleaning lovely hotel otherwise with really lovely friendly helpful staff They did change the bedsheets and clean properly after I called Housekeeping though The toilet door got stuck and locked by itself and looking a the scratch marks on the lock this was not the first time 
309964,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The rooms were very spacious and comfortable with high quality fittings and finishing including an Espresso machine rain shower large flat screen TV working airco etc The restaurant was also a highlight with very tasty food and great drinks selection 
309965,Jaz Amsterdam, I would have liked a bath rather than just a shower The lighting in the room isn t great so it feels a little gloomy particularly if you have to work at the desk , The staff are nice and it s an unfussy hotel There are no annoying bits of paper in the room inviting you to save the planet visit the bar and the spa order room service etc It s right opposite my office 
309966,Jaz Amsterdam, Me and my partner do like to go clubbing now and then even though there were bars and restaurants around we do wish there was a nice club to go to nearby instead of always taking the train to central , The bed was absolutely superb From all of the hotels we ve stayed at by far Jaz Amsterdam has been the best Whenever we had any questions about the area the staff were always happy to help Going to the central was very easy Even the ticket office staff were happy to help and show you exactly where to go We will already be planning our next trip to stay at Jaz Amsterdam very soon 
309967,Jaz Amsterdam, That I booked a Superior double for two people but was charged and extra 15EUROS for her stay , Beds are soooo comfy I didn t want to move out of them and was one of the reasons we returned also because it was close to the Ziggo Drome and Ajax
309968,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, the best part of this hotel is the friendliness of the receptionists and other staff Other bight sides are breakfast shower facilites bed and musician realted decorations In other words a wonderful place Good news for football fans is that Jaz is very close to Amsterdam Arena Ajax only 50 meters 
309969,Jaz Amsterdam, Perhaps we are easily pleased but cannot think of anything dusliked, Everything was very good Never seen such a large bed Enjoyed everything First time in Amsterdam would not hesitate to use this hotel again Also notice you are in other cities
309970,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing to complain about, Interior is very stylish breakfast ix excelled wi fi works very well I sincerely recommend it for everybody who is fine with location 
309971,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast selection isnt what i would be used to dont expect to be offered a tradional fry up eggs where awful we werent told the breakfast stops at 10am during weekdays I would Recommend getting something in town instead, Staff where friendly hotel design was brilliant peaceful area short tram distance to city centre rooms was greag
309972,Jaz Amsterdam, I have booked 2 rooms both at the same floor but by check in via an App called HotelBird my request has been avoided Not an app that I will use again , Location and Staff and Hotel Style
309973,Jaz Amsterdam, We wanted to have a room on the upper floors Requested that before And on the reception when arrived asked again In return we got a room at the very end of the corridor on the 3rd floor with a view on roads and roof of the hall gate near Limited toileters , Comfy bed Spacious room Good materials 
309974,Jaz Amsterdam, The hot breakfast foods could have more variety , Great metro and train connections this hotel is in a walking distance from the station Airport is 20 mins with the train cost app 4 Downtown is a few metro stations app 15 20 mins Sunday morning live jazz breakfast was amazing 
309975,Jaz Amsterdam, Buttons on the air conditioning and shower were a bit hard to operate Sink could have done with a plug to save water while shaving , Very spacious room comfortable bed very clean Quiet although there were no events on in the Amsterdam ArenA or Ziggo Dome during our stay Easy 20 minute trip into the centre of Amsterdam 
309976,Jaz Amsterdam, Food and loud music after the adjoining event concert had finished people flocked into the hotel bar where the music went on for some time, Location and plesent staff
309977,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Me and my partner stayed in a suite and it was absolutely lush It was so quirky unlike any hotel we ve ever stayed in before The bed was extremely comfy too we even said we d live there if we could 100 recommend 
309978,Jaz Amsterdam, The Hotel charges 24euros per day for parking which is a rip off So we parked at Olympic park for 8 euros for 4 days And took the Metro back to the hotel The other negative would be the pillows were super flat and uncomfortable , Loved the extra large bed It was super comfy The price you pay is worth it As you get a room with good space to put your luggage away with enough space to walk around Which a lot hotel rooms lack when you pay for standard size rooms I really enjoyed the view of Amsterdam arena and surrounding business district The property is Located fairly close to Metro which made traveling to Central Amsterdam easier 
309979,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Bed is big and comfy love the bathroom and shower The rooms are spacious and it s right next to the Ziggo Dome which is where the events are that we go to Breakfast is good plenty of choice And when we stayed there for ADE the breakfast boxes left outside our rooms were AMAZING It s pretty easy to get into central amsterdam on the metro and takes just 15 20 mins Getting to and from the airport is also really easy on the train Again only takes 20 mins max 
309980,Jaz Amsterdam, The location is a little out from the main city next to the Ajax Stadium Breakfast choice could have been better , Splendid Property Modern clean and well maintained
309981,Jaz Amsterdam, Need conditioner in the room, Absolutely made up with my stay i slept at the Jaz hotel for Dont Let Daddy Know it was so convenient as it was 10 seconds away from the area i slept on the 11th floor in an amazing room great views TV in the bathroom so made up will 100 back again next year because i booked with booking com we got a free taxi fare to the hotel made my experience
309982,Jaz Amsterdam, One or Two members of staff which we didnt catch there names we felt made us feel a little uncomfortable with their attitudes there was a tall blonde female who checked us in who made a very good impression then the two guys one who worked at the bar and there was a young looking blonde haired guy who was on reception who checked us out was more interested in a convosation with a female who entered hotel prior to us leaving , We thought the location between Amsterdam ArenA and Ziggo dome was excellent the view from our room looking between both Arenas the bathroom was probably the best feature
309983,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Really nice and comfortable design hotel The bed the view from the room and the bath room was awesome Nice gym really good breakfast and a good bar with good food 
309984,Jaz Amsterdam, Menu in the restaurant was slightly limited more choice would have been nice but it did have a great atmosphere The dj playing on Friday and Saturday evening in there was a great touch , The hotel was really modern and clean The location was perfect as was literally right next to the ziggo dome which was where we were going on the Friday night of our stay 
309985,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Relaxed environment inviting bar after a long day simple but tasty menu location had a conference just 100m away at the ArenA Very fast WiFi speeds Liked the lounge style zone at the window sitting and working in my room with a view 
309986,Jaz Amsterdam, There could of been extra lighten for getting ready etc but apart from that everything was good , The bed was huge and super comfy and the scrambled egg tasted amazing I was there for an event at the ziggo dome and I couldn t believe how close it was right next door 2 minute walk from the train station also 
309987,Jaz Amsterdam, There was no room service , We came as a young couple for a weekend break The location for us was perfect right beside the ziggo dome we were attending an event there The rooms were very cool with plenty of space Bed was very comfy View was great we were on 10th floor The atmosphere in the hotel was good chilled and relaxed Breakfast was on till 12 in the afternoon which was great for us late sleepers The bar always had a good dj playing Staff were so friendly and welcoming Overall a great stay 
309988,Jaz Amsterdam, Only thing I didn t like was breakfast it s continental could do with a toaster but that s about it everything else was perfect They did do mini pancakes and little Nutella they was nice , I love the fact there is a app you can down load and your key is then on your phone can be unlocked through that Little things in the hotel are so quirky it makes you smile coffee machine in the rooms amazing shower Beds are so comfortable Good channels on the television ideal location for the Ziggodome metro is around the corner to go into the centre it s ideal Also waking up hungover on a Sunday it s free late check out until 4pm Would recommend and deffinatly would stay here again 
309989,Jaz Amsterdam, The cleanliness we found someone s sock underneath the cupboard near the door which wasn t ours This clearly meant the room hadn t been cleaned properly Apart from that it was amazing had nothing else to complain about , The room was superb beds were huge comfy and the bathroom was so nice and modern To top it off we had a great view of the Ajax stadium Also the area in which the hotel is situated in is a nice area nothing like typical Amsterdam places 
309990,Jaz Amsterdam, Parking was expensive but that s to be expected in this location , The room was really cool really well designed and decorated Breakfast was excellent 
309991,Jaz Amsterdam, i didnt know how to use the coffee machine in my room an instruction manual would of been good, coffee machine on the second floor was fantastic the gym and sauna was great to
309992,Jaz Amsterdam, Only thing that could be better which is obviously not something they can control is location A bit far from the city centre , The hotel was perfect Breakfast buffet was fabulous staff were professional and polite and overall our stay was very very comfortable 
309993,Jaz Amsterdam, We had to leave , Upon arrival and for the duration of our stay the staff were SUPER friendly Parking was a piece of cake as well 24 50 per night for the 2 days underneath the hotel and breakfast had plenty to offer LOVED the live jazz music on Sunday Also it s an easy 15min train ride in to the CBD on the 1 train line to sum up PERFECT location Right next to Ajax Amsterdam Arena so it s a great place to stay to watch any games or concerts comingn up Do yourself a favour and BOOK NOW 
309994,Jaz Amsterdam, No tea in the room only fruit tea and coffee Found a false eye lash in the bed Staff did minium no map given or advice on local area weren t overally friendly If you are arriving from the airport I d suggest to get the train to the hotel taxi cost us 47 euros to get to the hotel and the train 7 40 and is direct to the airport , Comfy bed good facilities in the room hair dryer shampoo etc Break fast was good all you needed there Good location literally next door to the arena 4 minute walk to train station takes about 10 minutes to get to Amsterdam Central 
309995,Jaz Amsterdam, There could be more toileteries available in the bathroom We were there just for the weekend for a concert so we did not have any luggage only carryons which limit what we are allowed to bring with us And we just assumed there would be toothpaste slippers and robes and other toileteries just like other hotels , The bed is extremely comfortable The room setting is very nice I asked for a room on a top floow with a view and that s what we got so we were happy about that 
309996,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, This hotel will be my choice for future trips where I will have to stay rather close to the Schiphol airport as a translation is just around the corner and the rates are much cheaper than at hotels at the airport itself Via a metro line one also has a very fast connection into the inner city of Amsterdam So the location is really good for staying over 1 2 nights 
309997,Jaz Amsterdam, the toilet paper was to thin this is actually the only thing i can criticise And in the restaurant next door they forgot to keep in mind our special request but the food was pretty good nevertheless , Pretty stylish and clean rooms grat breakfast and friendly hotel staff I would come back and definitely can recommend this hotel 
309998,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Brilliant location especially for concerts and right next door to the Ajax stadium plenty around to do shops and restaurants and not far to walk to the nearest train station to go in the Town Centre would highly recommend would defiantly be booking again
309999,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing, The hotel is just in front of the ziggo dome in Amsterdam which was convenient for us as we were there to attend a concert The breakfast is excellent The staff very nice and friendly The djs and the atmosphere at night The sport facilities The room super nice and the bed very comfortable
310000,Jaz Amsterdam, One small niggle was that the sound system that came with the room you connect your mobile device to it to stream your music was difficult to work We rang for a technician to come and work it out for us and he wasn t sure but got there in the end , Everything seemed pretty much spot on the staff were so friendly and couldn t do enough to helpp so so attentive friendly and polite My absolute highlight of the stay was the mini pancakes that came with breakfast Unbelievable Although it s not centrally located it s really easy to get to 2 stops on the train to the airport or 20 mins to the centre of town on the tram Station is a 5 10 minute walk away 
310001,Jaz Amsterdam, Minor issue a bit far from the center but you can get there with a 15 minutes train ride , Beautiful structure helpful staff great breakfast nice wellness center 
310002,Jaz Amsterdam, The room was cold I left the heating on on the highest setting and the room barely warmed up , I loved my room How spacious it was I also enjoyed the live band that they had at breakfast on a Sunday It was a very pleasant suprise
310003,Jaz Amsterdam, I didn t like the review under mine in TripAdvisor Complaining about location did they not read the website The location is good only 15 mins on the train and you get a big room lots of perks and it s quiet Their other complaint about smoking again they didn t read their key card wallet Look at what you buy and dint be disappointed , I liked the temperature setting for the shower the bed was very very comfy breakfast was great and it had a live jazz band playing a great hotel 
310004,Jaz Amsterdam, Not enough choice of hot drinks in the room Coffee machine I couldn t get to work No decent English tea options Checked in on my phone but problems getting the lift to work and the hassle of needing the phone to enter room, Lovely atmosphere The rooms were beautiful Nice to have a dj in the bar 
310005,Jaz Amsterdam, The price of the parking was expensive like everywhere in Amsterdam 24 euro for a night No alternatives to park elsewhere near the hotel unfortunately , The design of the rooms Super fancy 
310006,Jaz Amsterdam, scrambled eggs were not good however the hotel immediately reacted to my feedback and are working on improving this one aspect , The hotel was excellent Loved the integration of the mobile app to access elevators and rooms fits the overall design of the hotel Breakfast was great fresh orange juice croissants bread all the things you need or want The staff were incredibly accommodating and professional Loved the interaction with them The hotel is really close to the metro and in 20 minutes you are in the center or alternatively to the business parks in the south there are great rail connections The rooms were incredibly quiet and I was not disturbed at all A wonderful hotel all in all 
310007,Jaz Amsterdam, The cocktails were overpriced, Amazing value for money room is spotless and huge beds are queen size and so comfy The hotel has a spa with a sauna and wet room free of charge I would recommend paying extra for breakfast as it was amazing There were pancakes full English crossiants fruit salad coffee machine and fresh fruit juices and water 
310008,Jaz Amsterdam, I would have liked an information pack in the room , Super comfy bed Breakfast was lovely Nespresso machine in the room Mobile check in and check out as well as the key to our room on my smart phone so easy and no need to queue at the desk ever 
310009,Jaz Amsterdam, No room service and no restaurant guide in the room No pen and writing sheets in the room No slippers I expect them for that price Minibar has one piece of still water and that s it Shower gel finished 1st morning cleaning took away empty but did not bother to bring in the new for 2 days I had to call reception Almost no hot dishes for breakfast, Great wi fi inspiring corridoor on the floor amazing choice of cold cuts yoghurt at breakfast hip bar downstairs
310010,Jaz Amsterdam, Bacon for breakfast maybe but seriously not a deal breaker , Fantastic staff all were at the top of their game loved the feel of the hotel overall and will certainly stay again
310011,Jaz Amsterdam, WIFI keep disconnecting every hour when not using Staff is not caring about delivering the required information I need many times I ask about several thing and they either say that they don t have information or they will call later to tell me and never call or care Even thought that the hotel seems new and good facilities but the lake of following will not seem to make this hotel last for long time , Location is near to train and metro station 9 min walk and a nearby shopping area and IMAX cinema Soundproofing comfort and facilities room space 
310012,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast is limited very poor range of cereals Rooms are style over substance shower controls are needlessly fussy why have 4 window blinds when you could have 1 Lighting through out the hotel was ineffective, Comfy bed and pillows
310013,Jaz Amsterdam, The coffee was extremely bitter I never add sugar but I needed to in order to make this stuff palatable Very minor complaint though , We came to Amsterdam to see a show at the Ziggo Dome Google Maps showed us that Jaz was the closest hotel but it did not accurately represent how very close it is It was PERFECT Our room was large clean comfortable and quiet We loved our stay here and if we return for another Ziggo Dome performance we ll stay at Jaz again 
310014,Jaz Amsterdam, Rude receptionist Were initially put in a disabled room on a low floor We did not need a disabled room and had requested a higher floor I know these aren t always available I went to reception as our phone wasn t working in the room to request to be moved to be told point blank that they were completely fully booked and the higher floors were booked for groups who were vips and something to do with Drake the singer so they took priority over us The way it was said was very snooty so dismayed a returned to our room After a while me and my husband decided we REALLY were not happy with this room at all so returned to reception to the same receptionist After explaining again and saying we would rather stay in a different hotel she suddenly decided to check to see if there other rooms and ta dah One was available on the 10th floor We moved an the room was fabulous exactly what we had booked It s just a shame it started on a bad note But our stay from then on was faultless apart from the room was a bit chilly I booked this hotel under the impression it was 0 1 miles from Amsterdam city centre All advertised as an amazing location but the day before we realised it was actually nearly 5 miles out This was very disappointing It was then too late to cancel , Amazingly comfortable bed Shower was fab Gorgeous breakfast and food was lovely in Rhythms 
310015,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Very comfortable beds I As well as clean cosy and modern room I stayed there for night and had a concert next door in Ziggo dome Location was perfect for me 
310016,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The rainshower is great The room doesn t feel cramped thanks to clever lay out The blinds are very effective for blocking out daylight in the early AM Pleasant informal atmosphere Industrial style interior design with a musical twist Quite a hip crowd gathers on a Saturday night Comfortable restaurant bar area Good location for a meeting
310017,Jaz Amsterdam, A bit more variety in the breakfast no toaster, Unique atmosphere great design and decoration nice innovations including mobile check in key and check out or iPad controlled coffee machine
310018,Jaz Amsterdam, The location is at the Ajax stadium so bit outside of the city Train to shiphol takes about 30 mins , A good hotel for business and pleasure trips Real desks make working a pleasure coffee machine is in the room Wifi works great and the rooms have comfortable couch like seating opportunities at the window The hotel has a small gym and wellness on the 10th floor and a bar with DJ on the ground floor Beds are so comfortable that I overslept the wake up call The staff went above and beyond to wake me up and ordered a taxi at 5 50 so that I still made my flight at 7 00
310019,Jaz Amsterdam, The hidden pay parking The fact that parking under the hotel does not belong to the hotel and the parking fee is 25 per day should be made explicit BEFORE you book , The cleanliness
310020,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Hotel was amazing I could not recommend more Staff were lovely hotel clean and very modern biggest and best bed I have ever slept in Bathroom was very funky I would rate the hotel and staff 10 10 and would advise anyone to pick this hotel The ONLY downside was the location for us Its very close to the metro however 10 stops on the train to central amsterdam so we did spend a lot of money on cabs in the evening 
310021,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, We had booked as we were off to watch Drake before he postponed the tour perfect location for hotel the beds are so comfy and with the black out blinds I felt like I got a proper rest i can t wait to visit again and would recommend this hotel to anyone
310022,Jaz Amsterdam, The heating system could be way better The bed was too soft it seems that in one the sides of the mattress the springs have broken so you felt like inside a little hole , Absolutely amazing hotel Not only a comfortable stay but a very fun one Incredible design huge bed a little too soft though and one of the greatest breakfasts I had in my life The hotel restaurant is not your typical hotel restaurant This is a great place to hang out cool atmosphere great food and drinks A less than 10 minute walk from the station so you can get on the busy Amsterdam canals area within a 10 minute ride Let me say this again what a breakfast 
310023,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Hotel was excellent breakfast had a great selection rooms were very spacious and bed very comfortable It was slightly out of the city centre as expected but only 10 minutes by train and enough shops bars and restaurants by hotel not to be isolated Train station was only a 10 minute walk and the Ajax stadium was right outside the door Brilliant stay would definitely recommend 
310024,Jaz Amsterdam, if you are not with a car far from the city center and road connections are a bit confusing, big clean room huge breakfast selection definitely worth for your money
310025,Jaz Amsterdam, Not really clear on the checkout time but was nicely extended for us , The jazz concert during the breakfast was really nice The sauna facility was clean and quiet 
310026,Jaz Amsterdam, nothing all perfect as far as I was concerned, a fantastic hotel with a twist very funky set up and room style which was refreshing to see Breaks the mould of your typical hotel with bar and restaurant etc For example a DJ in the bar fantastic multi function shower in room and overall the staff were so very helpful keen happy and really seemed to enjoy their jobs which gave the place an extra buzz 
310027,Jaz Amsterdam, The music in the bar was a bit too loud for us It would be better if there was a separate bar for hotel guests , Room was comfortable and plenty of space All the staff are brilliant worked hard to please you Nothing was too much trouble Metro was 5mins away to take you wherever you need to go Lovely restaurants within walking distance too 
310028,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing negative, Excellent hotel Super cozy clean modern lovely interiors great healthy breakfast super professional young staff most important 2steps away from ziggo dome so perfect after a concert
310029,Jaz Amsterdam, The reception on check out and check in was very busy Staff were swamped and did their best to see to everyone as quickly as possible , Room was nice and large comfy big bed and tea and coffee facilities The breakfast in the morning had an excellent selection Front desk staff were very helpful 
310030,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast some of the staff unfriendly no WiFi You have to pay for parking space , The room The bed was very comfortable Good location near to metro station 
310031,Jaz Amsterdam, Location if I was going to an event at one of the arenas the location would have been perfect However we were interested in central Amsterdam and sight seeing, Lovely comfy bed and lovely shower facility Bar and food available on site and staff very friendly Using the app that they provided was fantastic for access to room etc Breakfast was great 
310032,Jaz Amsterdam, I didn t like that our room phone didn t work breakfast was exactly the same each day and that customer service was poor , I liked that the bathroom floors were heated 
310033,Jaz Amsterdam, Although the staff were friendly the reception area felt understaffed with only 2 people The relax area was a bit disappointing and small although it was never busy , The room was great with very comfortable beds and an amazing and warm bathroom The breakfast was spot on and I would recommend it The hotel is also nicely located just 10 minutes to the train station and 25 to the city centre 
310034,Jaz Amsterdam, nothing that i could think of, Unique ambiance and decorated with friendly staffs Eventhough location is not central however its easily accessible by public transport 
310035,Jaz Amsterdam, you will expect much more for a 4star hotel No room service my room wasnt clean til 5pm bed not made or towels provided breakfast if you expect bacon sausage beans mushrooms tomatoes please dont choose it good quality but poor diversity , close to trains metro Ajax stadium
310036,Jaz Amsterdam, The wifi was not to brilliant , Brilliant location for where my destination was for NYE Friendly staff very clean nice room nice restaurant and bar and generally all round good vibe
310037,Jaz Amsterdam, We were shocked by the situation at the breakfast there was simply no free place every morning The staff sometimes tried to find a place for some people who were already desperate and claiming but with no much success either There simply aren t enough tables If you re lucky to get a spot it won t be clean and even if you manage to find somebody to clean it they will just make it wet not clean It really has destroyed our stay as we had to do sports every morning trying to find and or fight for a place as also many other guests did For a 4star hotel it is something really unacceptable The staff at the breakfast or at the reception too weren t really customer friendly , The rooms are OK in normal condition However some small things like a paper and pen are missing which we found strange But in general it was OK yet not cosy or really nice 
310038,Jaz Amsterdam, it was very expensive to stay over new year but considering that of course the price is acceptable since most of hotels were even more expensive breakfast for the price is also very basic and there really some staff members which have to be fired immediately since they have no clue about the customer service at all and I m not a person complaining normally , close to metro and train station this is different hotel from the regular hotels if you like to experiment with the design then this is hotel to go for good if you want to stay not so far from airport 
310039,Jaz Amsterdam, The Wi Fi did it work every place, Very nice hotel to stay for weekend or even more days The locations 15 min from airport by the train every 20 min to the Centrum of Amsterdam about 20 25 by Metro nr 54 To the Metro and bus station 5 min walking distains The Ajax for those who love football just a 100 meter from Hotel self it is excellent staf very helpful and friendly the room are wonderful tea coffee apparat small freighter enough place and space in the closet very comfortable bed sitting sofa s and nice dan shaver room All the towels daily cosmetic are very good Very good breakfast for vegetarian people as well And really very good nice and clean sauna s relax space and fitness room open till 23 00 There is also a different massage but must order at list a day before We stayed for 3 nights and really enjoyed Recommended 
310040,Jaz Amsterdam, The employees attitude They didn t listen to complains they didn t accept responsibility to do something The room was cold the heating system didn t work properly to make you feel warm and nice, The style the decoration 
310041,Jaz Amsterdam, We stayed in room 403 which is on the corner of building The WiFi signal was not reaching us The receptionist told us that it is due to problem with a provider But I suppose that the router was just not strong enough making few steps from our room torwards elevetor we were getting the signal , One football player from my home country said once Big expectations are the problems of its owner This is the case when we had big expectation price is quite expensive good reviews on stay in Jaz and this expectation fully came to reality The hotel is almost perfect Especially we would like to mark the breakfast and shower The bed was good Tea and coffee in room were also a good surprise Location is great although its not in the center 
310042,Jaz Amsterdam, No room service internet was very slow at times and bathroom design was not thought of every time we d take a shower the whole bathroom would flood with water , We were attending a concert at Ziggo Dome and it was literally steps away Perfect location if you don t wana be bothered with taxis after a crazy night Staff were nice quiet location very comfy beds and nice rooms 
310043,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The room was modern and very clear the breakfast was varied Big and Delicious steaks and burgers whit great beer selection in the restaurant There was DJ mixer each public room Reception restaurant Jaz Amsterdam is the best startpoint to the original dutch house parties We loved it 
310044,Jaz Amsterdam, I had to pay for late check out and this is my 1st time I have to pay for that it should be flexible and my stay was for 6 nights where they should be a complement from the hotel not to charge me for extra 2 hours I felt very bad for this , The location is perfect Beautiful decoration very helpful and friendly staff
310045,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Hotel was absolutely fantastic bed pillows was so comfortable that we just sank into them didn t want to leave the hotel room Steam Room Sauna were great as we were out all day got to use the facilities when we got back to the hotel which was great Breakfast was awesome as it was just what we needed to start the day Great location will definitely recommend this to all of our friends 
310046,Jaz Amsterdam, More English tv perhaps But that s it , Very modern clean and comfortable Free breakfast was great too Only a 15 minute Mtero ride into central Amsterdam 
310047,Jaz Amsterdam, It takes ages to check in and to check out The computer is slow and so is the printer Simply abnormally long Overcooked scramble eggs and no bacon at breakfast,No Positive
310048,Jaz Amsterdam, Unfortunately there wasn t any room service There weren t many options for breakfast as my partner and I are vegan so we had to stick with fruit , The bed was huge and so comfy and the interior was amazing Staff were friendly and really helpful with queries surrounding transport The location was perfect as we were staying to see 21 Pilots at the Heineken Music Hall which is just around the corner 
310049,Jaz Amsterdam, Can t think of anything , Breakfast was excellent and staff were very friendly and helpful they provided us with an adaptor plug which we forgot and late checkout on a Sunday at no extra charge was very much appreciated 
310050,Jaz Amsterdam, Cleanliness could be better I drank a glass of juice one night and the glass was left unwashed on the top of the counter Position might be good or bad depending on what you are looking for Subways from the arena to the Centraal station every 10min But it takes you a good 10 15min walk to get to the subway , Great designer hotel Rooms really comfortable and spacious Bonus point for the decor Shower was super cool with touch buttons An experience itself Breakfast was good but nothing really special 
310051,Jaz Amsterdam, The bar dinner staff were all very young and very bad at serving in the evening Food look nice but too so long to get and was cold , The design and features of the hotel and that BED Wow so comfortable the reception team was on the ball and helpful and the breakfast crew too they were great
310052,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The hotel in general is fantastic the room breakfast staff and restaurant All combined makes this one of the most memorable and best hotel we ve stayed at 
310053,Jaz Amsterdam, Parking a bit expensive not easy to navigate there by GPS bit far from the city center but still ok 15 EUR by Uber , Stylish Hotel spacious and immaculate clean room good wifi good breakfast decent food and live Jazz in the restaurant 
310054,Jaz Amsterdam, Not too many good restaurants nearby the hotel however this is not the hotels fault , Nice clean and modern hotel Good bar with a DJ Nice breakfast Friendly staff Located nearby the metro and therefore easy to go towards city center 
310055,Jaz Amsterdam, There is nothing to dislike This hotel is perfect Really , New and fresh looking hotel The rooms designed well Comfortable bad Extremely good service They know how to provide service to their customers Everything in this hotel is perfect 
310056,Jaz Amsterdam, Staff almost unwilling Not communication between front desk and reservation requested extra bed was not prepared we waited more than one hour Because room was so hot 25 5C we were moved to other room after several complaints Again without extra bed which was in the end moved by us personally from previous room since nobody came within another two hours During our stay was not vacuum cleaned the room any day was very dusty no replacement of toilet paper and tissues We never received without request third set of towels even we were three in the room One day happened that requested towels were ON THE FLOOR front of our room as per picture NEVER COME BACK , Bed was large and comfortable Subway was near by hotel approx 15 minutes to the city center 
310057,Jaz Amsterdam, The check in procedure was very confusing it was busy at the hotel when I arrived and Jaz s new age Apple like approach to check in not just using the standard check in desk but also individuals who walk around with Ipads seemed haphazard and confusing at best People were waiting everywhere it was not clear who was next in line and things did not move ahead with any speed After a 12 hour flight a more straight forward check in procedure during which I didn t have to jostle for position would have been welcome The hotel was fine for the two nights I was there but I would opt to stay at the Hampton by Hilton next time as it s closer to the station and better value for money , Comfortable bed good bread at the breakfast buffet the rooms are very quiet and the shower was good 
310058,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Very close 50m to the ziggo dome Large and comfortable beds Good breakfast We will stay here again next time we go to the ziggo dome or Heiniken music hall
310059,Jaz Amsterdam, Unable to get reception through hotel in room phone No reception area at wellness centre to give explanation Internet speed is sort of limiting for a Viber call out , Facilities including sauna yoga mattress fitness room and massage areas The breakfast was very good offering a variety of meals and drinks They have great curtains that can make your room completely dark which was awesome 
310060,Jaz Amsterdam, While cleaning they took my personal towels which where on a chair to dry off and I asked them about it they said give us an address to send them to you but yet no response no towels they were my anniversary gift and part of a set towels, Clean new hotel
310061,Jaz Amsterdam, The breakfast was refreshing but nothing like a bowl of coco pops or even a full English , The politeness of the staff general style of the hotel Also the blonde lady working Friday evening whatever she s doing it s working 
310062,Jaz Amsterdam, I really don t like music in the morning Certainly not during breakfast To my opinion the music was just too loud I really wonder if actually guests enjoy that music ,No Positive
310063,Jaz Amsterdam, The shower was not hot it went from lukewarm warm to cold , The hotel was clean and tidy The room was very quiet couldn t really hear any noise The bed was very comfortable Nice breakfast 
310064,Jaz Amsterdam, Usually we re in Amsterdam to enjoy the city but we were tired after walking the while day long in the city and a video on demand system would have been nice to watch a movie with the friends we were with , The view from the bedroom the design of the bedroom the buffet for breakfast the live band for breakfast the high tech toilet in the room 
310065,Jaz Amsterdam, Wasn t a fan of the toilet seat heating up as I sit there pondering life The breakfast was good but the staff could be a quick clearing away dishes , Great location as we were going to a music venue near by Short hop to town with the tube Don t get a taxi from the airport pretty much all trains go to the nearby station Very easy to get around Even a button in the toilet to lift the lid for those lazy days The live jazz trio at breakfast were great 
310066,Jaz Amsterdam, I do not think there is any improvement I could make , I have never stayed in a more perfect hotel We had visited in march and stayed in the Hilton in the same area however I would never stay there again after visiting the Jaz hotel The bed was that comfy that I cried leaving it The service and staff was unbeatable The facilities the room and the amazing shower all added to the enjoyment of the trip I couldn t recommend a better hotel Will definetely be visiting as soon as possible 
310067,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The location is right between the Ziggo dome and Amsterdam Arena which os great to attend a festival But it is about 20 minutes from the city center by the train 
310068,Jaz Amsterdam, Unsecured wifi without logging in anyone can use it Using cell phone as key card isn t without issues You cannot put drinks on tab when you have booked a room without restitution via Booking com , Big and clean rooms Roller blinds to make room completely dark Shower was great Location next to the Amsterdam Arena is great Very trendy concept daily dj performances 
310069,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, This was our first time traveling to Europe and we weren t sure what to expect The Jaz Hotel was perfect they made us feel right at home The staff were very helpful even printed out our tickets to the Ajax game for us The location is absolutely perfect just a short walk to the Metro station and only 15 minutes ride to Centraal Station Amsterdam The rooms were quiet We would definitely recommend this hotel 
310070,Jaz Amsterdam, No complains Really , Location Close to railway and metro station 12 min from the airport 12 from downtown Staff was great Pleasent helpfull positive Suprised me with a bottle of wine when they realised its my birthday Generally i would highly recomend this hotel especially younger ones 
310071,Jaz Amsterdam, The check in was quite slow, Amazing room I was upgraded for free at the 11th floor with an orange bath tub I still dream about Decoration for a pop star Nespresso machine huge bed and large terrace with sofas Good breakfast is a disco like room Everything modern cool and comfortable Good location in a short walk from the metro station and face to face with the Ajax Arena stadium 
310072,Jaz Amsterdam, Depending on your needs the location would be a little bit out of the city centre Took 30 mins to get to the city centre But this was OK for me since I ve made my visit for a concert which is at Ziggo Dome The restaurant inside of the Hotel is a little bit expensive , Excellent location for reaching Ziggo Dome Amsterdam Arena Breakfast is included and foods were delicious Staff was helpful 
310073,Jaz Amsterdam, The bathroom has a nice and soft lighting but completely impossible if you want to put your makeup on since it was of an orange colour tone , Excellent room with smart details nice shower ac easy to understand and adjust this hotel has some of those little extra details I also appreciate that the scents on the shower gel is more unisex than masculine since I prefer to travel with light packing The bed was amazing lovely covers and pillows and the room was quite relaxing 
310074,Jaz Amsterdam, First day WiFi didn t worked on any apple devices There is an option to use mobile app as a key but personnel don t know how to use it you have to update your booking virtual email with the real one and activate app, Facilities Location within 10 minutes walk to Metro station Big rooms Good breakfast
310075,Jaz Amsterdam, Odd location if you re not there for the stadium Far from everything else we wanted to do Cab driver couldn t figure out how to get to entrance So so restaurant bar, Modern fun design Very comfortable bed wonderful large bathtub that lit up Lots of light from huge windows Helpful staff 
310076,Jaz Amsterdam, a little to far away from the city center however the metro line is really close , wonderful hotel the breakfast was served in a area really nice the coffee was provided like in sf movies rich and really tasty breakfast the room very comfortable with soft bed and nice inside arrangement the bathroom was clean and like in the movies the coffee machine from the room provided a tasteful coffee 
310077,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing we really enjoyed it, The hotel is very close to the airport and only 20 minutes from the heart of the city great transport the metro comes every 10minutes the hotel itself exceeded our expectations tasty breakfast with lots of choice gym and lovely restaurant The staff were very friendly and recommended places for us to visit we were always greeted with a smile and would definitely go back 
310078,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Room was spacious and had everything we needed Bed was very comfy Staff were friendly and was in an excellent position as we were at a concert at the Ziggo Dome
310079,Jaz Amsterdam, As the hotel is new maybe why we didn t find it on our gps airport were clueless Thank God for a bus driver we found our way Maybe u should promote it at the airport , Overall very good Hearty breakfast staff in the bar very hospitable Awesome location away from the city n best within a few minutes one is in the city Couldn t have asked for more 
310080,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The best booking made with booking com over past few years Absolutely perfect service fantastic break feast Super comfortable bed and live jazz trio accompanying Sunday breakfast Unbelievable value added Plus great connection to Schipol and city center I d love to come back as soon as I can 
310081,Jaz Amsterdam, The reception is in the middle of the lobby and it is not clear who s turn it is when there are many people But this is just a detail the rest is great , The design of the hotel is amazing It is inspired to music instruments everywhere and great music at the bar of the hotel The style is the typical amsterdam style much wood some leather and steel and very different from a standard hotel The bathroom is amazing with a huge shower and there is a nice sitting area in the room next to the windows Recommended is also breakfast or a visit to the nice breakfast caf 
310082,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing will definitely stay again , Excellent hotel short ride from the centre of Amsterdam but it is totally worth it Rooms are great and the bed is definitely the most comfortable I ve ever slept in There is a late check out option on Sunday we didn t use it Staff was amazingly customer friendly which does not happen in the Netherlands so I was shocked Well done though Breakfast is included and is sufficient you will find something you like Breakfast staff helpful and efficient Cannot fault them for anything 
310083,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The design is unbelievably good If I could design my house this would be it Thank you all the people who travelled to Amsterdam and made me choose this hotel since all the hotels in the centre were completely booked It s possible to find everything you need in the room 
310084,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast medium to low quality Dit not enjoyed it unfortunately Parking is not free even though its in level 1 Dome Parking , Clean room Comfortable bed High quality furniture Sauna Fitness included Digital TV
310085,Jaz Amsterdam, There was nothing to dislike about this Hotel , The Hotel was quiet rooms large and airy with good facilities Breakfast was enjoyable with something for everyone It was close to the Metro for an easy 10 15 minute transfer into the centre on Amsterdam Ideal position 
310086,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Very nice staff and clean rooms Lobby bar always had a live DJ which may or may not suit you Some evenings it was fun but others after work a bit too tiring Overall very good though 
310087,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Location is great as its close to Ziggo Dome and a bunch of great restaurants Walking distance to the metro buses and train You can get to central station and the airport in about 25min We had a great time Thanks Jaz Amsterdam
310088,Jaz Amsterdam, Staff no smile have wifi access problem couldn t help without a sorry or adequate solution Deficiency in changing dirty sheet Forgot teabags or tissue refill from time to time Meant to Reserve for 2 persons told by hotel to pay extra money for that the room booked only for 1person Booking solved once no need to pay Later in Amsterdam Booking com said Jaz need us to pay extra money for the room if 2 persons stay once again I told Booking com to help me cancel the room Then they settled it down Vety unqualified for a 4 star hotel Very unpleasant experience nearly ruin my journey , Fashion design comfortable bed good scenery with breakfast early check in tea is good quiet room
310089,Jaz Amsterdam, pillows werent firm enough for me im just used to a very hard bed thats just me, breakfast was out of this world receptionist on arrival was a lovely young lady very welcoming and polite
310090,Jaz Amsterdam, The location was perfect for our occasion next to Ziggo Dome but not great for going to city center , Great breakfast open late in the weekend perfect 
310091,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing This hotel was beyond my expectations , Amazing hotel Great location next to the stadium and Ziggo dome Staff was excellent Room was very very clean and the decor was very well done Breakfast was plentiful with great selections and a lot of organic fruit I would stay here again in a heartbeat
310092,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing , Great location right next to the Ziggo Dome and Amsterdam Arena Ajax Took 10mins from Schipol via the train to arrive at hotel and less than 15mins to get into the centre of Amsterdam Rooms were stylish and comfortable Perfect black out blinds for a great sleep Breakfast was tasty served until 12pm We got to eat breakfast on the balcony and enjoyed the live band playing for guests 
310093,Jaz Amsterdam, I wish I could give it a 10 but it is a bit expensive compared to other 4 star hotels offering same conditions and you have to pay another 24 5euro per day for parking on top of the room price , AWESOME fancy hotel Very friendly staff very clean location very fancy and pleasant rooms shower had touch buttons instead of knobs nice breakfast They have their own fancy little restaurant with very good food if you don t feel like walking around the stadium for something else Hotel is located between the Amsterdam Arena 30 50meter and Ziggo Dome the 2 buildings actually touch A very big plus and Thank you for the staff for making sure we get parking still paid 24 5 night despite the 2 very big events happening that night football match and huge concert 
310094,Jaz Amsterdam, The breakfast Was all cold food except scrambled egg and boiled egg Even some toast would of been nice but there was no toaster Us Brittish like a warm breakfast Wish I had been told we had free spa facilities , Location how modern the room was everything about the room Staff very friendly and overly helpful Free spa facilities 
310095,Jaz Amsterdam, Only one thing was not comfortable the toiletpaper Everything else is top so why so lousy quality of this , Fantastic hotel love the difference from other hotels fresh funky and focused on music and atmosphere 
310096,Jaz Amsterdam, A bit far away from the City Center consider 20 minutes by Subway That s the only bad point of this hotel but on the other hand it s justified by the price Nevertheless just a great place to spend the w e , Just a great place From A to Z Will come again for sure 
310097,Jaz Amsterdam, Well first the lady at the lobby was very rude to me at check in and I have no idea why Second the battery for the lock in the room died so my key did not work I went to the lobby to get a new because we thought that the key card was bad At the same time there was a huge group in the lobby so the elevator was taking a long time so we went to the 4th floor using the stairs When I tried the key card it did not work So I went down at this point no very happy and the girl at the lobby said oh well the battery in the lock must be dead I will get another employee to go up with you No I am sorry for the inconvenience nothing The guy she send was very helpful and I explained how discontent I was with the hotel customer service When we came back later that night we had a note from the hotel saying there were very sorry about my experiences and they offered 2 free drinks at the bar I have to give them that at least they tried to make us feel better We went to the bar and this lady from the lobby walk us to the bar and was very nice to us and even gave us the name of some very nice local places in Amsterdam , They hotel is super nice but it is not close to town For me close is walking distance this hotel is a 28 min ride in train to the city main attractions 
310098,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The beds were very comfortable The location great Breakfast was wonderful 6 minutes walk to the metro station 2 stops from the Amsterdam airport by train 
310099,Jaz Amsterdam, A train ride out of the city centre but we were fine with that , Beautiful hotel very nicely designed Room very well appointed and stylish nice touches like underfloor heating in bathroom fantastic waterfall shower Nespresso coffee machine and pods herbal tea nice products for the shower etc Breakfast was very good would love to return 
310100,Jaz Amsterdam, Be useful to have a bar price including cocktails More info about surroundings would also have been useful When events on very busy hotel could do with more lifts at this time , Location to metro railway good very quiet room very pleasant staff Enjpyed the music
310101,Jaz Amsterdam, Staff not that motivated to help the visitors breakfast could be of greater variety , The ambience the decoration the building close to the metro station 
310102,Jaz Amsterdam, Two minor technical issues we couldn t get to work the telephone was not working properly and the alarm on the interactive TV didn t go off , The Breakfast buffet was excellent The room had a very cozy corner to sit next to the window and enjoy a free Nespresso Coffee very nice view from the 10th floor The Room and Bathroom were very modern stylish and comfortable
310103,Jaz Amsterdam, Instructions on web pages of the location are not clear enough Even there was plenty of items available during the breakfast service was bad It was friendly but so slow , Easy to access from Metro
310104,Jaz Amsterdam, More suited to those on business than families Everyone on a mission to work rather than relaxing Not the hotels fault more my own for not checking up beforehand Staff seemed under pressure as a result and a few confirmed this Room house keeping left a lot to be desired Rubbish never emptied and wooden sticks are not a good replacement for spoons , Very contemporary and all the staff were nice Bed was very comfortable and the shower was superbe 
310105,Jaz Amsterdam, Service at the front desk was rather slow person did not know how to print out our bill we were in a rush to catch our plan and we were waiting more than 15 min to check out , hotel itself interior design breakfast perfect
310106,Jaz Amsterdam, Well it is a bit far from the city centre and you will need to have a train ride , The room looked amazing The art orange bathroom lighting and an awesome shower in the ceiling I really liked the decoration The breakfast was good and included in my stay 
310107,Jaz Amsterdam, Check in could have been a little quicker but it was not that big a deal and all the staff were very pleasant and helpful If you want a picturesque hotel location you will not find it here this is a very modern and clean hotel in a very modern setting away from central Amsterdam It suited me perfectly but others may be put off , I would most definitely return to Jaz Hotel when i next visit Amsterdam It is clean modern and extremely comfortable the check in was a little slow but I suspect this is the staff struggling with a complicated booking system rather than them being slow as every member of staff we came into contact with was charming helpful and efficient they also spoke annoyingly good English But to make it easier for others to make a decision let me address two issues which other reviewers have commented on The Jaz Hotel location in regard to the centre of Amsterdam and the breakfast that is provided It will take you around 30 40 minutes to get to central Amsterdam including walking to the Metro station and then the journey on the train But to be honest it is so simple it feels a whole lot less It will also give you the chance for a little time away from central Amsterdam the location is not picturesque but it does have some great venues you can check out if you are that way inclined Breakfast is continental style and offers a huge selection If you want a fry up every morning your not going to find it here but if you are willing to ditch the old British not like I get at home attitude then you will be more than happy with with the selection I found myself getting back home to England and looking in the stores to find the ingredients to have the same type of breakfast at home that I had during our stay 
310108,Jaz Amsterdam, the location wasnt so great t was well off the dam square which is like the hub of all tourist spots one has to take a train for about 20mins just to get there ,No Positive
310109,Jaz Amsterdam, There was a lack of tourist information to hand would be handy to have literature available, The large comfy bed and luxury shower were excellent Breakfast was also excellent and well presented The location suited us being away from the busy tourist areas but they were easily reached by a very efficient metro 
310110,Jaz Amsterdam, Parking too expensive, Big choice of breakfast Nice design of the room Free spa facilities possibility Great location for those who have an event in Arena Park 
310111,Jaz Amsterdam, Food wasnt amazing but still alright, Bed was so big and comfort was amazing good location 3 minutes walk to the metro and 15 minutes on metro gets you anywhere in amsterdam
310112,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, OMG I loved how modern this hotel was The breakfast was a typical European breakfast however had several options Which were pretty good I really enjoyed my stay here 
310113,Jaz Amsterdam, Needed to be closer to dam square so the location wasn t great but was still easy access to public transport to get to dam square , The beds were so comfy and the shower and bath were amazing The actual rooms were really spacious 
310114,Jaz Amsterdam, Could have had a better selection of tea bags in the room but then again I didn t ask for any others I m sure the hotel would have sent up an English breakfast if I had asked so ignore this comment , Location was superb So close to the train station made travelling from the airport very easy And still close to the centre of Amsterdam We stayed because of attending the Pacha Festival at ArenA Park and we couldn t have been any closer I will definitely stay at this hotel again in the future The rooms are a brilliant size the beds are amazingly comfortable The coffee machine was brilliant The shower was fantastic The complimentary toiletries are huge so no need to take your own and they are very nice too The 12 o clock check out is a bonus so to is the breakfast service of 7 30 12pm at weekends Absolutely fantastic and the breakfast is out of this world gorgeous breads and pastries a good selection of meat and cheeses the fresh fruit and yogurts were delicious My favourite was the mini pancakes yum We ordered an omelette one morning and it was fab I would highly recommend this hotel very clean lovely helpful staff great facilities and it s right opposite the Ajax Stadium What more could you ask for 
310115,Jaz Amsterdam, Unfortunately there were a few things that made our stay a little less than perfect The breakfast wasn t up to the standard I expected The food that was served was very plain nothing spectacular Whenever I went to get something to eat or drink I always had to look for what I needed The set up was a little bit chaotic that s when everything was filled up Another point is the high parking rates We paid for 3 days 70 I think 25 per day is a bit steep , I booked the room for a friend and myself due to a festival which took place at the Amsterdam Arena The hotel is ideally situated and the rooms were absolutely stunning The modern style can however also be found in the lobby and bar area The employees were very informative and helpful regarding booking and tourist info 
310116,Jaz Amsterdam, I expected lower price considering that the hotel is quite far from the center , The hotel is close to metro station as well as railway station with the direct connection to the airport The hotel is new modern nice and clean Our room was big with comfortable bed and new bathroom Breakfast very good Wifi working ok 
310117,Jaz Amsterdam, Location is good close to two metro stations however this isn t the very centre of the city the flipside is that it was quiet which I liked , The lady at reception was very helpful she had lovely blue eyes Coffee machine was handy shower was very good Quiet location even though it may not appear to be I think the room had soundproofing as there was a festival nearby and I couldn t hear it 
310118,Jaz Amsterdam, Having the breakfast timings on our room key would have been helpful Room service would have been nice for when we arrived late , Jaz hotel was amazing and the staff couldn t do enough for us Easy to get into the centre via the Metro Breakfast was great Would definitely stay here again 
310119,Jaz Amsterdam, Hard to find when arriving by car Situated outside Amsterdam 15 min metro ride to city centre , Very stylish and modern hotel Good breakfast nice staff good food excellent wifi 
310120,Jaz Amsterdam, The sauna was cold and no personnel in the gym area available for assistance , Everything was fantastic The decor the ambience and the food in both the breakfast area and the restaurant was so lovely The kitchen restaurant bar and reception staff was so lovely 
310121,Jaz Amsterdam, The only thing for me would have been English breakfast tea to be provided with the in room tea coffee facilities and toast making facilities with breakfast but these are minor things A great hotel Thank you , Funky Hotel with excellent quick links into the city centre Excellent breakfast included Friendly helpful staff An all round excellent choice 
310122,Jaz Amsterdam, The only thing we were miffed about was having a bill for the city tax at the end of the stay as we were led to believe everything was paid for upfront but that was probably booking com who we booked through and not the hotel , The bed was huge which is a great bonus as my husband is over 6ft tall so we could really spread out We ate at the hotel twice as the food was excellent and the array at breakfast was so enticing Loved the Bowie lyrics to Amsterdam in the shower really quirky touch 
310123,Jaz Amsterdam, Location is a fair way out from the center which may be seen as a god thing for certain guests however not for us Sauna did not work , Hotel very nicely presented and clean All round a lovely hotel with the only negative being it s location 
310124,Jaz Amsterdam, A little bit of information in the room about breakfast and health suite opening times , really enjoyed my stay at the Jaz hotel The rooms were large modern and comfortable and the breakfast was plentiful and yummy Also added bonus of a steam room and sauna was really nice after a long day exploring Amsterdam Rhythm bar next to the hotel is worth visiting too Great food 
310125,Jaz Amsterdam, There was nothing that didn t suit me , very interesting decor different from any where else I have stayed I enjoyed the restaurants and the location as well 
310126,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast irish dont eat ham cheese or yougart for breakfast this would be more lunch so we had to go out and get breakfast in the town centre even do breakfast was included , Loved bed shower and overall hotel beautiful
310127,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Quiet location close to Amsterodam Arena stadion and metro station about 15 minutes to the city centre A lot of restaurants nearby New unconvential hotel in modern design Clean spacious and comfortable Cool coffee maker in breakfast restaurant 
310128,Jaz Amsterdam, The staff were very polite and helpful but we found you have to ask twice for anything you need but they were great nevertheless, Very modern funky hotel would definitely stay again if in Amsterdam
310129,Jaz Amsterdam, There wasn t anything we disliked , The staff were so friendly all throughout our stay They couldn t do enough for us The room was really nice and the bed was sooo comfortable The rainfall shower was so relaxing It was so easy to get to the cental station from our location We had an amazing time and would definately recommend 
310130,Jaz Amsterdam, It s not too close to the city and during late night it may be a little more complicated to get back to the hotel but compared to the filthy uncomfortable and sometime also expensive accomodation in the city center it s totally worth it , Wide choice for breakfast clean and modern rooms the best shower I ve ever taken in an hotel so far 
310131,Jaz Amsterdam, The location was a pain to get back to in the evening My wifi wouldn t connect for about 24 during my stay , Bed was amazing Dining room awesome Bathroom shower were trendy and cool 
310132,Jaz Amsterdam, I don t think there is anything i didnt like , The staff where friendly helpful and smartly dressed and were ever ready to help with anything They the staff made my stay very comfortable The rooms are clean with beautiful walls Every aspect of the hotel was working every facility They make you feel like home Its also strategically located so much so that you can t hear any single around I stayed on the 7th floor and it had a beautiful view of that part of city 
310133,Jaz Amsterdam, The hotelbird app and hotel system for rooms allocation are not synchronised We were given someone else s room During our stay I was worried that it would happen to our room and had to lock all the valuables in the safe Our stay was spoiled by the cleaners as they did not bother to hoover our room in our last day All dirty cups were left and not replaced by the clean ones and fresh tea bags were not provided, Excellent location and friendly receptionists 
310134,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing could not have had a better stay , Staff facilities and atmosphere are fantastic could not ask for a more friendly welcoming atmosphere would highly recommend to everyone 
310135,Jaz Amsterdam, I want one in every city , Great bar with nice selection of beers Good food Smiling staff Everything was juuuuuuust great Nice rooms lovely furniture wall decorations 
310136,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, We arrived late for our check in which was supposed to be 2pm but did not get there untill 11pm Was really scared they would cancel our rooms since there was 10 of us but the staff were exceptional and so courteous it was a great pleasure to stay there The view and the rooms were terrific Would definitely recommend staying Easy to reach all places Will be a pleasure to stay again in the future
310137,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing everything was perfect , Everything Location style staff room Especially room Our room was on the 10th floor with amazing sights through panoramic windows Room as the whole hotel is modern fresh spacious and very very cozy And as one more great plus good coffee in the room Thank you It was a pleasure and an honor to stay in your hotel 
310138,Jaz Amsterdam, it is a bit far from city center but for us it was good since it was close to the Amsterdam arena ziggo dome and train station , The facilities were perfect we encountered a small technical problem with the key and the staff immediately upgraded us the staff is always helpful and nice the breakfast is nice and rich the rooms are spacious and the bad and shower is amazing 
310139,Jaz Amsterdam, No negative comments here , The meal I ordered delicious and tasty The room was quite roomy Exceptionally clean Loved the shower in the bathroom Roomy bathroom Just a great room The staff was superb 
310140,Jaz Amsterdam, There was no room service available, The rooms where very comfortable a good size and provided everything we needed The breakfast was lovely Reception staff very helpful Train station was around the corner A lovely view of the Ajax stadium 
310141,Jaz Amsterdam, Few of the appliances were not working AC telephone , Comfy large bed very nice design and silence Live music with breakfast was great Also breakfast served till 12 is a huge plus from us 
310142,Jaz Amsterdam, Distance to the city center, Amazing rooms super comfortable bed fancy shower very nice breakfast and friendly staff We couldn t ask for more Will definitely return 
310143,Jaz Amsterdam, the breakfast can be more diversified , the hotel itself is very nice modern and worth the money the room was beautifull and it had a really nice corner by the window just to relax rain shower a perfect touch and the display of washing products in bottles a good ideea but the best part is the bed extra comfy and big and the view of Ajax Arena a plus for men overall a very pleasant stay 
310144,Jaz Amsterdam, Honestly There was nothing that I can complain about , The entire venue was well worth it The price the rooms the accommodations the jazz musicians at breakfast Absolutely recommend to all when I come back I will definitely look to this venue again 
310145,Jaz Amsterdam, Awkward when we were locked out of toilet in middle of night Required a concierge house call to fix the lock Also awkward to roll luggage from either of the two Metro stations as no shuttle service existed Modern bathroom fittings a bit tricky , Large room comfortable large bed Excellent range of buffet breakfast items Brilliant modern jazzy decor Very quiet even with background music Late checkout was a bonus Big hotel in an Arena sports stadium Would be very busy when events are on 
310146,Jaz Amsterdam, No free parking it s mentioned on booking com it s 25 Euro The service could have been better They promised separated beds forgoten breakfast to go forgoten , Great room nice concept The location is really really good if you go the the Ziggo dome the music hall or the stadium 
310147,Jaz Amsterdam, 1 breakfest was a little too monotony and very small vegetable choice 2 in my opinion it is a little too expensive, 1 localization very good near the metro station 15 min to Ams Centrum AND railway station if You want to go out of Ams for example Utrecht Haga or other it is very easy It is main station even IC trains stops there 2 very comf rooms nice beds AND places for rest in the room 3 General climate of this place was some kind uniqe jazz band 4 coffe express and tea kettle in the room So You can make tea and coffee
310148,Jaz Amsterdam, staff only speaks english might be a problem for some and at some moments reception is really understaffed, easy to reach nearby station very nice trendy decor well equiped room nespresso machine Lot of value for not too much money make sure to reserve a parking spot upfront 10 euro cheaper I will definitely come back here
310149,Jaz Amsterdam, The location Called Jaz in the City but so far out of town its not even on the city map , Nice big room comfortable bed excellent shower 
310150,Jaz Amsterdam, The room was not cleamed propperly every day tv broke twice but was always fixed but inconvemient to have it sorted out every time , Big room loved the modern shower 
310151,Jaz Amsterdam, We had a hard time finding the hotel using an automobile with two different map programs Ended up driving around in circles for quite a while before finding the place Parking was confusing and expensive In August the only bed covering provided was a heavy comforter more suitable for winter We d have appreciated a lighter blanket While the food in the bar restaurant was quite good there was no quiet area more conducive to conversation while dining , The hotel is clean new and modern Bed and other furnishings were comfortable The room was quiet with a good view over the city Breakfast was comprehensive and generally tasty though the scrambled eggs were a bit strange 
310152,Jaz Amsterdam, The free wifi didn t work on my phone which was a bit annoying and my boyfriend and I got swotted away a bit rudely when we were still finishing off our breakfast a couple of minutes after it had officially finished but other than that it was great , The staff were really friendly The breakfast runs until midday need I say more It s not in the most central location but it s still fairly easy to get to and the night buses make it easy to get back to after a night in the centre The bed was sooooo comfy I m still having dreams about that bed Oh and the breakfast is something else So good 
310153,Jaz Amsterdam, The only negative thing was having to get the metro into the city centre, The size of the bed the breakfast very helpful staff and friendly staff 5 minute walk away from the metro which took you to the city centre
310154,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Huge comfortable bed it made my own super kingsize look small Great value and easy to get into the city centre in around 20 minutes It s usually really quiet around the hotel but it s right next to the Ajax stadium We came back to the hotel just before a match one evening and it was unbelievably busy but it was a really great atmosphere even though we weren t supporters One of the best hotels we ve been to 
310155,Jaz Amsterdam, The tv wasn t working the last day couldn t change the channel and we couldn t use our hdmi cable Unclear parking situation , The location was close to public transportation Very nice and modern looking The food in the restaurant was really good 
310156,Jaz Amsterdam, The hotel was quite a way from the center and cabs were expensive so ended up getting the train most days, Bed was so comfortable like a cloud The steam room and sauna looked brand new and was very beneficial in getting rid of our hangover
310157,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, I really like the interior The ambient is really cool in this place The rooms are really nice and stylish For me the location was perfect because it was close to my workplace however even for the purpose of sightseeing it s ok since there is a train station and metro via which I can get from to the airport and the city centre 
310158,Jaz Amsterdam, It was a bit far from the center but a 5 mins walk to the metro and 10 stops will take you to the Centraal Station so it is not a big deal , Everything Room was clean and stylish staff were friendly facilities were cool try the wellness area on the 10th floor breakfast etc 
310159,Jaz Amsterdam, There was nothing we didn t like , Everything the hotel was amazing The warm welcoming we got to the comfy bed that you didn t want to get out of in the morning to the wonderful breakfast laid out for you nothing was too much trouble and we loved every minute of our second stay here 
310160,Jaz Amsterdam, The pillows For the bed kind of mesh around your head when you sleep, I honestly had low expectations going in because I didn t really do much research on the place outside of the location and cost but after staying there I was more then surprised with the value I got with the food the decor and the staff I was only traveling with one other person but the rooms size was perfect I never felt cramped like in other hotels and the shower wasn t complicated to figure out like any shower away from your home shower Also it has free internet everywhere in the hotel which to me you can t get 5 stars for your hotel if you don t have free wifi everywhere in your hotel 
310161,Jaz Amsterdam, The location is a little out of the city centre but transport is so good it was easy to travel on metro with 3 stations located very close to the hotel , Really friendly staff Happy to help with anything Good clean facilities Lovely room Chef and waiting staff were brilliant and we ended up eating there every day My sister has some allergies and the chef listened carefully and went out of her way to create food that she could eat without worry I am a vegetarian and there was enough choice for me and the food was excellent Fresh and tasty 
310162,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing , Modern trendy hotel Beautiful design clean and functional rooms Great breakfast everyday very relaxed atmosphere Located right opposite Ajax arena and only a 5 minute walk from Biljmer Station Nice to be away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to easily get into Amsterdam 
310163,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing was perfect , Me and my boyfriend stayed at Jaz for our joint birthdays Absolutely loved everything about the hotel Staff were lovely and welcoming Loved the design and was spotlessly clean and presented We would definitely stay again Thank you Stella 
310164,Jaz Amsterdam, The location was further from the city than expected No room service or mini bar in the room No pay TV or Netflix I night staff member was rude unhelpful and patronising This was addressed with management and overall I am happy with how it was addressed , The bed and space in the room was great Most of the staff especially house cleaning were very professional and a pleasure to deal with 
310165,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast is fine for adults but there was no cereal options available So if you have children that like basic cereal for breakfast Cornflakes etc then they will be disappointed I had no choice but to go to the supermarket and buy a box of cornflakes that we carried into breakfast everyday we did get a few strange looks , The location was perfect for us as we wanted to stay as close to Ajax stadium as possible It is just a short walk away from stadium and Metro train station The hotel is new and very modern It has a really nice bar restaurant with a lively atmosphere the gourmet burgers were great Staff are all very friendly as you would expect Our room was ok modern with nice bathroom Overall we were very happy with our stay at this hotel 
310166,Jaz Amsterdam, Location is ok if You can walk couple minutes from Metro station Restaurant doesn t raise any hiphorays , Extremely good fresh juice fruits and youghurt on breakfast 
310167,Jaz Amsterdam, They had an system issue and overbooked the hotel so the 1st night we had to sleep in a different Hotel that i didn t like that much , The Hotel was amazing very clean staff was great to us it was a bit far from the city center but in the train only 15 min away and would definitely stay here next time
310168,Jaz Amsterdam, Too much use of orange color in bathrooms mixed with the yellow lights and u cannot tell the exact shade of the lipstick A little bit more light in the room would be good Everything else was perfect and spot on , The staff was very nice and friendly they checked us in before time The bed was super comfy everything neat and clean 
310169,Jaz Amsterdam, I had to leave earlier due to family reasons and this hotel refused to adjust the amount paid You have to read the conditions of your stay was the arogant response from the desk staff Next time I am picking Motel One instead of this one , Breakfest quality
310170,Jaz Amsterdam, The only small downside is that being a little far from the city during the night it would take you a while to go back to the hotel But if you re not into nightlife that s simply perfect , Basically anything Confortable and silent rooms amazing shower the best I ever had in an hotel super rich breakfast open till 12 rooms and commons spaces perfectly clean professional and always kind staff Literally anything you want from an hotel 
310171,Jaz Amsterdam, We wanted to extend our stay further but due to demand you were fully booked with the only option to upgrade at the grand cost of 100 euros a night , Lovely modern hotel room with space a treat from the hotels we experienced in central Amsterdam
310172,Jaz Amsterdam, Distance to city center but the Metro station is at 5 min walk so It s OK , Excellent Relaxing Hotel Designed Room with a comfortable bed Cheerful Friendly Staff We loved everything in the hotel It was a very good experience we will surely come back Thanks for making our stay amazing 
310173,Jaz Amsterdam, Would have preferred more choice for our evening meal although the steak we had was very good , Relaxed feel of the hotel Didn t have to queue to check in All done using app on phone Staff very helpful moving us to another room because the TV and phone not working Calling us taxis etc New room was lovely had everything we needed 
310174,Jaz Amsterdam, Staff were more concerned about spinning their tunes on a deck that dealing with guests trying to get served at the bar restaurant a group of guests tried to watch the euro football and it was turned down and the music was just really loud need to pay more attention to guests also waiting ages to check in ,No Positive
310175,Jaz Amsterdam, There was no room for smokers They couldn t provide us plug adaptor because they had no stock Vending machine sells the plugger but it cost 20 , The bed and pillow were super comfortable USB charger in the room was a good innovation The room was clean with a good view of Ajax Amsterdam stadium Friendly staffs Near to the metro station Exit the station turn left walk about 5 minutes youll see the hotel very easy
310176,Jaz Amsterdam, If you are coming back after the Metro has finished at midnight taxis to the area are expensive There was a sufficient amount of storage in the room but some drawers would have been useful , The bed was very comfy and there was a variety of options for breakfast The location of the hotel was good and was only a short journey on the Metro to the centre and main sites 
310177,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast selection could have been a lot better more of a selection for kids , Bedrooms clean and fresh Beds and pillows were super comfy Spa area was great and very clean Overall super hotel 
310178,Jaz Amsterdam, I would prefer more vegetables for breakfast especially during summer in Netherlands , Very good coffee very good location if you come with car Hi tech shower 
310179,Jaz Amsterdam, The breakfast is too minimalistic though very tasty , Beautiful intertior design handy digital check in check out friendly staff good location 
310180,Jaz Amsterdam, I wanted to be more central I calculated wrong , The beds are very comfortable The hotel Is very nice modern and relaxing The staff are very helpful 
310181,Jaz Amsterdam, The restaurant has great food with modest prices The room has all the needed facilities and very big quiet The desk people did everything what we ask We are coming back for sure , Fantastic Hotel being now living the Future as Hotel will be in 20 years from today Excellent room Breakfast was great Location is only 20 min from center Amsterdam

310184,Jaz Amsterdam, Service in Restaurant for my opinion a bit slow but very nice food quality, Nice Rooms good food nice bar Check In was very easy and the staff very friendly Close to the office Very comfortable bed nice rainshower and good ameneties The safe in the room was as well usefull Breakfast was nice too
310185,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast was the downfall Nothing fried no fried eggs omellete sausages bacon croissants and ham and scrambled eggs and cheese only , Location is best close the metro and Arena Bed is cozy and size of the room ok Lovely croissants pastry
310186,Jaz Amsterdam, The coffee tea facilities in the room were very poor and the were no complimentary drinks in the fridge as stated there wasn t a booklet in the room of things to do or how to work the air con funky touchscreen ect and the noise was awfully outside up till around 3am alot of lorries loading and unloading right outside, The location for the arena was perfect and bed was really comfortable had a great nights sleep
310187,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing, Overall equipment room bed bathroom fitness sauna hammam excellent breakfast Good location next to Subway line and direct access within 10 minutes to Amsterdam downtown
310188,Jaz Amsterdam, Would have been nicer if the twin bed was a bit apart from each other , It was very clean and modern Very good location for staying for gig at Amsterdam ArenA 
310189,Jaz Amsterdam, Hotelbar could open a litte longer for an afterdrink Jazzcombo at breadfast nice but quite loud , Perfect location for concert Ziggo or HMH Super staff at frontdesk very serviceoriented and with humor Parking under hotel but don t forget to make reservations upfront 
310190,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Most comfortable bed we have slept in while travelling in Europe for 12 weeks Almost to hard to get up and go to Amsterdam sightseeing Excellent breakfast in the mornings with lovely live music Fantastic showers 
310191,Jaz Amsterdam, More tea bags etc in the room and Milk to go with it rather than creamer powder , En suite shower facilities were pristine and clean Very quiet heard no noise from other hotel users nor the Ziggo Stadium next door even though there was a concert on 
310192,Jaz Amsterdam, My friend dropped a phone charger at the front desk for my family to pick up but the front desk misplaced it and my parents never got it I was very disapointed due to this experience I even sent an email to the hotel to deliver the charger with no reply , The hotel is amazing hi tech good location far from the hustle bustle of Amsterdam and in easy reach of downtown area 
310193,Jaz Amsterdam, the music in the bar area was drum and base and very monotonous by contrast the subtle jazz over breakfast was far better, great hotel in a great location and very quiet Lovely shower 
310194,Jaz Amsterdam, It would have been handy to have an information booklet in the room with details about the hotel facilities the surrounding area and public transport Not a big problem though as the wifi was excellent and the staff were helpful too , The whole hotel and rooms were really modern and nicely designed Public transport was easy to access less than 10 minutes to walk to the Metro where you can take a tram directly into the city center We parked at the Park Ride Arena next to the hotel and paid just 2 euros to park for the whole weekend Perfect for anybody going to a concert at the Ziggo Dome Even though our room faced the adjacent square Ziggo Dome venue which was full of people late at nightt the room was incredibly quiet An awesome futuristic shower huge TV and excellent breakfast selection made our stay superb 
310195,Jaz Amsterdam, If you are not there for an event in the Amsterdam Arena or for a music gig which was our case the place is rather isolated, Very clean spacious super quiet room with everything I look for Excellent comfy bed Top quality shower gel and shampoo in big dispensers to avoid waste Very good breakfast
310196,Jaz Amsterdam, Better information regarding breakfast times we missed our Monday breakfast as the time was not communicated to us, The beautiful large comfy bed with the very pleasant decor We both fell in love with the bathroom shower Lots of privacy also
310197,Jaz Amsterdam, I expected a wider variety of continental breakfast than what was offered For the price you pay for the hotel you would expect a better selection of breakfast, We went to the arena on the Saturday for sensation and it s literally over the road So perfect for any events in the arena or at heineken music hall 
310198,Jaz Amsterdam, we can t seem to get the sound system to work Definately cant play our own iphone ipad and the info onscreen was in all languages except dutch or english, Awesome ambiance Close to concert venues Bowie lyrics in bathroom
310199,Jaz Amsterdam, We rented bikes from the hotel to ride into the city We had a blast but found out you actually get a better deal on bikes if you rent from in the city center Next time we would take the metro into town and rent bikes there instead , The hotel was very clean and the reception staff were very friendly and helpful The in hotel restaurant served up some amazing food for pretty decent prices There location was great Only about a 15 minute walk to the metro station and there are plenty of shops and restaurants along the way 
310200,Jaz Amsterdam, Issue with parking ticket paid at the reception while leaving P Dome parking house, Comfortable beds friendly and young staff late breakfast on Sunday 
310201,Jaz Amsterdam, After parking the car in the Arena Parking it took me 10 minutes to find the hotel due to missing directions Some small signed e g Jaz Hotel in 100 m on the left at the parking exit will be useful , Close to Arena Nice musing during the breakfast Excellent bedding
310202,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The location is perfect and very close to both the subway and the train station The hotel is very modern and everything looks as if new The staff is very friendly and reliable 
310203,Jaz Amsterdam, There was nothing not to like Honestly , Absolutely fantastic hotel Brand new spacious rooms very stylish decorated with attention to details Right next to the ArenA stadium great for visiting a venue there 
310204,Jaz Amsterdam, There was no food available when we arrived late and no room service Breakfast was okay but got boring after 2 days , Bed bedroom was definitely the highlight Coffee was amazing 
310205,Jaz Amsterdam, Took forever to get me an iron and board , Rooms were very nice 20ft high ceilings in mine Very nicely decorated Very Clean Great Bathrooms and Showers also Lovely Staff at Reception and Restaurants 
310206,Jaz Amsterdam, Staff not very accommodating upon check in the receptionist started checking us in then answered the phone and left us waiting rude Asked for an iron and ironing board and had to go to reception after 45 minutes as it had still not arrived, Really nice room with large bed good location for what we wanted Easy access to city center via tram links Breakfast was not English but plenty on offer
310207,Jaz Amsterdam, Expensive parking I love if I can open the window there wasn t possible, New and stylish hotel Close to Metro station Arena Amsterdam in very quiet area Good approach by car Young and helpful staff
310208,Jaz Amsterdam, The location you need to take the underground to get to the city centre or the taxi We payed 40 eur for a hybrid taxi car to take us there or 22 26 eur for an Uber car It takes 20 25 mins breakfast after 10am is rather poor, Such a cool hotel with a great design and modern look Different in many ways than other hotels I ve stayed in I liked the jaz music related objects chairs looking like drums breakfast areas looking like stages walls looking like concert audience etc The hotel also has great modern facilities to turn on the shower and set the temperature you need to push some buttons and to order a cappuccino at breakfast to need to click on an Ipad app The room was big with a huge comfy bed and nice mini couches near the window to read a book or simply relax The design was also very nice The hotel is located right near Amsterdam Arena so in case you plan to attend a concert or a football game it s the perfect place to accommodate 
310209,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing really , Comfortable well appointed room Very clean Hotel quiet Well situated and connected The breakfast was superb I could check inn before arrival via an app and used my cellphone to unlock the door 
310210,Jaz Amsterdam, Not for walking but the train is close and only a 15 min ride, Continental breakfast was great the bed was 10 10 and really clean just too mention a few
310211,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, very clean staff excellent perfect for us cos we were at Coldplay at the Arena next door and the train station was just as close to get into Amsterdam Would definitely recommend We ll be going back for sure 
310212,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, We were included in the hotels relaunch which was very kind but we felt a bit out of place We had an amazing time and would definitely book the hotel again 
310213,Jaz Amsterdam, no room service but i have to say i did ask for some milk to make tea and the staff where straight up with some for me but i would of loved some food in our room after our concert, room and furnishings
310214,Jaz Amsterdam, Lack of choice of room as first come first basis tho booked a superior room got a basic room, Coffee via an iPad rooms soundproofed very good shower very powerful wet room good idea
310215,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing, The bed was excellent Breakfast was good design of the room was modern and very comfortable lots of plugs for charging phones and computers 
310216,Jaz Amsterdam, attention is paid to irrelevant details greather than the warm atmosphere which makes one hotel better Just a few details The staff wasn ready for the breakfast on time limited breakfast for this kind of hotel category due to negligence of employees folding table smash down during the breakfast and scary us a lot the alarm system in the hotel without any reason was activated early in the morning with message to all of the guest to leave the hotel very unconvinient situation , Interesting modern concept far from the city center but good location if you are planing to atend Amsterdam Arena
310217,Jaz Amsterdam, More information available on the metro and trains in surrounding areas , Breakfast was amazing rooms clean large and modern Also such comfortable beds and amazing bathroom 
310218,Jaz Amsterdam, Telephone service was out of order through out in most of the rooms TV was also out of order but was fixed later Number of staff members seems to be less and they were struggling to cope with the pressure of work particularly at night , Close to public transport reasonable room size and comfortable bed 
310219,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast excellent but the option of English breakfast would have been a bonus , Room absolutely private luxurious and quiet essential in a busy central location 
310220,Jaz Amsterdam, The location was always difficult for a taxi to find but its within walking distance to the train station , Beds were very comfortable and the shower was amazing Room and facilities were very clean and the staff was always friendly and helpful 
310221,Jaz Amsterdam, I don t think there was anything I would change maybe more selection at breakfast But my main issue would be value for money I paid 350 pounds for 2 nights which I felt was a bit too much , The location was fantastic we were staying there as we re going to see rihanna at the arena which was right in front less than a 2 mins walk The bed was glorious extremely comfortable The staff were amazing very very helpful amazing customer service Will definetly go back and stay but this time in a suite 
310222,Jaz Amsterdam, No room service no food after 23 00 never experienced that in a 4 hotel When getting back from a concert and not wanting to eat overpriced junkfood from the street the absence of room service or some fingerfood at the bar was a disappointment, Brand new great comfortable beds and nice modern room
310223,Jaz Amsterdam, The breakfast could be better as I only had breakfast once during our stay and it made me ill there should be a English breakfast on the menue The scrambled eggs tasted like some powder mix absolutely awful, The room was lovely some comfy defo will be coming back for another stay Was such a perfect location right on the door step for the Chris brown concert
310224,Jaz Amsterdam, The location is not convenient if you plan to explore the centre of Amsterdam I was really disappointed that the hotel charges for parking when there is a huge empty underground parking area I also expected more from breakfast Last but not least we were asked to pay the city tax although it was already included in the fees of Booking , The hotel is clean and staff were kind and friendly 
310225,Jaz Amsterdam, The position is not ideal , Really nice room and room design with an amazing shower booth Also a decent sized gym to get your workout in when away from home The live jazz band for breakfast rendered me speechless 
310226,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing at all I couldn t fault it , The staff are nothing but helpful here anything we wanted it was no problem We checked in 4 hours before it said our room was ready but it was ready already Then we d forgot our adapters but it was no hassle they had some at reception for us to borrow Breakfast is served until 12 noon which is amazing when you have a hangover and you can have a late check out until 4pm at no extra cost We ate in the restaurant one night and the food was amazing and very reasonably priced The beds are SO comfortable and the rooms are very modern extremely clean and the TV even had English channels I would 100 stay here again even though it is a tram ride away from the centre of Amsterdam you are only a 5 min walk away from the station and it is only 2 90euros return BE WARNED do not get a taxi back from the centre of Amsterdam at night it cost us 45euros NOT the hotel s fault though just a friendly pointer 
310227,Jaz Amsterdam, Not much can t think of anything but perhaps location but Metro was close , Everything The staff was excellent especially Food Beverage Decor was cool and upbeat snagged a special rate which was the hook 
310228,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing place is perfect , Staff very helpful and could speak English well The hotel was beautiful clean quiet and so modern I took pics everywhere amazing decor Breakfast was lovely a lot of variety with staff at hand to help or keep the place looking spik and span constantly Free WiFi A good size telly and bed And the shower Need I say more I would definitely recommend and return this time for a longer stay thanks jaz amsterdam 
310229,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing, Everything possibly the best hotel I have EVER stayed in Showers Sauna Staff decorations The hallway carpet was clean and soft Yes I walked around barefoot felt so comfortable here The steak was incredible Very glad I chose Jaz x
310230,Jaz Amsterdam, Not in the centre of Amsterdam but it is close to a metro stop which takes 15 mins to get to the centre A little noisy till around midnight because our window looked over the Ziggo Dome bar where people had gathered after a concert , Very large comfortable bed and pillows Very clean Looks very new and fresh Late check out till 4pm Right beside the ArenA and Ziggo Dome 
310231,Jaz Amsterdam, Only location is a bit too far from the centre of the city train really goes about 14 min but to get in to get out waiting for a train walk to the hotel not less than 30 min min , Hotel is designed and stylish absolutely modern and comfortable can be a good price decision when centre city is overpriced 
310232,Jaz Amsterdam, I think the hotel is overpriced for what it offers Location is far from the center rooms are nice but anything exceptional it is only the big board with the girl face they put on top of the bed that makes the difference but it is the same in all the rooms I seemed to understand I was upset by the breakfast poor choice and low quality great breakfast room though I would come again but for a cheaper rate , Staff is nice and kind WIFI is working well The place is trendy and there s music going on almost every night at the bar 
310233,Jaz Amsterdam, This nice and comfortable hotel need to be complimented with better all round staff service , A brand new modern clean and comfortable hotel with very particular eye catching design details and facilities Congratulations go to the interior designers who had a keen eye to detail for every corner of the hotel 
310234,Jaz Amsterdam, Only disappointment was not being able to go into the hotel bar for a drink before the concert as it was pre event diners only which was a bit odd given that we were hotel guests , Really terrific modern hotel with excellent facilities and helpful staff Helped make a trip to Amserdam to see an Adele concert very enjoyable Also ideally placed with a short tram ride into the city centre and a short train rdie to the airport 
310235,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing every thing was perfect , This is probably the best hotel we have been to on the continent We we re recommending to our friends as soon as we arrived Brilliant stay Even when the fire alarm went off the staff were brilliant 
310236,Jaz Amsterdam, A correct explaination about the parking garage , Very friendly and helpful staff We were with a group of chinese customers They needed help sometimes Good breakfast fitnessroom trendy environment very nice

310238,Jaz Amsterdam, Restaurant was more bistro style and we did not have a good experience when eating, Location to ziggadome comfort of room cleanliness friendly and helpful staff
310239,Jaz Amsterdam, Had bottles of drinks in the fridge but no bottle openers When checking with staff there was still no joy and had to use a knife to get tops off , Location perfect for the concert Very clean and staff helpful Good access to the city via train 
310240,Jaz Amsterdam, Minor issues cleaning staff in breakfast restaurant could use some coaching on how to clean properly Bit on the pricey side for a hotel 20 mins from centre , Excellent location for football match in Amsterdam ArenA or concert event in Ziggo Dome Nice transport possibilities to city center Good breakfast buffet great atmosphere in hotel Very friendly staff 
310241,Jaz Amsterdam, Stand in line at breakfast to get Coffee really too long, DJ in the restaurant in the evening Lounge Music in the corridor also when joining my room in th afternoon
310242,Jaz Amsterdam, One of the staff was lying bcz he want to use his mobile phone he told us i solve ur problem about parking but when i checkout they said its not Take to long to get the key more than 20min No room service food U should go down to Restaurant come on, The bed Quite

310245,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The room was unique in design and facilities It was super nice to have a Nespresso machine with 6 capsules in our room for two The breakfast was delicious 
310246,Jaz Amsterdam, No explanation at incheck over how late we had to checknout Breakfast needs a sign saying you dont have to wait to be seated Disco music at breakfast was luckily stopped and a relaxing trio played live , So close to the ziggo dome Breakfast simple but lekker Great freshly made omelet Lovely trio of musicians serenaded us at breakfast 
310247,Jaz Amsterdam, This was a party hotel we were advised on our booking in There s no room service we wanted to go for dinner but there was a party going on in the restaurant it was just loud unbearable In room soaps etc were s big ugly bottle three quarters empty used by previous guests YUCK,No Positive
310248,Jaz Amsterdam, I can t fault a single thing, I can t fault this hotel at all Staff location overall the hotel was amazing Enjoyed our stay so much and will be recommending to friends Thanks for having us 
310249,Jaz Amsterdam, Called twice for a iron board Employees promised both times to get me one which did not happen With check out it took 20 minutes which is way too long ,No Positive
310250,Jaz Amsterdam, We arrived by car and the entrance comes very sudden in a roundabout with not a particular good sign Go straight in the roundabout It s then down a steep hill until you are at the entrance It doesn t realy Look like a hotel entrance If you miss the exit it s quite a long way to drive back and get it right The parking attendent was also very rude and kept insisting about a reservasion while the reseptionist had told us that we should just tell him we were guests at the hotel , Very nice hotel with a modern Look It is situated Next to the Ziggo Dome so a perfect choice if you are attending a concert there Great Breakfast and very nice rooms 
310251,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Good staff Always ready to help you Good position Far from the centre but using the metro you need only 15 minutes to arrive into the centre of Amsterdam There isn t private parking but the available parking is public and it is available for 24 50 euro for the first 24 hours and afterwards the cost is 2 euro hour Close to the stadium there is a P R parking less expensive There is a huge discount with the metro tickets but be careful the discount is only available if you have the ticket valid for 1 hour and not the one valid for 24 hours Beautiful double room and good breakfast
310252,Jaz Amsterdam, Very far from city centre Very big hotel it needs more staff to run smoothly , Amazing atmosphere modern and interesting concept youthful and energetic vibe Large double bed very comfortable Good breakfast Great coffee making facilities in the room Very comfortable digital shower Good WiFi 5 minutes from metro 
310253,Jaz Amsterdam, The hotel is far away from city centre several Metro stations and you need to walk about 800m to the nearest Metro or train station Free hostal style breakfast The pump of the shampoo was broken and the shower gel was empty I chose cash as payment preference during booking but the reception staff only asked for my credit card Finally I paid cash but I cannot believe the staff of a 4 stars hotel said they don t accept 500 bank note , Hotel room with Amsterdam Arena view
310254,Jaz Amsterdam, 24 day for the parking The staff made it 14 day Anyway if you would stay for 1 week it would have been an expensive nightmare They should put it on there bookingpage , Lovely breakfast Verry friendly staff 
310255,Jaz Amsterdam, Parking of Eur 20 is expensive for the location They play music in the corridors all night I could hear it in the room while trying to sleep Had to call the reception to request them to turn down the volume , Brand new and very clean Breakfast was nice and service at the breakfast was also very nice 
310256,Jaz Amsterdam, Cannot identify anything excellent value for money, Staff were very friendly especially at a busy breakfast service nothing was too much bother Food was delicious rooms spotless beds and pillows divine 
310257,Jaz Amsterdam, My partners burger that he had from the restaurant was raw and cold inside but we didn t have time to send it back due to needing to go to the airport , All the quirky mod cons were super queen size bed was amazing And the shower was bliss 
310258,Jaz Amsterdam, checking in was slow check in staff was giving tourist attraction tips to a group of elder german women for at least 15 minutes Organize a desk to assist tourists , good bed good shower good breakfast
310259,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast selection was good but restocking should have been faster , Design led hotel fresh and modern in a fantastic location for the Ziggo Dome and Ajax Arena and only a few minutes by train into the centre of Amsterdam 
310260,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Amazingly comfortable bed Excellent walk in shower Large room Great views of city Super helpful and friendly staff 100 staying here next time we come to Amsterdam 
310261,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Firstly great staff all really helpful and friendly bedrooms are large decor is funky food good guitars to pick up and play if you fancy it bar has a dj in the evening easy access to city Would return 
310262,Jaz Amsterdam, Lack of lighting in the room poor breakfast facilities ie no toaster and we had to ask staff everytime we wanted toasted bread , Modern facilities friendly staff nice shower with good toiletries situated close to the train station which makes travelling around quite easy 
310263,Jaz Amsterdam, No hotel parking although the parking is in the hotel building it does not belong to the hotel and requires separate payment and my US credit cards did not work there causing a long delay upon departure So no advantage to the hotel location being away from the city with regards to parking We took the train to the city convenient if you are OK with a few minutes walk , Nice modern hotel with all facilities Nice breakfast once you understand how does the modern style breakfast work what can you ask and from whom You can prepare your own hot drinks e f cappuccino once you learn how to do it Interesting experience 
310264,Jaz Amsterdam, not much choice in hot foods for breakfast, supeb comfy beds stylish rooms and fantastic location for the ELO concert and getting the trains into the city
310265,Jaz Amsterdam, The smell of their shampoo n lotion , The room so nice n comfy Breakfast is excellent specially their jogurt breakfast and the selection is good Staff are very friendly and happily working there 
310266,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Everything was perfect The hotel is near a metro station 5 minutes by foot to the station then 18 minutes with metro to Amsterdam centraal in front of Amsterdam Arena and Ziggo dome The room is large with a special design the bathroom looks well with some high tech facilities The bed is big and comfortable There is a good breakfast The internet connection works well One of the best hotels that I stayed in Highly recommended The price of the room may be a little problem but it worths the money 
310267,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast could be bigger and the location is not in the city so if you want a city hotel this is not the one for you However it is next to the football stadium and music venue so if you re booked into these events it s the perfect location , Really nice hotel nice decor clean friendly staff
310268,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing , An excellent hotel with friendly staff A great location for concerts eating etc The train station is only a five minute walk taking you strait into amsterdam Central Will be booking again 
310269,Jaz Amsterdam, It s a bit out of the way of the center but public transport is so good it doesn t matter , Massive bed really clean great windows seats Overall a lovely room
310270,Jaz Amsterdam, The restaurant seems to think it s a club with a DJ playing dreadful dance music as early as 7pm Not a comfortable environment to just have a quiet dinner or drink in It doesn t even make sense because there s nothing in the area that would make this place a good pre club spot , Very modern room incredible shower Breakfast was decent the coffee machine was quite a surprise iPad controlled bizarre 
310271,Jaz Amsterdam, Beds made up as 2 singles when we had booked a double and only one cup and no milk and no basic English tea Also no written instructions for use of equipment like the coffee machine Pillows were far too soft Food in the restaurant during the afternoon was very poor had to send it back and money paid was refunded No compensation though when you are hungry , Breakfast was fresh and plentiful Enjoyed live music over breakfast and friendliness of the staff 
310272,Jaz Amsterdam, the breakfast it was a struggle to find a clean table as the staff was totally unattentive some of the facilities such as an ipad to control coffee brewing are a nice gadget but not very effective there are no quit e meeting rooms to be found which is essential for somebody on business trip the restaurant is chiefly for loud speaking because of the DJ beer drinking guests The decoration of the corridor is really ugly but that is personal taste there is no real place in the room where to store your cloths Never discovered how to keep water in the sink My room not only had no view but was facing a light blinking wall that was quite disturbing , the bed and the shower were excellent
310273,Jaz Amsterdam, For some reason during my previous stay in February and on this occasion I didn t sleep well I think perhaps it is that I find the duvet too warm and heavy The staff did leave extra sheets but then there was no warmth at all Oh dear as I think it s a great hotel , Very handy for the airport and rail access to all over Love the breakfasts and the live music and dancing from the server 
310274,Jaz Amsterdam, No pen in the room, Stylish pleasant really friendly staff Also had good coffee machines everywhere nespresso in the room awesome automated TopBrewers at breakfast Also they have an app to use your phone as a door key 
310275,Jaz Amsterdam, The info button on our TV was not working when we arrived on the Saterday We reported it when we left on the wednesday it still was not working The windows were very dirty , The room and bed was comfortable 
310276,Jaz Amsterdam, I had some problem with the app key in my phone , Excellent hotel Even though it is not located downtown it was very easy to get to the heart of Amsterdam Five minutes walk around Amsterdam Arena to Bijlmer Arena station and then 12 minutes in the Metro and your are in the city center Simply one of the best hotels I have been to Very modern in style design and technology I checked in and out of the hotel with app in my phone Breakfast was very good and the mattress in our bed was excellent 
310277,Jaz Amsterdam, Lysa at the beaureau was no kindly with teenagers Poor breakfast I mean only 2 kind of pastries and slw service at the restaurant I would like to suggest you the 24h room service, It is wonderfull desin hotel We loved the entire bulding in and out Very nice rooms perfectly cleaned and soundproofed Fantastic tesla service The staff polite and professional expecially Maria We will come back certainly
310278,Jaz Amsterdam, The guy at the end wasn t too friendly who checked us out of the room bwe had already paid the deposit but he insisted we still needed to pay He then had to double check and realised we were telling the truth he didn t apologise at all The lady staff were all absolutely lovely though ,No Positive
310279,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast staff is unmotivated to clean up tables replace items Breakfast selection is poor, Far from the historical center but train public transportation is good Next to Ajax stadium Close to shops and restaurants Live music sun morning during breakfast Great design of the room super comfy bed rain shower good selection of Nespresso 
310280,Jaz Amsterdam, On check in the staff did not tell us about any of the facilities in the hotel such as the restaurant or the gym facilities Usually this would not matter however on two seperate occasions during my our stay we asked different staff members if there was anywhere to eat to which we were literally pointed at the door and told there might be somewhere out there and another time were offered a takeaway menu which made no sense to us as on the third and final night of our stay we discovered there was a restaurant within the bar area of the hotel Also even though the location to the metro was excellent the actual Location of the hotel in general was not that good within itself There were next to no bars or restaurants to eat and drink at during the night making our time there a little underwhelming during the night time Overall I would say that although I loved my time in Amsterdam the hotel played no part in enhancing my stay and I definitely wouldn t recommend it to anyone that is visiting Amsterdam for pleasure , I loved how close the hotel was to the metro station This made it extremely easy to get into the centre of Amsterdam and back to the hotel at night The actual room was lovely There were beautiful views from our window and everything in the room was as expected comfy bed TV fridge safe etc 
310281,Jaz Amsterdam, The location is not good if you are in central Amsterdam for an evening A taxi back to the hotel will cost you around 30 If you want to be near the Arena though it s perfect , Free late checkout on the Sunday until 1500 Lounge jazz band playing at breakfast Comfortable bed
310282,Jaz Amsterdam, waiter at bar took 15 min to go to the table asked for 2 teas 20 min later we still did not have the drinks Got up to leave and saw the waiter running to the bar to make the drinks I said never mind I don t want it now Answer are you sure I m sorry for all the other members of staff wich were quite friendly and helpful this guy should be fired , room and hotel are excellent breakfast is very good location is quite good
310283,Jaz Amsterdam, room was cold and did not heat up at all even after several hours Not clean found hair on the top bed linnen stains on the cushions at the window some coffee spill not cleaned up on the floor at the desk , good atmosphere in the hotel bar music not your typical boring hotel 
310284,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The best hotel I ve ever stayed will 100 be going back again It s super modern Great place to stay for myself and my friend 5 mins on the tram to the city center 
310285,Jaz Amsterdam, Only one person at the reception not easy to ask for info or call the taxi, Late checkout on sunday breakfast room and live music on sunday for breakfast
310286,Jaz Amsterdam, The only thing which was not good was the service in the restaurant I only had breakfast The choice of cold foods was good but the restaurant has no proper system for preparing hot food e g fried eggs bacon One morning I had to ask staff who were rushing around three times before I received my order On a second occasion I ordered but it never arrived and I gave up On the morning of leaving I needed an early breakfast and was assured that a number of items would be made available to me to eat in my room In fact all I was presented with was a few pieces of old bread a couple of pieces of fruit and a used bottle of orange juice This was very disappointing for a four star hotel , The room was excellent genuine four star standard The staff were helpful having breakfast run until 12 00 was very civilised Location was not bad about 200 metres from the metro and about 15 minutes ride to Amsterdam Centre Hotel has fully equipped gymnasium As the hotel is next to Ajax football ground there are several shopping restaurant park nightclub facilities around 
310287,Jaz Amsterdam, No parking We were checking in about the same time as a Football Game in the stadium Makes getting to the hotel difficult since all the roads are blocked closed or traffic We ended up parking in the public lot below the hotel 25 per night Ouch , Loved the hotel Hotel was extremely clean Quiet Friendly In a safe area Close to the Stadium Close to the train station 10 minute walk Close to some restaurants Rooms were super clean Modern Breakfast we ok but not to 4 Star standards I would stay here again 10 minutes by train to Central Station 
310288,Jaz Amsterdam, Staff very friendly but mainly I ve never been to a hotel with no beverages in minibar no room service no hot breakfast no proper arrangements for the spa The list goes on and on , Location to Amsterdam Arena Live jazz music in eating room
310289,Jaz Amsterdam, We had a terrible experience with the man who did check in 24 03 2016 around 00 00 He asked us for a credit card to charge a caution we give him the card with founds and he said is not working we said repetitively we have other cards but we don t want to be charged in that cards and he said it wont be charged is just for caution you will pay in check out we gave more cards none of them working all with founds then he toke a card and wrote the card details in computer and ask for pin and it worked of course in check out we had the big surprise of the credit card was already charged We ask several times and he said that card wont be charged it is misusing of clients credit card information The lady in check out completely ignored our complain You should be responsible for the interest rates of a very expensive credit card you used without authorization , Rooms are comfortable there was no big variety for breakfast but the quality of food was good The staff in bar are very friendly and they work hard there is need of more staff The location may be good if you go to the stadium but far from city 
310290,Jaz Amsterdam, Some days were very busy in the dining room some food items were missing Wifi is free but not very fast, Friendly staff great location gave us a late check out without any fees the hotel s restaurant is delicious The hotel is designed in an urban feel has a great look 
310291,Jaz Amsterdam, Coff machine not working every morning we were there with a long queue waiting for a coffe Also found cutlery and cups not always properly clean probably because of the busy period, Everything was great large room confortable and large bed Yoga mat in the hotel room was a very nice touch Very easy to get to central Amsterdam 
310292,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, This hotel has such a cool atmosphere Very detail oriented and well themed Friendly and accommodating staff The metro was a 5 minute walk and only 20 minutes to the city center 
310293,Jaz Amsterdam, Coffee seemed to be one strength and tasted burned Could do with more bar staff on the busier nights It would be nice to have a choice in the firmness of the pillows although we didn t ask so this may be an option , Breakfast was so relaxed You didn t have to wait at all even when it got busier at the weekend The food choice was tasty The room was lovely and comfortable The cleaning staff were most helpful with filling up the coffee even when we didn t need the room cleaned The rain shower was a added surprise Transport no problem 5min walk and catch the Metro to the City Centre or hop off along the way No other place for us to stay than the Jaz Hotel We zullen terugkomen 
310294,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing , Room was very very clean All was great in the room and a very nice view over the hills Breakfast is quite good enough and a lot to choose from For european standards it is good It is located outside the city center however it takes 5 minutes to get to the metro station and another 10 minutes to the city center central station And it is quite fast Also to get to the airport takes you 15 minutes by direct train The team is young professional and always helpful Very nice staff We arrived after midnight the kitchen was already closed and they still baked us a pizza for dinner Amazing room facilities Maybe the price was a bit higher based on the outside cirty center location but it is still acceptable 
310295,Jaz Amsterdam, Couldn t fault a thing, The location was great Only 10 minute walk to train station hotel was very modern Very clean Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful Nice breakfast DEFINATELY recommend to anyone considering booking it
310296,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, This hotel is absolutely beautiful Me and my boyfriend spent 4 nights at the Jaz hotel and were extremely impressed with the cleanliness and friendliness of the staff The interior blew us away The decor both in the room and throughout the breakfast and dining area was stunning The food at breakfast was typical European breakfast accompanied by fresh juice all of which was very delicious The staff on reception were very welcoming both on arrival and whenever we returned to the hotel after being in the city Also the cleaning staff and staff at breakfast were also very friendly and cheery every morning The hotel is about a 20 minute ride on the metro from the city centre With the trains being so frequent this wasn t an issue and was in fact better in my opinion You could leave the bustle of the city and return to a beautiful room to relax and recover 
310297,Jaz Amsterdam, No room service The breakfast area is beautiful but only open for a small fraction of the day It s in a very isolated location and there s no where to get anything if you need it They definitely need room service or some kind of cafe , This hotel has such a cool atmosphere Very detail oriented and well themed Friendly and accommodating staff 
310298,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The hotel was beautiful rooms were so comfy and the staff were always willing to help The metro was a two minute walk and only 7minutes to the city centre on the metro 
310299,Jaz Amsterdam, Slightly restricted on site dining options For those who want to visit central Amsterdam be ready for some travelling by subway , Minimalist decoration Ultra comfy beds Entertainment not too far from the hotel with a cinema at 500 meters Good breakfast options 
310300,Jaz Amsterdam, Location is convenient if attending an event at the Amsterdam Arena Ajax Heineken Music Hall or Ziggo Dome Otherwise it s a 10 minute walk to the nearest metro station then a 15 minute metro ride into town which gets annoying if you re staying multiple days or want to pop back to the hotel during the day Noisy street cleaning vehicles outside after an event at the Ziggo Dome in the early hours of the morning midnight 3am , Quality healthy varied breakfast buffet Great facilities in the bedrooms and across the hotel Modern and fun decor in the large bedrooms very comfy beds 
310301,Jaz Amsterdam, n a, The staff as soon as we arrived were really friendly helpful The room was absolutely gorgeous really contemporary modern Good size bed really nice views the bathroom was gorgeous It was in an excellent location close to the train station where we were able to get the train to the airport metro to Amsterdam Centraal It was also close to the Ziggo Dome where we were going the Saturday night which was really handy Breakfast looked lovely although we never made it for then

310304,Jaz Amsterdam, hotel restaurant was not serving any food late evening just drinks, Good hotel great room tasty breakfest Far from city center metro quite close but just next to Ziggo Domme 
310305,Jaz Amsterdam, I didn t check location before booking It s a little out of town although handy for music arena stadium and airport But public transport is pretty good so only takes 15 20mins to walk to metro and get to centre, It had the biggest comfiest bed I ve ever slept in Great breakfast too 
310306,Jaz Amsterdam, A little way out from Central Amsterdam but close to metro station so manageable if you purchase a travel card, Fantastic modern design with comfortable and fashionably decorated rooms Friendly staff who dealt with checking in and out promptly and efficiently 
310307,Jaz Amsterdam, It was a bit crowded during breakfast And my friend missed the bacon and fried eggs , Breakfast was good there was plenty of everything The overall design and ambience of the hotel was very good The entrance of the hotel is exactly next to the entrance of the Ziggo Dome 
310308,Jaz Amsterdam, No room service, Well designed hotel minimalist industrial style yet comfortable Loved the shower and bed Breakfast had minimal choice but adequate no fry ups which isn t a bad thing
310309,Jaz Amsterdam, Coming home , Staff all very friendly and helpful bar staff Mark Jose Daniel good laugh Excellent bar food menu at reasonable price Jazz band playing at breakfast DJ in the evenings Beds and bedding Shower and coffee machine in room Cappuccino with breakfast
310310,Jaz Amsterdam, Its good for guys coming for business as its located at Bijlmer were all the offices are generally but if someone wants to visit central which has the tourist places then I would suggest to check for something near to central , Young ambiance music and breakfast 
310311,Jaz Amsterdam, When we arrived we were advised that the breakfast was until noon however when we went down for breakfast at 11 on Monday it had finished and we were told that it was only until 10 30 am on weekdays , Great breakfast The rooms were really comfortable and easy on the eye shower was amazing The overall atmosphere in the hotel was most relaxed and laid back

310313,Jaz Amsterdam, I didnt like the toiletries gels shampoo no conditioner etc Things Id sometimes find in a good hostel This is the only thing I think could be much improved Other than that it s a brilliant place to base yourself for a weekend in Amsterdam , Loved this place The beds are the most comfortable monstrous things I didnt want to leave the hotel Special mention the little details are the clincher here freshly squeezed orange juice at breakfast and endless delicious high quality coffee 
310314,Jaz Amsterdam, No scrambled eggs or bacon at breakfast There was quite cold in our room and we weren t able to adjust the aircon Surely the hotel staff would have helped if we just had asked , Fresh squeezed orange juice and coffee machine at breakfast Just 5 min walk from Biljmer Arena station The bed was super comfortable and super wide Interior very nice Jazz band at breakfast on sunday 
310315,Jaz Amsterdam, In the breakfast I missed some toaster for the bread and no decaf coffee No room service The restaurant has very limited options for dinner I couldn t use the in room phone at all to call the reception The sink in the bathroom is very fancy but unpractical it can t be plugged , Undoubtedly one of the best hotels I ve ever been The decoration is beautiful and all the little details make a huge difference It s a big hotel nevertheless you feel very warm and comfortable The shower is very nice and the 2x2 m bed is fantastic You get a Nespresso with coffee capsules in your room a kettle with some tea and a complimentary bottle of mineral water Breakfast is served till noon and on our last day on Sunday they offered us late check out for free 
310316,Jaz Amsterdam, For the first night we were put in a twin room even though we had booked a superior double After asking we were put into a double room on the second night , The rooms are huge clean and very modern The staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was amazing 
310317,Jaz Amsterdam, The food and drinks service in the bar was really slow all weekend Its a little further out of the city than advertised by the time you walk to the metro wait for it and then ride into the city , Hotel is very funky and cool facilities are great Rooms are quite and clean food is good albeit slow and staff are very friendly 
310318,Jaz Amsterdam, We arrived in a rental car with a GPS and couldn t find the hotel entrance due to the lack of signage in the area We circled around the hotel eventually finding the entrance only to be told that the hotel parking was full due to the evening performance at the nearby concert hall After explicit instructions which were wrong and after several more circular trips we eventually found the parking By this time we were hungry so headed to the hotel restaurant which unfortunately for us closes at 8pm After that you have the limited choice of bar food which is the alternative we chose or you need to leave the premises to find other restaurants , The staff handled our concerns professionally and provided solutions to a difficult situation The hotel is new so everything is clean and tidy Breakfast was basic but good and plentiful 
310319,Jaz Amsterdam, Would have appreciated a little more variety at breakfast but I am struggling for ideas to suggest further improvements We really enjoyed our stay , Great location next to train metro 15 mins from city centre so nice and quiet Great sound proofing and black out blinds We slept really well Fabulous rain shower with great temperature control Nice spacious room Breakfast was good quality Friendly helpful staff 
310320,Jaz Amsterdam, Further out of the city than informed Information on how to get there via public transport rather than paying 35 euros for a taxi A Young couple may have limited financial funds and spoil there break,No Positive
310321,Jaz Amsterdam, Don t worry it s all good , Great feel to the place Music runs through the veins of the whole hotel Staff rooms facilities are all excellent Highly recommended for visits to gigs or matches at the stadium Easy walk and 5 stop metro to town fun and games 
310322,Jaz Amsterdam, A few employee at the reception are indifferent and unfriendly Food is average No heating from the central A C during the stay The mattress is way too soft made lower back suffered every morning Crazy drunk people near Strandvliet Metro station , Sleek Interior design Hardware and facility are enchanting stylish 
310323,Jaz Amsterdam, It wasnt a major drama but there was no food after 10 11ish Other than that everything else was great , Really good vibe about this place nice and chilled with really funky tunes playing throughout the hotel Food was cracking as well 
310324,Jaz Amsterdam, If there s a single thing that brings down the grade for me it s the lack of hot foods for breakfast Some bacon would have been nice , Really clean rooms and very comfortable beds The location is beyond amazing if you re looking to catch a football game at Amsterdam ArenA or a concert at Ziggo Dome City center is only 15 minutes away with train and the station is a couple of minutes walk away The staff was also really easy going and accommodating Overall one of the best hotel experiences I ve had and way beyond expectation for the price paid Also some amazing orange juice at breakfast 
310325,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Stylish rooms very clean and also quiet during the night Wonderful electronically operated rain shower Staff at the reception was kind and helpful Delicious breakfast with a small band playing live 
310326,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The most comfortabele bed ever All very clean new and stylish Excellent and friendly staff Next four too the Ziggo dome and Amsterdam Arena only a short walk to Heineken Music Hall perfect stay if you ate attending an event But even if you want to visit the city centre it s almost directly at the Amsterdam BijlmerArena station so good train and metro connections to central A dam 15 min 
310327,Jaz Amsterdam, They don t let taxis pick you up from or drop you off at the door 1st world problem I know but it s bloody maddening when you don t know an area so you can t tell the taxi driver where to pick you up , It s different Well put together And without doubt the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in 
310328,Jaz Amsterdam, There was nothing to dislike unless you are a really fussy person looking for faults that aren t there , Well where do I start it was our very first stay in Amsterdam and we picked this hotel due to us attending a concert at the Ziggo dome arena and oh my did I make an amazing choice a choice which started off the perfect stay in a beautiful city The arena was literally attached to the hotel which impressed us and the transport to central Amsterdam was a about 5 10 minute walk away from the hotel and took about 10 minutes overall on the metro so nobody can complain I would recommend buying a day pass for the metro buses and trams as you save a fortune The staff at the hotel were very friendly from start to finish and will help you any way they possible can from the checkin desk to the bar and restaurant etc fantastic and especially the young lad who served us in the resurant on a evening I forgot his name but I know he s from London who has only been in Amsterdam a few months he was so pleasant and friendly and seemed to really enjoy his job which is wonderful to see so thumbs up to him and all the other staff I was that impressed with the hotel we are booking again for my birthday in August and can not wait to come back I did say we would stop more central if we went back as we only picked this hotel for the concert but I don t want to stop anywhere else as it was a wonderful stay and made an everlasting impression well done all and see you again soon x P S when traveling by taxis from the airport watch out for unmarked taxis as they are like vulchers and make you feel very intimidated as well as probably charging you a fortune don t be fooled Use the main airport taxis which is located by signs throughout the airport PPS The beds are that big and comfortable you have to be forced out of it so beware 
310329,Jaz Amsterdam, Parking far too expensive No room service No minibar Salad in the restaurant was disgusting Very noisy could hear all going on on the corridor, Friendly stuff
310330,Jaz Amsterdam, A difficult location for taxi Beware if you have big bags Dont take the taxi on your arrival Take the train , A chic modern hotel Its for you if you travel in style 
310331,Jaz Amsterdam, The shower has a fancy design with integrated controller but it is absolutely useless We stayed at the hotel for two nights and our shower did not work properly At the last night it was totally out of service We were asked to change room and at the end we went and used shower at another room Breakfast is really poor For a five star hotel I haven t seen such a breakfast not even a warm dish is served Only cooked egg ham and bread And the worse is we had diarrhea both of us after eating the breakfast , Nice interior unique design Queit area Staff is helpful 
310332,Jaz Amsterdam, We needed a little more lighting in some areas of our room and the dining area where the food is displayed , This hotel delivers a Good Time on all levels From the decor to the complimentary Guest Reception at the bar to the Live Jazz Combo during Sunday brunch nobody will leave disappointed If your going to a show event at the Ziggo Dome or the Arena you can t beat the location 
310333,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, This have Been the best hotell stay i have been on D im going back 1 3 April and I cant wait to see the hotell again D It is my favorite D And because Ziggodome is right there the concerts im going to is being a dream D Thanks soooo much D love you workers there too 
310334,Jaz Amsterdam, parking is pretty expensive as everywhere in Amsterdam it is 24 a night there is NO free parking around, very stylish new modern hotel lots of international TV stations big room 
310335,Jaz Amsterdam, Expensive parking at the property and no alternative to that, New hotel with extra comfortable rooms great sleep quality nice interior design and good quality
310336,Jaz Amsterdam, The service in the restaurant in the hotel was really bad It took very long to get anything we asked for 10 minutes for a glass of water But I think they were a bit understaffed as the waiter also made drinks The Beertails were awful It was like the bar was trying to be too alternative Being a barman myself I can say you need a mixologist working there if you want to make the most of the cool bar you have Everything else was perfect, Really modern stylish hotel The staff were really helpful I would really recommend this hotel 
310337,Jaz Amsterdam, We couldn t figure out how to use the nespresso machine , Jaz is 15 20 minutes from the city centre and the station is easy to find Jaz was a 5 minute walk from the station There was no queue when we arrived we were greeted with a friendly welcome and were promptly given our room key after checks The room was beautiful and modern with with an exceptional view The thermostat was amazing We warmed and cooled our room so easily We both loved the shower that also came from the ceiling The king size bed had a memory foam mattress which we immidiately feel asleep in because it was so comfortable The television was high definition and has a range of international channels including the bbc channels film 4 channel 4 e4 and more The room also has 4 sub slots including in the to so if you don t have an adapted like us we were still able to charge our phones and use their free wifi The breakfast had a range of foods from croissants to cheeses The set up was lovely and the self service coffee was so quick The staff were helpful and friendly giving us directions and helping us back into our room when we locked ourselves out Overall the hotel was one of the highlights of the trip and we were sad to leave We will definitely stay here next time we visit Amsterdam and we highly recommend Jaz 
310338,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Everything was Perfect I have placed this booking on the behalf of the CEO of the company that I am working for As a result the CEO has requested to stay at jaz each and every time he is called for business in Amsterdam A Big thank you to Vanessa Veppan in charge of booking at the jaz for being so accommodating Thank you Warmest regards Lilie CC PA CEO
310339,Jaz Amsterdam, No Scrambled Eggs or Bacon at breakfast , Location was exactly next to the Ziggo Dome and like 50 meters from the Amsterdam ArenA After the concert they cleaned for half an hour but we had no problems with any noise It was a real modern looking hotel A large hotel with a great view from the 10th floor Very comfortable beds and good breakfast 
310340,Jaz Amsterdam, The minibar was empty except for one small water bottle , Very hip and colorful place It is next to the Amsterdam Arena and Ziggo Dome so if you want to visit any of these the location is perfect Public transport is 5 10 minute walk and takes you in 10 15 min in the center of Amsterdam Staff is friendly beds are great Maybe they could fill the mini bar with more than just one water but that is all Would recommend this to anyone who will stay more than 1 day in Amsterdam High value for money 
310341,Jaz Amsterdam, For the breakfast there have no vegetables Only different kinds of bread ham and cheeses , The hotel is very modern and very comfortable It was a great experience to stay there 
310342,Jaz Amsterdam, NOTHING And I can be very eeeny weeny sometimes, For those who read this review and potentially for a year or 2 to come this is definitely the best hotel in Amsterdam when compared to the money you pay I paid less than 70 Euros for a single use of a double room it is really modern really clean and transport is very good to the city centre ArenA station is a good 5 minute walk on a pedestrian street to the hotel and it is a 13 minute train or 16 minute metro trip to the central station I was there on a Sunday and the breakfast was very good and there was even a band playing for breakfast some nice jazz music the staff is young and very natural no pretending or complications just easy going helpful staff you write your email for example yourself on an ipod which the staff member holds I loved the various tv stations perhaps in most hotels with British channels German french and Italian channels etc and the shower is equipped with electric buttons for exact temperature if you are ok with the 15 minute trip to central station and 5 minute walk to the hotel then this is the best 70 or 80 Euros you can pay in busy expensive Amsterdam no need to think much 
310343,Jaz Amsterdam, The restaurant staff asked me to pay 10 euros because I wanted to have egg for breakfast though my booking included breakfast they said egg is not included in buffet Dirty silverware and tables ,No Positive
310344,Jaz Amsterdam, transportation was a bit far from Amsterdam city center Location was not easy to find with a car need to put some signes from the road as many roads are close to cars due to the nearby stadium, excellent service and room accomodation
310345,Jaz Amsterdam, If you are staying with someone please be aware that the door in bathroom does not lock , Location is very close to the train station and subway Very Comfortable The design of the hotel and rooms is very good The hotel is very fresh everything is new and clean Very good breakfast The hotel has very good style in everything starting from rooms to the music on breakfast Highly recommend you to choose it 
310346,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, This hotel was fantastic It is outside of the city centre but we loved it The staff were great and the whole atmosphere was amazing We will definitely stay there again when we next visit Amsterdam 
310347,Jaz Amsterdam, The location is not very good It takes around 40 mins to get to the central The hotel doesn t have good sound proof especially at night with young teens party in the building we felt the vibrant , The apartment is modern 
310348,Jaz Amsterdam, That I only stayed for 1 night, Fantastic hotel the staff were very friendly and the style of the whole place is very modern and unique They left a birthday card for my wife as I asked them to leave a small note via booking com Small but effective breakfast Very impressive and I would recommend to all friends and family 
310349,Jaz Amsterdam, A proper restaurant with a decent menu needed and without loud music would only eat there again if I were near death from hunger Difficult access by car and not easy to find Some signs are desperately needed , Rooms are fine 
310350,Jaz Amsterdam, Couldn t find the car park entrance, Hotel is new and still very clean Rooms have all the facilities needed for a comfortable overnight stay there is even a yoga mat in the room should you need one Hotel was excellent value for money at the rate we paid
310351,Jaz Amsterdam, Reception is always busy because it s understaffed Long waiting times , Breakfast is good not so many choices though There s a small gym and wellness facilities Room is spacious and comfy Nice atmosphere overall 
310352,Jaz Amsterdam, On booking your hotel I looked for the closest proximity to Amsterdam centrum which it said was approximately 0 2 miles on arrival I asked a staff member how far it was and she told me it was just under 14 km way from the centrum This resulted in me having to pay a 50 euro taxi fair each way of which we travelled four times COSTING A TOTAL OF 200 euros This was very misleading on your behalf and I was very upset with this part of my break as I did not set aside extra money for taxi fairs such as this Please respond asap,No Positive
310353,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Even if the hotel is in the suburb of Amsterdam it was great great rooms nice staff good dj good drinks and foodstuffs We will come back There is a direct bus from Amsterdam s airport 300 
310354,Jaz Amsterdam, The lighting in the room wasn t the greatest The air con and heating wasn t the best either Breakfast didn t serve any hot food and could of had more of a variety Not too close to Amsterdam central , The staff were really welcoming and friendly The facilities were amazing and really clean Rooms were amazing size and the beds were huge Shower was great and overall comfort was great Check out was at 4pm on Sunday Have you ever heard something so great 
310355,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Only a 15 minute easy train ride to centre of Amsterdam Hotel Jaz is brand new Good breakfast with live jazz music on Sunday morning Price quality point makes Hotel Jaz easily a 10 We ll be back 
310356,Jaz Amsterdam, Location is a bit far away from the city center though easily accesible by metro and the surrounding is nice and calm after the old town turmoil , Wow We really liked this new hotel great concept Stylish hotel with Amsterdarm charm big comfy room clean and welcoming Would definitely stay there again 
310357,Jaz Amsterdam, The only bad thing was the location for us As we were interested in spending a lot of time in the centre it resulted in a lot of travelling via metro to get there 11 stops Other than that it was a perfect stay , Hotel was spotless Staff couldn t have done anything more Breakfast was continental yet had lots of variety Rooms were very modern waterfall shower was amazing and the nespresso machine in the room was a lovely touch 
310358,Jaz Amsterdam, Apart from quite some distance to the A dam city center nothing bad, Nice modern hotel close to Amsterdam Arena stadium Path Arena cinema Ziggo Dome Heineken Music Hall and Railway subway station Nice modern bathroom Nice breakfast
310359,Jaz Amsterdam, breakfast doesn t have much of a variety and bathroom was not fully equipped with toiletries, that the staffs are nice cozy room and they have a cute baby bed
310360,Jaz Amsterdam, Food Overpriced and not exciting Happy to pay for something if it s worth it So if they sort out the food offer this is a great spot to stay in for work not many bars food options in close proximity so hence I feel it important to get the food offer right here , Trendy Modern Nice staff Funky bar and has the potential to be really a great spot to stay whilst on business in this area of the DAM 
310361,Jaz Amsterdam, there were a few glitches but a very new hotel so can t fault them The breakfast was a nightmare long queues not enough food things breaking down The TV information wasn t working and the only alternative to was to ask at reception, Great location for concert couldn t have been better
310362,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing , Extremely pleasant helpful and kind staff The royal breakfast The design of the whole hotel and the rooms You can feel the Jazz vibes everywhere A great view 10th floor And last but not the least the showerheads you ll love that bathroom
310363,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, I loved the fresh industrial chic Exactly my type of decor I built my own bed from scaffolding so its safe to say that we share the same artistic taste The food was lovely and fresh staff approachable and upbeat The environment was simply joyous The music for breakfast was upbeat dance music but not too energetic Every detail was on point and i loved the light humour dotted everywhere that signified that the hotel doesn t take life too seriously Located only two stops from the airport to the east about 10 mins on the train and 20 25 mins on the tram to the city centre It s right by Amsterdam ArenA so would be ideal if staying for a sporting event I promise that i don t work for the hotel either feel free to run a background check In 10 years of working in the airline industry i ve stayed in my fair share of hotels and can easily say that this stands head shoulders feet and stilts above any of my other stays others feel so too it scored highest on other comparison sites too 
310364,Jaz Amsterdam, If you come by car make sure to ask details at the reception about the parking Especially when there are events Even when you are not attending the event you ll have to pay the event parking price and that can become very expensive I suggest that the hotel provides their guests with a parking card for a fixed price per night , Very pleasant and spacious rooms with very comfortable beds Spacious bathroom with great shower Breakfast was super and the atmosphere perfect to start your day Staff was friendly and helpful It was a pleasure to return back to the hotel after a busy day in the city 
310365,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff was really nice and helpful The included breakfast was basic but the quality was very good I liked the mordern style of the entire facilities from entrance our room to the breakfast area The room had the perfect size and was modern but still suprisingly cozy Towls Soap Coffee Tea Water and Lemonade was provided in the room In terms of location it is a little but outside of the city center but there is a train station only 5min walking distance from the hotel By train it takes about 10 15min to the city center I will definetly try to stay at Jaz Amsterdam again if I go to Amsterdam 
310366,Jaz Amsterdam, The bathroom lighting is quite poor very orange and dimmed For anyone who needs to put on makeup the lighting is terrible , Rooms were great staff were mainly lovely and the hotel being new was in fantastic condition Very cool and modern place to stay For anyone who loves sport you will love your view of the Ajax stadium Loved our stay 
310367,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing , Large well equipped rooms with screen mirror for your phone USB ports built into the wall rain shower a Nespresso machine etc It s about 8km from the city centre but just a 2 min walk from the Metro which is very easy to use All in all a fabulous stay and I d happily use them again if I find myself back in Amsterdam Rooms were absolutely quiet with no noise to be heard from the other rooms 
310368,Jaz Amsterdam, The spa was not available for us to use We specifically tailored pure stay and plan to use it and on 3 occasions weren t able to as it was not ready or closed Not much of a breakfast choice but what was there was lovely , Lovely stylish hotel Paid a really good price Loved the rooms we were on the top floor 
310369,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing, The room was really nice and clean There was even an espresso machine Breakfast was good even if they don t have many gluten free options 
310370,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The breakfast was amazing Particularly the jazz band Sunday morning The staff were very kind and well informative A really neat concept for a hotel 
310371,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing, The hotel is well located five minutes walk to Arena Metro Station and 15 minutes to the center The room is optimal designed modern and equipped with all conforts Breakfast has been great We also enjoyed sauna great relaxing moment after sightseeing 
310372,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Large room brand new furniture the fastest check in and check out of my life Many more positive things to write but not necessary 10 points 
310373,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, New modern equipments cosy design great staff great food at Rhythms bar kitchen 15 mn from center by subway and 15 mn from airport by intercity train Surrounded by food spots 
310374,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Fantastic and extremely helpful staff Great breakfast Nice location very easy to get to Centraal Station Very clean and thoughtfully decorated Loved everything 
310375,Jaz Amsterdam, The only downside for me was location It was a bit out the city of Amsterdam so the taxis were expensive at night Having said that there are late night busses operating if u choose not to take the taxis ,No Positive
310376,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Very nice and friendly staff real nice design rooms other facilities good food good location Me and my son 7 years old were really impressed 
310377,Jaz Amsterdam, The hotel was really modern It was clean and really comfortable The staff were so friendly and help full The hotel was also located beside a really good transport system which made it easy to get around, The hotel
310378,Jaz Amsterdam, Poor indications to find the hotel by car as road situation apparently changed in October and navigation systems do not find the hotel via the new road situation There was no rate agreement with any of the parking lots in the vicinity to bring down the parking costs of EUR 20 for a night , Big room great bed good shower nice breakfast
310379,Jaz Amsterdam, Breakfast could improve especially in the choice of healthy food such as fruit etc , Great location for who is attending events at ziggo dome hmh arena New fancy hotel with superb design
310380,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, We stayed for two nights and really enjoyed it The hotel has got a modern design the room and bathroom were clean the bed very comfortable and you can use a coffee machine for free tea and water are also available The breakfast offers a lot of different cold meat cheese jam various sorts of bread eggs fruit cereals and yoghurt You get freshly pressed orange juice tea water and tasty coffee Cappuccino Caf Latte On sunday morning there was live jazz music in the dining room In the evening you can listen to live music as well and enjoy a beer or long drink in the hotel bar The hotel is well situated you need only 5 minutes by foot to the next train and metro station Bijlmer ArenA It takes 10 15 minutes by metro to the city centre of Amsterdam I really recommend a stay at Jaz Amsterdam 
310381,Jaz Amsterdam, Staff in the restaurant were insecure and not so bright asked for sweetener got salt My room was 188 euro There was coffee but only one coffee cup No information what so ever Usually there is a map or something like that The location was perfect but I won t come back , The location And the people at the service desk 
310382,Jaz Amsterdam, The only small thing that we ve noticed and that could improve is that the bar staff was very busy and couldn t cope with the demand They were great but needed some help On the night there was a group of girls a party in the restaurant area and the focus was on serving them but customers in the bar area were waiting for a very long time to be served Including us 20 mins wait for a beer and a juice There was few members of staff the restaurant who didn t have much to do at the time that could easily jump to the bar area and help out Also the food wasn t the best the burger was overdone and dry and the chips were also bit burned no one checked if we were happy with food after we have finished shame as food is not cheap there , Excellent hotel Great design with attention to detail Beds are massive and comfortable staff is very friendly And helpful We loved the breakfast area 
310383,Jaz Amsterdam, Restaurant was fully booked I would have loved to taste the burger It took ages to order a drink at the bar most likely because there was a large group that order tons of cocktails , Beautifull design hotel near Arena and Musical halls Spacious room with exceptional design Love everything about it Metro line to Amsterdam city center takes 19 minutes 
310384,Jaz Amsterdam, check in only possible after h 14 00, amazing location just a few steps from Ziggo dome new brand building with great facilities cool environment clealiness Breakfast was just wonderful great variety of bread and beverages all fresh and like home made Close to Bijlmer Arena metro station new area 15 min metro to the center and 30 min train to Schipol Airport bus on weekends 
310385,Jaz Amsterdam, Was not too happy the well being part was not open They should tell you this before you book Apart from that no problems , Thought the staff were excellent Really friendly and helpful Keen to please Thought the hotel was comfortable excellent location to ziggo dome and loved the breakfast Especially on Sunday when they had live band playing Amazing 
310386,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, The best choice if you visit Ziggo for a concert or a football match in Amsterdam Arena Good location and close to the metro train station Great and friendly staff 
310387,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, Excellent location just in front of the Ziggo Dome two metro station nearby to reach the center of Amsterdam in 20 minutes Train station with train to Shipol airport e Rotterdam Very cosy and modern with a social vibe 
310388,Jaz Amsterdam, The hotel is situated across from a nightclub that was very loud and made it hard to sleep until 2 a m This might only be a problem on weekends We tried to split the cost of our hotel stay and are experiencing some difficulty , This place is very very slick and modern It is comfortable and easy to use and the location is really convenient to public transportation and events at the Ziggo Dome and the Arena Our room was clean and spacious the breakfast was lovely and the fitness area was well equipped 
310389,Jaz Amsterdam, We could not eat anything after the concert No restaurants were opened midnight But this is maybe the law in the Netherland , Everybody was friendly Breakfast was excellent 
310390,Jaz Amsterdam, Nothing bad to sau, Chose the hotel on the basis that it was attached to the ziggo dome as I was seeing madonna there and had standing tickets i wasn t expecting much ofvthe hotel I nearly fell through the floor when I stepped inside Beautiful super friendly staff easy check in The room was big the massive bed was so comfy en suite and shower was cool too 
310391,Jaz Amsterdam, nespresso machine great idea but can we have milk and not creamer powder Being Brits we like our tea so cant use powdered milk we asked for milk but was told that they did not have any strange reply from room service , Staff are friendly it is a brand new hotel so when we arrived they had a problem checking us in because their systems were down but they resolved everything quickly Breakfast area is lovely the bar facilities are good and I certainly feel that this hotel will succeed I am happy to come back Maria front of house really looked after us however english breakfast tea and milk needs to be included in your room Also you need to have two cups not one cup to share between two people for the nespresso Lovely showers as well and great rooms 
310392,Jaz Amsterdam, checking in still takes a bit to long and the tv didn t work due toe power problems, Liked the coffee very much especially with the barista guy We also enjoed the live music in the evening and Sunday moorning
310393,Jaz Amsterdam, It s unbelievable but they don t provide vanity sets and slippers I thought maybe they are available on request but no there are NO shower caps or nail files at the hotel The guy who answered the phone sounded surprised finally said no we have nothing like that only shaving kit No room service available EMPTY minibar only water in it Really When I check in I just want my room key and no questions about where i am from and why i came Check in was too long and way too personal Staff at the restaurant is clueless Took order from one person ignored the other Food was good though , Everything is new and fresh Nice modern design Breakfast limited and simple but tasty and good quality Great coffee Very nice and comfy bed 
310394,Jaz Amsterdam, We found it difficult to find somewhere to sit for breakfast at the weekend this would seem to be caused by people lingering to listen to the live music When tables were available they were hard to identify we had a staff member almost offer us an occupied table , We liked everything apart from the weekend breakfast seating We shall return to this hotel 
310395,Jaz Amsterdam, A dj was playing music during dinner but way too loud Leaving the restaurant with an aching head was a bit too much , Very nice accommodation they try to approach everything in an innovative way which is nice in most cases 
310396,Jaz Amsterdam, The breakfast was good but I can imagine some people will miss the English Breakfast style , The rooms were very nice and had a young and innovative atmosphere 
310397,Jaz Amsterdam, Housekeeping is probably the worst part of the hotel When I checked in my room floor was a mess with biscuit crumbles and teabags on the floor I instantly switched my room 2nd room was clean but housekeeping didn t clean my room the next day They had only made my bed and put my dirty towels that were on the floor onto my bed If they had folded those towels I could be tricked into thinking that they were new clean They didn t clean the bathroom sink or swipe the floor It s also very noisy at night Loud music comes from outside It really doesn t matter which floor your room is or which side it is looking at , Well decorated nice rooms fresh croissants at breakfast friendly staff It is a new and a stylish place I can even open the roomdoor with an app on my phone Awesome 
310398,Jaz Amsterdam, Que for breakfast Need to better streamline for getting coffee Parking cost ridiculous high , Comfort of bed was very good Close to ziggodome and local station Fresh orange jus quality of coffee was good 
310399,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, We had an anniversary trip with my husband We was excited then saw our room it was nice decorated and had a comfortable bed We like this hotel and refer it to everybody
310400,Jaz Amsterdam, No fitness room yet many of the things promised by the hotel in the description do not exist Breakfast is poor and the lines for it are way too long Nothing you can take to your room as snacks or drinks in the hotel area , Right next to the ziggo dome so it was perfect to go to the concert and not having to deal with traffic and parking issues The room is comfortable The staff is nice
310401,Jaz Amsterdam, The staff was apparently very new and lacked some experience in handling customers The breakfast was arranged in a minor room along the walls which made it a very slow process to get to what you wanted Coffee were delivered by a staff member on one of the two machines it was not always warm and it took much too long to get it Much improvement can be achieved here , Very cool place new and nicely decorated Rooms of a good size most fabolous showers 
310402,Jaz Amsterdam,No Negative, 5 stars for everything Nothing to complain about Super nice decoration awesome staff make you feel at home The rooms are lovely comfortable and VERY clean I will definitely come back again 
310403,Jaz Amsterdam, It was all perfect , Friendly and helpful staff nice bar with good food very practical and comfortable contemporary design room comfy bed great sound proofing I look forward to going back to Jaz Hotel Amsterdam
