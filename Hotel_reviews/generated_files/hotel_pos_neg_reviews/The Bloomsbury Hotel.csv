61644,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Nothing really, It was a lovely experience Food fabulous room amazing but no view Bed was so comfy We ll stay there next time we re in London going to the theatre The staff were lovely
61645,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Getting into the shower was a bit of a problem because of the layout, Hotel was attractive comfortable and staffed by helpful friendly people Very convenient 
61646,The Bloomsbury Hotel, What most hotels in Europe lack no ice machines for the rooms Limited TV channel access , Although I thought over priced breakfast was excellent as it was cooked to order Guest relations Camille tried to solve our every concern with patience and resolve Porters were always at your service and friendly Some renovations of the hotel were in progress so there was a disruption in getting to the rooms Expect it will be done by the end of the summer Nice atmosphere Beautiful flowers in the reception area 
61647,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Nothing , I liked every single thing in this hotel from location to cleanliness to the room super comfy bed and service but most of all the staff full of positive vibes and always ready to help with a smile thank you for making our stay memorable we will surely come back to the Bloomsbury 
61648,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Although presented beautifully and immaculately clean the rooms unless travelling alone or you are below average size are uncomfortably small From having to inhale and fold shoulders in to sit on the toilet to having to take turns on the small bed to having nowhere to put your luggage Enjoyed the stay would recommend the hotel for the right persons solo short or willing to pay for the upscale rooms but for me I d sacrifice a little bit of quality to find a bit bigger room in same area next time , Location is fantastic Certainly the prime area of London to stay within walking distance of Soho Covent Garden etc Hotel presented beautifully and staff get 10 10 
61649,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, It was very kind of the hotel who had wrapped and messaged a Happy Birthday handmade slice of cake and left it in the bedroom for my mother for her 70th The room interior was beautiful and it was a gorgeous quality of bedding The entrance hall and flowers were spectacular and the hotel cosy and a warm feel 
61650,The Bloomsbury Hotel, If i would have to find anything is that the breakfast to our taste is good but a bit expensive to what you get we had only one morning breakfast , Staff gives a great service House keeping are awesome always putting the hairdryer back to his Place The hotel is a walking distance to all major stores in oxford street Tottenham Court Road Station is 2 minutes away We had a very pleasant stay and would happy to be back in the future Thank you 
61651,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Being woken at 0745 by a pneumatic drill so loud I thought it was going to come through the bedroom wall , Staff were particularly helpful polite and friendly who did their best to mitigate the one problem we did have 
61652,The Bloomsbury Hotel, No hairdryer , The staff were lovely and super helpful The food was superb loved the brunch The air conditioning was a life saver in the heatwave 
61653,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, The room was gorgeous and the hotel was beautiful Staff were friendly and always around to help if needed Breakfast in our room was just yummy Hotel is within walking distance to Covent Garden Perfect hotel for our weekend in London Will definitely stay here again 
61654,The Bloomsbury Hotel, we ordered a deluxe room and only after arguments over and over again and 4 changes we got a proper room in addition the hotel s basement is under construction these days which makes massive noise during the whole day I m pretty sure we will not visit this hotel again ,No Positive
61655,The Bloomsbury Hotel, There was at least one large meeting of some kind going on and the large concentration of participants were an interference , The Concierge was very capable and all requests to the front desk were responded to very promptly 
61656,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Air conditioning did not work heated floor in bathroom came on late at night and had to put towels on floor because it was to hot to walk on room was so hot and could not open windows either called reception and took more than an hour to come up by then was in shower and had to send them away The web site showed an image of the superior room but our room was a lot smaller with none of the furniture in the image I was gutted because I booked this for my wife s 50th birthday I told the receptionist and all she would say was sorry big deal , Location
61657,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Small rooms for the money paid The Concierge booked a Taxi for us who cheated and scammed us by misinforming us It spoilt our entire experience in the end There is no response from the hotel and we suspect the worst We recommend be careful about the Taxi services hailed through the hotel travel desk, Very friendly staff
61658,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Can t think of anything I didn t like , Helpful staff Lovely hotel Afternoon tea was a perfect to my birthday celebrations Would recommend this hotel and definitely stay here again 
61659,The Bloomsbury Hotel, wish we had been told about renovation work on arrival and maybe had the chance to move rooms away from noise, brill location lovely clean room unfortunately there was renovation work in progress and the workmen started drilling 8am sunday morning so not too happy with that 
61660,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The number of staff on the reception Only one on when we arrived who was dealing with other arrivals and telephone calls , Breakfast was excellent with a huge continental selection choice supplemented with a good choice of hot food too Dressing gowns in the bedroom were a nice touch as well
61661,The Bloomsbury Hotel, One thing that can be improved is probably the layout of the bathroom At the moment it is designed lengthwise so it is a bit awkward to move around inside The floor mat is always in the way when you open the door , It was located in a really nice area and the underground station was really close by The room was very spacious and the bed was really comfortable They did have a nespresso machine in the room which was a huge plus for me as i m a coffee lover The staff were all really kind and helpful they even offer hot towels during check in and also offered us small bottled waters when we checked out 
61662,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Missed the flowers we experienced last year for Chelsea Flower Show , Great staff service attention to detail to make our stay the most comfortable possible Good location near Metro and theatres 
61663,The Bloomsbury Hotel, My reservation was delayed due to the fact my booking did not go through despite receiving a confirmation from booking com However staff was more than apologetic and offered free breakfast with our stay for the trouble Overall staff were helpful and warm room was lovely and clean and my fianc e and I had a delightful stay ,No Positive
61664,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Extremely comfy bed Great location for theatre and shopping Oxford St and Regent St minutes away Staff very friendly and extremely helpful Concierge recommended and booked a table for me at a lovely Italian restaurant which was only a few minutes walk away from the hotel Although alone I felt comfortable to be in the bar and enjoyed some delicious cocktails 
61665,The Bloomsbury Hotel, It s definitely not cheap but worth every penny for the superb experience They are renovating at the moment so if you want to sleep or work in the hotel during the day you won t be able to but if you re out and about it s amazing, Location location location right next to oxford st and tottenham court road underground station Superior Double room was spacious comfy and luxurious staff was friendly catered to our every need instantly Room service was a delight and not that expensive highly recommended If you book a superior double room make sure you ask for the king size bed room size is then bigger When our flight got 6 hours delayed Booking com and The Bloomsbury were kind enough to be flexible and not charge us for the change 
61666,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Loud at night we were woken up from other guests coming into the hotel and our floor at 3 4 and 5am multiple nights multiple times walls were thin and didn t feel like hotel was doing much prevent e g posting signs or asking drunk guests to be quiet when they entered Suggest specifically requesting a room far from elevators Also hotel offered to book us a 6am car to the airport which didn t show up despite us checking twice to confirm they were apologetic and blamed car company but that just shouldn t happen at this high quality a hotel, Loved the overall feel of the hotel boutique great linens and decor fantastic bar and restaurant Perfect location close to it all but on a quiet street Larger than most room size great that there is a nespresso in the room and fantastic bath products 
61667,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The poached eggs were over done but this was literally the only thing I can pick them up on , The staff were incredibly welcoming We went for my wife s 40th birthday and they went the extra mile with a birthday cake for her 
61668,The Bloomsbury Hotel, not easy to find a table at the restaurant as it is fully booked in advance So if you plan to eat there book your table in advance That s the downside of having good food and good service , Very nice place nice and supportive stuff Good food at the restaurant and very nice service Thank you Pavel and Ivan for your tips and support 
61669,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The room was supposed to be a superior double it was not Even as a double it was very small we did ask if it was the correct room and were told we could have another with a different configuration i e smaller bathroom but that would have been impossible as this bathroom was so small two people could not stand in it at the same time A while later we were offered the chance to view another room but we had unpacked and were getting ready for the theatre so declined The point is we should have been given the correct room to begin with the one we had paid for weeks ago When we returned in the early hours there was a bottle of champagne in the room for us and an apology but , Dinner was excellent simple but very tasty 
61670,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Bed too high for short person with little legs and arthritic knees Suggest wooden foot stool available on request no higher than 4 inches Foot stool in room was too high and soft had to step up on to 2 coffee table books to get into bed Bed was very comfortable , Size of room Separate shower room Good pessure shower Ambience of public rooms Pretty terrace eating facility Good public disabled toilet Friendly and efficient staff Front entrance greeting and help 
61671,The Bloomsbury Hotel, We could find no fault , I must say that the welcome we received and the thoughtfulness of the staff especially Andre was exceptional I had planned our stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary and my wife s birthday Andre asked me if there was a special reason or occasion for our stay I told him and he made our stay extra special The whole team were kind and attentive and we have already made plans to return We cannot recommend this hotel enough for a special weekend in London 
61672,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Very small window so room a bit dark and overlooked not a lot I am sure we should have had a king size bed but it was just a double , Staff were lovely Reception area nice to arrive at Room was quite small but very clean and comfortable and we had everything we could need Bed really comfy Location really great and hotel looks impressive Bar fab with lovely areas to sit in and amazing staff On check out we were offered water for our journey which I thought a nice touch 
61673,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Everything was great, The defining feature of this lovely hotel was the staff Efficient Courteous attentive without intrusion friendly engaging and in good numbers The best I have encountered
61674,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Great location in the middle of Bloomsbury British Museum is two blocks away West End theaters are 10 min walk and the Tottenham Court Road tube station is just around the corner Best part of a long day out and about is that the room is well appointed very quiet and had a queen size bed with nice linens Tea coffee and cookies in the room and each night they had a turn down service Lots of London hotels I considered had twin single beds which I feel I left behind in my childhood bedroom Nice staff and a bar for a nice glass of wine before going out I will stay again 
61675,The Bloomsbury Hotel, They were renovating the Terrace while we were there so we couldn t use it but it s probably back open by now , Picture perfect location next to British Museum very close to Tottenham Court Rd and Oxford Circus tube stops walking distance to Theatreland and all of Soho Quiet beautifully decorated rooms very comfortable beds Very helpful staff a wonderful hotel 
61676,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Staff was super friendly the decor was nice and the location was perfect right around the corner from Oxford Street and close to every place you want to be in London Probably the best choice for the money that you will find in London 
61677,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Breakfast not taken at hotel as seemed overpriced when several of us only have a bowl of fruit or toast One of the rooms I booked was for a family so requested extra bed and discussed it direct with hotel They confirmed extra bed for teenager was possible and that it would be arranged Was not advised that it was a camp bed and therefore was not suitable for my niece Her father slept on the camp bed but also suffers from aback condition so not very satisfactory We would need to find an alternative hotel who can provide a decent extra bed for future trips Bar 1 as guests of the hotel did not expect to find could not get in as had not booked a table Friday evening 2 as guests of the hotel did not expect to be asked to leave as our niece aged 15 accompanied us for an after show drink Though on asking were advise they could serve us a drink in the reception area suffered a very long delay before someone arrived to take drinks order , Location superb Welcome was lovely Room and bathroom was a good size Pavel took time out to give us a room tour making sure we knew how to use the air conditioning etc
61678,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The room temperature was a little too warm , The staff were attentive and helpful Really enjoyed the bar it had a welcoming atmosphere and the staff were very friendly 
61679,The Bloomsbury Hotel, poor communication with booking com, booking dot com ruined my 18 th birthday treat as you insisted we hadn t booked breakfast when we had and it was hughly embarrassing to be turned away we had to go to bills the restaurant instead 
61680,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Small rooms even by London standards although they are beautifully decorated The Superior one we had this time did actually allow two of us to move about at one time so marginally better than the standard room we had on our previous visit , Location decor and comfort are all very good This is undoubtedly a pleasant hotel in a beautiful building and the location in Great Russell Street makes it convenient for a number of activities Walkable to theatres museums and tourist sights and near several bus routes 
61681,The Bloomsbury Hotel, In all honesty there is nothing we did not like The staff was attentive and thoughtful if we asked for something it was done with a smile No complaints at all , My sister and I took a trip together and hadn t been away for fun in so long The staff was amazing in every respect and we opted for the morning breakfast which was amazing The hotel was so very charming Someone mentioned windows in the room but while we loved our room our goal was to see London So that didn t bother us at all The location is perfect very central but the block is quite so you don t feel overwhelmed right when you step out of the hotel I would stay there again in a heartbeat 
61682,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Nothing of note , Absolutely first class experience from beginning to end and in particular the Bloomsbury club bar fantastic atmosphere and service 
61683,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Wanted to try out the high tea at Dalloway Terrace but that mere disappointed as it was closed for upgrading works , Like the warm hospitality from each and every member of the staff in the hotel Very thoughtful to have the button to call for luggage assistance at the doorstep way before even entering into the hotel 
61684,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Little daylight in lobby and room High price and at the same time cancellation free of charge not possible , Great location Close to Covent Garden and Soho Close to tube station Northern Line Central Line Very friendly staff 
61685,The Bloomsbury Hotel, I felt the hotel was extremely comfortable however the heat was at times too hot sometimes even unbearable in the hotel rooms even turning the thermostat down it was too hot , The hotel was just lovely felt luxurious loved the candles in the lanterns in the hallways the seating area in reception was cosy and I found the staff especially the doorman to be very nice helpful and made us feel special The bar in the evening had a great atmosphere and staff was again very nice brought us over water as well as our ordered drinks It was a very pleasant stay would definitely book the hotel again 
61686,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Very popular with people not staying at the hotel so finding seats in the bar club area difficult Wanted to visit the library and chapel but it was locked , Staff so helpful and friendly Great atmosphere in all the areas
61687,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Being told we would have to pay for something we ve paid for already The floor in the bathroom was dirty anf there was no milk for tea or coffee, Had to argue regarding breakfast being included as they were going to charge us twice 
61688,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The room was too hot We could barely open the window for known reasons the air con kept turning itself off the was a high pitched buzzing noise in the room preventing sleep and the bed sheets were the loudest bedsheets I ve ever experienced every time I moved I woke up Unfortunately I had a very disturbed sleep , Staff were excellent and very helpful and polite The hotel was beautiful and very clean Check in and check out was easy and they even let us check our bags out early when we arrived and late when we left 
61689,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Not so good on value for money as Room was very small table too big as was literally touching the side of the bed which my partner kept banging against More of a room for a single person Been to a few hotels lately and this was the worst room I ve stayed in for overal comfort as just too small for 2 people although can t complain about decor or cleanliness , Staff were superb bar was fab overall ambience of hotel was lovely 
61690,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Staff were incredibly helpful and polite always with a smile Amazing facilities Cocktails in the bar were amazing and again staff helped when we looked a little lost giving us recommendations Really good location for Covent Garden and the theatre Room was really comfy 
61691,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Staff were fantastic The bar had a great atmosphere The room was quiet clean and came with an iron bathrobes and hair dryer which was absolutely great 
61692,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Friendly welcome and a hot towel when you arrive to clean your hands and face post travel I had gone to the hotel to celebrate my partners birthday I arranged champagne for the room and they had arranged a birthday cake with a personal note delightful and thoughtful 
61693,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Booked this hotel as a christmas present for my mum and dad and they absolutely loved it They were extremely impressed with the staff and service when arriving at the property and had a lovely evening Thank you 
61694,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Someone had left their food in the mini fridge and it hadnt been cleaned out We had to move one of our rooms due to an electrical problem Thermostats werent working well Bar service very slow despite beautiful setting Concierges were pleasant but really didnt know the nearby restaurant scene and certainly were not up on the top rated places for every restaurant question i was met with surprise despite the well known reputations Concierge did not get us into any places we had to do it ourselves in the end , Staff pleasant hotel is well appointed and room was good sized room nice beds good bathroom nicely decorated Great bar downstairs We had some issues with one room they were very good and quick about refunding us for an overcharge and credited my bar tab because the room not being cleaned but i had to bring it all to their attention Location of hotel is very good for central London activities Mostly great service 
61695,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The bathrooms are small but that can t be helped , The atmosphere in the hotel was magical and the staff were incredibly friendly chatty and helpful 
61696,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, In the middle of the gorgeous lobby of the Bloomsbury we ended our stay with high tea The scones were literally melt in your mouth delicious the best I have ever tasted Pure heaven We will be back The staff were at our beck and call when does that happen anymore at any hotel I couldn t believe how helpful and caring they were it was hard to end our vacation here They treated our kids to milk and cookies every night presented them with stockings filled with candy and gifts at Christmas and made sure we knew where we were going every day as we explored London Terrific and tremendous 
61697,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The rooms are nicely appointed but as with most hotels in central London quite small , The staff was very warm yet professional Andre at the concierge desk was particularly helpful The bar staff also great Location is fantastic close to British Museum and easy walk to West End theatres 
61698,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Nothing , Wow What a gem a beautiful hotel with a staff that goes above and beyond for their guests from the second you walk through the door Amazing An Old World feeling on a quiet street in the heart of London Rooms are gorgeous and well kept The staff was also wonderful with the kids even left them Christmas stockings filled with candy and games Many thanks for a wonderful stay 
61699,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Room very small one small window so little light and had to keep curtains closed as overlooked by an office block Drawer handle on dressing table loose so I fixed with my Swiss army knife Hair in bed and shower Had to wait long time for breakfast to be served then coffee luke warm no butter At nearly 20 breakfast exorbitantly priced for very less than average fayre It was probably in the small print but overpriced cocktails in bar had a service charge too that I only knew about when I came to pay bill on leaving One small bar of nut chocolate from room fridge was 5 50 , Excellent location good jazz night bar
61700,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The room should be 20 square meter but it was about 12 the room and 4 the bathroom I complained about it and they answered me that it is 19 They are wrong because I measure it They have to correct their site But I didn t want to lower my evaluation because everything else was perfect,No Positive
61701,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Shower was both weak in flow and cold However when we told staff they apologised and comped our bar bill Also the restaurant is very small so you should consider booking a table well in advance if you want to eat there , Beautiful place that is a great blend of high calibre hotel boutique personal service 
61702,The Bloomsbury Hotel, At 198 00 per night the room was not cheap and so I had thought breakfast would have been included as part of the package It s a shame it wasn t this small detail really let the hotel down for me There is a kettle and coffee machine in the room but no water jug so we had to use bathroom sink to fill both items Trying to fit kettle under basin tap was tight and felt a little grubby The sachets of milk were also a let down for such an expensive and supposedly upmarket hotel , The hotel is very central and within easy walking distance of many theatres and shops It is beautifully decorated and staff were very helpful and friendly 
61703,The Bloomsbury Hotel, This hotel has no negative points in my view , The room was extremely clean with an abundance of resources The breakfast was delicious and there was a wide variety of items available The staff are always friendly and are extremely well trained they are always smiling and pleasant 
61704,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The breakfast area was a bit chaotic menu was confusing and unfortunately the staff didn t help to make it clearer The food itself is good quality but there are a lot of way nicer and cheaper places nearby to go for breakfast , Overall it s a very nice hotel in a perfect location walking distance from attractions underground stations shopping and great restraurants Rooms were a good size for being central London and the complimentary coffee facilities were much appreciated There s a lovely coctail bar too 
61705,The Bloomsbury Hotel, i thought the bedroom was too small but this is often the case with Central london hotels , the foyer bars etc were very attractive The staff were friendly and helpful without being obtrusive 
61706,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Our superior room was a lot smaller than what was shown on website quite dated and really cold in bathroom , The overall ambience and the terrace bar was amazing Just like a secret garden 
61707,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The fact it has become so popular its difficult getting a booking so last minute is out of the question here, The staff are wonderful unlike so many more corporate hotels they take a genuine interest in their guests
61708,The Bloomsbury Hotel, reception staff are not friendly Double bed is tiny Shower is tiny Small room, Location Concierge bell captain service fast and efficient Well maintained hotel Nice street
61709,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Superior double room was very small and the price paid didn t include breakfast After now staying at this hotel I would say this hotel room is overpriced compared to other quality hotels in London we were given a room next to the lift on 7th floor the noise from the lift was very noticeable when inside the room , The location is great for the Dominion Theatre and the British Museum there are many local restaurants and shops within a short walk of the hotel Staff were friendly and helpful 
61710,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The bathroom was a bit small as the door opened onto the toilet so made getting in and out not as easy The minibar was ridiculouslly expensive And the receptionist failed to announce there was a turn down service in the evening so when we got back to our room after dinner we were surpised to notice someone had been in our room To not have breakfast included in your stay when paying a certain amount of money is a big put off Specially when its 20 per person DISCOUNTED , The supier double room was great very comfortable and the rooms decor was classy as you would expect from this type of hotel The staff were very friendly the concierges were very polite The hotel was a brief walk away from Shaftesbury theatre which is excellent if you re watching a show there 
61711,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Could ve had more coffee options for the Nespresso machine But still a lovely inclusion , Lovely staff rooms and facilities in a superb location Went to London for the theatre and staying here helped make it the perfect weekend away 
61712,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Nothing, Abience of the foyer and lounge Very helpful and respectful staff The perfume as you entered the foyer The lanterns in the entrance The attention to detail in the room and the comprehensive inclusion of all needed items in the room
61713,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Very closed in hallways and rooms No open windows very stuffy I had to fill out a special release form to try to get a window open Terrible breakfast in underground room for 18 26 lbs Too much , Location Nice Lobby staff
61714,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The main entrance is reached by a flight of stairs which is not accessible for wheelchairs or baby stroller There is a disable lift on the side of the property but it is usually locked for security reason Therefore one need to ring a bell at the bottom of the stairs each time one come to the hotel to ask for an employee to send the lift down and open the side door This is not the best Also the Superior Double rooms are very small We had 4 such rooms and they were all very small , The location is superb Within walking distance from most attractions The staff was friendly and helpful and the overall cleanliness of the property is excellent The rooms have all the amenities to make one stay comfortable 
61715,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The breakfast was the same each day and not too much to select from The vegetable variety was poor mainly bread , The location is perfect The staff was very kind Room service was fast 
61716,The Bloomsbury Hotel, In the main I think most would be happy with this hotel as is demonstrated by the reviews on this site However that is not to say it is beyond criticism there are still areas that would give many people cause for concern The first is the usual London complaint that rooms are small but at the Bloomsbury this manifests itself in a particularly graphic way because space is so limited that you cannot fit anything but a standard British double bed four foot six wide ie one and a half times as wide as a single bed into their standard room I wonder how many couples who can afford to pay 200 a night for a hotel room have a bed that small at home To get what I would call the norm of a British king size bed ie 5 feet wide and slightly longer than a standard double you have to pay for a bigger room at the Bloomsbury which necessitates an outlay of nearly 300 per night which I would say is excessive compared to other hotels in major cities around the world There are other areas that fall short of the best too Why in a hotel that seems to encourage a feeling of calm elegance do all the bedroom doors have to close like they are being slammed at maximum force Believe me if you are in a corridor of people who want to be the first down to breakfast or have to leave early to catch a plane you will be woken up And if by some miracle you manage to sleep through that you may well be disturbed by a hotel operative sliding the big envelope with your bill in it under your door at 6am on the day of your departure Why do they do that for heaven s sake They have already swiped your credit card at the time of checking in so you can t exactly do a runner can you In a hotel like this it comes across as rude and pushy not many hotels I know do this sort of thing any more , With its excellent location in a relatively quiet street just around the corner from the newly refurbished Tottenham Court Rd tube station and its close proximity not only to Oxford St but also the British Museum UCL Euston and all that Fitzrovia has to offer the Bloomsbury is undoubtedly perfectly placed for many travellers It has an air of timeless elegance and romance that may well chime perfectly with the expectations of overseas visitors who crave a quintessentially English bolt hole when they visit London 
61717,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The jugs of orange juice with the meal cost 12 and I didn t ask for them Greedy hotel owners , Staff are absolutely brilliant nothing was too much trouble 
61718,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Bathrobes were like sandpaper , Location and the room was a good size very clean and well decorated Staff were very friendly and room service food was delicious and hot
61719,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Exceptional and knowledgeable staff at an upscale urban hotel in Covent Garden on a relatively quiet street by London standards Room was very comfortable and hotel is well located near tube lines 
61720,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Nothing, Beautiful hotel in a great location the staff were lovely and the service was great we loved the fact that the maid came in in the evening and laid our ropes out on the bed while we were out really nice touch
61721,The Bloomsbury Hotel, There was a pre cooked breakfast on the Sunday morning I would have expected for the cost of the 2 nights stay that this would be freshly prepared as it was on the Saturday , Everything was generally OK Just did not give me the WOW factor for the money 
61722,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Our initial given room was very very small which is totally different than the photo on booking com it was even not suitable for single occupancy after complaining to the front desk we have given a bigger room which was better than the initial one but still was not as the photos on booking com , Staff positive attention The location is perfect 
61723,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Service in general and availability of certain products not up to usual standard at breakfast Ambiance was not so good this time either as they were renovating Also wonder about the plan to move the reception desk into the center of the foyer and create another restaurant in the foyer area For me the use of the foyer was central to justify the price of small though well decorated rooms , As usual the comfy beds and general decor My favorite place to sit the foyer And of course the location 
61724,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, The location was great We enjoyed afternoon tea as well as the complementary espresso tea and water Our friends recommended your hotel and they were spot on Friendly and kind staff too Loved the shower and bathtub 
61725,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, They made an effort to dress our room As newlyweds also surprised us with a glass of fizz on arrival I love the decor of our room Studio would recommend to anyone 
61726,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Short walk to British Museum Also near good restaurants on Charlotte St and tube stations Received quiet room requested Sophisticated warm decor 
61727,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The location wasn t great but perfect if you wanted to be near the British Museum I did , Bed was delightful Really quiet sleep compared to other places in London couldn t hear anything Cleaning staff couldn t do enough for you 
61728,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Lovely charming hotel loved the patio area the staff were very friendly our room was not ready so they upgraded us to a suite which was fantastic Comfiest bed and pillows we have experienced in a hotel Could honestly not fault it at all 
61729,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Perhaps a few more options on bar snack menu , Staff could not have been more helpful and friendly remembered us and what we liked from one day to the next Very personal service 
61730,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Booked a Superior Double Be aware that it was pretty small so I suggest booking a higher category of room if there is more than one of you , Perfect location great staff very clean 
61731,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Only small little gripe was only hand soap was provided in bathroom A shower gel and lotion would have been a nice I m sure this was a mere oversight and would have been corrected if mentioned , Me and my daughter enjoyed our stay at the Bloomsbury Staff were very friendly and always greeted you with a smile When leaving we were both given bottle s of water for our journey home because of the heat We left our luggage at the hotel while we looked around London on our last day and picked it up early evening On collection the young concierge carried our bags out and asked if we had enjoyed our stay and to have a safe journey home Very polite young man Great location and room was fantastic we will return to this fantastic hotel 
61732,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Honestly can t think of anything Loved our time at the hotel , Wonderful room friendly and helpful staff Also used the restaurant at the hotel and found this to be excellent 
61733,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The only problem was at breakfast The staff were a little slow and I had to ask them twice about my eggs But they were still very friendly and very apologetic , All the staff where very helpful and friendly I had booked the hotel for a shopping weekend as it was my nieces 18th birthday They had put balloons in her room left her a birthday card some chocolates and had wrote happy 18th birthday on the mirror This made her day and was a nice touch 
61734,The Bloomsbury Hotel, First room very small but were able to change to a very good one Hard for our driver picking us up at LHR to find the hotel as sign small and invisible at night ,No Positive
61735,The Bloomsbury Hotel, It was perfect , The staff at this hotel made us feel welcome also it was the start of our honeymoon they left loads of lovely messages in the room for us 
61736,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The room I paid for and booked for was a superior booked months in advance when I got there I was told it was superior it clearly was not they then admitted it was a small superior room because the hotel was fully booked This was despite as stated booking months in advance In addition the corridor outside my room had circa 20 plastic storage crates in it I advised reception but they never got moved When I raised the issue of the room I was advised that if I checked in again I would get an upgrade When I confirmed I never would visit again and asked for a refund this part via e mail on the difference between superior and standard I still await a response I also found the check in perfunctory took my payment details gave me the room key telling me I had a superior room But no introduction to the hotel or its facilities not even where the lifts where I had to ask the concierge to tell me all this , In general the staff were very good except for check in
61737,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Standard room is too small Writing Desk was too close to the foot of the bed and the space between was difficult to negotiate So sitting down to write was annoyance as the hair and to pulled out and away in an awkward way just to sit down , Service location and overall atmosphere were excellent Welcoming and comfortable 
61738,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Position is excellent Easy walk to Trafalgar Square Covent Garden and the West End Close to Tottenham a Court Road tube and a great number of bus routes The British Museum is close by Room was very comfortable and staff are exceptional
61739,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Room needed a bit better sound isolation Carpet a little worn in the room and clipped my ear on the corner of the bathroom glass shelf However these issues didn t distract from the excellence of the hotel and service first mentality Staff aware and actively improving on the issues , Hotel is beautiful large clean stylish functional relaxing Staff provide service excellence and above and beyond mentality with individual personality and good energy Group of good healthy looking young but attentive and trained internationals Location is great for my needs Thank you to all the team and special nod to Martina for a wonderful stay 
61740,The Bloomsbury Hotel, No complaints , I was traveling alone for business I loved the building and it s history Every single staff member was helpful and the service was excellent Everyone I encountered went way beyond what was expected to provide first class service and an enjoyable experience The two nights I dined alone in the restaurant the manager and waiters were friendly and conversive and I never felt like I was on my own The rooms are beautiful and comfortable and were always spotless after cleaning The outside bar was a great place to have a drink I could not be happier with my stay and I look forward to my next visit 
61741,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Price of drinks in hotel bar a little on the expensive side but was expected , Hotel Staff were very friendly and accommodating Hotel Bar and Terrace are superb very enjoyable and relaxing Hotel location is perfect for visiting London
61742,The Bloomsbury Hotel, N A , Comfortable elegant and spotless room Excellent staff with great experience of looking after every little detail Fabulous food and drink with a gorgeous basement bar 
61743,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Could not find one bad thing to say about this hotel , We just loved the feel of the warmth and ambience of the whole hotel Everything in this hotel was just perfect The most fantastic location best friendliest staff you could come across beautiful decor This will always be our first choice of a London hotel 
61744,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Not overwhelmed by the hotel as a whole Could hear through the walls Slightly flimsy luxurious extras Nespresso machine unnecessary Bathroom products only ok , Bed was great very comfortable Great staff Room smallish Dalloway Terrace and bar wonderful Good location 
61745,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The service at the restaurant was not the best and the food over priced for what we had, Loved the decor and the restaurant terrace area was lovely The extras in the room such as the espresso machine were such a treat
61746,The Bloomsbury Hotel, I don t really want to put negotive comments but have to be honest A Little pricey for the size of the room and the mini bar was quite expensive too, The location was superb pretty central for Oxford street Covent Garden soho and china town and the British museum is just seconds away Beautiful building Friendly and helpful staff Luxury interior surroundings The foyer always smelt beautiful and fresh Fresh flowers on show The staff looked and acted very professional Comfortable beds fresh towels daily 
61747,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, My wife and I stayed 4 nights in a superior double room Although the room was a little smaller than I expected with no view it was clean beautifully appointed bed comfortable and most of all was fairly quiet I would definately stay again 
61748,The Bloomsbury Hotel, It s just a small detail but we went for a drink in the new bar of the hotel and the staff was friendly but we felt a bit pushed towards consuming more there It is wonderful that they come over to the table to talk ask about where we are from etc but we were asked by 3 members of the staff if we wanted to eat aswel or have more drinks We only were there for 30 minutes and just wanted to relax and have one drink , Location Breakfast Service Beautiful architecture 
61749,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, On arrival we were provided lemonade and hand towels to refresh and on leaving a bottle of water these little touches added a good feel to a high quality hotel in a great location 
61750,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Our first room was very small but we liked the location of the hotel and the staff were so nice that we didn t complain It wasn t until the door handle to our room was broken the window was left open and something that wasn t ours was left in the room that we asked to be moved , We had a problem with our original room and the staff responded quickly to resolve the issue The staff were are very helpful and easy to work with 
61751,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Breakfast extras really expensive doesn t encourage a guest to buy them mini bar extortionate, Staff really helpful nothing too much trouble really attentive
61752,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The shower Not enough water pressure on the 4th floor and the shower door was only a half one so the bathroom floor always needed a mop up after every use , The staff was both friendly and helpful We liked the ambiance of the patio restaurant as well as the food The property was very near the British Museum and the Tube Lots of good shopping and places to eat nearby The hotel is a very attractive property We would absolutely stay there again
61753,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Inconsistencies in linen and towel changes Some days we had extra towels perfectly aligned And on the next day we had less towels or wine glasses Very small details but noticeable , Most of the staff was very polite We also had chocolates left by the bed every day 
61754,The Bloomsbury Hotel, We checked and then left for the day In the meantime someone had been on our room Couldn t see the reason as we d only dropped our bags off, Didn t have breakfast so couldn t really comment beautiful hotel excellent location great staff 
61755,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is centrally located right by Tottenham Court Road tube station Lobby and public facilities are all decorated beautifully with gentlemen s club style Staff is so attentive polite and always ready to help Room was super clean modern with chic with many treats Highly recommended 
61756,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Didn t find out about fitness centre until we were leaving complimentary Nespresso pods were good but 3 per day for 2 persons doesn t go far , Bed was comfortable location very good
61757,The Bloomsbury Hotel, 2 single beds pushed together is not a King the advert stated 1 king bed so mis selling issue perhaps but a lot of hotels do it Later check out option would be nice 450 per night the room didn t match the cost although room 414 is a brilliant suite with huge bathroom with 2 large windows and a stand alone bath stayed previously many times unfortunately the suite 6th floor that I was assigned has a very small and quite grim bathroom a very small dark dull lobby 414 is such a great room all in all a rather uneventful disappointing stay maybe time to look elsewhere , Location is good concierge are polite and attentive 
61758,The Bloomsbury Hotel, All was excellent , The service was excellent with very friendly staff who helped us with all of our needs The room was extremely comfortable with wonderful turn down service chocolates and cookies 
61759,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Maybe the cleaning staff should be told to wait a bit more before entering the room since nobody is waiting for them just behind the door Even more so before 9 o clock in the morning although it is true to say that we had forgotten to put the sign do not disturb outside our room , Everything was fine All staff at groundfloor very friendly and efficient 
61760,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Hotel Bar was quite expensive , Very friendly staff great location a general good feeling if you prefer the smaller hotels with a very good vibe and atmosphere this will be a very good choice Great breakfast as well 
61761,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Size of room was small but was nonetheless immaculate modern and a good value for London , Courtesy and friendliness of staff was exceptional as was the location near the British Museum Bloomsbury and the underground 
61762,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The gym was in the basement which put me off going down for a workout on my own as there wasn t another person on that floor, Lovely hotel in a great location very comfy beds and nice rooms
61763,The Bloomsbury Hotel, There was nothing we did not like about the Bloomsbury, Wonderful staff who were beyond helpful and courteous Great location for access to theatre and other attractions Beautiful room which was clean and comfortable Cannot fault the Bloomsbury

61768,The Bloomsbury Hotel, I loved everything, I was so impressed with the welcome I received from reception and all the staff and also all the time I stayed in the hotel I really really loved my comfy bed and the bathroom was so special with underfloor heating
61769,The Bloomsbury Hotel, We got a room at the 8th floor that was a bit small and the AC was a bit noisy , The comfort of the bed Room well equiped Friendly staff Good location right next to the British Museum and at walking distance from Covent Garden 
61770,The Bloomsbury Hotel, I wish the room rate was a bit lower , From the hot towel when checking in to the complimentary bottled water when checking out I enjoyed the stay at the Bloomsbury 
61771,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The lighting in the room was quite dim also it we could not get seated on the terrace after trying a few times and were directed downstairs which was very dark We also did not have breakfast in the hotel 26 is excessive , The staff were all very friendly and accommodating The hotel was very comfortable and there were lovely details like scented candles burning and quality toiletries 
61772,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Would have liked a better view from bedroom for the money paid , Very clean room and comfortable bed staff very helpful Unfortunately didn t get to eat in the hotel as we have a very hectic schedule 
61773,The Bloomsbury Hotel, To say the room was a superior room it was very small the bathroom was tiny and the cleaning in the bathroom particularly around the shower door should be improved I had to stand in the bedroom to get dry after a shower through lack of space , Sitting on the terrace having breakfast or a leisurely drink in the evening 
61774,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, From start to finish everything was perfect including the birthday card and cake placed in our room for my daughter s birthday a little extra from the hotel which made the stay even more perfect 
61775,The Bloomsbury Hotel, the bathroom was a little bit small and the view from the rooms wasn t that great, The location design and staff was great The room was comfortable we loved the bar terrace and Lobby we will defiantly come back to this hotel

61777,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Everything we required for a one night break, Ease of check in we arrived at 12 30 expecting to drop a bag but had no problem accessing our room Room was spacious with lots of extra touches such as nespresso coffee machine plenty of plugs lights toiletries robe slippers turn down service 
61778,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Bed was very firm shower was fiddly resulting in me having a boiling hot shower as when I turned the temperature gage it came off in my hand , Staff were amazing and the building and general decor was beautiful 
61779,The Bloomsbury Hotel, I could hear people next door or passing thru the corridor if they are a bit loud Also the hands washing sink needs some work as well as the shower door Only to make them perfect otherwise all excellent , It s an excellent 4 star hotel that has all facilities amenities I actually needed Good rooms bathrooms housekeeping friendly staff quite location and generally overwhelming 
61780,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The croissants were a little too hard and crusty , The welcome gift was a nice touch and the staff were all very friendly Special thanks to the Filipina lady in the breakfast room 
61781,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The room was quit small The bed was too soft , The location is really good Very centric and very close to restaurants shopping metro The breakfast is really good Staff is very kind 
61782,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Nothing even when there was a slight issue itcwascredilved quickly and complimentary cocktails were in speedily in place, The ambiance was so comforting and relaxing It s location so close to the West End was really the deal breaker Price wise it was good value for such a key position and the standards it offered Definitely would return and with such close location to the tube at Tottenham Court Road it has the edge on many of its rivals Well done Bloomsbury we shall be returning 
61783,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Although the bed was comfortable it felt that I was sinking a bit on the mattress The room was a bit hot even though it was cold outside but the air conditioning helped with this , The location is great and very central for visiting London The room was clean comfortable and big enough for 2 people It was also nice to have treats such as a Nespresso machine and lovely biscuits 
61784,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Difficult to find anything wrong But a bath to soak in after one particularly long day would have been a bonus Instead I took a long hot power shower and relaxed on the lovely bed a good compromise , Everything to like about this place excellently situated staff are professional courteous friendly and there isnt anything that s too much trouble This is our second stay as we were so impressed and enjoyed the first time so much it s going to be difficult to find somewhere as good so central 
61785,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The bed was so uncomfortable we both had a terrible nights sleep Very disappointed with the mattress quality we stayed in a holiday inn the night before and their bed was much more comfy , Location was great very polite staff Rooms lovely apart from poor quality mattress which is not what I want when paying 210 for 1 night 
61786,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Perfect location and very close to Tottenham Court Road tube station and Oxford Street The room is very comfortable and clean with superb toilet and shower Love the coffee machine and all the amenities I will definitely come back here again 
61787,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Price of breakfast was high We went to an amazing cafe over the road which was high quality and great value Also please note there is a turn down service which we were not made aware of It was very surprising when we returned to the room after going out for dinner and to find it had been made up was not so pleasant a Suprise , Amazing location and quality of hotel Being close to a tube station and walking distance from the theatres and Covent Garden was fantastic 
61788,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Nothing as everything was exceptionally good , The bedroom and all facilities were excellent as was breakfast and the service throughout The hotel is perfectly situated close to Tottenham Court Road tube station the British Museum Leicester Square Covent Garden etc
61789,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Noisy rooms ours had music from the ground floor restaurant reception area filtering through to the room making it hard to slip This was after we asked to be moved from another room which was more resemblance to a closet Room service did not refill replace cotton buds after use , Location
61790,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Standard room is quite small for that price Shower attached to the wall , Nice looking rooms confy bed very friendly staff great restaurant very close to a tube 
61791,The Bloomsbury Hotel, I upgraded to a superior room but discovered excrement in my toilet and cause to complain which was dealt with effectively and efficiently However what I was most annoyed with is that on the morning of my departure my wife an I were woken before 8am by a male who appeared to constantly in and out of room 216 and was performing some kind of meet and greet on the landing adjacent to his room This individual was extremely loud and was constantly whistling and using his mobile phone He had no thought or concern for other guests like me who had purposely used the weekend as a get away break from the usual rat race routine and to enjoy a well deserved break I most certainly did not anticipate or expect to be woken by anyone else and let alone before 8am Once again I had cause to complain about this further aspect of my stay and as a result I have been reassured by management of a reduction on any future stay What I would have considered a more appropriate resolution and a gesture of goodwill would have been a refund of some of the funds that I had already paid for my weekend experience , Great location and the hotel had a good look to it and appeared to cater for every requirement 
61792,The Bloomsbury Hotel, while room very comfortable would have preferred if it had natural light It was too hot and dark Breakfast was too expensive Plenty of nice restaurants around for a lot less , nice welcoming foyer and staff nice touches ie fruit bowl coffee table books library chapel 
61793,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Room comfortable but one tiny window opening onto a wall meant natural light was extremely limited felt claustrophobic and a bit like a cell , Staff service exceptional
61794,The Bloomsbury Hotel, We were on the 7th floor Unfortunately I hit my head a few times on the sloping roof which was right by the bed , Hotel exceptionally clean All staff very helpful Bathroom equipped very well Like having quilt turned back and dressing gown on bed 
61795,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The room was tiny the windows was open to some obscure court and the coffee creams were expired Little things , If you want spend a couple of days shopping and visit the museums this is a good starting point Staff was helpful finding us a taxi on Sunday while the city was closed for the Chineese carnival
61796,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Can t fault anything , Everything It is a wonderful place to spend time relax and feel special The staff were so friendly Not stuffy or snooty We can t wait to stay again 
61797,The Bloomsbury Hotel, I couldn t fault any aspect of my stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel The location was ideal , The staff were very attentive and always willing to help The room was equipped with everything you could possibly require The little touches such as turning down the bed on an evening and laying out the bath robes and chocolates made our stay memorable 
61798,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The coffee and cake was a bit of a let down that may just be me though Very expensive if you want to have a late checkout however I do understand that it probably disrupts the standard housekeeping routine , Absolutely brilliant location 2 mins from Tottenham Court Rd station minutes from British Museum and the shopping theatre strips Although so close to the action it was quiet and peaceful Staff were helpful and courteous Bed was SO comfortable that it was a tough choice to leave the room I appreciated the personal note from management and the treats left in my room on a number of occasions I did not use restaurant as there were many cosy cafes in the neighbourhood and YES I would definitely stay again 
61799,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Service change on everything even when collecting from bar yourself This is optional but I hadn t noticed the small print Food bar pricey, The room was very nice and had all the comforts we needed We did book a Double Delux It was perfect for the theatre and local shops Restaurant food wonderful 
61800,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Nothing, Clean well delayed out rooms fantastic staff who were extremely accommodating and friendly The small touches were what made it for me such as a hot towel when you arrive in the from the cold to warm your hands I hope to come back again soon 
61801,The Bloomsbury Hotel, No tables available in reception area as all being used for afternoon tea Side terrace also full with tea cake guests Had drinks in bar downstairs which is a bit dark As a resident I would have expected a choice , Friendly staff clean hotel good location
61802,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Full English Breakfast extremely disappointing Eggs like rubber on a bed of grease and I didn t order well done black pudding dry as shoe leather mushroom oozing grease and the rest not much better When in England one expects the Full English Breakfast to have been mastered it s unacceptable otherwise shame on you Wish I had the buffet breakfast instead , Location Room and Amenities Great 
61803,The Bloomsbury Hotel, service at breakfast was appalling they said they would correct breakfast charges which they didn t this hotel doesn t respond to any requests sent ahead of arrival wifi slow and erratic, the lobby is a very nice place for drinks comfy rooms
61804,The Bloomsbury Hotel, There was nothing really that caused any serious problems, Breakfast was exceptionally good On arrival we got a room that was quite noisy due to some plumbing or whatever But staff member ADRIANA gave us a new and better in fact upgraded for free room within minutes of our telling of the problem The hotel is superbly situated and staff is very helpful and attentive I shall certainly consider Thje Blooomsbury for my next stay in London
61805,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The restaurant is draughty I was seated with my back to the window and felt very cold A lady at the table next to me experienced the same problem and she requested to be seated in a completely different area of the restaurant to get away from the draught On one occasion the staff forgot to give me a wake up call which was unfortunate , The staff were all extremely helpful charming and very prompt to fix any problems I was very pleased to get a truly excellent upgrade plus a free meal in the restaurant in compensation for some issues I encountered e g feeling cold in the restaurant due to draughty air Restaurant food is excellent and the hotel location is very practical So overall I would rate the hotel highly despite a few issues as the staff I was in contact with went to great lengths to see that I was more than adequately compensated for some of the issues I experienced 
61806,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The room was pretty small you could only really get out of one side of the bed as there was a wall sticking out on the other side The bathroom was also small my husband cut his shoulder on the towel rail as the room was so narrow, Location and room cleanliness Communal areas were lovely
61807,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Room superior double was smaller than we had expected and smaller than we had elsewhere for a similar price But then again it was central London And the colour scheme was beautiful and the room quiet , Location was great the interior decoration stunning staff was friendly and caring ambience was stylish but welcoming Breakfast until 10 30 there was a good choice at the buffet and the cooked breakfast was delicious Rather late check out time added to our stress free last day 
61808,The Bloomsbury Hotel, You can put nothing of your own to the minibar since it has electronic sensors like in most London hotels , Good helpful and nice staff Location will be good when the surrounding area s huge construction works finish Clean and efficiently big room good sleep quality Nespresso machine was so good in the mornings 
61809,The Bloomsbury Hotel, We booked a delux room There was nothing delux about it The bed sunk into the middle and was only an arms length away from the bathroom door Our room was over the restaurant and by the street so not only did the lights that illuminate the building fill our room to the point we may as well have left the lights but we heard every bus garbage truck and drunk on that street all night long We were also right by the cleaners cupboard which was being used all night But that s just to name a few things that we didn t like or that were wrong The reason we were so disappointed is we compare this to our last stay when we had an amazing and spacious room with a huge bathroom complete with a grand bathtub we were in complete darkness and the bed was like a cloud So we came away feeling refreshed and happy This timewe were both exhausted and really annoyed that we had spent all that money and would have been better off elsewhere or at home , Location was good
61810,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Room wasn t ready when we arrived was serviced unnecessarily while we were out on our first night Breakfast took over half an hour to arrive in the restaurant No condiments on the table Very average, Good location Luxurious room clean nice bed staff friendly and helpful 
61811,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Nothing, As soon as we arrived we were greeted with amazing service and professional staff As we checked in they gave my partner a rose for valentines day which I thought was a beautiful touch The hotel was immaculate and our room was perfect Would stay here again without a doubt 
61812,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, We were in London to see The War of The Worlds at the Dominion Theatre to celebrate Our Wedding Anniversary and were given a Happy Anniversary card and strawberries dipped in chocolate It was a lovely personal touch The Bloomsbury is just a few steps away from the theatre close to the Underground and we were even within walking distance of Oxford Street 
61813,The Bloomsbury Hotel, I cannot fault this hotel , Brilliant hotel Staff were faultless extremely helpful We were upgraded on arrival and the room was excellent The bed was very comfy the room was spotless I would deffinately recommend this hotel look forward to staying again 
61814,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Room was so hot The air conditioning cooled it down but the cool air draught became uncomfortable, Staff Friendly and helpful Rooms Clean Good D cor Restaurant food lovely
61815,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Room was a bit confined but I guess that s the trade off you bargain for in an older building in a great spot , Great central location with access to the Tube Soho restaurants and West End theatres Staff were extremely friendly and helpful 
61816,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Everything was perfect from the staff the surprise birthday cake the beautiful candles everywhere cosy bar and the food Wouldn t hesitate to recommend to others The location was excellent and the bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I ve ever stayed in Thank you Bloomsbury for the fantastic stay Hopefully be back again very soon 
61817,The Bloomsbury Hotel, found the room small and not great how often the heating had to be turned back on as it kept going off automatically while i was in the room, the proximity to the british museum the very english decor
61818,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Housekeeping kept ringing room doorbell n atempted to enter room on last day despite being informed of late check out The new restaurant was not sufficiently staffed to handle its customers , Very convenient location 
61819,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Everything was perfect, Helpful and kind staff The room was very clean and comfortable A plenty of facilities The hotel is located very close to center and to the theaters 
61820,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Little expensive but , The location of the hotel is amasing 2 15 minutes walk to Oxford st the british museum Soho and west end the stuf was very helpful and the full english breakfast was great The room was specious and very clean 
61821,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Beautiful renovation luxury in the heart of London Location is perfect for shopping and theatre very handy to Soho Covent Garden Seven Dials Oxford Regent Streets Very close to Tottenham Court Road tube station so getting around is very easy 
61822,The Bloomsbury Hotel, There was nothing we didn t like , Loved loved loved our stay at this hotel the staff went out of their way to make our stay as special as possible from the moment we walked through the door They provided my mother with a birthday card and cake in the room my 7yr old son with a football sticker book the moment we arrived I could not rate this hotel higher we can t wait to return in 2016 
61823,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Room was a tad small , From our arrival at was a bustling Friday night foyer until our departure after picking up our bags on Saturday afternoon the Bloomsbury can be summed up in two words impeccable service Utilising customer service principle not found in some hotels at twice the price the Bloomsbury proves that in some cases the old adage you get what you pay for holds fast 
61824,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The outside dinning area was very cold The plastic flapping doors spoiled the evening meal However it was great to be able to have superfood salads , Very cosy comfortable Loved the rich colours with a Morrocan feel 
61825,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Everything about my experience was great from booking the bedrooms to booking meeting rooms and getting recommendations for dinner Beautiful hotel great location and friendly staff 
61826,The Bloomsbury Hotel, That we could not stay longer This tims , Everything Perfect location amazing staff Most of all loved the charisma of the building and how gently they turned it into a 5 hotel If you want more than just the clinical perfection of all hozel chains try it 
61827,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The room was very small especially considering we had paid for a Superior room Our travelling companions were given a handicap access room which had more space despite being a Standard room it would seem wise to request such a room if there are two of you Most of the space in our tiny wardrobe was taken up with an ironing board and there was no realistic storage space for our clothes so we ended up living out of our suitcases , This is a lovely hotel very close to Oxford Street Tottenham Court Rd tube station Soho British Museum and some excellent pubs and breakfast cafes Stylish decor great location helpful and pleasant staff good wifi
61828,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Not much other than the fact of the service charge that is automatically added to the bar bill when the prices are pretty steep already , Brilliant location that is easy for shopping nightlife theatres museums and a Sunday stroll around Bloomsbury
61829,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Foyer very small for size of hotel with not much seating Room had vent flapping in barhroom ceiling with wind tv didnt work in room Afternoon tea snacks very over priced for where it was served which was in foyer , Location appearance cleanliness pleasant staff who were very helpful and courteous 
61830,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Lack of attention to some small details was disappointing For instance the edging strip to the shower door was hanging off allowing water to spill through onto the floor One of the dressing gowns was presented ready to wear but was discovered to have make up on the collar , The location and presentation of the hotel was superb The staff friendly and helpful 
61831,The Bloomsbury Hotel, No hot water for more than one day in the initial room in the 8th floor , Manager Julia was extremely kind and helpful in changing the room since in our we did not have hot water Concierge Dale was very kind 
61832,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Room had not been checked by anyone safe broken needed to be repaired Very small room perhaps it would be better to book direct and not through booking com, Location and style of hotel
61833,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, I booked this as a Birthday pressie for my mum and she loved it When we checked in the Receptionist found out it was for my mums 60th Birthday she arranged for a card Birthday cake to be left in our room Such a surprise a lovely gesture Made my mums day Everyone was so friendly helpful lovely experience Will definitely be visiting again
61834,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, When we got there we were offered an upgrade to a suite lovely room staff were all polite we always stay at the marriot county hall not any more this hotel is streets ahead and better value for money and ideal for theatre visits
61835,The Bloomsbury Hotel, I did not get the paper I asked for , Loved the location the coffee machine and the comfortable bed Also the Aromatherapy toiletries It was lovely to be offered mulled wine on arrival Interesting history of the building provided in the room 
61836,The Bloomsbury Hotel, No help from the concierge concerning adresses busses theatres etc no change of bedlinen during 4 nights, The decoration was elegant the room nice the style with very good taste
61837,The Bloomsbury Hotel, London is an expensive city and the room was nice but expensive for what we had But it was roomy and very comfortable , Amazing Location beautifull hotel 
61838,The Bloomsbury Hotel, I was charged for mini bar items which I never consumed The fridge was not reshelved by some items each day and I was charged for these items The reception took it off my bill but it was nevertheless embarassing having to explain myself and I didnt feel happy about this and I didnt feel comfortable , Beautiful room great location Super clean Lovely staff at the front The gentelman at the consiege and another one at the front door were super attentive Beautiful interiors Great quality bedding 
61839,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The bar was not as welcoming convivial as we would have liked, So central close to Oxford Street British Museum etc Lovely and well maintained decor 
61840,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Unfortunately our shower was not working properly the temperature could not be regulated properly We complained each morning but it didn t get fixed during our stay although they said that they would send someone up to repair it Last day shower turned really hot and I didn t manage to bring the temperature down We thought this was unacceptable for a hotel at this price ,No Positive
61841,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Special touches like strawberries and chocolate petals the room service was very quick thank you will stay again soon my favourite hotel in london 
61842,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The room was very small and with a window facing into the hotel I am pregnant and found the room very stuffy We asked to be moved however we were told we could but too an even smaller room However friends who had come down to surprise my husband for his birthday had a free upgrade , Julie kindly sent a cake up for my husbands 30th birthday
61843,The Bloomsbury Hotel, You can see the opinion up, The receptionist named Pedro has unpleasant attitude was unkind My suggestion is be more careful when you select the fron desk staf it can be ruined your image
61844,The Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Fabulous experience in all areas The reception staff were attentive and friendly any staff member passing in the hall said hello and asked how our stay was going Breakfast was top quality The suite was beautiful clean and full of exceptional little details 
61845,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Rooms can be a little small depending on what gets assigned to you housekeeping staff cupboard near to bedroom and thus very noisy on the morning as the door was slamming back and forth Quite a small TV but probably proportionate for the room size Would like to see a little bit more security on who can and can t just freely walking in to the hotel , Very relaxed atmosphere at the Bloomsbury staff always attentive and happy to assist to the fullest extent Very comfortable beds although I don t like two singles pushed together

61851,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Being woken at 8 40am after a late night out by an angle grinder hammering and drilling was more than unnecessary on a Sunday morning That spoiled a very enjoyable stay Not what you expect for 229 , Everything was great service rooms staff but 
61852,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The breakfast was not what I expected no fresh fruit fresh fruit juice no pastries boiled eggs were cold and only hard boiled eggs Little variety of bread For a continental breakfast I feel a hotel of this standard could provide more , The location was very central staff were excellent

61864,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Dirty drinking glasses when I arrived to the room and were not washed or looked at the entire time for 5 nights No soundproofing on the doors so I could hear the cleaners slamming the storage room door through the night and morning and the closing doors of the near by rooms , Nice design Big property Well maintained 
61865,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Sorry but I genuinely can t find anything poor to say , There wasn t anything about oour stay that wasn t excellent Location fantastic decor beautiful staff lovely bed the bed I have slept in for a long time All the extras were a lovely touch I also liked the idea of the emails sent before and on arrival about your stay and your comfort This hotel has spoiled it for many othera and I will be booking again for out next stay Thank you 
61866,The Bloomsbury Hotel, When asked for feedback by morning reception staff do not fall into the trap of answering it s clearly just a pretext to pick an argument and tell you that you re wrong wrong wrong , Evening reception staff Location Cute rooms even Standard category Nice lobby WiFi connection in room Sparkly clean beautiful bathroom
61867,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Had to wait 35mins fir a lunch order then order was incorrect However they did try to rectify by giving us a discounted bill Would have preferred for order to have been correct , Staff were very pleasant and attentive 
61868,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The walls are a bit thin I could faintly hear conversations television snoring from the adjacent room , The location is great It s a five minute walk or less to the British Museum the Tottenham Court tube station numerous bus stops 3 decent pubs about 20 eating places of every variety The hotel is generally quiet no street noise It was built in the 1920s and has a pleasant appearance The staff was helpful 
61869,The Bloomsbury Hotel, I suppose the only negative things I could say are I had to use the chair to reach the hair dryer It was on the top shelf and I am not a tall person There are no information I could find regarding the charges made by using the room phone So it was a surprise the cost of calls charges on the bill So beware of the cost , The staff was very lovely and helpful And happy to help when needed It was very comfortable room and would love to visit there again 
61870,The Bloomsbury Hotel, The room looked like it hadn t been hoovered after some decorating had gone on but then there was decorating needed to be done few touch ups here and there , I loved my nights sleep as room was completely black no light entering the room what so ever the overall decor of the room had potential 
61871,The Bloomsbury Hotel, Wi Fi was very weak signal Late night menu could easily be extended Later checkout option would be useful Very small cups on the in room tray with limited milk Remote control unit for air con would ve been a nice touch Towels were a little rough and had a copper scent to them not good All of the above observations are pretty much the same in most hotels though I ve stayed in a lot and I think the Bloomsbury is really excellent on balance, Very relaxed atmosphere excellent location good concierge assistance not overcrowded with functions events good standard of guests
61872,The Bloomsbury Hotel, My only gripe which is only a small one is the fact that if you want fresh orange or any type of fruit juice with your breakfast you had to pay extra for it from the Juice bar this was a first for me as been to many hotels 4 5 star and never experienced this apart from that everything was perfect, The staff were fantastic very friendly and very helpful the hotel was immaculate our room 621 was exceptional the Landseer restaurant food was mind knowingly good recommend the fillet steak if your looking for an exceptional hotel in a good location at a good fair price then book the Bloomsbury we loved it
