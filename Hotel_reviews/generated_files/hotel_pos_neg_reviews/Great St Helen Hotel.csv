162278,Great St Helen Hotel, The room was small by American standards and we also brought an infant The hotel isn t kid friendly so unless you are ok with your toddler or kid sleeping in your bed this isn t the place for you There is massive construction going on six days a week outside so if you are looking to sleep in probably isn t going to happen Because it s the financial district nothing is open in this area on the weekends Had to take a taxi to get a coffee , Stafff was very accommodating hotel is located in the center of financial district Complimentary snacks and waters in the mini fridge Walking distance to great restaurants pubs and Tower of London 
162279,Great St Helen Hotel, Wifi went down at night time but no fault of the hotels just unlucky timing , Staff were really helpful and even picked up chocolates as I booked the room for my boyfriends birthday Room was super clean and shower was amazing 
162280,Great St Helen Hotel, our shower flooded the entire bathroom floor every time it was used and we had to use a mop for it after use because we had a wheelchair accessible room The sink in our room was very small and water would splash out onto the floor There was construction work right outside our room which was very noisy early in the morning , The room was modern spacious and comfortable with useful amenities The location was great and the rooms were cleaned daily 
162281,Great St Helen Hotel, The room was one of the smallest I have ever had Everything small bed pillows towels No room for a chair so nowhere to sit except on the bed with knees almost against the wall The shower room was really tiny Not even roomy enough to dry ourselves after showering Storage space very small also , Everything was very clean We had a good TV free wifi tea and coffee and plenty of free snacks in the fridge though no breakfast available The shower was hot and powerful The location was handy for Liverpool Street Station and the Tower Pleasant staff 
162282,Great St Helen Hotel, cannnot complain great location and room for the price, Stayed one night for a concert at Shakespeares Globe Great location and great price Walking distance from Liverpool street station and London bridge Fine for one night small room and on ground floor building works outside at 8am suppose that cant be helped and Bed was lovely and comfy so had a good sleep regardless Great choice of refreshments which made up for lack of breakfast cereal bars biscuits cookies and nuts all included in room Great find would def stay again 
162283,Great St Helen Hotel, 1 when we were there there was construction just next to the room you can hear the noise from the construction and the street 2 one of the rooms I book is just on the ground floor seems there is a wrong design on the bath room there is no difference on the level of the shower nor the barrier so the water flood the whole bath room funnily they provided the broom to sweep the water from the floor, 1 I like the colors ambiance of the room 2 the staff was very attentive to all our questions before and during our stay 
162284,Great St Helen Hotel, No place to open the suitcase other than the bed , Very good location just a 5 minute walk from Liverpool Street station But be careful as it is a but hidden behind some works I booked a double room which was comfortable and clean It had a fridge and a safe The bathroom was fine but no space to put your toiletries The room also lacked a place where you can open the suitcase Service was good and wi fi fine Good value for money for London standards 
162285,Great St Helen Hotel,No Negative, Lovely clean modern rooms with great bed and wifi No breakfast but snacks and coffee in the room free of charge Muffins buiscuits peanuts breakfast bars etc More than enough to set you on your way for the day 
162286,Great St Helen Hotel, Option for breakfast would have been nice but not a big deal Wouldn t like to share a room that size as they are compact but fine for one , Nice compact room almost pod like Good shower and complimentary toiletries Tea coffee and nibbles in the room 
162287,Great St Helen Hotel, Nothing but would have been very small for 2 people, It was a stopover Very close to Liverpool street station Very clean modern and comfortable good shower Very pleasant sraff and very welcome tea coffee and snacks free
162288,Great St Helen Hotel, Finding pubic hair in the sink upon arrival Quite noisy due to lots of building works around the area Broken bathroom blind Dirty cushions on the bed and no mattress protector on the bed just a sheet tucked in The bedroom was tiny the smallest I have ever been in I was too tired to bother the lady on reception and couldn t call down using the internal phone , Very comfortable bed and nice bathroom Good powerful shower Good little mini fridge with snacks 
162289,Great St Helen Hotel,No Negative, Smart hotel in a great location Air conditioning was very welcome on one of the hottest nights of the year Staff were friendly and it s reasonably priced in comparison with others 
162290,Great St Helen Hotel, Reception set up is a little strange as there isn t one and always have to re contact them for an invoice afterwards but they always send this fairly swiftly , Really convenient for a business for the location to ERM offices
162291,Great St Helen Hotel, The window in the room did not shut so the loud work noise across the road could be heard The room was tiny and the wardrobe was not big enough to hang your clothes , The location was really well situated for where we wanted to be Walking distance to main attractions such as the London eye The room was lovely and clean and the air con was a blessing as it was 28 degree outside 
162292,Great St Helen Hotel, To check my credit card they charge me before coming and then returned the money however this operation cost me 30 Euro because of exchange rate , Location and staff
162293,Great St Helen Hotel, I had a basement room at the front The construction of the new building opposite goes on 24 hours so very noisy I suspect this will be ok once finished The room is very small but not dissimilar to other local hotels in the city The immediate basics were clean I e slink shower furniture and bedlinen but the rest was filthy Thick dust on top of the skirting boards all the corners full of dust and debris The phone did not work and there was no extra way of locking the door so I felt a little vulnerable on my own The Bed was rock hard and I like a hard mattress normally So I had a bad nights sleep due to the hard bed and the noise and do not intend to stay there again in the foreseeable future , In a good city location 
162294,Great St Helen Hotel, Bit noisy due to construction work nearby Nothing the hotel could do about that, There was no breakfast we knew this when booking but the hotel provided muffins breakfast bars and biscuits free of charge in the room
162295,Great St Helen Hotel,No Negative, I liked the location I needed to rush to Stansted airport at 4 AM and it took me 5 minutes to liverpool street by foot so it was great In overall I liked the hotel very much clean confortable nice staff 
162296,Great St Helen Hotel, room was tiny bathroom was tiny view was of a building site demolition and building works taking place opposite so very noisy no space for luggage, comfy bed and good wifi free tea coffee and snacks in room
162297,Great St Helen Hotel, The room was quite small no room for large cases Not the hotel fault there is a building site next door at the front of the building which is noisy Ask for back facing room , There was a lift Airconditioning was very effective the weather was very warm There s a refrigerator extra goodies supplied eg muffins nuts water Comfortable bed security safe Close to restaurants tesco liverpool st station The Gerkin building is just around the corner Petticoat Lane markets 
162298,Great St Helen Hotel, Room very small only just enough room to get around the bed Not enough wardrobe storage space Hairs found on top of duvet on first checking in, Great location central to all attractions in the City of London Quiet within hotel Good TV
162299,Great St Helen Hotel, The location was good but the building work going on across from it wasn t helpful first thing in the morning Also with the windows being single glazed I found it difficult to sleep at night with the noise of the traffic this really let down the hotel , Room was clean and tidy Staff were friendly and the room was ok over all 
162300,Great St Helen Hotel, The bathroom floor got a bit full of water due to shower and made a big puddle all over, But overall the hotel room was very good enjoyed my stay Deffo be returning
162301,Great St Helen Hotel, Our bathroom was way to small they are not all the same And you could hear in the room all that was happening in that bathroom The room was also very small but not so unconfortable as the bathroom , The daily free snacks the cleanliness 
162302,Great St Helen Hotel, The duvet and runner along the foot of the bed were dirty they had mud on them from a previous customer , Free water and snacks were provided in the room
162303,Great St Helen Hotel, Unfortunately directly opposite of the hotel is a huge construction side doesn t look very nice What really annoyed us was that we had a room in the basement with no view at all, The staff was really friendly and very helpful We stayed in London because of a concert and they helped us a lot with the transport to the concert 
162304,Great St Helen Hotel, The room was on the outside of the hotel and currently there is a considerable amount of construction taking place next door which made for an interrupted two nights sleep,No Positive
162305,Great St Helen Hotel, The cleaning maybe could ve been a bit later in the day However the reception staff gave us fresh towels and water since we missed room cleaning , There was replacements of refreshments like muffins shortbread nuts cookies breakfast bars water tea and coffee everyday The bed was really comfy Staff were friendly and helpful The shower was very nice 
162306,Great St Helen Hotel, Bed and pillows very soft Shower did not drain away Building work opposite so couldn t leave window open Room was small but fine for just a stay over , Excellent location if working in the City Simple check in Complimentary snacks in the room were a nice touch Aircon worked well 
162307,Great St Helen Hotel, Nada All was spot on , Really central location 5 mins walk from train and tube 10 mins walk to tower bridge Staff really helpful Safe and fridge in room always a great bonus 
162308,Great St Helen Hotel, I have to be pedantic to find any flaws but ideally I would have liked more than one small bottle of water in the fridge because it was a hot and very nice day outside Also the room was a bit small but this wasn t an issue alone , Muffins shortbread biscuits were a nice touch and whole room was gorgeous Good facilities like TV and nice bathroom The location and the price I got the room for was absolutely brilliant 
162309,Great St Helen Hotel, Building works right outside the hotel noisy all day night Hairdryer did not work in the room which was inconvenient no iron in the room , Great location with plenty of transport links and sights nearby Room was small but adequate bed was very comfortable good value for money compared to other hotels in the area 
162310,Great St Helen Hotel, Noise from outside Toilet drain must run past my room as every time someone used it on a higher floor the noise of passing water was very loud and woke me up twice during the night, Modern decor and good shower
162311,Great St Helen Hotel, I found the attitude of the staff disgusting I have photographic evidence that pre authorization and pre payment was not required However they did a preauthorisation for the full amount which blocked money on my account and then they did it again a couple of days before the stay When I rang to query why they had done this twice whoever was answering the phone first tried to tell me they hadn t done any previous preauthorization I asked about what if I wanted to pay cash for my stay and she stated that they would then refund my card So essentially I was expected to pay for my hotel stay prior to going there In general just found the whole hotels processes shoddy and not customer friendly at all and was so put off I didn t even go and stay there and found a decent better hotel with friendly staff elsewhere ,No Positive
162312,Great St Helen Hotel, The windows could close better it is very loud even when the windows are closed , The location is amazing and everything one would like in a walking distance the staff is very friendly and accommodating 
162313,Great St Helen Hotel, Small room for two people Bathroom was too small and there was no space to walk , Free bar stuff in the room and nice decoration Good location and quiet 
162314,Great St Helen Hotel,No Negative, Very central location nice secure modern room and good value for solo travelers like me I was not put off by constructions nearby as the neighborhood included beautiful quiet church and had vibrant city atmosphere 
162315,Great St Helen Hotel, Very small crammed rooms traffic is bad around the hotel but doesn t matter if you rely only on public transport walking no frills , Convenient central location in London Value for money if you need very short term accommodation 
162316,Great St Helen Hotel, As ever the room was too hot and although there was a thermostat in the room operating the heating air conditioning again it was impossible to reduce its temperature below that set by the hotel I ve raised this with them before but nothing has changed The result a poor night s sleep , It was clean and had tea and coffee facilities in the room 
162317,Great St Helen Hotel, One should mind a socket plague and have a spare universal socket connection with them I could only find a single one in the room , The Hotel works 24 7 it is very convenient The staff is friendly and helpful Location is great a nearest tube station is within 10 minutes walk however one can always walk for sightseeing there is no need in public transport from where the hotel is located 
162318,Great St Helen Hotel, Small rooms two people would struggle No hot water for my morning shower and the lower ground rooms are next to the staff area where they make a lot of noise in the morning So no chance of a lie in, The friendly staff and the location
162319,Great St Helen Hotel, The building work in the area though this will obviously not be a problem for future guests once completed, The location the quirkiness of the hotel and general comfort of the stay there
162320,Great St Helen Hotel, Air con made quite a bit of noise like a tap running into a bath but just switched it off and the noise stopped , Clean and right in the centre of London Friendly staff 
162321,Great St Helen Hotel, No catering facilities shame I was so tired and the walk to Tesco for sandwiches was not a welcome one , location great very small and compact Very clean just the job 
162322,Great St Helen Hotel, I booked free cancellation pay later but my account was debited for the first night within 24hours of booking and the balance 48hours before arrival This came as a surprise as I had intended to pay cash , The location was excellent room a little small but the staff very helpful and warm We would book again because our stay was so pleasant 
162323,Great St Helen Hotel, Toilet door being too large or perhaps the bathroom being too small for the door , Charming receptionist on check in check out 24 hour manned desk Location 
162324,Great St Helen Hotel, Unfortunately the bed was so hard you d be as well sleeping on the floor , The hotel was good value for money and despite other reviews the noise wasn t too bad for us 
162325,Great St Helen Hotel, Room and bathroom absolutely tiny too small for a couple No room for a chair so clothes ended up on floor hanging space drop was too short for even a shirt nowhere for a case ,No Positive
162326,Great St Helen Hotel, Very difficult to find A detailed map is needed as the hotel is tucked away in a side street Room very small but servicable Room lighting too bright and I could not find a way to lower the lighting, good bed pleasant service good shower good location apart from difficulty in finding the hotel
162327,Great St Helen Hotel, Staff at entrance was pretty rude when arriving early for check in despite having informed the hotel beforehand Only when asked if she s going to kick me out she offered my baggage to leave there The rooms are super tiny though if you have hand luggage only and for 1 night it is bearable My room only had a window in the bathroom kinda claustrophobic sleeping in a blind room Lots of strong LED lights in the rooms which cannot be switched off , Location
162328,Great St Helen Hotel,No Negative, A very reasonably priced hotel in the heart of the business sector Rooms were very clean bed really comfy Recently refurbished as well The rooms were small but just perfect for a weekend stay Would I stay here again Absolutely 
162329,Great St Helen Hotel, This single room was little bigger than the bed Just enough space for a drop down table next to the bed and a cupboard with fridge and hanging space at the head of the bed Huge tv on wall at end of bed if you like such things However I didn t really mind all that the thing that let it down in my opinion was the poor quality towels and the absence of any form of mattress protector which meant seeing and feeling the mattress through the thinnish bottom sheet I thought this odd as it must surely benefit the hotel to protect its mattresses , Friendly staff Clean rooms Firm big bed even in single room Pretty well everything you might need for a one night stay everything well organised for such a small space Window in bathroom that opened to cool the room down a bit Good size shower and good water flow 
162330,Great St Helen Hotel, The bed wasn t a full double which was ok for me but my other half being 6ft he was a little cramped , I picked this hotel due to its location and wasn t disappointed The rooms are small but considering we were in a basement room the secondary glazing ensured a great nights sleep even with a major construction site outside The ensuite had everything you needed including the best shower The staff were friendly and helpful and even though they don t offer a breakfast they provide snacks etc in the room 
162331,Great St Helen Hotel, Room size particularly the en suite which was a squeeze to use the facility as a former large rugby player , Friendy staff plenty of free water and snacks in the room a real bonus 
162332,Great St Helen Hotel, Had a leaking shower drain wasn t draining and water spilled over the top Few stained towels but was provided lots of them , Excellent location Hotel was tidy 
162333,Great St Helen Hotel, The door to my room jammed shut on my return so it took some time to get in but the staff were apologetic Carpet and furnishings were a bit shabby and room was small but functional The fire alarm went off at 5 53am which I wasn t too pleased about apparently somebody was smoking in their room , Great location and close to Liverpool Street station and where I needed to be Was worried whether it would be noisy when I arrived as I was on the street front but hotel was quiet during the night and I got a good night s sleep Bed was firm but comfortable Lots of free snacks tea coffee and water provided as they don t provide breakfast 
162334,Great St Helen Hotel, Room was a little tired the bed was made each day but not fresh Toilet smelt a little funny but there was an air freshener supplied , Well stocked fridge and tea making area Bed was comfy 
162335,Great St Helen Hotel, Room size extremely small I think room size quoted included shower room Compared to other hotels we have stayed the quoted room size did seem correct TV signal poor on night of our stay picture flickering with distorted sound Reception staff not real friendly had to wait at reception for staff to attend desk for check in and check out , Close to Liverpool St Station 
162336,Great St Helen Hotel, The beds are very high which is an issue for reduced mobility there is a step but little purchase for the hands Very warm I opened a window and I like warm places , This hotel is very compact unsurprisingly as it is about 100yards from the shard 
162337,Great St Helen Hotel, Temperature in the room was a nasty thing to control Without the Aircon turned on it was too hot but if you turned on the Aircon you would find out it s definitely not that silent For people needing to sleep in silence it not advisable Sink in the bathroom was so small to make anything almost impossible without spilling water anywhere Although Bathroom was clean enough there was some mold to be removed from shower stall No breakfast possible at all unless you want to enjoy the Breakfast kit provided in your room , Not the best hotel i ve ever been but not even the worst My room was really small there was room enough for a double bed and a little isle but the bathroom was big and comfortable enough The modern style applied to the room makes the room really nice There was a BIG TV mounted to the wall in fron of the bed so if you like it you can enjoy your tv while comfortably laying down on your bed 
162338,Great St Helen Hotel, The hotel was disgusting The toilet smelt so bad it stunk out the whole room it was vile and there were no other rooms available so we had to stay in it The room was dirty and my pillow was covered in what looked like blood The staff were unhelpful and didn t seem to think it was an issue to sleep in a room that smelt like a sewer and was filthy , Nothing
162339,Great St Helen Hotel, My room on the 1 floor had to keep curtains shut or people on street could look down, Bed comfy room spotless good T V Tea coffee plus extras
162340,Great St Helen Hotel, Rooms were very small Double rooms face a major construction site in the City of London with intrusive construction noise No caf or restaurant facilities , Easy accessibility to Liverpool Street area and the City of London 
162341,Great St Helen Hotel, The shower didn t drain minor pain The bed only had one sheet could see straight through to the mattress would have been nicer had there been better sheets or mattress protector , Great location value for money cannot be ignored given how central Room has big windows which could be opened for fresh air Staff very good had a shower that didn t drain so bathroom was pretty wet staff member came up immediately to sort Pretty good selection of free snacks 
162342,Great St Helen Hotel, The lack of space to walk around within the room , Very understanding of some miscommunication that happened with the booking prior to arriving It was sorted out with no stress at all 
162343,Great St Helen Hotel,No Negative, Had a work function at sushi samba The location was ideal staff friendly and helpful The room was ideal for somewhere to shower and sleep Would recommend for any solo traveller just needing somewhere to get ready and sleep after a night out 
162344,Great St Helen Hotel,No Negative, Great single room with large bed and big flat screen TV Large bathroom and great power shower Generous freebies with tea and coffee making facilities Good value and great location close to rail links 
162345,Great St Helen Hotel, The only problem I faced during my staying was almost absent wardrobe I believe the problem could be partly solved with nailing a board with 3 4 hooks for cloths plus several shoulders By the way additional shoulders were given to me immediately when I asked about it , I stayed at this hotel in November 2016 It was a really nice experience First of all I arrived at the hotel at 11 30 I asked about early checking in my comments while booking but there was no guarantee Smiling lady from the reception kept me amused with conversation for the half hour while my room was preparing At 12 00 I had a rest in my room and my early check in was absolutely for free I would like to say that all staff was nice and friendly My room was small but clean quite comfortable and there was a very good big enough and well equipped bathroom Towels were extremely white and soft Shower cabin had a tropical rain option and it was a pleasant addition to the standard facilities There was also mini bar with free of charge snacks and a bottle of water which were delivered every day Another pleasant surprise was an international plug it was truly convenient to be independent of power adaptor And another one and very important advantage was location The hotel was perfect situated in London City and had the best value for money 
162346,Great St Helen Hotel, The room was very small This was ok because we were out site seeing all day Also it was quite warm No extractor in the bathroom which means the small room can get pretty smelly , Very nice location very clean and tidy
162347,Great St Helen Hotel, receptionist very unfriendly as if she wanted to be somewhere else room was extremely small bed was hard and smallest I have ever slept in value for money it was very expensive,No Positive
162348,Great St Helen Hotel, I have not been in many hotels in London but thought the room was tiny compared to what is paid for it 100 euro a night Maybe London is just expensive and this is normal The room really is tiny but they do try to make the most of it eg the desk fold out from the wall and the not so comfortable wooden chair is kept under the bed The bathroom is surprisingly large compared to the rest There is no bathtub Other negative things 1 very close to construction work which can be heard not very peaceful if you want to sleep during the day 2 As others have mentioned in their reviews it can get very hot inside and there s very little control on this It seems like a waste of energy money The airco only seems to work for a while and then switch off Not handy if you want a cooler sleep 3 Some tv channels were not working well Summary This is quite a small room for what you pay , I guess the location was fine being close to Liverpool street station The room had a fridge that you could use to put your own food in it The food in the room was also included in the price and refilled every day 
162349,Great St Helen Hotel, The building site 20 yards from our room started work at 6 30 and finished at 1800 very noisey, The close location to the tube overground stations
162350,Great St Helen Hotel, Felt a bit awkward walking into the main reception The staff didn t seem the most welcoming and it all felt a bit uncomfortable checking in walking through reception each time we left returned to the premises Probably didn t help that it was small and very quiet didn t see any other guests there and there was one member of staff sat at reception in silence with no music or background noise They also didn t explain that we needed to put the key in the slot on the wall to be able to use the electric until I went back down to reception to ask why the electrics wouldn t work Shower leaked onto the floor when used Room was insanely hot all night kept turning the aircon on but the temperature seemed to keep climbing after a certain period of time Overall it was decent enough just not the most comfortable of hotel stays I ve had nor worth the price I paid though it was booked on shiort notice , Room was pleasant enough and we appreciated the free treats that were in our room 
162351,Great St Helen Hotel,No Negative, Location is great The rooms although small we re spotlessly clean and very modern Tea coffee biscuits snacks and water all included Great little one night stop over 
162352,Great St Helen Hotel, A less than 4 square meters room under ground level 1 In a civil european country the authority wouldn t allow am hotel to work like that and here we are in the City of London and then show four stars Shame Shame Shame The vote is zero the worst I never experienced using booking,No Positive
162353,Great St Helen Hotel, Can t think of anything , The location of this hotel was perfect for my office The room wasn t huge but was very comfortable with every extra you could need toiletries fluffy towels and an excellent hospitality tray 
162354,Great St Helen Hotel, I have never paid so much and received so little The reception staff at check in were VERY rude I had a problem with the shower and got blamed for mis using it The rooms are tiny stuffy and very warm This place is a disgusting rip off Do NOT stay here unless you are really desperate , The Location is perfect 
162355,Great St Helen Hotel, for a 4 star hotel it was really lacking in a lot of amenities also there are extremely loud building works going on outside the hotel and with a 10 30 am check out it s impossible to get any sleep there the shower was also terrible, staff were very friendly
162356,Great St Helen Hotel, Building works going on right outside the hotel and I could hear people chatting away every night when I was trying to get to sleep A little concerned that the wall socket next to the bed in the room was not held in properly and came away from the wall though as you removed the plug see photo , It was within walking distance of the offices I was visiting
162357,Great St Helen Hotel, The staff processed payments incorrectly and responded poorly when challenged They did not seem to understand that taking a payment in addition to blocking funds through pre authorisation was fundamentally the wrong thing to do and could cause hardship to guests In this case banks cannot be blamed for transactions initiated by hotel staff who blindly hid behind process and the banking system not considering that it could have been their fault Having stayed in London week in week out over the last three years and hotels for decades this is the first time I have come across a hotel that has handled situations to poorly with little empathy and indeed with some aggression when challenged They need training Although the rooms were fitted out well everything was far too small For example even the wardrobe which couldn t fit a handkerchief hanging up let alone a jacket or shirt was big enough The shower room was inadequate ,No Positive
162358,Great St Helen Hotel, I had asked for a quiet room and there was no mention of the building site literally on the doorstep The room was pokey and dark and straight off the reception area I had 4 shampoo miniatures but no conditioner or other standard tolieteries, location v handy for office
162359,Great St Helen Hotel, Room was tiny OK for 1 night but with a double bed and just a narrow walkway alongside with fold down table compact is an understatement, Location is excellent right in the city next door to the Gherkin Rooms were clean and modern with high quality fittings Free tea and coffee and even free water and snacks in the minibar 
162360,Great St Helen Hotel, Our door lock did not function Repaired by Saturday evening when we returned to our room Disappointed with noise from adjacent building site including Sunday morning, Location and facilities
162361,Great St Helen Hotel, small room no restaurant but free snacks in the room, location was ideal shower was perfect bed was comfortable nice little hotel would stay again 
162362,Great St Helen Hotel, Temperature was too high A C control didn t seem to have enough authority hence left window wide open Luckily for a city location it s in a quiet back street so this wasn t an issue, Comfortable bed neatly designed room to make best use of limited space
162363,Great St Helen Hotel, The construction of the sky scraper opposite , It was clean and perfectly adequate for a one night stay for business Good value for the money considering how expensive London is 
162364,Great St Helen Hotel, No breakfast facility The bathroom shower was set up as a wet room and flooded The bathroom hand basin was tiny like the type in a small toilet Thus nowhere to place your toiletries Soundproofing against continuous construction work in the street was poor I Would not recommend this hotel to anyone , The room was clean
162365,Great St Helen Hotel, The rooms were a bit too tiny My bed was not made up correctly thin sheet placed over a bare mattress not very hygienic also no staff available to correct matters, Convenient location
162366,Great St Helen Hotel, groundfloor room between internal lift and busy street meant very little sleep If you re offering a room on ground level the very least you should do is soundproof the windows Also woke up to smell of cigarette smoke chatter of people smoking right outside the window , Good location and facilities
162367,Great St Helen Hotel, We were not informed that there was a huge noisy building site next door The photos of the hotel or information on website did not indicate how cramped the rooms would be The receptionist during the day was very efficient helpful and polite the night staff were not , I found the bed very hard but the room had everything we needed for an convenient overnight stay and we were only 4 mins walk away from the dinner at Merchant Taylors Hall which we there to attend Very clean nice linen Good value hotel 
162368,Great St Helen Hotel, Fittings starting to look a bit worn Couldn t turn air conditioning down to below 16 degrees which given how hot it was and how dark and compact the room was wasn t really low enough , Clean not too expensive excellent location friendly staff 
162369,Great St Helen Hotel, The room originally allocated to us appears to have had a plumbing problem and we were notified the afternoon prior to arrival We were attending a weeding in Central London with an overnight stay and at that late juncture had no option but to accept a small double bed in a single room We negotiated a slight reduction in the room charge but when asked why us we were told that we were the only people staying for one night and so we were seen as easier for the hotel to change our room Not altogether satisfactory for us but there was nothing we could do about it ,No Positive
162370,Great St Helen Hotel,No Negative, This is an amazing small hotel in an excellent location in the City The rooms are very well laid out and have a luxury feel to them despite their small dimensions Aircon is always welcome in a city hotel and the one in my room was effective and not too noisy George Clarke Amazing Spaces on TV would be proud of the innovative layout and attention to detail I would definitely stay here again 
162371,Great St Helen Hotel, The room was much smaller than I expected and therefore storage space was virtually non existent This would not put me off staying there again , The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean which is always top of my list with clean towels every day Friendly staff and excellent location for all transport 
162372,Great St Helen Hotel, Had to change rooms as shower would continually flood when running It was supposedly repaired but would still occur Rooms were very small even by Europe s standards Could only open suitcase on bed as there is not enough room on the floor, Easy access to the underground only a five minute walk Very easy to get around London
162373,Great St Helen Hotel, We booked a double room and what we got was a tiny and noisy 9m2 room with a 3 m2 bathroom on the basement level The bed was not a double bed but a 1 2m wide single bed We complained twice at the reception and asked to speak to the management The only answer from the receptionist was we don t have another room A compensation was asked for but not granted not even an apology Never again ,No Positive
162374,Great St Helen Hotel, Tiniest room I ve ever seen website was telling 19m2 it was around 10m2 with the bathroom Wifi is quite slow and the guys at the reception not really welcoming people, Good comfort good location and well equipped
162375,Great St Helen Hotel, Everything is quite small but again enough room for a weekend break or some work days No breakfast but lots of shops around Staff was professional but could be a bit more attentive Nothing to really worry about but would make this even more cozy if dealt with , All you need for a city break and more than central New ish furniture super clean and cozy Perfect showers Also given the location silent enough for a good night of sleep Also free of charge some water nibbles and coffee in the room

162413,Great St Helen Hotel, room too small no laundry no food no restaurants nothing I do object to this place being dressed up as 4 star how it be when you only get a basic room , locaton is good Free mini bar good price is good
162414,Great St Helen Hotel, The shower floor had been fixed together with black gaffer tape The room was maybe a little too cosy But most of all there is a big construction site right opposite the hotel maybe 10 metres this was not mentioned anywhere and when the work started at 7 30am also not appreciated I feel potential guests should be made aware of this before making a reservation as I would have definitely reconsidered my booking , The location of the hotel was perfect for what i required The room was exactly what you needed no more no less 
162415,Great St Helen Hotel, It was very noisy when checking in builders drilling digging across the pathway from my ground floor room window Noisy building work woke me up the following morning No breakfast facilities Wet room shower wasn t working properly water covered the bathroom floor near running into bathroom Male member of staff didn t seem pleased to see me at all , Fridge in room

162421,Great St Helen Hotel, The whole 5 days there was a cigarette smell in the bathroom Not sure where it was coming from Probably something wrong with ventilation , the location it was just across the street from my office building The room was clean Shower etc was new and with thermostat Was a bit worried about the construction sound mentioned in other reviews but my room had an extra glass added in addition to the old style single glazed window So it was ok I had a double room and it was just about the right size for me alone I imagine that a single room could be rather tiny

162427,Great St Helen Hotel, Some more information in the room on how to work the air con heater and since there are no dining facilities a list of local take away restaurants would have been helpful, The location When travelling for business purposes this hotel is ideally situated a 10 minute walk from the office

162434,Great St Helen Hotel, The bathroom is very bijou smart but bijou Not ideal for a larger occupant I would imagine , The hotel was ideally situated for where I was working The hotel underwent a refurbishment in June 2015 so was all very smart and new feeling with tasteful decoration and furniture The staff were friendly I will definitely use this hotel again 
162435,Great St Helen Hotel, Employee at the front desk friendly but somewhat helpful I was staying at the 1 which was not pleasant Room cleaned apparently but the carpet of the room should be a better clean Old aspect used and not clean , location
162436,Great St Helen Hotel, Hotel would be fine for one or two nights max but not ideal for longer stays or for people who suffer from claustrophobia because room very small No real wardrobe or cupboard space not enough space to hang shirts I had to climb over bed to close curtains , Staff friendly and helpful

162440,Great St Helen Hotel, Room is quite small Same for the bathroom it was impossible not to get the floor wet while washing having a shower, Central location in the heart of the City at walking distance from many hot spots and close to Liverpool st station many other tube stations Building and room very well refurbished Snacks and drinks provided to cater for breakfast included in the price of the room
162441,Great St Helen Hotel, I had no complaints at all There is only one point and that is that the ground floor rooms should be double glazed as there was considerable noise from outside This didn t cause me too many problems but it is worthy of note Another thing is that the hotel website refers to complimentary breakfast while Booking com says no breakfast The breakfast that the hotel refers to is the fridge with snacks such as cereal bars and blueberry muffins Alongside the tea and coffee tray this works for me but perhaps the website could be clearer , The location cannot be beaten right in the City opposite the junction of Bishopsgate and Threadneedle The reception staff were friendly and helpful and I could leave my case in storage the next day until it was time to go home The shower was fantastic I had a ground floor wheelchair accessible room I didn t need one and the wet room shower had a choice of overhead drench and hand held power shower Lovely toiletries Nice linen and bed The curtains did a great blackout job The fridge bottled water and snacks were a great touch 
162442,Great St Helen Hotel, The room was very small and so was the bathroom and toilet Had difficulty trying to use the safe and gave up eventually No bar or restaurant , The location was great and just what I wanted The staff girl on reception was very helpful and polite Very clean and tidy 
162443,Great St Helen Hotel, The room was very small which was fine for me on my own for one night but it would have been tricky for 2 people especially 2 girls getting ready for a night out , The location for me was excellent since it was only 150m from my office but also nice and near to most city venues ie near Liverpool Street Bank Monument All very clean new nicely furnished decorated Snacks small bottles of water left in the room 
162444,Great St Helen Hotel, We were sold the deal on Booking com as Breakfast included but on arrival were told that the hotel did not provide food The room was also very small and the staff not very helpful There was no coffee in the room only tea but when we asked for coffee we were provided with more tea not coffee We were able to leave our suitcases when we arrived before check in time but these were left in reception in full view and there was no security , Good location 
162445,Great St Helen Hotel, My double room was ridiculously small I had read the rooms were small so had thankfully paid extra for a double on arrival There was NO cupboard space not even to hang a coat or dress only a small space for a few shirts Nowhere to put luggage so was tripping over bags in the tiny space Impossible to imagine two people having to share this room The bathroom was also very snug and smelt of cat pee The shower doesn t drain properly and therefore floods The towels were small rough and not good quality no excuse for this and easy to remedy Bed was hard and tv reception came and went Am really surprised that Booking Com had given this hotel 4plus stars Would really not recommend Not good value for money , Convenient for Liverpool Street Station and fairly quiet Friendly helpful receptionist 
162446,Great St Helen Hotel, The wind set off the fire alarm several times in the night There was no hot water a cold shower after a much disturbed night Bed took up 90percent of the room, It was clean The bed was comfortable

162448,Great St Helen Hotel, We booked this hotel price included breakfast But the hotel has no facilities for food at all We understand this is the fault of the booking company Our lovely room being in the front was very noisy mostly all night traffic and late night revellers , Nice modern and clean room

162450,Great St Helen Hotel, Staff had little local knowledge bathroom could have done with more cleaning Bed was small Wardrobe hanging space only 1 2 height , Central Location clean room 
162451,Great St Helen Hotel, The single room was very small and extremely hot making sleeping difficult I had to change my booking on a non refundable rate and whilst allowing me to change to another date I was charged 50 more despite my reason for change was an unexpected hospital appointment for my wife s cancer seemed mean to me Allowing the date change at the same rate was all I was asking , Location was fine
162452,Great St Helen Hotel, We booked this hotel because it quite clearly said breakfast was included which it was not we would not have booked at that price for room only ous sink was dirty , lady on reception was friendly and helpful
162453,Great St Helen Hotel, Sold as including breakfast no breakfast supplied Also booking com refused to give any type of refund and accidentally sent me a copy of an email intended for the hotel asking them to change their advertisement The room was for two people and was a box room where you couldn t even walk around the beds The room was below grond onto the main street The place was dirty ,No Positive
162454,Great St Helen Hotel, The room was really small with no window just for sleeping I assume though that that s what you get for such price in the center of London , Convinient location close to the city center and not far from several subway stations Room is stylish and is good equiped There was even european electrical socet 
162455,Great St Helen Hotel, This brand new hotel according to the taxi drivers offers no facilities beyond WiFi and rudimentary coffee makings There are no catering facilities and the room bar is an empty fridge That in itself gave me a sense of unease in that the fridge wardrobe and snacks such as they are are packed into a very compact space which is enclosed by a single door The result is that there is a very distinct FIRE RISK The fridge heats everything It is an accident waiting to happen There is a residual issue with the fridge heat in that the snacks are always warm raising the possibility of bacterial decay and that that means , The bed was comfortable and the shower good Cleanliness was absolutely not a problem 
162456,Great St Helen Hotel, Really essential hotel tiny tiny room on ground floor on very noisy Street even tinier bathroom No space to move around the bed no space to move and dry yourself in the bathroom no space to sit and work except on the bed Wardrobe half occupied by fridge no space to hang long clothes No breakfast available , Position of the hotel 5 min walk from Liverpool Station Cheaper than most hotels in the area Wifi works well at no additional cost

162458,Great St Helen Hotel, My room was very small , Very comfortable bed and clean throughout The person on reception when I arrived was very friendly Great convenient location 
162459,Great St Helen Hotel, Room and bathroom was far too small had to think before moving otherwise bumped into walls or husband One large step into bathroom and you were in the shower , Friendly reception staff very clean well presented accommodation Coffee tea and snacks in room Location was good for City if London
162460,Great St Helen Hotel, Surly receptionist when I checked in Smallest hotel room I have ever stopped in Literally 8 inches round the side of the bed all round No room for a table or anywhere to put my luggage There was only two foot height in the cupboard for hanging clothes so I couldn t even hang my jacket or trousers up Shower room was ridiculously tiny couldn t properly sit on the toilet it was so narrow My colleagues and I were hoping this would be the new place for us to stop given its proximity to the office However I couldn t recommend it to anyone other than as a last minute booking if you get it cheap There is much better out there , It was less than 1 minute walk from my office It was decorated well 
162461,Great St Helen Hotel, The single room was super small the bed was basically the room size Also there was limited possibilities to hang off clothes I would only recommend the hotel for short term trips , Perfect Location when you are working in or around the Gherkin The room was modern and clean very good bed as well 
162462,Great St Helen Hotel, there is nothing like service breakfast etc My room was too warm and small and in a morning my hot water didn t work, Hotel is so close to city center and there is 7 24 receptionist
162463,Great St Helen Hotel, No breakfast supplied and only snacks in the room Room was very small but adequate for short stay and sleeping Could not hang suit or shirt in wardrobe due to shelving in there , Quiet clean location good wifi worked well
162464,Great St Helen Hotel, Smallest hotel room I have ever been The room was so small that it had a custom build in bed that was too small for a grown man to sleep in I am 1 86 meters and that was too tall to sleep in this bed Impossible to make the room dark Don t expect to get any rest in this hotel , Location is good
162465,Great St Helen Hotel, A room with a single bed and a desk was booked I was given a room with a double bed that took up 75 of the space permitting only a tiny fold out desk Very cramped , Staff and cleanliness
162466,Great St Helen Hotel, No breakfast available but plenty of options nearby Rooms small but very comfortable and great bathroom , New hotel in a very central location Handy for the Trains and Local attractions Friendly staff and no hassles 
162467,Great St Helen Hotel, No bad experience but room is small would be more difficult with two people in the room as would be cramped Bed only accessible from one side Providing you don t want to spend too much time in the room and don t have much luggage it s fine , Ideally located clean and simply furnished very minimal and modern Great shower Good price 
162468,Great St Helen Hotel,No Negative, Friendly helpful staff you need anything at all just let us know I asked directions for a location and without asking them they printed off a map of the location Room small but beautifully appointed clean and spotless I ve stayed in 5star hotels not up to the same standard Porter gave us extra tea and coffee without hesitation Great location for our needs Will definitely stay again in spite of them double charging me for the original booking quickly rectified I may add All in all a great experience and we are staying again next Thursday we cant wait

162470,Great St Helen Hotel, No breakfast, Small rooms but well equipped and very clean Friendly staff great value for the money Will definately book here again great Base hotel for the sights and approx 10 mins walk to tower bridge 
162471,Great St Helen Hotel, Our stay was terrible When we just arrived at the hotel the receptionist received us with such an I don t care attitude that we started to suspect She assigned us to a ground floor room and without asking or letting us know she sent us to a room with private bathroom WITH NO WC DOOR You can imagine how embarrassing that can be when you use the toilet When we realized about this obviously we asked why was that and she told us that this was the only double room available in the property On the next day she offered to switch us to a different room with a double bed so she lied about the only room with double bed in the property The other room was extremely small and in front of the bathroom door there was a dark 25 cm sticky stain in the carpet We didn t realize that it was a vomit stain until the last day unfortunately We stayed for some nights and every night when we returned to the room it was a disguisting smell We thought it was something related to the toilet given that it s an old building but unfortunately we slept and lived with that smell But that s not all the night before to the last night we heard something like a dripping water sound late in the night When we turned on the lights we saw that it was a huge amount of water falling from the upper floor maybe from a pipe over the suspended ceiling over our toilet I dressed up and went to the reception immediately to ask for help to the receptionist The answer he gave me was It s too late in the night there s no one I can call to help us please go up and tell me how much time it takes to the water to stop I asked So you were aware of that problem previously right He didn t answer As you can imagine our stay was a nightmare The morning when we left the hotel we complained about the leaking and the vomit smell and obviously asked for a compensation , Unfortunately we didn t like any features of the hotel The only positive aspect would be the location but that s not positive either due to the fact that the hotel is in front of a construction site ant the workers start at 7am 
162472,Great St Helen Hotel, Rooms are extremely compact but if you look at the pictures you could have seen that , Just a stone throw from Liverpool Str Station Modern room with a wonderful rain shower 
162473,Great St Helen Hotel, Unprofessional staff poorly trained and unable to help with simple questions e g where is the next ATM to the hotel Additionally the receptionist s English was pretty bad I had to write down everything I said because she wouldn t understand me I m not saying she wasn t behaving well but the staff definitely needs better training the management should work on that The room was ok although I have never seen such a tiny hotel room in my entire life impossible for more than one single person And there is no proper closet ,No Positive
162474,Great St Helen Hotel, Small just enough room to walk around the bed and a small desk Shower and toilet just enough room I was in the basement with windows leading to the street Single glass so you could hear a lot but it was a quiet road I had not trouble sleeping through it but if you are sensitive , Clean good bed and shower Free WiFi reasonable bandwidth enough to stream video Free minibar without a fridge but water and some nuts bars and muffins 
162475,Great St Helen Hotel, Very tiny rooms Not particulary clean hairs in towels and room smelled Nearly impossible to work in the room due to its size, Very central business centrum of London and close to tube station
162476,Great St Helen Hotel, Small room but sufficient for a short stay No breakfast Not cheap but Not untypical of a good hotel in London , Good location Modern facilities Helpful pleasant staff Quiet and comfortable Air con 
162477,Great St Helen Hotel, Room was tiny although very well designed to maximize the space and was fine for one person Whilst it was a double bed I can only assume I stayed in a single room to be fair to the hotel I didn t book the room so I don t know how it was advertised It would not have been suitable for two people to share due to lack of space The bed was built in with one side up against a wall Bathroom window overlooked by offices in courtyard and should ideally have been frosted glass blinds for privacy , Excellent location ideal for one night on a business trip 
162478,Great St Helen Hotel, No window in the room except the tiny one in the toilet There is no air at all unless you have the air condition always on Wifi is possible to use only on a single device If you connected your smartphone the code does not work any more when you try to connect your laptop Even if the phone is disconnected at the time The only place to keep you stuff is under the bed No shelfs , It is really conveniently located There was a fridge and coffee tea facilities in the room Shower and TV were new and good Bed was comfortable 
162479,Great St Helen Hotel, Our room was located downstairs in front of the reception where the shower cabin doesnt have any edge so when we started having a shower in few seconds the whole bathroom was inundated by the water There was a mop kind tool but unfortunately didnt help much so after that we couldnt reach the toilet without street shoes and there was NO door on the toilet Beside the bathroom problem we were satisfied with the hotel especially with the location , The Hotel is very good located near to Liverpool station We liked the bed as well it was comfortable The WIFI was good 
162480,Great St Helen Hotel, Small hand basin in the bathroom Because of the location in combination with sub optimal noise isolation single glass pretty noisy due to street noise Fascilities limited no pool gym breakfast etc , Located in the centre business district close to the Liverpool and Bank underground Spacious room new clean Small hotel 24 hour open friendly staff relatively new refurbished
162481,Great St Helen Hotel, Room very warm and the A C would not stay on A bed the size of the room is quaint with a small single narrow aisle to get on the bed makes it OK for a night but not for a real longer stay , Location very good in the city of London
162482,Great St Helen Hotel, The room was too small and very warm I tried to adjust the air con but it still too warm I got disturbed on 2 or 3 occasions close to midnight by what I thought was a member of staff who tried to open my door and then knocked on to ask if my phone was working , Location was great
162483,Great St Helen Hotel, The single bed room is too small to contain a king sized bed the bed is very comfortable but too big to leave you a space to move inside a room The TV is almost not useful, The staff were very friendly and supportive especially Victoria she was really helpful and supportive The location is close to most of the main touristic locations in central London in addition to the main underground stops There lack of breakfast option is not a big issue as the hotel is in close proximity to many reasonably priced restaurants and supermarkets
162484,Great St Helen Hotel, The room we got was right next to the reception and near a busy road so didn t feel very private The room although advertised and charged for as a double was far too small for two people There was no room to walk about the bed was stood against the wall with a window on one side otherwise it wouldn t fit in It feels like an old building was turned into a modern hotel trying to squeeze in as many rooms as possible to make money compromising on the size and the service since there is no breakfast available It is by no means a bad hotel but I feel we were charged for its location rather than for what we got , The bathroom was nicely done with a lovely shower The location is fantastic with some nice places to eat like a 24 hour cafe nearby which we utilised a few times for pancake breakfast 
162485,Great St Helen Hotel, The room was to small for 2 people The bathroom was tiny too elbows touching the walls whilst showering The location can be a bit noisy Wi fi wasn t the best stops working in between No breakfast available DO NOT BOOK IF YOU LOOK FOR SOMETHING BIGGER we would not return , The Staff was friendly Location was great Good air conditioning 
162486,Great St Helen Hotel, Cleaning staff walked into my room which was okay but then about 15 minutes later they came back and asked me if I could be out of the room within 5 6 minutes I think that was a bit pushy considering I was still within time of vacating the room , Location was outstanding Room was comfortable and suited the purpose of my trip Very clean and comfortable Would definitely stay again 
162487,Great St Helen Hotel, This is a new hotel which has only been open a couple of months the equipment is all new but my biggest gripe about this place was the size of the room it was tiny you would have trouble swinging a cat in it it s reputation was saved by the quality of its staff, The friendly staff
162488,Great St Helen Hotel,No Negative, An amazing location close to Liverpool Street Station and the iconic modern buildings of The City The period exterior of the hotel sits well among the redeveloped sites and hides a thoroughly modern interior The room was compact but very comfortable and spotlessly clean Attention to detail was excellent Also great value 
162489,Great St Helen Hotel, There was nothing to dislike , Everything was great the ease of access from reception to the room the service generally the comfort and certainly the location Deserves a high rating 
162490,Great St Helen Hotel, Would like hairdryer on the spec but not in the room Usual price is a little high given size of room and features but on special late booking is good value, Loved location Liked cleanliness and decor Happy with small room
162491,Great St Helen Hotel, Room incredibly small I actually burst out laughing after I had entered the room it was that small Bathroom basin was so small it was almost impossible to use More water went out of the basin than into it , Nicely renovated rooms Clean and tidy
162492,Great St Helen Hotel, Double room Tiny room lacking desk chair fireplace clothes storage all as advertised in the room description Had to pile luggage up in front of door thereby blocking exit in fire or other emergency Told management not interested Asked for change of room none available Asked for refund and move to a safer hotel refused by manager who did not even come to inspect the room Room smelt of damp as shower had obviously been leaking for some time and carpet was stained and saturated Raised issues again on check out no apology not interested again Avoid , Good location
162493,Great St Helen Hotel, Air conditioning kept going off woke up in a sweat After complaining several times took it upon myself to correct the settings Put in a call for 3 20 am woke up at 3 15 was never called When I went to the lobby the guy was asleep Could have missed plane , t was clean and looked good 
162494,Great St Helen Hotel, Small room bed small basement room with no double glazing no bin in room, Nicely furnished clean great shower nice touches like cereal bars and bags of nuts 
162495,Great St Helen Hotel, Firstly I requested an upper floor but on arrival was given a basement room The receptionist did offer another room and also suggested that next time we got in touch direct However that s why we used booking com and I feel this is a poor service by them as it is the second time it has happened in as many months After viewing the basement and noise level we took the offer of a different room In this room we were met with a very stale damp smell and an horrifically big brown damp patch outside the bathroom The hairdryer didn t work although the receptionist did provide us with a temporary one In the morning I awoke to a dripping noise in the toilet For several minutes I though it was the toilet itself however on further investigation I found the water to be dripping through the light fitting from the shower room above I informed the receptionist and we were again provided with another room This is all said with the added attraction of being a 6ft couple in the smallest rooms i have ever been in and to top it the hotel is presently in the middle of a building site , The receptionists were apologetic 
162496,Great St Helen Hotel, I am disappointed the reception desk person was not able to issue a proper invoice due to system settings , Location is very convenient Decent value for money
