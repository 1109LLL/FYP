211869,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Air conditioning in Room 10 made an odd noise throughout the night which disturbed my sleep The room safe was in the locked position and we weren t able to use it despite mentioning it during our stay We arrived ahead of check in and we re told we could leave our bags by reception and they would be taken to our room once it was ready When we returned someone else s bag was in our room and ours still by reception There were some cracked tiles in the bathroom and some mould in the shower whilst the shower was a bit temperamental It just felt as though it needed a bit of a spruce up We didn t have breakfast here preferring to eat out , The room was quiet and the bed comfortable The hotel is very well located for the Albert Hall 
211870,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The room was underground with no view even though it was only a 1 night stay, The room was clean water pressure an temprature in the bathroom was good Wifi was quick and location was excellent
211871,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Bathroom very small steep stairs lift only went to second floor and we were on top floor , Very comfy bed and linen helpful friendly reception staff looked after our luggage as we were early 
211872,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, No complaints at all It was exceptional , One of the best hotels we stayed in on our trip Luxuriously furnished VERY QUIET air conditioned in a great street close to the Victoria and Albert Museum Science Museum Natural History Museum easy walk to Harrods and Kensington Gardens The staff were great and responded to every request in a positive and professional manner It was a great London experience 
211873,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel,No Negative, The rooms are quite big and spacious for London we even had a balcony The internet is also working fast The location of the hotel is great just 2 minutes walk away from Kensington Gardens and Gloucester Road tube station This hotel is definitely great value for money 
211874,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Lift only went to second floor and we were on the 4th, The staff were friendly and pleasant Bed really comfortable very clean great location good value for money We would definitely choose this hotel again if travelling to this location 
211875,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Didn t feel like a Hotel staff were lovely but 172 for overnight stay no breakfast just felt it didn t have any qualities I would want to book again or recommend such a shame , Lovely property but room on the forth floor no lift staff didn t offer to help with bags Bit of a shame very clean but no Hotel qualities 
211876,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Although the main parts of the bedroom thankfully were very clean the light switches and plugs were a bit old and grubby not what I would expect at that price with a 4star rating , Very comfy bed 
211877,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The tap in the bathrooms did not work correctly The lift only goes to floor 2 As our rooms were on floor 4 one had to climb 4 more staircases with luggage Just be aware for this No help w carrying one s luggage to the room or from the room at check out At the breakfast on Sunday morning the plain yoghurt was finished , People were friendly 
211878,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Like a lot of London Hotels there isn t any parking We got a great parking rate using Just Park and it turned out to be only 5 minute walk away , Very close to Royal Albert Hall for our visit and also for our afternoon in the Natural History Museum which was just across the road Hyde Park is only a short walk 
211879,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, This hotel is only Boutique in name it is NOT a boutique hotel Just a reasonably decorated hotel in a large house Lift only serves first 2 floors If I was disabled in any way I would not want to stay here Wifi limited to one device at a time No restaurant just breakfast which was basic , Location is good and was quiet Everything worked Staff were pleasant It had airco 
211880,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, My search in booking com was for breakfast included but when I got to the hotel the booking was room only Check the offers , Very friendly and helpful staff comfy good sized room although bathroom was small Air con wasn t working efficient when I was there but room was cool enough
211881,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Great location for our visit to the a Royal Albert Hall also Science Museum and Natural History Museum directly opposite if we d had the time to visit Pleasantly surprised to gave a ground floor room with French doors and a small terrace 
211882,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Had a single room which was unbelievably cramped not enough room to open my suitcase unless put it on bed incredibly claustrophobic as window opened on to brick wall For 150 pounds excluding breakfast thought could have been better , location was excellent for Kennsington palace and gardens Staff very helpful and bed comfortable 
211883,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel,No Negative, The staff were outstanding We had an overnight flight so were very early and tired to say the least when we arrived They had the room ready for us within the hour just time to grab a quick coffee at least 4 hours earlier than expected check in time and were so friendly and helpful regarding details of the surrounding area I would highly recommend this hotel for staff cleanliness location and price 
211884,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, the only drawback was that the lift only went up two floors and we were staying on the fourth floor so had to walk up the other two flights of stairs I ve recently had a knee op so found it a little difficult but other than that it was a nice hotel and would use again, All in all it was a very nice clean hotel
211885,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Elevator to 2nd floor only There were 25 steps down and up a very narrow staircase Terrible for a mid 70 s guy with a bad back This info needs to be available before booking I would not have booked this hotel if I had known this beforehand We had some help when we left but a very small female receptionist only on arrival , Bathroom OK Bedroom small but OK Tube station fairly close Also nice pub and a very nice Lebanese restaurant
211886,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Breakfast is continental which was fine with me I would have liked some fresh cut fruit though , Excellent location I was going to a concert at The Albert Hall Took the oppportunity of visiting The Natural History Museum the entrance just across the road Bathroom towels and bed linen all good quality Good shower very powerful 
211887,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The room was a little small for fine for a couple of nights Wasn t keen on the coffee at breakfast but I am quite fussy , The location was perfect for us as we were going to a show at the Royal Albert Hall just a few minutes walk away The staff were pleasant and friendly like the fact there was a bar we could use all night if we wished The air con worked fine and bed was comfortable 
211888,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The hotel is in desperate need of a complete refurbishment Rarely warm in London but we scored a very warm week A C didn t work in 2 rooms we were in several rooms have nothing more than light wells for windows beds were average and small , the staff are great
211889,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The lift only goes to the 2nd floor so if your room is on the 3rd or 4th you have to walk up fairly steep narrow stairs The staff will carry your bags up and down which is helpful We had a heat wave in London and the air conditioing on the 4th floor worked well ,No Positive
211890,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Bath is slippy no handles and no mat How do you get away with no break blind cords we can t in our property , Service with a genuine smile Really decent continental selection
211891,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The rooms are shabby with wall paint peeling off rotten wood door frames and the bathroom could use a good cleaning and updating , The close proximity to Knightsbridge
211892,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Decoration of our room, Friendly staff though our room was a little tired but still comfortable and clean The coffee machine was on the blink but room service made us drinks with no extra charge 
211893,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The elevator only goes to 2nd floor and we had to carry bags and walk up to the third floor Somewhat expensive for a small room , Comfortable bed nice breakfast Friendly and helpful staff Great location 
211894,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Pillows not comfortable , Great shower Spacious room Very close to a lot of site seeing places and the tube Lots of eateries in the area Easy to get to and from Calm room 
211895,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, everything was great about hotel and staff unfortunately we had some noisy young men in room next to us and they kept us awake most of the night till early hours of the morning This wasnt the hotels fault just inconsiderate young men as guests, very comfy bed and room was perfect temperature and easy to get to using the lift
211896,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Lacking a few basics evening no Ice available for drinks who has a G T without ice and the next morning they ran out of some basic breakfast items we were 2 of 10 customers at the time so need to forward plan a little better to meet their 4 Star rating , Lovely old building with friendly staff and in a great location 
211897,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Room 18 was a very small room next to the lift at the back of the hotel overlooking a flat roof Just enough room to walk round the bed Luckily we didnt spend much time in the room, Location excellent in walking distance of both Gloucester Rd and South Kensington tube stations restaurants and Kensington Palace Clean rooms with safe and toiletries Continental breakfast was varied with croissants pastries toast cereals fresh fruit cheese and ham Tea or coffee offered and orange juice at hand 
211898,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, We were given a tiny room on the ground floor next to the reception and kitchen The staff hardly spoke and breakfast was dreadful , The beds were comfy and it was clean
211899,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Seemed a bit old and need of a bit of a spruce up Check in was not the friendliest but the guy at the checkout was great , Large room comfy pillows powerful shower Proper coffee machine 
211900,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The toiletries weren t new they had been refilled and had obviously been used before The wallpaper was peeling off the corner of the room room 6 and it was chilly , Excellent location and friendly staff
211901,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Small room quite dark and no outlook It had the feel of a b and b rather than a boutique hotel , Very good location and close to the tube station Beds quite comfortable 
211902,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, No elevator to the top floor but not a big problem Must learn to travel lighter , The location and amenities were perfect for my needs and time The fact that the underground Picadilly line that takes you to Heathrow in approximately 30 minutes is just around the corner was so convenient The rooms were very comfortable and quiet Lovely experience for me 
211903,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, They adevertiaed the bar being open 24 hrs on returning at 12am to the hotel we were going to have another drink only to be told by the rude only 1 member staff member that the bar was shut and didn t even offer to sell us a drink to take to the room , The decor and the bed was comfortable and the shower was decent 
211904,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Hotel advertised as a 24hr bar that was not the case Told bar was closed when we arrived back around 1am on NYE Not impressed especially on an evening where people are generally celebrating , Great location and the rooms were clean and well presented The bed was huge And very comfortable Majority of the staff were very polite and helpful especially the guy who did his best to find us some safety pins 
211905,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Needs modernising few facilities pleasant enough location in best factor of the place, The place is ok six out of ten good location ok state of place room a bit crumby
211906,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Wifi did not work on arrival though was available next morning No elevator above 2nd floor had to carry luggage for 2 floors to 4th, Nice comfortable room location View
211907,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, I stayed here a few years ago when it had just opened You can definitely see it has aged a bit and could do with a fresh coat of paint here or there Also the breakfast was a little basic the day we were there and certainly not as good as I remembered You need to know the lift only goes to the second floor out of four and that some rooms are in the quite somber basement , Friendly small hotel convenient for visiting London Royal Albert Hall and museums close by Decent sized rooms for London and comfortable bedding Staff are very friendly and helpful 
211908,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, I had to send credit card information via insecure connection email in order to confirm that I was actually the holder of the card for so called security reasons I recommend using PayPal for booking instead , Right next to Natural History Museum also that Underground exit is the closest to the hotel itself Staff is extremely helpful checking in printing of boarding pass etc Close to good restaurants and Hyde Park 
211909,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, No shaving mirror and cheap toilet paper could be used as sand paper , Great location ideal for Hyde Park and Royal Albert Hall Room 1 is good sized but in basement with no views 
211910,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, We chose to have breakfast elsewhere as there were no cooked options Zak s by Gloucester Road station was really nice , Excellent location Also we loved the quiet room 
211911,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, bed super small and soft and right in front of the door so you have all the sounds and the light coming through heating was constantly being turned off i was freezing in the evening and asked the consierge to turn it on it took some hours though for the room to get warm in the morning it was freezing cold in the room again absolutely uncomfortable and a no go for a hotel , location is nice
211912,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, No to poor internet and mobile phone coverage where our room was We mentioned this to Staff whose response was that it should be ok , Location of hotel to tube station and attractions 
211913,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Nothing except it would have been good to have had breakfast included in the price , The location and the friendly staff who seemed to staff reception and help with the Continental breakfast which was good 
211914,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, TV by bed not tuned in to any channels Bit airless Chairs uncomfortable, Good power shower Comfy bed not hard like in many hotels Warm room Friendly staff Very helpful and considerate 
211915,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, They advertise free wifi but at check in I received a free wifi voucher which was valid for 5 days only and we had booked and stayed 6 nights They would have probably provided an extra voucher if I asked but it is a bit shortsighted on their part When booking we asked for a room above the street ground level but the room allocated to us was in fact on ground level and facing the back yard Although this was a slight disappointment the silver lining was that the room had a private veranda with a bench and a table and my wife and I actually spent many quiet moments there reminiscing on the day s sights and activities In the time we spent there we had breakfast only once as we mostly ate on foot through out town I felt that the options and food selections are slightly scanty and minimalistic but this seems normal for most small hotels and establishments I did not leave hungry though The complimentary coffee and tea in our room were not replenished daily which is a bit of a surprise because the way I see it if lodgers change daily the staff would have to refill these for the new guests Because of this and the wifi issue mentioned earlier and considering the price range of this hotel I could not help getting a tiny feeling of stinginess and parsimoniousness on part of the staff management but this is just a minor feeling perhaps not even worth writing about , The location is beautiful The entire area is surrounded by museums Both Hyde Park and the Royal Albert Hall are 2 3 minutes away just up the street The hotel is clean and the staff are helpful and very friendly Because the hotel is pretty small nestled in an old London house this makes it very quiet with a strong feeling of privacy compared to larger hotels Nothing in particular stands out to be praised The rooms are what one would expect Bedding is clean and soft the beds are comfortable 
211916,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, A little hot Air con in the bedroom so ok but bathroom very warm , We were going to the Royal Albert Hall This was an excellent hotel within east walking distance Also great for visiting the Science Museum and the V A Was excelent
211917,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Location of room used lift for 2 floors and then had to use stairs for 2 floors not good for 2 70 year olds Not enough choice for breakfast and food was indifferent , Proximity to the Albert Hall and tube Friendly and informative staff Quality of room 
211918,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Thoroughly enjoyed our stay Hotel was as depicted staff were helpful friendly Front desk manned 24hours Great location to museums tube buck palace etc For value for the Kensington Chelsea area highly recommended Would definitely stay here again Also room nice and quiet for a good nights sleep No traffic on road after about 10pm until morning 
211919,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Being on the top floor four flights of very steep stairs Unfortunately that s the downside of staying in a beautiful town house so close to everything , Lovely clean hotel Great location 
211920,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Television was a bit small and no information on what channels were available, Bathroom was spacious and shower really powerful Decor was contemporary and bed very comfortable
211921,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, It didn t bother us but those with mobility problems should be aware that the lift only goes as far as the second floor , Lovely quiet hotel ideally located for the museums and Royal Albert Hotel Very comfortable bed Great having fridge in room Complimentary water every day much appreciated 
211922,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Nothing really it was a really pleasant stay , I asked for a quiet room and they actually took note of this The room was super quiet It was also a decent size and the bathroom was big enough to fit into sometimes a challenge with London hotels The chap on reception was extremely helpful and they had taken delivery of a package for me which was fab 
211923,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Perhaps and extra mirror in the bedroom but this is a very minor groan , This hotel is in a superb location a short walk from the Royal Albert Hall the museums and the underground and buses The bedrooms and reception areas are tastefully decorated and spotlessly clean The bedroom and en suite bathroom were small but had everything you need including a brilliantly powerful shower 
211924,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, I don t think it is necessarily a four star or a boutique hotel even though it s nice and has reasonable facilities The room was quite small but that is usual for London A small minus for me was that the room was next to the elevator and you could hear it which is not necessarily the trait of a quiet room which I requested Fortunately it was not that loud , The staff was helpful nice and did their best to accommodate all our requests The room was very clean The location is good close to Royal Albert Hall Museums and 2 subway stations 
211925,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, the bathroom could have been a bit larger the breakfast was not worth the extra 9 , comfortable bed bar ideal location for royal albert hall quiet area friendly and helpful staff safety deposit box in room complimentary shower and washing creams 
211926,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The lift only goes to the second floor but the hike up the steps to our beautiful room on the third was worth it , We had a lovely room with a balcony in a beautiful townhouse It was a five minute walk to the Underground which is short or long depending on your point of view The staff was warm helpful and interesting The area had people out and felt safe while walking in the early evening 
211927,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Fixtures and fittings getting tired Shaver socket in bathroom was broken so no shave extractor fan in bathroom did not work making showering very steamy Bathroom and bedroom a bit small , Staff were friendly and helpful
211928,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Breakfast was a very poor offering particularly at the price point of the rooms Little choice no non dairy options Room 7 dim and dismal despite quality drapes and paper but pillows dreadful No seating in which to relax Bedside light inoperative and potentially dangerous No local room a c control, The location good shower good towels 
211929,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The lifts were limited to a couple of floors yet they did accommodate my request to givem me a room with lift access , The size of the room was like no other I ve stayed in in London 
211930,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Directly opposite west end of Natural History museum Short 5 minute walk into French quarter in South Kensington Short 5 minute walk into Kensington Gardens Short walk from tube walkway that leads to NHM Relatively quiet street at front in evening 
211931,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The USB connector in the room didn t work No instructions on how to use the safe It was jammed open The bed linen was old and very thin , The staff were helpful The room was adequate for our needs 
211932,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, We expected a bath tab in our room standard double according to the descriptions and photos on the site but it was actually only a shower , Very clean Staff are friendly 
211933,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, honestly nothing, great location for access to museums and tube station good choice of varied places to eat in walking distance friendly and helpful staff but not obtrusive
211934,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Room was amazingly small They air conditioner could not be set any lower than 16 but 16 was not the actually temperature of the room It hovered between 18 and 19 Also the staff kept turning off the air conditioner during the day so it was sweltering when we came back at night I would not agree that the hotel provided air conditioning in the rooms , Location was wonderful Staff were very nice Room was clean 
211935,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Some decoration in the room needs attention water damage wallpaper in one corner , Friendly helpful staff Good location and well served by public transport Nice bathroom 
211936,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The front desk person was extremely unprofessional and dishonest I Was charged on my credit card although I had paid cash and repeated several time I did not want to have my card charged I Was promised by him that it will be credited it back on my credit card but I just received my monthly bill with the amount on it I now have to follow it up with my bank and go through the nuisance of proving it all Very disappointing and unethical customer service ,No Positive
211937,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Stairs from 2nd floor very steep the wifi kicks you off every time you not using it , Very friendly staff great location rooms very comfortable and clean 
211938,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The breakfast was a bit disappointing Not much of a choice For the same price in another hotel we had an amazing ra ge of choices including fresh fruit salad freshly squeezed juices and a very generous fully cooked breakfast , The location of this Hotel was excellent beds were comfy the room was very quiet and the staff were very accommodating 
211939,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Very good locations close to the museums and shops in Kensington and just a few minutes away from Kensington Garden and Hyde Park very friendly staff
211940,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and helpful lovely hotel I have stayed there previously and the standards have stayed the same would have no issues in returning 
211941,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, All very satisfactory, Fourth time we have stayed here excellent for Royal Albert Hall and Museums Only a short walk from South Kensington and Gloucester Road Tube stations
211942,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, It was overpriced Regret it not looking for more options in the area for much less money Was a bit disappointed we asked to extend our check out for another 3 hours was given only 1 more Considering we stayed there for 9 nights it was the least they could since we were going to take a long haul flight in the evening , The location is excelent The staff was very helpfull Very clean rooms 
211943,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Room on the fourth floor and the lift only went to the 2nd floor Not really a problem for us but if you are not very mobile it s quite a lot of stairs The room was relatively modest in size large enough for overnight but not huge , Fantastic location Decent breakfast and friendly staff Good air conditioning which is not always the case in London Decent wi fi which allowed simultaneous connection of 4 devices increasingly important these days 
211944,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Quieter air conditioning, Comfy spacious bed Very quiet room with no significant traffic noise Very friendly and helpful staff A proper flat white with Breakfast 
211945,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, No restaurant and most eateries were a 15 minute walk away Pizzas will be delivered We liked the Scoff Banter just around the corner , Great location Very upmarket Most of the staff were pleasant and helpful Our room was comfortable and clean 
211946,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Room was 4 floor elevator only to second floor Narrow stairs for older guests , Easy access from Piccadilly line tube station South Kensington Museums and shopping possibilities nearby Reasonably priced Safe surroundings 
211947,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The room was tiny only room for a single bed and me, Location and style of accommodation Certainly boutique very clean room and a comfortable bed and bedding
211948,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The lift went no further than the 2nd floor The so called room service was limited to a certain time and all you could get was pizza s Why this hotel is 4 star is certainly not based on anything else but its location Not worth the cost of staying at this hotel ,No Positive
211949,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Not the best place if you don t like staircases There is an elevator though but you still need to be able to navigate steps But then that s just what all of London is like So not a deal breaker I couldn t figure out how to get cold water in my shower either but I suppose most people won t have a problem with that , Room was small but incredibly nice modern clean and cosy The location was great 6 minutes from the underground 10 from the Kensington gardens and quiet and pleasant at the same time Wifi works fine but the bit buzz service they use is not my favorite 
211950,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Air con was leaking right over the table used to place the suitcase so contents got wet Probably a one off incident though , Bed was very comfy location perfect for Albert hall History Science museums
211951,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The incredibly irritating clothes hangers , The air conditioning All free tea etc topped up daily and good to have bottled water Beautifully remade bed and used towels refolded 
211952,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, After 20 years I am still shocked to see what you get for your money in London This hotel is an excellent 2 to 3 star hotel with small rooms Everywhere else in Europe you would pay 70 Euros for the room , Well it is South Kensington close to Underground and Museums Personnel is nice and helpful
211953,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Was a very hot in room no need for towel rail to be on , Great location Lovely clean hotel friendly staff Only stayed one night but was very happy with it 
211954,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, There was nothing to not like , The location was perfect for our visit to the Royal Albert Hall and also the staff were very helpful and the room was comfortable clean and quiet Would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family 
211955,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Water pressure was adequate but not great Mirror in my room was in a stupid location you couldn t stand in front of it , Room was relatively large with nice decor Good location It s literally across the road from NHM but the road is pretty quiet at night 5 minutes walk to Gloucester Road tube The up to date magazines were a nice touch
211956,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Room very small and the bed headboard only a meter from the door so if anyone was going past in the passage the noise would wake me up Shower temperature very difficult to control and the water was either cold or scolding , Great location street quiet at night Bed fairly comfortable
211957,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Considering this was an upgrade the flow of water to the shower basin was Poor and looked a little tired Unfortunately wifi was not working on arrival , location 
211958,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Liked everything , The staff were fantastic I fell very ill not related to the hotel in any way the care and attention I was given and assistance to arrange a doctor was second to non nothing was too much trouble and myself and my husband can t thank them enough 
211959,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Happy with everything all round except for London prices but you cannot escape those , Very comfy room We had the window open and could not hear any traffic 
211960,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The plumbing left something to be desired Shower would cut out and temperature would vary all on its own , Location is excellent Both the Science museum and Natural History Museum were across the road and Royal Albert Hall only a five minute walk away 
211961,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Bathroom very compact but very clean , Very comfortable bed Didn t need to ask for extra pillows Good use of the space Fluffy towels Our deal for 2 nights was excellent 
211962,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The hair dryer that worked couldn t be plugged in near to a mirror The one near the mirror didn t work It was a good job we were fit as the lift only went to the 2nd floor we were on the 4th fine for us but it would be difficult for the less able , Loved the location We could walk to the Royal Albert Hall Nationaly History Museum V A so brilliant 
211963,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, I was worried by some of the electrics the wall lights on the bed headboard were wobbly and had some of the copper wire sticking out at the top One of the 2 hairdryers crackled when I picked it up and I couldn t read when it was PAT tested so I avoided that But I was wired into the wall so I think maybe it should be removed , The view from the room was fantastic right onto the natural history museum Lovely big windows lots of natural light It was great to have a separate little seating area to enjoy a morning coffee from the nespresso machine Loved the Neil s Yard toiletries too and the bath was lovely I ve stayed once before and will definitely come again Well run hotel with polite staff especially the thoughtful housekeeper Thanks 
211964,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, We had room 16 which staff said was their best room It s possible if we were in a smaller room it would have been less comfortable , Room spacious bed excellent everything super clean love Neals Yard toiletries
211965,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Not really a boutique hotel overall in good shape but the room was not perfect showing some wear , Small nice hotel conveniently located Good area good wifi
211966,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel,No Negative, this is my second stay there and like last time it was perfect the beds are very confortable the shower excellent I could check in late as they are open 24 7 
211967,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Hotel interior too warm Nespresso coffee machine didn t work , Great location Interior of hotel very warm Good size bed two singles joined together Nespresso coffee machine didn t work Lift does not extend to top floor 
211968,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, As I expected the room was tiny the bathroom door did not open all the way b c of the size of the room and placement of the bed But for the price and the location it is NOT a big deal for me It is completely expectable at a hotel in a traditional building And for me size is not important esp when I am traveling alone But this is not a Hilton if that is what you expect spend more , The location is perfect if you plan to visit the V A and Science Museum as I did The staff was excellent available helpful 
211969,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Room a bit sparsely furnished small desk stool rather than proper chair at desk, V good location near museums and Imperial College good size room for central London excellent bathroom Comfortable bed 
211970,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, One negative personal think I know but pillows not so good need better support An easy fix to get an excellent rating , Top location Friendly helpful staff 
211971,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, My room was a little cold it was middle of January and the single glazing needs to be upgraded Room no 14 was also a little small but cosy , Great location close to the V A Natural History museum science museum Albert hall etc Friendly and accommodating staff Clean throughout Continental breakfast was good quality and set me up for the day 
211972,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Location was brilliant 5 minutes walk from South Kensington tube station There are a lot of restaurants pubs and bars in the surrounding area great for the evening 
211973,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Don t bother with the hotel breakfast it was the only thing that was a disappointment , Booked delux double room was large bed very comfortable had everything one needed Staff helpful and friendly 5 min walk to tube station and directly opposite Natural History museum Would stay there again

211975,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Maggie the receptionist was excellent Allowed my son into the pool She probably doesn t realise how important that was to him and I am truely grateful All the other staff were great also
211976,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location for the Royal Albert Hall Staff friendly and very helpful Room small but charming in every way Breakfast excellent Definitely recommended as a boutique hotel 
211977,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, We were in a room behind the kitchen bar and this was noisy in the early morning There were no bars or pubs within walking distance I was convinced I had paid for breakfast in the price but there was nothing on our confirmation to prove it , Clean Good continental breakfast 
211978,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, My only negative no plug point close to a mirror when using hair dryer very difficult to dry style hair without a mirror Easily rectified , Close to Royal Albert Hall very helpful and friendly staff comfortable bed lovely fluffy towels 
211979,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel,No Negative, The location of the hotel was perfect for our plans to visit the Royal Albert Hall the V A and Natural History Museum and Hyde Park Our room on the first floor was tastefully decorated well appointed and quiet after full days out The staff were very helpful and obliging 
211980,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, It was clean but not as much attention to detail as would be expected in 4 hotel for the cost Elevator only goes to second floor so baggage can be an issue , Location was great Near two tube stations for Piccadilly line 
211981,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Breakfast was disappointing It was obvious the hotel does not have the facilities to prepare food and this was definitely reflected in the breakfast There are other options nearby and that is what we did after the first morning If you have hefty suitcases make sure you do not have a room on the third or fourth floor because the lift does not go to these floors The staircase is narrow so lugging suitcases up the stairs is not a good option though the concierge offered to do this for us We swapped rooms instead , The location is very good handy to Gloucester Rd tube station an easy 5 minute walk In our Deluxe Double room the bed was large and very comfortable had good clothes hanging space and a safety deposit box for our valuables 
211982,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Watch out for the price of a taxi if you ask the Hotel to order one for you We literally only went 2 minutes up the road to the front of the Royal Albert Hall and we were charged 12 , The location was great as we were attending the Royal Albert Hall Staff were friendly helpful and the room was clean comfortable

211984,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Happened to book unknowingly at the Rugby Worldcup Final weekend So hotelprices in all of London were up, Good location quirky hotel layout elevator only goes to the second floor steps are typical for those buildings quite narrow and steep Be aware of that Didnt bother us though
211985,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, There is no eating facility in the premises and the hotel menu is from a local restaurant that gouges for delivery , Friendliness of the staff and their willingness to help a sick visitor 
211986,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Housekeeping standards were a bit uneven especially concerning restocking the in room coffee tea tray and bathroom supplies tissues shampoo But this was a very minor drawback , My room faced the back of the building and was very quiet and comfortable I slept very well and the breakfasts were very nice The location was great as I wanted to visit the nearby museums 
211987,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Brilliant location right next to the museums and ideal for the Royal Albert Hall Room very warm comfortable and spacious Staff very pleasant and helpful 
211988,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Elevators only go to 2nd level So if you are on the 4th floor you need to walk the tiny stairs a challenge for older people , The night audit was really friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome The location is great and the rooms are comfortable and big 
211989,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The climb to the top of the house to our The small room The toilet roll holder hanging off the wall No indicatoon of the price of the breakfast or what it consisted of, The comfortable bed The friendly and helpful staff The location was brilliant
211990,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The only thing I was unhappy about was that the sink did not empty Someone had jammed it in the plughole and I couldn t shift it I reported it to reception , Comfortable bed pleased to find shampoo etc as not often get them Staff were very friendly perfect for a short stay 
211991,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Fan in the bathroom is very noisy and goes on for a long time after having switched off the light , Very friendly and helpful staff Laid back homey atmosphere 
211992,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Our room was on lower ground floor with little natural light We had to ask reception for teabags and milk and water took along time to run hot through taps in the hand basin , Very convenient for venues like the Albert Hall and Museums
211993,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, the only point I would like to make no rail to hold onto when getting in and out of bath, very good hotel clean friendly great location would stay there again
211994,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel,No Negative, This is a gem of a hotel hidden behind an anonymous facade on Queens Gate friendly and helpful staff a very cosy atmosphere clean nicely decorated room with surprisingly good beds for English standard 
211995,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, no elevator to the third floor The receptionist at night on the 14 10 2015 was very impolite He told me that my room was in the third floor but the number was 19 so i thought it was on the first floor So asked him again to make sure and he was very impolite Shower is poor in order to adjust it you have to go through the water which can be cold or hot stairs are very dangerous they are narrow I cant believe they charge 200 euros for this hotel , receptionist Mohamed was very kind 
211996,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Steep narrow stairs to the 3rd floor Small room Mediocre breakfast in the bar , Fabulous location opposite National History Museum and short walk to Albert Hall Comfortable bed and quiet room so slept well

211999,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The whole unit of the wash basin taps was not secure The fridge was not mounted correctly on its base in our room ie it was unstable considering the kettle was on top of the fridge could be considered to be a hazard , The main plus was the location even for the fact the hotel was in London the price of 152 per night was at the high end all things considered 
212000,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Top floor room for two people of advancing years though our luggage was transferred for us , The service from reception was friendly efficient and excellent 
212001,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The only thing that makes the hotel attractive is the surrounding area and this is how the hotel advertises itself putting pictures of the Science Museum Yes obviously the hotel is cheaper than the alternatives around but you get a VERY small room and virtually there is no lobby or a place to hang around What I did not like was that mineral water was refilled only once during my five nights stay and that on the last day maids took used towels but forgot to put a new ones , Nice area around simple but ok breakfast 
212002,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, The room for one person was very cold while the others were warm we went with our family and saw 3 rooms , Good location good room for a couple teapot in room 
212003,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was lovely and quiet very clean and comfortable with a relaxed modern feel As there are only 26 rooms it did not have that corporate feel that many hotels have

212007,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, A small caveat is that it is not always a simple matter to enter the hotel Sometimes the staff is away from the front desk so it becomes necessary to ring the front doorbell and it occasionally took them a few minutes to respond and buzz me into the hotel Strange not to have access to the main hotel door , Friendly and courteous staff were always helpful Location is excellent High ceiling in the room gave a feeling of spaciousness Breakfast had most everything I enjoy Quiet room Powerful shower Good consistent free Wi Fi coverage 
212008,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, Minor things really that didn t detract from the overall stay couple of things could easily be improved night light did not work and the full length mirror was behind the desk which made it difficult to use , Close to the Albert Hall for late night prom Very good hotel for the location Staff polite and friendly 
212009,Fifty Four Boutique Hotel, I had a large room in the 4th floor which was very nice However my college only had a quite small single room on the backside which was a little fusty The elevator only reaches to the 2nd floor , Breakfast was very good Location is close to piccadilly line
