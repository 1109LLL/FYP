291931,Ohla Eixample,No Negative, Great location in the middle of Barcelona Attentive and helpful staff Because there was a problem with our room ceiling leaking in the toilet they immediately evaluated the situation and moved us to a nicer room 
291932,Ohla Eixample, On the 9th floor I wanted a cocktail that was not very sweet little did they know my grand child spoke Spanish and he told his companion or co liege I was being a nonsense and laugh at me my grand daughter was very offended I paid highly for those drinks I took her with me for that reason you should be kind to all your guest This was at the pool , very dark and what they call a garden view wasn t People washing clothing and some plants the owners grow is not garden view to me I was promise a garden view 
291933,Ohla Eixample, Maybe pool can be opened till 8 or 9pm but overall nothing went wrong, Perfect room friendly stuff great welcome surprise it cost extra but price was reasonable and it was very nice tasty breakfast not limited to my opinion late check out at 2pm everything was just perfect truly 5 star experience 
291934,Ohla Eixample,No Negative, The hotel is of a modern contemporary design and the room was very well equiped The hotel contacted us in advance for any special requests including the type of bedding and pillows required The swimming pool and attached bar provides a great area to relax above the bustling streets of Barcelona below The service from all the staff was first rate 
291935,Ohla Eixample,No Negative, This hotel is 6 months old and already has a Michelin Star awarded restaurant Very nice neighborhood only a block away from the Ramblas very nice rooms very friendly staff Definitely a great place to stay while at Barcelona 
291936,Ohla Eixample, I am sportaholic so the gym was little small for me but other than that its all perfect, Excellent Hotel and Excellent Staff location is just simply perfect 
291937,Ohla Eixample, The pool the gym and the sky bar are not even worth to be visited These shouldn t be mentioned as facilities Breakfast is of much lower standards , Clean and comfortable rooms Design furniture Modern tech in the room 
291938,Ohla Eixample, The staff could have been friendlier didn t feel like they were very welcoming When we asked questions I also found the staff in the lobby to be standoffish and not as helpful as you would expect from a hotel like this 1 elevator was broken when we stayed so there was only 1 elevator to use for all the rooms in the hotel This was an annoyance but not a huge problem , The hotel is new and the rooms were amazingly designed super cozy 
291939,Ohla Eixample, Nothing, Amazing staff Extremely helpful Their concierges were all amazing They helped us book a rental car through the hotel I cannot say enough great things about the staff here 
291940,Ohla Eixample, We were unfortunately unable to visit the restaurant during our stay however there were adequate restaurants within very easy walking distance from the hotel , The staff throughout the hotel were welcoming helpful and friendly The room well maintained and well kept throughput our stay Great location 
291941,Ohla Eixample, We wanted late checkout but we couldn t get it despite having being promised that it will be arranged but the lady at the reception refused to negotiaite, The Deluxe room was amazing spacious with a couch a bathtub and a shower Great service in the reception Very fast internet and very convenient location 
291942,Ohla Eixample, The breakfast options could be improved it was the same everyday so I think some variety could be good , I really liked the neighborhood it is located in Just a 5 minute walk to the main street It is not busy and quite peaceful in the evenings The hotel decor is very modern and chic with good service The rooftop pool has a nice view of the city 
291943,Ohla Eixample, the breakfast was disappointed for a 5 Hotel same , the room was very good also it was very clean the bed and the pillows was superb the location is very good about 1 5 km from the Catalu a square 
291944,Ohla Eixample, The washbasin is in the room The commode is in a tiny sealed off area and you have to open the door come out and wash your hands This made me very uncomfortable Not to mention it disturbed the other person in the room if you needed to use the basin while they were sleeping Also the shower area does not have a door so I had to switch off the air conditioning while having a bath this also becomes inconvenient to other guests in the room I had cold pressed fruit and vegetable juices in novotel madrid petite palace boqueria also offered the same I was disappointed to be offered mostly packed juice or cava for breakfast ,No Positive
291945,Ohla Eixample, In the 40 heat the pool was a little overrun with beautiful people and not such a friendly environment for families or older couples , Wonderful room a junior suite Very characterful great bath and shower Greeted with Champagne on arrival very prompt and helpful service and spent the evening doing a degustation menu at the in house Michelin star restaurant Xerta Wonderful shopping district for my shoe mad partner Honestly one of the very very best experiences we ve ever had 
291946,Ohla Eixample,No Negative, We had a small problem reported it to reception It was instantly taken care of and we were made to feel special We would definitely stay here again Great location near the designer shops wife loved that loads of places to eat and have a beer I loved that 
291947,Ohla Eixample, Instant coffee in the room, Breakfast was perfect loved the pool and the staff were wonderful There is an excellent deli supermarket nearby and it is a short walk to las Ramblas transport and shops 
291948,Ohla Eixample, The room was very sterile and quite basic for an expensive hotel The water sensor to the tap on the wash basin was very irritating Nobody took us through any of the gadgets climate control etc to explain how to work any of it upon arrival For me it didn t have the Wow factor of a 5 hotel , The bed was very comfortable The common areas were pleasant spaces
291949,Ohla Eixample, No possibility to open the room window , Staff always attentive and very kind Perfect location for city touring Very good facilities Michelin Star restaurant 
291950,Ohla Eixample,No Negative, A modern and conveniently located hotel where the staff go out of their way to ensure your staff is as comfortable and enjoyable as possible Home to a Michelin star restaurant and within walking distance of numerous other excellent dining options the Ohla Eixample was an excellent choice for those who prefer not to be in tourist central 
291951,Ohla Eixample, I think they need more equipment in the gym and need to include perhaps more options in the food menu, The property is centrally located to all the major attractions in Barcelona especially La Rambla and La Rambla de Cataluna it took us only 10mins to get to the Camp Nou stadium to watch the final game of La Liga where Barcelona played EIBAR The room is beautiful the size is perfect its one of the best boutique hotels i ve ever stayed at The staff of the hotel are who made my experience wonderful At the reception i still remember Alba David and Dave The bell boys Rui and Martin The lady that made my capuccino Rosana All of who made my experience beyond wonderful 
291952,Ohla Eixample,No Negative, During our Europe holiday we rated our stay at Ohla Eixample as the best that we had and we had stayed in a lot of 5 star hotels Upon arrival we received a fantastic welcome and a lovely glass of bubbles and during our stay were treated as a VIP guest at all times The room was exceptionally clean and comfortable with modern touches and layout and everything was explained very well by the polite young man who accompanied us up to our room with our bags We had a great sleep since the bed was comfy and the room was quiet with no outside noise filtering in At breakfast we were pleasantly surprised and impressed by the hotel gifting a book and a red rose to all guests in celebration of Sant Jordi s day Such a lovely gesture by the hotel and my rose was still going strong over a week later The staff really were the highlight of our stay and went above and beyond to make it a most enjoyable one for us They were very helpful with a smile at all times and we appreciated all they did for us We wished we could have stayed on longer and wouldn t hesitate to stay here again We certainly hope to do that again soon Many thanks to all Ohla Eixample staff 
291953,Ohla Eixample, Small minus was the private event in rooftop pool and bar which was not announced to guests, We stayed in Luxury Attic room spacious room on 8th floor with own terrace Sun was shining there from morning to late afternoon Nice rooftop pool and bar on 9th floor Good breakfast with fresh food Pleasant atmosphere and great service 
291954,Ohla Eixample, The bathroom clearly visible from the bedroom and no mention of this on the website for the higher end room category selected Slow room cleaning service Unable to get the names of the guests correct even when clearly stated in the reservations paperwork A welcome letter that was inappropriate Variable service from reception with some staff pleasant and others off handed , The restaurant Exerta was excellent Italian waitress at breakfast especially attentive and a pleasure to talk to Pity it was also her last day on the day we left the hotel 
291955,Ohla Eixample, tea for breakfast and in the bar Lipton tea bag really for 5 star hotel you cannot provide infusion tea , Very poor breakfast Nice room design Overpriced 
291956,Ohla Eixample, We didn t have a view outside our window which was a shame , The staff were very helpful and friendly The breakfast was good The bedroom and bathroom were both very clean modern and light The pool on the top was small but perfect for what we needed and sun loungers very comfortable 
291957,Ohla Eixample, No complaints whatsoever I definitely recommend this hotel and hope to come back soon , Everything was great The location is excellent very easy to access and near by lots of bars restaurants and attractions The staff was absolutely incredible very accommodating friendly and professional Furniture and decoration are tasteful and modern The room had lots of space and was very clean 
291958,Ohla Eixample, A bit far from the beach for people who want to run But overall great location for visiting and shopping , Very nice boutique hotel Great suite Great service I will definitely come back 
291959,Ohla Eixample, I would have loved if the hotel had a fully fledged Spa on site However they do offer massages which can be booked through the reception desk , I liked the staff the most Very helpful at all times 
291960,Ohla Eixample,No Negative, Stunning warm and friendly boutique hotel I travel a lot and irately does a hotel feel this comfortable Fabulous restaurant Fabulous happy and helpful staff and fabulous facilities I could walk to most of my meetings I will be back 
291961,Ohla Eixample, no regretts no complaints so , Location friendlyness concierge very knowlegable Great and friendly service in the restaurant 1 star michelin even when we spilt a glas of water over the whole table Modern boutique satile is very adequate Would come again
291962,Ohla Eixample, No privacy in bedroom between shower and wash basin in bedroom better to have a private shower room with wash basin could easily put privacy screen in shower, Staff and food
291963,Ohla Eixample, The only thing that would make the Attic room better would be sun loungers on the terrace to enjoy in sunny weather , Excellent location breakfast bed linen bathroom cleanliness pool bar all very good 
291964,Ohla Eixample,No Negative, Staff excellent from the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble Location quiet about a 15 20 minute stroll north of Plaza Catalunya Cleanliness Rooftop pool bar small but very nice
291965,Ohla Eixample, booking com pictures of two connected rooms are not corresponding to the reality Junior Suite is actually different and much smaller Please fix this not very high quality and durable materials used e g sink desk is made of basic wooden conglomerate which is affected by water dampness sinks are made of steel rather than stone or porcelain room windows are not openable and actually appeared to be very small in Junior Suite part of connected rooms water temperature was difficult to adjust was taking too long to change rather limited breakfast for 5 star hotel limited equipment in the gym only good for light cardio trainings, new hotel modern equipment free champagne at the entrance all the time comfy sunbeds at the rooftop pool little candy gifts each evening car rental right next to the hotel
291966,Ohla Eixample, doors are so thin you can t sleep in morning due to cleaners being so loud with their talkie walkies and making too much noise cleaning with hover and such but the worst was their talkie walkie set up on like car volume level, location central and the shower
291967,Ohla Eixample, Breakfast was a disappointment WE often stay at Hospes Hotels in Spain and their breakfast is far superior You have no smoked salmon for instance fruit was sparce just not up to the standard of the rest of the hotel Some of the modern furniture looked a bit cheap , The bed was super comfy and lovely linen The staff could not have been more helpful 
291968,Ohla Eixample, The restaurant for dinner was good but the staff was kind of aloof Brought my 2 kids to dinner they are experienced travelers but felt like staff was looking down on us throughout the meal , Staff was amazing and helped us with EVERY request even acquiring a balloon for my daughter s birthday and transport from train station and to the airport 
291969,Ohla Eixample, I didn t really like breakfast it was rather boring and churros seemed very crusty for my taste The shutters in my room were kind of cranky as the switches were broken , Very comfortable beds nice room very good wi fi signal Great location only a few blocks away from the centre 
291970,Ohla Eixample, Room could have been bigger and certainly not up to the 5 star rating that the hotel claims to have Wash basin in the room outside the bathroom and glass wall of the shower overlooking the room were real negatives , Excellent Location away from the tourist trap places like Ramblas and yet had excellent bars and restaurants within walking distance Good breakfast and excellent free wifi 
291971,Ohla Eixample, actually nothing I can think about , I travelled with my wife my son and his two twin daughters to small babies not easy to deal with at 15 months old the staff did everything we would ask or need to help everything was in order clean spotless absolutely no complains whatsoever I shall come back in summer with my wife for vacations what a great service and a very nice hotel 
291972,Ohla Eixample, Slight noise form the Metro that seems to run underneath the Hotel almost continual rumble starting from about 05 00 It s not too intrusive but did wake me a couple of times It would not put me off from staying again though , Excellent service professional staff and fantastic room and amenities 
291973,Ohla Eixample, When we stayed the waterpipe of the building was going under construction on the second night The hotel informed us that we shouldn t use any water taps in the bathroom from 1am to 5am that night so one of our family turned on the tap to take a quick shower at 9pm that evening Then he found the water YELLOW We were so surprised and told the hotel manager She immediately came up to check on us and said the yellow water was not toxic to human body but we were still quite confused Else than that we liked everything , We chose junior suite loved the room condition and comfy bed Staff was nice Breakfast was good enough for us Would stay again 
291974,Ohla Eixample, The breakfast was a bit more than a bit disappointing the waiters looked always annoyed and if you order eggs you will wait forever and before the closing time by 15 minutes dont think that the empty bread counter or anything else for that matter would be replenished Totally contrasting with the rest of the Hotel service feel and look , The design of the rooms is pleasantly surprising with unusual layouts where you open the door and you have the bathtub in front of you Nice touch from the hotel distributing Cava on NY eave and with a smile 
291975,Ohla Eixample, Location is a little far from main locations Breakfast is a slightly limited selection, Friendly staff Comfy Beds Clean Rooms Modern contemporary rooms
291976,Ohla Eixample, If there was a sink in the bathroom but I understand the unique character of the hotel so this is not really a dislike , The staff the drinks the service Just great For those that smoke or drink in the room get one with a balcony 
291977,Ohla Eixample, Restaurant wasn t that good New Year s Eve meal was poor and breakfast not great But overall a really nice hotel , Rooms very comfortable excellent showers nice welcoming staff Was my wife s birthday and they put loads of balloons in the room a lovely touch 
291978,Ohla Eixample, Very noisy rooms You can hear everything from the corridors and the neighbors We don t know this from a 5 star hotel , Breakfast style of the Hotel wonderful friendly stuff Very good located and nice rooftop pool and bar 
291979,Ohla Eixample, Ordered tea at breakfast and waited for 30 minutes In vain So we complained to the main waiter He practically told us that this is it very aggressively So we left the breakfast room That is not a smart attitude to adopt in the hospitality business The rest of the staff were very helpful and professional , Location
291980,Ohla Eixample, Northern Europeans will like a more healthy less sweet breakfast with a better selection of whole grain breads Sometimes too long wait times for breakfast related orders probably due to lack of organization and or staff E 15 cocktail was gone in 5 sips I was left with a lot of expensive ice cubes after that They should be more generous with this Now I didn t like to order more cocktails , Great location roof terrace rooms and very comfy bed Excellent hygiene Very dedicated and friendly staff NY diner was top class and 5 star worthy 
291981,Ohla Eixample, Kitchen management constantly had to ask for buffet breakfast refills Windy rooms All or nothing lighting system making one getting ready one sleeping incompatable, Staff support
291982,Ohla Eixample,No Negative, Really this was the perfect stay in every way The staff were all lovely and friendly the hotel itself is beautifully designed and finished and this was without doubt one of the best hotel stays I ve had Well done Ohla I ll definitely be coming back when not if I return to Barcelona 
291983,Ohla Eixample, The rooms service menu was very limited The room was small and the TV was very small I just felt like we overpaid by 50 per night for what we received , The Hotel is located perfectly for us We walked to La Rambala and a large part of the city The staff was as good as on could get They were helpful understanding and true professionals The whole Hotel was very clean and neat 
291984,Ohla Eixample, I booked a table in advance at the guest relation for the two of us in the restaurant of the hotel and asked for a five course vegetarian menu which was confirmed At arrival we checked in and went almost straight to have dinner Nobody seemed to know anything about our reservation and definatly not about the vegetarian whish We were told that it s not possible to have a 4 5 course Veggie Menu in that restaurant so we left Not a real good start in that hotel and a bit of a shame for the restaurant crew There was just 1 other table so they would have had the time to be creative if they wanted to The breakfast was good but the crew always seemed to be kind of scared of the breakfast Boss They were no able to take choices by us they allways had to ask him which produced a kind of nervous atmosphere , Nice new and modern Hotel Beautiful Junior Suite 
291985,Ohla Eixample, All good , Very comfortable large room deluxe great breakfast customer oriented staff and a good location for having a short walk to the city centre on the great streets of Barcelona 
291986,Ohla Eixample, Unskilled breakfast service staff very different origin very modest English no idea what to do when i asked olive oil and vinegar to my salad To get coffee was like to do service for them not for us They MUST be trained first of all when new visitors come to offer them coffee or tea as it is usual in all hotels It was not the case there Croissants were under cooked well done outside but absolutely raw inside Somebody must go to France learn how to make croissants , terrace outside our room but no roof on it when raining 
291987,Ohla Eixample,No Negative, Everything was excellent The staff were so helpful and friendly and the restaurant was great Particularly liked the design of the room which was very comfortable modern and spacious The rooftop pool and terrace were also lovely and the views were amazing 
291988,Ohla Eixample, Although Staff were very friendly service in restaurant was slow and disorganized Front desk staff not great at making restaurant suggestions to meet our needs Check In Service was below average , Great Location
291989,Ohla Eixample, Breakfast staff had difficulty in understanding our coffee preference Luckily another competent staff member came to the rescue minutes later and sorted it out , Room artistically designed and ergonometrically spaced and the shower experience was new and nice Excellent location to access central Barcelona s top shopping and dining places Breakfast was 5 stars 
291990,Ohla Eixample, Breakfast was cold and service was slow Gym was poor Room service and Restaurant were none existent Plays at being a 5 star hotel but it really really isn t Very dissatisfied as it was a special birthday and overall the hotel was a real dampener on the holiday Room was uninviting cold and similar to a cell , Staff were very helpful
291991,Ohla Eixample, Gym is underwhelming Too small too few pieces of equipment to be of any use The bar at the roof is empty , Concierge Rodolfo is excellent Breakfast staff lovely if not a little overworked Room layout nice and quiet Location fantastic if you want to be in nice residential commercial section of Barcelona and away from the tourists flocking Rambla
291992,Ohla Eixample, Always make sure you book a room on a higher floor You can hear the Metro rumbling below on the ground floor although not intrusively We had no problem on the 5th floor , We would happily book this hotel again Smart bedrooms which were immaculate Very central location but without noisy traffic Michelin starred chef a huge bonus Excellent 
291993,Ohla Eixample, As vegetarians we didn t find it great for food The breakfasts were very fresh with juices and fruits pastries etc but I would have preferred a better selection of veggies Unfortunately the restaurant couldn t offer us anything from the tasting menu for dinner either There are plenty of veggie restaurants within walking distance so we didn t starve , Very friendly staff ultra modern design and roof top pool very nice Junior suite was quiet and roomy A bottle of cava was delivered to the room for my husbands birthday which was nice 
291994,Ohla Eixample, 1 Having to order taxi whenever i want to go out that takes time 2 Breakfast not many options 3 Poor English speaking staff at breakfast that caused me and my wife to eat pork and bacon with the omlette though we explained I think staff should be trained to understand different religions and kind of food 4 waking me up early everyday to check the mini bar is just not acceptable , Smooth check in location clean spacious 
291995,Ohla Eixample, The bedroom had a mixed review Beautiful comfy bedding shower superb but may not be to everyone s taste as it was see through in bedroom The toilet was very small and needed to have wash basin in with it But overall a lovely room , The breakfast quality was outstanding and the infinity heated pool was fabulous overlooking the city The staff were very friendly and the added touches were of the highest standard 
291996,Ohla Eixample,No Negative, The hotel was a real surprise for me the location the high quality services the food the cleanliness of the room The swimming pool was amazing I could walk for a couple of minutes to Rambla enjoying the cafes and shops on my way Great experience 
291997,Ohla Eixample, Room is a bit on the small side and I think the hotel is overpriced for what it offers also most of the hotel is quite dark Breakfast is very poor They could definitely improve that, The Hotel is beautiful Location was great with nice restaurants closeby Bed was very comfortable 
291998,Ohla Eixample, It s not a dislike but the layout of the room may not be to everybody s taste shower bath visible from bed seating area The room was a great size but didn t have a cosy feel to it Industrial theme maybe , Friendly staff Roof top terrace bar with pool loungers Lovely to enjoy the sun have a drink in the evening Good food Comfy beds 
291999,Ohla Eixample, Breakfast could have been better for a 5 star hotel Paying for parking , Big comfortable bed junior suite Great location for shopping and cafes All young staff very accommodating and pleasant 
292000,Ohla Eixample, Very little improvement required The only thing we thought was one morning breakfast service was not quite as perfect as the other mornings , The hotel which is stylish and modern is in a great location for sightseeing Staff were very helpful and service was very good Clean comfortable rooms Breakfast was really good Buffet style with a good choice and catered for all Swimming pool whilst small was the perfect temperature and the bar was perfect A great place to spend a few days 
292001,Ohla Eixample, The only small thing I would advise to improve is that when you try to call reception or hotel facilities from your room it s rather difficult to locate the number We ordered breakfast to the room one morning and it wasn t quite the same as downstairs a little cold and couple of items we ordered were missing Having said that its very minor and apart from that it was amazing , Fantastic boutique hotel with very accommodating staff Beautifully comfortable beds loved the added touch of bed aroma and pillow menu Staff went extra mile to ensure our stay was pleasant and comfortable Food at the rooftop terrace as well as restaurant was excellent Will definitely come back and reccomend to friends and family 
292002,Ohla Eixample, Overpriced For 300 I expect a trully 5 which this is not Same quality service you can get in a 3 rated hotel in the same area for half the price Pool is iin reality small and only 40cm deep no swimming possible photos are deceptive Big screen TV but no programs Most programs are in spanish only 2 news channells in english Shower with no door only seethrough glass panel between bed and shower, Location is 5 walking from Casa Mila Casa Batlo all the designer named shops in Paseig Grasia and restaurants in Rambla Catalunya Comfortable and clean bed with good breakfast is what you get here Kind staff WI FI ok 
292003,Ohla Eixample, very cold feeling rooms and small Climate in the lobby was very warm while in the room was frizzing cold Bar and Breakfast menu very limited for a pretended 5 star hotel , location
292004,Ohla Eixample,No Negative, Really lovely modern hotel Staff were extremely helpful and polite Good choice at breakfast Bedrooms are more spacious than I was expecting with super comfy beds Would recommend
292005,Ohla Eixample, Nothing, Stuff is extremely helpful Everybody from help with luggage breakfast service team registration people concierge We have to mention Rui who was so polite and helpful almost in every field Will certainly come back next time we are in Barcelona 
292006,Ohla Eixample, the tureens with breakfast ie bacon scrambled egg beans were only tepid cold and service a little slow Roof top bar drinks prices very expensive , great location very clean chilled out room roof top terrace with pool and views English speaking reception staff very helpful and polite 
292007,Ohla Eixample, A few more beds are needed around the pool area and perhaps on the terrace where there are a couple of table and chairs Other than that we could not fault the hotel in any way , The staff couldn t be more helpful The pool and beanbag beds are wonderful we loved chilling out here Great breakfasts too We wouldn t hesitate to return 
292008,Ohla Eixample, Little English skills of staff Pool Skybar in same area ppl sunbathing and ppl with their suits sitting next to each other , Very friendly and helpful staff Delicious breakfast Great location Fast WIFI
292009,Ohla Eixample, Nada nada nada nada nada nada nada nada nada nada nada ndndndndndndnndndndndndndbdbdbdbdndndndhdhdhdhdhdhhdhdndndndndndnbdndndndndndndndhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhd, Mario bar man is fantastic ohla mariooo by michele only the staff is beautiful but mario is the best 
292010,Ohla Eixample,No Negative, The staff was extremely hospitable and friendly They were very nice when answering a question The location of the hotel is convenient and the room is modern and new They even upgraded the room for our honeymoon stay The overall experience was superb 
292011,Ohla Eixample, Expensive drinks , Friendly and helpful staff nothing was too much trouble Room was chic and modern with great wifi and quiet air conditioning Roof top pool area was a real bonus 
292012,Ohla Eixample, We enjoyed the stay but it was nothing stand out The decor is very simple with plain colours and a minimalist feel Also it felt quite formal and not quite our type of place with all the staff being extremely polite and other guests lounging by the pool taking selfies of themselves Obviously not a fault of the hotel but we probably wouldn t stay again in preference of a more lively casual place , Overall the hotel was nice clean very friendly staff tasty breakfast We had a dip in the rooftop pool enjoyed the comfy bed and made the most of the blackout blinds Very good electronics provided and everything felt of good quality 
292013,Ohla Eixample, The toilet area was small and confined and we believe larger people would struggle with it We believe a washbasin should be in the bathroom or toilet area rather than in the bedroom , All the staff were warm friendly and attentive Breakfast was excellent Standards were of a high level The air con in our bedroom was really quiet 
292014,Ohla Eixample, The only disappointing thing was the gym wasn t ready Everything else was perfect , The hotels design is amazing Very comfortable beds stunning rooftop pool and very friendly staff
292015,Ohla Eixample, No bath in room Poor view No spa Pool area very small , Very friendly helpful staff Nice breakfast with a good selection Lovely bar Fresh cocktails 
292016,Ohla Eixample, Loved rooftop bar pool but a few more sun loungers were required I know limited space but 2 3 more would be super, Your calm cool bedrooms very peaceful doors closed gently
292017,Ohla Eixample, Only two minor issues none of which would deter us from going back to this hotel the coffee in the rooms and the food at the Sky Bar It would have been nice to see a Nespresso machine in the room instead of the the instant Nescafe sachets really not up to par for a 5 star hotel At the Sky bar we orders a Club Sandwich I think we paid 20 euros for it and it was a total disappointment Again we would gladly go back to this hotel , Very nice hotel The service was impeccable the bed linens duvet pillows mattress was super comfortable and the air condition system was efficient and quiet which made our sleep there even more restful We loved the breakfast as well the selection and quality of food was better than what one would expect for a continental breakfast buffet We had dinner twice in the Xerta restaurant and took advantage of the 38 euro per person offer for guests of the hotel and we were not disappointed The food was delicious and the price actually included the wine The rooftop pool was nice but the deck is small for the size of the hotel so it gets crowded too quickly Location is also great close to everything but on a quiet street We enjoyed our stay and would gladly go back to this hotel 
292018,Ohla Eixample, The only english speaking TV channels were news which was disappointing as would have liked sport or entertainment The staff on the terrace need to make sure people don t try and keep the sunbeds when they are not there There are only 8 beds so in high demand while we were there 2 beds were left with a book and towel on them for over 2 hours when many people wood have used them Room wasn t ready when we arrived even though we had been asked for our arrival time, Fantastic modern hotel with very friendly and helpful staff Sun terrace and pool are lovely great if you can get a bed Breakfast was great with a huge selection although would have been nice to get your own coffee
292019,Ohla Eixample, Too many slip ups to ignore The first 24 hours there were two that I reviewed already and were solved by management surprise on check in and undercooked burger And I though that would be fine and they were settled But then the list kept on growing with small things that a property that rates itself as 5 star cannot left ignored Failing to organize the surprise on check in as I came 30 minutes earlier No black out curtains in room making it almost impossible to get proper sleep Cleaning staff making so much noise in the hallway although we have a do not disturb sign on the door Ordering eggs that are well done from the kitchen but having them come back twice watery Then a third time to come back looking like charcoal Ordering a well done burger coming back medium not once but twice and waiting more than 1 5 hours for the correct order Kitchen has issues Ordering a taxi from reception on departure and having to remind them again 10 minutes later only to realize they didn t even order the cab while they clearly knew we needed to be on the way to airport ASAP Requesting for an additional hour for check out when all of these issues had been happening since the start of our stay and having to have an argument with reception to get the extra hour Management response was swift and prompt but with so many issues on the front line this will no doubt impact and cause negative reviews I hope you take my comments with the seriousness and action they deserve You need to either upgrade the capability of your staff or get new ones mainly in kitchen and front office , Management response in the first 24 hours Room size Comfortable bed Nice looking hotel I had rated this hotel 9 in my review after 24 hours but then stayed an additional 3 nights and had to send an updated and more complete review
292020,Ohla Eixample, the access to the pool could be an easier smoother experience for a wheelchair user , the wheelchair accessibility had a few glitches but the service from the staff in taking care of them was impeccable it s a gorgeous well designed hotel with friendly respectful and attentive staff 
292021,Ohla Eixample,No Negative, amazing brand new hotel no signs of use and desgasto great condition good parking best city location in barcelona very good breakfast best thing the rooftop view lounge
292022,Ohla Eixample, Non existent soundproofing surly staff with the exception of Wen five star service no one answering the internal phone be that reception or room service etc etc, The hotel was clean and in a good location bed was fab
292023,Ohla Eixample, Only small hiccup was that we were placed in a family suite which was two rooms next to each other one deluxe twin and one junior suite sharing a common outer door to the hallway When we arrived the internal doors to each room were deactivated so that we only had to use the keycard for the exterior door This worked well except that housekeeping kept leaving that door open when we were out thus ensuring that anyone in theory could enter our rooms without keycards We did point this out to reception but it didn t help housekeeping did it anyway It is a very small thing and had no ill consequences just a detail that needs to be ironed out , Everything else was wonderful I would definitely stay again and highly recommend this property The rooms were sparkling clean well equipped and large The breakfast was divine The mixed drinks at the bar were fabulous The rooftop pool was lovely and refreshing 
292024,Ohla Eixample, Only two slips happened I had requested for a surprise on check in as I wanted to surprise my wife with a romantic package on check in Issue is we arrived a bit earlier 30 minutes so nothing had been prepared in the room The second is in the rooftop bar when we ordered a well done burger the burger came after 30 minutes medium cooked Then they ordered another one and had us wait another 30 minutes only to find it again cooked medium red inside At this point we were extremely hungry and the staff basically said the kitchen got it wrong twice and if we would like to wait another 30 minutes total wait over 1 5 hours for a well done burger or cancel the order This obviously wasn t the response needed as we were very hungry and no immediate solution Javier stepped in and offered an apology and gave us alternative solutions which was great , we loved the way the management responded to some of our complaints very swift and effective response which showed how much care and level of professionalism there is in management special thanks to David from guest experience and Javier reception manager for being personally involved to make our stay even better All in all hotels are allowed to make mistakes and do make them what makes the difference between average and great hotels is the way they respond Ohla is a top notch hotel and management is on top of things hence this makes it a great hotel Thanks for a memorable stay
