396243,Hotel Am Parkring, Breakfast expensive if you only wanted juice and fruit Should be two prices one for light breakfast and a higher one for full breakfast, Central location very clean and value for money
396244,Hotel Am Parkring, Breakfast could be included The arranged taxi transport to airport was a bit odd as the taxi was an old ish van and the taxi fare a bit costly But luckily the driver was just perfect and got us to the airport via a scenery route , Very expensive breakfast But there is a Biomarket around 200m from the hotel worth to buy the breakfast from there or just enjoy the fr hst ck over at their cafe BigBus tour around bus leaves just outside the hotel Cheap and nice way to go from other side of town to the other also to the Sch nbrunn Palace Hotel is also nearby an amazing jazz dinner venue Porgy Bess Overall we were very satisfied with the hotel service and staff Location is also a top ten Just around the Ring

396250,Hotel Am Parkring, One small problem after staying almost a week in the suite and second time at this hotel we were not able to stay 4 more hours as a late check out Not in the suite and not in any other room which is very uncomfortable before flight We did ask that upon reservation , A good and central location near underground and tram nice staff good breakfast buffet comfortable suite 
396251,Hotel Am Parkring,No Negative, This hotel exceeded my expectations because from the outside the hotel looks like a dull office building Once inside I realized it is a charming boutique hotel with generously sized rooms featuring all the amenities one could expect The views are stunning and my associate had a corner room that had a huge balcony overlooking the entire city with a gorgeous panorama The staff were friendly and very responsive to any and all requests

396256,Hotel Am Parkring, Parking was a bit expensive but convient , We were move to a corner room with a great view Balcony was small but adequate for our dinning Staff was well versed in tourist sites in Wein This was appreciated during our stay 
396257,Hotel Am Parkring, If you are staying for more than 1 2 days this place is not the right place The price is not worth the view Vienna is an expensive city and the breakfast is really expensive here and not worth it In all the rooms they have two single beds joined together instead of a queen or king size The rooms have weird mural on the walls From the balcony you can see the balcony and room next to it We had to keep the curtain pulled when we were inside the room as we could see the people in the balcony next to us We felt that we made a mistake by taking this place when there are way cheaper and nicer hotels are available in innerstadt Also because of summer their restaurant was closed which they didn t mention anywhere , The view was nice Staffs are helpful especially all the women receptionist

396262,Hotel Am Parkring, when we arrived the complimentary apple was half eaten probably no one paid attention to change it when cleaning the room when we checked out the hotel charged us 9 euro for 1 tea in the room from the complimentary stuff Sort of 3 Michelin star pricing was rather negative surprise , Great balcony great view welcomming reception staff

396266,Hotel Am Parkring, Nothing major except there was a male front desk receptionist was not informative when I asked him questions about tours also he looked very serious on the other hand the women receptionists had smiley faces all the times Tiny elevators capacity of 3 persons , Location balcony cleanliness air condition and the wifi 
396267,Hotel Am Parkring,No Negative, Private balcony air conditioning quiet room located right on the Schubert ring for easy access to everything Extra touches like chocolates on the pillow and a room safe hairdryer eco friendly toiletries The hotel staff were exceptionally friendly especially Sabrina K who gave me great advice on where I could go and how I would get there Normally the single traveler is given the less desirable rooms In this case I feel like I was given the perfect room with an incredible view from my balcony to enjoy the evening after an enjoyable day of sightseeing 
396268,Hotel Am Parkring,No Negative, Staff at reception were very friendly and had an outstanding recommendation for dinner location near park and wien mitte room view and other great things Highly recommended 
396269,Hotel Am Parkring, We booked 2 rooms same category same price However one of them was much better than the other since it had been renewed , Very good location close to the center many restaurants around and far enough from the very touristic and full streets Also close to Wien Mitte where you can catch the CAT to the airport 
396270,Hotel Am Parkring,No Negative, We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Am Parkring Some highlights Beautiful view from the room and the balcony Quiet no noise from street below or surroundings Park across the street Quickest check out ever Close til airport train station shopping restaurants bars Good bed nice firm mattress Restaurant Das Schick is excellent we went for dinner on a Saturday night did not have breakfast at the hotel georgeous food drinks and wine excellent service high standards view The hotel actually mean what they say about changing of towels policy It bothers me when hotels claim to be environmental considerate but still changes towels etc when there is no need to and we haven t asked them to haven t placed the towels on the floor

396273,Hotel Am Parkring, The neighborhood seems to be changing with several empty store fronts and not many people walking on the street It may have been an incorrect perception since this was a weekend Did not eat at the facility Breakfast was not included and should have been As a vegetarian I saw no evening meals that were acceptable , Hotel is only on upper floors Good views Convenient walk to Old Town and close to U bahn stop
396274,Hotel Am Parkring,No Negative, great location close to all attractions in vienna center the staff were very welcoming and helpfull this is our second time at this hotel and i am sure will be staying there again in the future
396275,Hotel Am Parkring, Not much really Had to go to the Marriott next door to buy a few things stamps Wien Karte bottled water but that was really a minimal inconvenience , Hotel is on the top 3 floors 11 13 and we had wonderful top floor room 306 with a balcony that wrapped around so we could see east out over the Parkstadt as well as south and west back toward the city Having the view of the park was very calming and open The only downside to the top floor was when it rained we had to take our umbrella out to have a smoke on the terrace The 12th floor balconies do not have as great a view but do have a bit of cover The staff were wonderful the room was clean the bed was comfortable and there was a lot of closet storage space We skipped the 21 euro breakfast at the hotel restaurant to try local options nearby several within a 5 minute walk There is a ringstrasse tram stop right outside the hotel and the metro stop is very close by The city center itself is within walking distance 
396276,Hotel Am Parkring, Minor building work next to hotel was a bit dusty but no noise issues , Great location good aircon wifi breakfast fantastic view over city The free upgrade to a huge suite was most appreciated 
396277,Hotel Am Parkring,No Negative, The very standard of high quality service and accommodation in a fantastic location It was so near to walk to St Stephens Platz and the Hofberg Palace etc it couldn t have been better The bus and underground stops were very near and it was a short walk from the CAT train station so transferring from the airport was really easy Would recommend it very highly 
396278,Hotel Am Parkring, The hotel lounge bar was on the ground floor while the hotel floors are on the 11th 12th and 13th floors It was rather soulless and uninviting and not at all comfortable to sit in let alone have a drink in , Room with a wonderful view over Vienna Comfortable beds and well appointed bathroom Breakfast brilliant if rather expensive at 21 per person All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly We had a lovely stay Location an easy walk to the train station from the airport and to the Opera House and the old town 
396279,Hotel Am Parkring,No Negative, Staff were wonderful went out of their way to make it a enjoyable hassle free experience Sonia at front desk could not do enough for us Loved her 
396280,Hotel Am Parkring, Only issue was that we had specifically booked a single room with a bath and a double room but on arrival were told the only rooms with baths were doubles and we were expected to pay the normal double price ie a supplement to get a room with a bath as the hotel had been renovated since we made the booking We had not been informed of this change despite emails welcoming us to our forthcoming trip etc Only way round it was for us to take a double with bath and a single with shower and then to swap rooms at bathtimes Not very satisfactory and we do not think this was fair treatment by the hotel management , Rooms clean good views good breakfasts 
396281,Hotel Am Parkring, I could hear people from others rooms during the night like walking on high heels but that didn t disturbe me at all , The room was amazing very confortable The location is excelente few minutes walk from the main landmarks of Viena and close to a subway station The staff are very polite

396288,Hotel Am Parkring, On the evening of Thursday 14 April we were notified that there was a problem and there would be no hot water between the hours of 23 00 and 7 00am We accepted that and didn t have a problem In actual fact there was no water at all no cold water for the toilet For a 4 Hotel this is really unacceptable We had already paid for a balcony upgrade For the goodwill and reputation of Hotel AM Parkring I feel the least the management could have done was refunded this amount to us ,No Positive
396289,Hotel Am Parkring, The reception staff were pretty rude and unhelpful Also we checked out around 9 but asked if we could leave our car parked while we went into the city We were told we had to move it by noon checkout time Considering how expensive parking is and how empty the garage was it was annoying that they wouldn t let us leave it there until after lunch , The location is amazing The breakfast although pricy is very good The balcony rooms were spacious and very comfortable 
396290,Hotel Am Parkring, No adverse comments , Location Friendly and efficient staff Comfotable and catered for all our needs Will certainly stay here on our next visit to Vienna 
396291,Hotel Am Parkring, The hotel is not suitable for business travelers Wanted to iron my suits Was told that the hotel policy is not to provide iron in the rooms as it could be a potential fire hazard Have stayed in hundreds of hotels BUT never came across such a bizarre answer Was then made to walk a floor to a dingy storeroom where I was provided an iron to press my suit Room was on the 12th floor which is co located with a restaurant Banging of cutlery hotel serving staff moving around caused a lot of noise Do not recommend taking a room on the 12th floor Some of the housekeeping and other hotel staff were struggling with English, Location of the hotel Very central
396292,Hotel Am Parkring, The only downfall was the shower Not the pressure but it wasn t draining well We decided not to say anything until we left since we had the dogs , The hotel is accross the street from Stadt Park which was a plus because we were traveling with our dogs It is also close the the subway station it is a 10 minute walk to the Opera House The suite was on the 12th floor and had a wrap around deck which gave us amazing views of the city the bed was comfortable the resturant was also on the same floor which was nice Wifi was strong Breakfast was good please note that they cook eggs to ORDER so you will not see them on the bufett This was a huge plus You can get fried soft boiled scrambled or an omlett

396296,Hotel Am Parkring, The weather , Great location and views over south Vienna near Stadparkt and Wien Mitte railway station for connection from airport only 25mins 4 40 euros and less than 10mins walk We upgraded to an enormous suite because only the suites with balconies have baths Other rooms with balconies though only a shower must also have stunning views over the city Friendly staff 
396297,Hotel Am Parkring, There were workman working on the building across the way with a good view of us , We had a lovely room with a balcony and a nice view There was an ample supply of good coffee The room was quiet and comfortable 
396298,Hotel Am Parkring, The price of the breakfast buffet was really high A full portion of breakfast in the best cafe of the city costs about 12 Euro while the price inside the hotel was 23 , The location was really great in the best part of the city center Staff were really kind and helpful They answered our questions in the most useful way 
396299,Hotel Am Parkring, Separated toilette is too small for a tall person Bed linen is too heavy and too warm and pillows are too stuffed and too hard making consequently the night almost sleepless for me ,No Positive
396300,Hotel Am Parkring, No queen king size bed Only single beds put together Heater impossible to set air conditioning not functioning The room temperature was awfully hot in winter with 2deg C outside Bathtub very small for 2 , Central location Check in check out was quick and simple

396308,Hotel Am Parkring,No Negative, We Received an Upgrade which was Great since we Stayed for 4 days Great views Nice staff they helped to surprise my boyfriend on his birthday during our stay 
396309,Hotel Am Parkring, Our room was adjacent to the restaurant and the restaurant kitchen balcony and we did not like restaurant staff smoking at their balcony one evening all the smoke was going to us The hotel management should look into this especially given the fact that the rooms are all non smoking in the hotel and that the guests are requested to sign the non smoking disclaimer during the check in , All was perfect location room at the 12th floor service cleanliness Internet connection WiFi was stable A nice surprise was a bottle of champagne and a box of chocolates from the hotel on the occasion of my daughter s birthday we traveled and stayed in the hotel together 
396310,Hotel Am Parkring, I don t think the additional charges for the cathedral should be charging , The view from the rooms is beautiful considering the high floors The staff at the reception is very friendly and always ready to help 
396311,Hotel Am Parkring,No Negative, The hotel is in a great place to see the centre of Vienna The room I had Single was very well equipped and clean The only issue i had was that the shower drain was blocked so when I had a shower it spilt onto the floor of the bathroom however the staff were very apologetic and when I returned in the evening it had been sorted without a fuss 
396312,Hotel Am Parkring, A bit of a bad surprise partly my fault for not reading carefully the parking cost 26 eur per day , Great view from the 13th floor Good location 5m walk to Stephansplatz Great culinary experience at the Schick restaurant 
396313,Hotel Am Parkring,No Negative, Views are incredible staff are brilliant and rooms are very clean and have amazing showers They take suggestions as well we went for my gf s birthday and they spread real rose petals on the bed for us 
396314,Hotel Am Parkring,No Negative, I loved a gentleman with prescription glasses at the front desk Not only was he a total professional but he also noticed that I was celebrating birthday the day I checked in He had box of chocolate and a bottle of wine sent to my room with a card saying happy birthday He sent a bellman to help me with parking my car from place A to place B As far as the quality of the service this hotel totally surpassed vast majority of 5 stars hotels I have ever stayed in I was given 6 star service and peoples smiles How cool is that

396318,Hotel Am Parkring, Staff helpful and professional but not overly welcoming Our room was close to a meeting reception room and although we were not disturbed by the noise the access to the room was hampered by the dinner s trolleys Wierdly enough the bathroom seemed to run out of cold water after 10pm making the shower unpleasantly hot , Location is great superb view over the city quiet place Staff discreet 
396319,Hotel Am Parkring, One day I left at 10 00am to go out and my room wasn t cleaned until 4 00pm One night there was a banging and fan noise next door that woke me up at 3 00am This continued for about an hour sounded like an extractor fan in a kitchen The breakfast was too expensive I ate out for less than half the price for a similar if not better one at a neighbouring 4 star hotel For the room rate it should have been included , The location was good and the staff were generally very helpful I thought being on the 12th floor wouldn t have been good but actually the view over the city was excellent 
396320,Hotel Am Parkring, breakfast expensive room at 11th floor close to the restaurant was noisy , Excellent location 10 minutes from the city center and close to the CAT arrival small room but nothing was missing

396325,Hotel Am Parkring, My personal myth on Viennese people being kind friendly and joyful falls in the case of this hotel The girl that checked us in just couldn t produce a smile on her face Others didn t show much enthusiasm either If you are entering garage be extra careful the pillars are scratched from cars bumping into them on entering and exiting the garage , Hotel is very centrally situated in a silent and lovely part of the city only 10 minutes stroll to main happening All rooms are at the top 3 floors of a very tall building and have a wonderful view over the city
396326,Hotel Am Parkring, the building of the hotel is modern Breakfast was good but not included in the price of the room so add 20 euro per person per night , Located In the city center very light clean and worm rooms with view over the city Very nice personal on the reception 
396327,Hotel Am Parkring, We had some difficulties with Internet connection but it was solved by reception people Newer furniture is needed for room 240 , We stay in the hotel for the second time because it is centrally but peacefully located Hotel occupies upper floors of high office building Thanks to it the rooms have great panoramic views over Vienna and no noise from transport Opera St Stephen Belvedere are nearby Wonderful breakfast with champaigne and same great view After you stay in this hotel there is no desire to try any other hotel in Vienna

396330,Hotel Am Parkring, No real minuses The only thing which may disturnb one and inspire another is that the hotel is surrounded with a number of strip bars Anyway those are quite and do not disturb anyone , We head a suit and the view was amazing with windows to two sides of the building The size of the room furniture facilities all was amazing Location is also awesome close both to the city center and Stadpark outside the Parkring It is also not far from a number of very good restaurants including Michelen star awarded Although hotel is obviously not new the furniture and bathrooms are clean in good condition Rooms contain teapot coffee machine WiFi also works excellent 
396331,Hotel Am Parkring, Staff friendliness we were pleased with staff in general but when we checked out the staff didn t even ask us how the stay was , Location close to all of major attractions With small kids proximity to places are much appreciated Hotel room we stayed in the Stephan suite Well worth it Two rooms gave us time to relax in living room after kids went to sleep Balcony gave great view of Vienna Staff recommended places to eat and explain how to get to places
396332,Hotel Am Parkring, Didn t test a rather sparse food service Fine dining restaurant but it wasn t our desire , Great value Don t expect a 5 star hotel but very high in all respects Balcony was used each morning 
396333,Hotel Am Parkring, No complains, We have stayed there several times and we re always pleased We recognize some people of the staff which always makes you feel at homeThey recognize us also very important when you are so far away from home
396334,Hotel Am Parkring, No gym or relaxation facilities though you can get these across the road , Good room with great view easy check in Good restaurant also with great view 
396335,Hotel Am Parkring, Nothing everything positive , Everything breakfast which was not mentioned above was amazing the room with the terrace and magnificent view of the city was really wonderful 
396336,Hotel Am Parkring, The building hosts some offices and only one of the three elevators goes directly to the upper stories hotel Hence if you do not take the correct elevator you can be stopped a lot, They care small details coffee and the chocolate on the pillow sleepers 
396337,Hotel Am Parkring, The breakfast is expensive and not so rich , 1 Beautiful view 2 They have early breakfast so it may be worth despite the high price other places outside open relatively late 3 We got a nice crib and presents for our kid 4 Big and light room 5 Electric kettle in the room 6 They have an option for late room cleaning so you can stay in the room in the morning 7 Quiet place 8 Electric shutters on the windows 9 Low rate late checkout 10 The hotel restaurant is open at late night the dishes are small yet

396340,Hotel Am Parkring, Elevators too small Need to wait for 15 minutes if large crowed in front of you Room is too small Bed is too small compared to four or three star hotels in the US Internet keep interrupted Towels provided are not enough No iron and board available in the room , Location The view from the room The balcony

396346,Hotel Am Parkring, The card keys did not work for the second time had to go down to the reception twice Mags Cups for hot drinks no handle so it s you cannot drink till it s cool to hold it , The view from the room A secondary door to divide bedroom and bathroom A bid two seater sofa 
396347,Hotel Am Parkring, Room booked was not available due to internal booking error Communication before hand and indeed on day of arrival could have been better as it was disappointing not to get the original room booked The initial discussions as regards next remedial action took a little time to get going , While the replacement room was a little small particularly in the bathroom the views were fantastic over the city The hotel staff particularly the manager and front of house were very helpful in the end and made our stay a very nice experience for which we thank them We were very happy with our stay and will be returning again 
396348,Hotel Am Parkring,No Negative, We loved our room on the 13th floor that had a spacious balcony It was nice to come home at the end of the day of sightseeing and be able to unwind and look over the beautiful city and it s landmarks The breakfast was outstanding a wide variety of anything that you would eat for breakfast or lunch The location was perfect 
396349,Hotel Am Parkring, Dry cleaning company ruined a shirt of mine They reluctantly paid I checked shirt was valued at 250 euro I was recompensed c 200 euro Breakfast is far too expensive We had breakfast at Gerstner for c 15 euro for the two of us , Very nice room with outstanding view 
396350,Hotel Am Parkring, The concierge information guy didn t speak English In a highly globally visited city English is almost a must for a good concierge staff member , The hotel is in a great location and the front desk staff is very friendly and helpful The gal who checked us in upgraded us from a double to a suite I would book a suite at this hotel if we ever returned to Vienna The room was spacious and had the most incredible views 
396351,Hotel Am Parkring, Breakfast was expensive and not included Probably the only negative of the whole place , Loved the balcony incredible view Incredible staff as well 
396352,Hotel Am Parkring, The balcony needed to be swept especially where there was a small dip in it with all kinds of bits of rubbish However when I reported it the matter was dealt with the same day It would have been better if there had beeen a roof over the balcony so it could have been used in the rain , Very helpful staff both on reception and at breakfast Extremely good choice of Help Yourself food at breakfast with eggs in various forms cooked to order There were also a couple of other things on the menu which could be ordered The breakfast kept me going all day so didn t need to stop for lunch They also provided Decaff coffee which was brought in a coffee jug and not from a DIY Machine Bus stops outside the hotel and Wein Mitte Station was a 6 minute walk away by going through the park across the road which was very pleasant The AC worked well and it was 38C most days
