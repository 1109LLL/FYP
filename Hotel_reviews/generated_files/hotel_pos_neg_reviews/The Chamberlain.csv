44799,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Room was lovely it was quite clean bed was comfortable facilities nice didn t have to go looking for an ironing board etc
44800,The Chamberlain, Can consider building a small gym room for exercising, Large room large toilets clean free mini bar wonderful breakfast OMG and the price is so low Just literally next to the tower bridge no where else can we find another place like this 
44801,The Chamberlain, No parking, Value for money the room decor amenities are like 5 but comes at really good price Great location just 3 mins away from Tower Hill tube station Good breakfast prepared breakfast with several selections Air conditioning Free beer small bottles of water beers in the mini bar are all complimentary nice touch 
44802,The Chamberlain, The water in the shower was not draining well, Really nice pub The staff was very nice and welcoming the location is very close to a tube station but it take a while to travel to the center 20 25 minutes 
44803,The Chamberlain, There s nothing about my experience at The Chamberlain that I did not like , Professional and friendly staff comfortable bed and modern bathroom and shower 
44804,The Chamberlain, The bathtub didn t drain properly so when having a shower we ended up with water up to our ankles , Excellent location very friendly staff clean room comfy bed and the complimentary beer in the fridge was a nice touch 
44805,The Chamberlain, no eggs except scrambled or salmon left left when we came down to breakfast with an hour of breakfast service to go , we were upgraded to an executive room which was very nice The king bed was really comfortable 
44806,The Chamberlain, The lift was broken one morning fixed after a couple of hours , A lovely message welcoming my wife and myself on our anniversary The room was excellent with a large balcony Every single member of Staff was very friendly and helpful

44809,The Chamberlain, Breakfast was quite slow but tasty and room was cleaned only late in the afternoon , Decent size room good beds and shower Great location of the venue 
44810,The Chamberlain, As the room was facing the street it was quite noisy at night therefore sleeping was a bit difficult, The room was fantastic with the bed being very comfortable and AC being great 
44811,The Chamberlain, Nothing everything was great , I was very fortunate when I checked in to be upgraded to a Deluxe Room which was a great way to end the last few days of a combined work and holiday trip The Chamberlain is fantastic I had to stay at a supposed 5 Star hotel around the corner and The Chamberlain is definitely far superior The room was great and had plenty of space fantastic bathroom with an amazing shower Comfortable bed with power outlets right beside the bed including USB plugs To top it all off though is breakfast not a buffet of congealed eggs bacon and beans but being able to order off a menu there is a small buffet but that is for fruit pastries juice and cereals The other part I loved about the hotel is that all the staff are so friendly and helpful and look happy to be working there Even through it is in the city and near bars and restaurants it is very quiet and they have blackout curtains so you can have a great sleep in if you need it You also get two free beers in the fridge or cider if you ask each day of your stay along with a bottle of still and sparkling water and fresh milk to make a coffee in your Nespresso coffee machine It s also close to transport and The Tower of London I will definitely stay at The Chamberlain again and am also trying to get it included as somewhere to stay for corporate travel instead of the other hotel we have to use 
44812,The Chamberlain, Accomodation is already expensive in London and I do not like to pay extra for breakfast Breakfast should be included into rates Some road noise , Christopher and reception staff was perfect Thank you 
44813,The Chamberlain, No complaints or negatives Really picky but fruit salad at breakfast wasn t great That s the best thing I can come up with, Reception lady during our stay made the weekend from tha second we arrived Friendly helpful informative
44814,The Chamberlain, It was a bit noisy but that was mainly due to other guests being inconsiderate and slamming doors Also there was quite a bit of light coming in from the halls as the gap at the bottom of the door was a bit big , The location was brilliant and the room was bigger then I expected The food was delicious especially the ale soaked sticky toffee pudding and I loved the fact that breakfast was chosen from a menu instead of a buffet as is common in most hotels now Also I requested an early check in and my room was ready when I arrived The staff were wonderful and I received a lovely welcome 
44815,The Chamberlain, Continental breakfast could have more variances although extra dishes were available for extra payment , Loved the service and comfort of my room and specifically bed Felt like at home 
44816,The Chamberlain, Embarrassing that our friends room was much much smaller than ours with a smaller bed and only a shower then when querying whether these were the two luxury rooms I had booked being told their room was an upgrade to a deluxe room The description definitely says the deluxe is a more spacious room with Super King bed Having sent e mail as advised by receptionist to the manager with this complaint after 6 days still no reply , Heavenly bed like sleeping on a cloud Our room was exceptionally spacious luxury room Having a bath and shower is a bonus especially when cutting it fine for dinner in the heart of the city having been to a matinee performance 
44817,The Chamberlain,No Negative, The staff was exceptional Very friendly outgoing and helpful Room was very nice and well equipped Bathroom was superb Large with the best shower ever Food in restaurant was very good and service was excellent Would definitely stay again 
44818,The Chamberlain, There were some issues with the bathroom faucet , Excellent breakfast Room came with robes and slippers Also you were encouraged to take advantage of the two complimentary bottles of beer from the mini bar Available each day of our stay 
44819,The Chamberlain, Very late checkin at 3pm so couldn t get into central London til nearly 4 not great to make the most of a weekend break, Nice room good bathroom
44820,The Chamberlain, Nothing, We had a very friendly welcome from the lady on the desk The room was fantastic really modern Breakfast was delicious Great transport links will definitely return 
44821,The Chamberlain, Room on 1st floor could listen to the underground Room a bit small Cost new bed but old furniture , Very cosy bed Free of charge coffee tea and water in the room Nice breakfast 
44822,The Chamberlain, Check in could have been a bit more personal and individual , Chocolate Brownie in the restaurant was super tasty Thank you for your flexibility in opening hours 
44823,The Chamberlain, More coffee and tea at breakfast, Breakfast was good cooked fresh The fresh milk in the fridge in the room was very welcome why don t all hotels do this 
44824,The Chamberlain, Check in is from 3pm according to the web but when we arrived at 3 45 we were told that no rooms were available and that the 3pm check in just meant you could check in after that time it didn t mean that a room would be available We eventually got into room at 4 30 , Fairly quiet area yet very close to Tower Hill and the City Room not large but adequate and fairly standard for central London I guess 
44825,The Chamberlain, Had to wait half an hour to check in even though we told hotel in advance what time we were arriving Had to wait 45 minutes for our breakfast to arrive in the restaurant and had to tell two different members of staff We could hear what we presume was the underground trains going past every 5 mins and we were on the first floor Wouldn t advise light sleepers to stay as they were very noisy Wouldn t describe our room as deluxe like it says on the website also quite old fashioned , The breakfast was lovely and breakfast in bed service was great Room was clean and bed was very comfy Bathroom was lovely and the shower was fab Staff very helpful 
44826,The Chamberlain, The cooked breakfast was a disappointment as the streaky bacon was more fat than meat the black pudding was cold the mushroom and tomato were swimming in oil so not eatable was not asked if there was an issue so just left it the toast was fabulous as were the croissant, The room was spacious more so than usual London room The bed comfortable the temp of the room was spot on and controllable The shower did not have a detachable hose my personal thing the towels were huge and so fluffy Quiet room so great sleep
44827,The Chamberlain, We ordered breakfast in the room so we could eat on the balcony but it wasn t very warm when it got to us No big complaint though but we d probably eat in the restaurant next time , Good location just around the corner from tower Hill and one of the major hop on hop off stops we had a balcony room which was great it wasn t the best weather so maybe a parasol would have been useful Room was clean free drinks in the minibar and snacks were nice Bar area was really nice and if you sign up to Fullers email you get a free drink voucher reception staff were some of the nicest ones I ve ever met Would go back again 
44828,The Chamberlain, The hotel lobby is somewhat dated Although the front desk staff were very helpful the hotel supplied little in the way of flyers etc regarding London tourist attractions , Upon check in We received a room upgrade Staff was friendly and professional This hotel is located just a short walk for the Tower Hill Underground stop The hotel operates a quality pub on the ground floor Centrally located there are a number of good restaurant and pub options within easy walking distanepce 
44829,The Chamberlain,No Negative, I liked that when we booked the room we mentioned it was for our honeymoon and they gave us a complimentary upgraded room with champagne and desert with notes to enjoy our honeymoon It was a wonderful personal touch that we did not expect but loved it 
44830,The Chamberlain, purely picking holes just to say something here no Earl Grey teabags in the room , Excellent receptionists good information complimentary drinks in the room quiet good curtains ensured good quality sleep comfortable bed good toiletries and towels All in all a surprisingly nice hotel 
44831,The Chamberlain, The breakfast was very basic just pastries and coffee , The location was great very close to Tower Bridge The room was spacious the bed was confortable and since the hotel belongs to a brewery they had free beers in the mini bar This is a classic old school hotel but does not miss anything one would expect from a modern hotel In fact the internet connection was faster than in most business hotels I have been to 
44832,The Chamberlain, The pub part of the Chamberlain is very blokey but that s what you expect in a city pub Not really a criticism just not my kind of thing , Large and stylish room big bed well appointed bathroom with large fluffy towels excellent shower and toiletries Cleanliness and attention to detail of the housekeeping staff was extremely good 
44833,The Chamberlain, We couldn t book breakfast on the day Sunday morning it needed to be booked the day before This is not a negative remark on the Hotel it was entirely our fault for being indecisive , The Hotel was very homely and the staff lovely and the fact that there s a pub always a bonus Rooms were great with comfortable beds Location was brilliant 
44834,The Chamberlain, Late food was quite cumbersome to order and get and in addition quality and price does not fit with the rest of the hotel too bad , Excellent location inbetween of three underground stations 5 minute walk to Tower Bridge Small but nice room good value for money Excellent renovated bathroom Very nice staff and several amenities in the room make you feel welcomed They do have a bar which is open late for guests but not for outside people In addition several nice places are located within a few meters walking distance Can certainly recommend for staying 
44835,The Chamberlain, Breakfast was a bit chaotic on the Thursday ran out of juice and only one waitress running around doing her best Bit better on Friday although a different waitress got our order wrong Fridge not working properly in the room as our milk went off on both days, Being upgraded to a room with the roof terrace with cake and bubbly to celebrate our wedding anniversary and a really comfy bed Fantastic friendly staff nothing was too much trouble Free extras in the room biscuits water fresh milk beers and fudge were much appreciated Air con was a bonus especially as we were there during the heatwave Great location especially for evenings with bars restaurants and the river near by 
44836,The Chamberlain, The location was very close to the Tower of London and the Thames but during the weekend the area is too calm and quiet far away from shops and places of interest , Very nice Hotel with a Filler pub inside very clean comfortable room everything needed was inside even a wonderful Nespresso machine 
44837,The Chamberlain, The price but can t grumble too much , Nice rooms with all the mod cons Great locations and friendly staff Attached bar and restaurant was useful too 
44838,The Chamberlain, The window in the room was very high up and therefore no view A lot of noise from the room above on the third floor I reported this to the reception staff at check out and no apologies were made It was laughed off The breakfast was extra charge and it was 16 pounds which was far too expensive for what was presented , Location was good It was only minutes from Aldridge tube
44839,The Chamberlain,No Negative, A great hotel which was fantastic value for money Within a few minutes od the nearest tube stop and a 5 minute walk from the tower of London The room was very comfortable and had great amenities 
44840,The Chamberlain, Some areas of the hotel needed touching up repairs but overall quite well maintained Only sandwiches with crisps for room service after 10pm No food places convenient to the hotel open later on a weekend Would love to see some more environmentally friendly procedures in place , Extremely convenient location for us close to Tower of London public transport 5min walk from 2 underground stations and the inner city Friendly staff Photos reasonably representative of rooms Clean rooms 
44841,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Laura at breakfast was great very pleasant and so helpful why are all waiting staff not like her Breakfast was excellent so much choice and good quality too The guy on the front desk was also good welcoming and friendly Loved the free beer in the fridge
44842,The Chamberlain, Nothing bad we d absolutely stay here again , We got a great deal on a last minute booking The room was spacious with a comfortable bed and separate bathtub shower in the bathroom Oh and the contents of the minibar were included in the room rate The staff were very understanding about us being slightly late checking out Best of all we were lucky enough to get a top floor room with a roof balcony so we ordered a huge breakfast to our room and ate outside in the sunshine 
44843,The Chamberlain, Honestly I cannot find any fault to The Chamberlain , Loved this place so much that I am going back next time I am in London Ok not super cheap but then again this is London and I have been to some seriously run down places paying this rate or more The room was beautiful the bed extra comfy and the breakfast brilliant You get a lots of freebies in the room including beer and Nespresso coffee Furthermore because it s a property owned by Fuller s there s a pub on the ground floor with a very nice menu and interesting and diverse patrons 
44844,The Chamberlain, Nothing , The room was comfortable The amenities in the room and in the toilet were excellent All items in the room bar were free including two beer bottles daily Aniko at the reception was outstanding Really went out of her way to make our stay memorable From arranging packed breakfast to helping me book excess baggage for my return flight Will definitely stay here when I am in London next
44845,The Chamberlain, The only issue we had was it being very hot The door was open and the thermostat was on the lowest but it didn t make any difference It really didn t ruin anything though just a minor detail , We got upgraded to the balcony room and it was so beautiful Nice and modern with a homely touch The bathroom was great too Couldn t recommend it enough 
44846,The Chamberlain, Leaving Especially as it rained as we left , The staff were excellent The room and bathroom were spacious well designed and spotless Of course the Fullers beer was perfect The breakfast was excellent I couldn t fault our stay at the Chamberlain 
44847,The Chamberlain, We took the breakfast included with the room It was not bad it covered the basics but it could probably be improved with some warm options too like eggs and bacon for example You can always order additional things for an extra cost , Big room very comfortable and clean The bahtroom was also quite big offering both a shower and bathtub The location is great close to the Tower Bridge London Tower and also close to two metro stops made getting around very easy Everything in the minibar was complimentary so that was a nice touch We really didn t miss anything for our long weekend stay 
44848,The Chamberlain, breakfast was ok but not great especially the continental buffet next to nothing there and the service was very slow and not too friendly Had better in cheaper hotels so that was a bit of a letdown, great room especially because of the upgrade i received Good beds complimentary mini bar nice looking room with good coffee in the room 
44849,The Chamberlain, Room was a bit dated The carpet flooring in my room wasn t entirely even , Since I was travelling for business location was really important to me The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of both Tower Hill and Aldgate stations There were a number of eateries restaurants and cafes in the area The Tower Bridge was within walking distance

44881,The Chamberlain, Nothing , Fabulous hotel easily one of the best I have stayed in Me and my wife were given a upgrade with a room with a rooftop terrace which was unexpected we also had a mini fridge with complimentary beers water and milk that was a real nice touch The hotel Lobby and pub had a real rustic feel but the room was very modern with everything you expect and more The location is fantastic as well and it is so easy to get to all the main tourist attractions It is right by the Skygarden which was great as we planned to spend our Ssturday night there also thrre is a DLR line a 2 minute walk away that was perfect as we were going to see s concert in the 02 on Sunday We also had breakfast included and this was also of a very high standard so overall this was a fantastic experience and I would definitely look to stay in this hotel again the next time I visit London 
44882,The Chamberlain, All worked pretty well Limited facilities but no problem as I arrived late and left early , Room quite spacious by London standards smart and clean Comfortable bed Friendly helpful staff 
44883,The Chamberlain, The staff could have been more attentive in the restaurant it wasnt a busy evening we were asked if we wanted any condiments which we did then the waitress forgot to bring them , A very welcome Mini Bar extremely clean very comfortable room
44884,The Chamberlain, The tea tray was in an odd place and not easy to access but no big deal , Free drinks in the minibar was a very nice touch The bathroom was great The location is very good if you need to be in the city It was also quite quiet even if near a fairly busy road

44891,The Chamberlain, Breakfast on first day was poor and we complained also bringing a few other issues to the Managers attention He apologised and promised to sort out the problems These issues were rectified and the next day breakfast was much better , Friendly staff
44892,The Chamberlain,No Negative, The bathroom was really spacious I know that sounds like a strange thing to say but as someone who has stayed at a lot of hotels and a fair few in London I wasn t really expecting such a good sized bathroom they re usually a glorified cupboard even when they re nice and they do the job The room was already good for the price in London 
44893,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Really excellent staff and beautiful rooms with all the facilities that are useful for a city break with minimal luggage Great breakfast The location in the City isn t that exciting but very close to two tube stations so convenient to get anywhere else you want to go 
44894,The Chamberlain, We had to wait a little bit longer for our breakfast than hoped although the staff kept us informed of the delay so not a problem The selection was great and not just your standard cooked breakfast , The warm welcome and reception area were fantastic The facilities excellent and the decor of our room was wonderful Especially the bathroom We were so taken by it we are going to redecorate our bathroom the same way 
44895,The Chamberlain, Restaurant stuff can be a little bit slow sometimes , Most delicious breakfast in London with vegetarian options You have to be prepared for some waiting but it s absolutely understandable as it is freshly cooked which is marvelous Food in the restaurant is also really good not to pricey And the whole atmosphere is great Free beer in the fridge was really really nice 
44896,The Chamberlain, Nothing could have been better, Lovely room very comfortable beds Fullers beer in mini fridge was an unexpected bonus and free Breakfast was very good 
44897,The Chamberlain, Service at breakfast was very slow There were not many options for breakfast except for the warm menu , Room was good sized and clean Location is good if you are on business in the city but not very charming Very close to many bus and metro stations 
44898,The Chamberlain, The only thing that wasn t a wow at this hotel was the noise not from outside which was a bit rowdy on Saturday night but when you re in the heart of a major world city that s understandable This was noise from inside the hotel we could hear babies crying heavy footsteps from the room above us and so on , The room was very nicely appointed they paid attention to small details like a soft close toilet seat The hotel has a very cozy feeling with classic wood trim and old photographs and engravings The hotel bar next door had fantastic staff thanks Rob and Laura and a solid menu Location was great too just a short walk from two Tube stations and the Tower of London 
44899,The Chamberlain, Some stair carpet was showing sign of age, Room upgrade request for quiet room honoured Modern bathroom and facilities Fresh milk in fridge for morning tea
44900,The Chamberlain, The pub was out of the scotch egg which my husband really wanted not a catastrophe as it seemed like this happened in other locations items on menu not available Other than that no complaints We will be back , Location is great We were flying in and out of City airport and also had business at the Excel Center The hotel is about 3 minutes from the DLR In addition the underground to Tower Hill is right there too so you can get to the central London areas really fast There are lots of pubs and restaurants around the area We arrived at 9am so I asked if we could leave our bags and come back for check in This was easy to do and the front desk agent let us know that the room would be ready at 10 if we wanted to wait she also offered coffee and tea We asked for a quiet room and we got a courtyard facing room on the 2nd floor The corner room was quite spacious and we loved the bottled water and Fuller s beer We had complimentary breakfast which was also great Cold item buffet along with a cooked selection of your choice The front desk gave us a coupon for 5 pounds off of dinner but we didn t have time to try will next time for sure We will definitely be back on our next trip to London 
44901,The Chamberlain, Our breakfast took us an hour to be served and was not great quality but did not ruin our stay at all, Everything was great fantastic room shower was amazing and comfy bed Really good value for money and location was excellent
44902,The Chamberlain,No Negative, The hotel was perfect from the welcome at reception the friendliness of the staff the amazingly comfortable and luxurious bedroom the cozy bar the first class breakfast and the overall ambience and atmosphere I will definitely stay there again and recommend the hotel to others it far exceeded any expectations I may have had 
44903,The Chamberlain, The staff on reception were quite dismissive and didn t even ask how our stay was As it happens the stay wasn t that great it was really very noisy outside the hotel the bed wasn t very comfortable and the shower was lukewarm There was also a hair in the shower , The decoration in the rooms and there was a free bar in the room 
44904,The Chamberlain,No Negative, The room was so lovely and the bed and duvet were the most comfortable I have ever experienced I love the fact that everything in the minibar fridge is free what a generous and welcoming treat The whole feel of the hotel was very cozy and not like a boring commercial Marriott at all The food in the pub was also delicious and the serving staff excellent 
44905,The Chamberlain, Our only complaint would be that the lighting in the room and bathroom was not satisfactory to put on make up I did struggle Please listen to this We ladies need lots of light, I lovely hotel very friendly staff we ate in the bar restaurant and our food was excellently presented and tasty Our room was superb 
44906,The Chamberlain, Can t fault this hotel facilities , Fabulous rooms larger than the average Lots of complimentary extras not usually included Spotlessly clean Staff very helpful Breakfast very good value for money when booked beforehand 
44907,The Chamberlain, The dressing gowns provided had seen better days but a very minor point , We travelled as a group of 5 for a hen weekend The staff were accommodating from the moment we arrived and were able to check us into one of our rooms an hour early so we could drop our bags and go to the first activity we had booked The rooms were lovely and clean and the beds were comfortable The shower was fantastic The cooked breakfast in the morning was delicious It was all brought out at the same time even though we all ordered different things off the menu The staff were attentive and would bring top up of tea coffee and toast The location worked perfectly for us being a short walk away from Tower Hill station and all the activities we had booked Brilliant value for money it exceeded our expectations 
44908,The Chamberlain, Heating system could be better and a moving shower head would be better than the stationary one Also better lighting in the rooms , Great value and great location
44909,The Chamberlain, The climate control in the bedroom was very erratic hard to control and erred on the side of too hot , I think they ve refurbished since I was last there I stayed a few times years ago but started trying other places as it was getting a bit run down This trip was much better Very comfortable bed Good bathroom Helpful staff The restaurant is British pub style food but is well done 
44910,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Room on the small side but well decorated and the bed was comfy The hotel is in the middle of two stations Aldgate and Tower of London making it quite a good base for moving around the city Nice area for walking about Breakfast was a combination of a la cart and buffet if included in the room rate 
44911,The Chamberlain, The mattress was uncomfortable the doors slamming from the other rooms kept us up , The staff at reception were really friendly and the hotel is really well located 
44912,The Chamberlain, The room needed a little TLC The hot tap in the bath didn t work the carpet had a large ridge in it across the room making it a trip hazard in the dark , We have stay here every time we come into London it is a fantastic hotel 
44913,The Chamberlain, A problem with milk in the fridge which shouldn t have occurred but it was sorted , We were upgraded to a lovely deluxe king and a bottle of prosecco and cake delivered to our room for my birthday The breakfast was excellent and plenty of choices from continental to full English Staff were helpful and pleasant room service was good 
44914,The Chamberlain, Only one pillow for two on the double bed but for request we got another pillow no problem , Nice hotel in a good location near to Aldgate and Tower Hill tube stations with really friendly staff Brick Lane s curry places in walking distance Nice pub downstairs used also as the restaurant of the hotel Breakfast is ordered from a list

44918,The Chamberlain, Nothing especially , Nice rooms not too big but well equipped and quiet and clean Gives good value for money Staff is friendly and helpful Nice pub comes with the hotel
44919,The Chamberlain, The location is in the middle of the financial district which is away from all the fun places in town Be prepared to travel to other parts of town for late night dinner or alike , Quiet and clean the staff is very helpful 
44920,The Chamberlain, Lack of an hairdryer, The kindness of all the staff Nice breakfast Amazing location and really close to Tower Hill and Aldgate underground stations
44921,The Chamberlain,No Negative, We really enjoyed our two night stay staff were wonderful and we loved all the little extras in the room we couldn t have asked for anything more 
44922,The Chamberlain, If I could pick on thing to improve on I would say it would be replace the reception stairs and hall carpet as looking a little tired now but I am being picky , Location is Superb Fridge in the room is fantastic and I really like having a bottle of water fresh milk free beer in there 
44923,The Chamberlain, The pub was extremely busy on both Thursday and Friday evenings which was to be expected just before christmas with works parties and drink sessions so it was a bit awkward if you wanted to eat there with any degree of comfort , The hotel was exactly as advertised regarding the room we booked i e not a photo of one room and then shoved in a box room The staff were all brilliant and friendly One recent review on trip advisor criticised the breakfast This is a hotel pub not a swanky restaurant everything was well cooked plentiful and good quality We will definitely return 
44924,The Chamberlain, There s nothing we didn t like The only minor thing that could be improved on is that the television reception wasn t brilliant , The staff at reception are always friendly professional The bedrooms bathrooms have been beautifully decorated are always immaculate The beds are just so comfortable 
44925,The Chamberlain, Not crucial but might have been easier if tea coffee was available from a dispenser rather than having to request refills from staff , Breakfast was excellent and specially enjoyed the porridge Good choice of cooked food Staff very helpful and attentive
44926,The Chamberlain, Evening meal could have had more choice of menu , Bedroom a good size and very comfortable Well equipped Breakfast was cooked to order and excellent quality All the staff were very helpful 
44927,The Chamberlain, Nothing Would definitely stay here in future , Friendly staff good size room with complementary mini bar and accessories excellent full English breakfast and very quiet even with the pub attached Close to transport and leisurely stroll to the Tower of London

44929,The Chamberlain, The menu choice, The whole experience was excellent room was very nice and the bed and bedding was so snuggly The shower was superb I could have stayed under it all day 
44930,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Excellent prepared breakfast including Full English or authentic Eggs Benedict amongst other things Excellent staff always courteous and willing to help Regularly stay for business and will continue to do so 
44931,The Chamberlain, Nothing negative to report , Excellent service particularly as we had to move rooms due to a problem in the ensuite Free breakfast offered as compensation as well as reduction in rate as we had to downgrade 
44932,The Chamberlain, Nothing , I booked for 11 people and we all enjoyed our stay Spotlessly clean room comfy bed lots of hot water from the shower and the best towels It was nice to have an English breakfast cooked to order it makes a change from having everything as a buffet available at many hotels nowadays 
44933,The Chamberlain, Restaurant no table service, Rooms were good size and layout but already showing wear toilet lock hanging out and mould appearing around the tiles Location was good for my meeting 
44934,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Fantastic hotel comfy beds beautiful breakfast and a great wine list in the bar I have stayed in some of the best hotels in London and this is by far the best value for money Book in advance though as it gets quite expensive the closer you get 
44935,The Chamberlain, On a sat sun the nightlife dwindles Lovely mon Fri , Clean room and mini bar that was free and you could store your own items in staff very helpful and friendly 
44936,The Chamberlain, The room door s lets through a lot of light at the bottom I covered it with pillows at the bottom to sleep better But I am a sensitive sleeper so this might not bother anyone else The toilet handle was broken and flushed with difficulty I think they should take a look at that , The hotel was stunning From the moment we walked in which was around 12 20 am the staff was extremely friendly The hotel was very clean especially the room And the food was stunning particularly the breakfast Everything was perfect and when I return to London which I do every year I would not stay at any other place ever again Plus I received a voucher for a complimentary drink which was really kind of the hotel And the fact that they don t feel like one of those large chain brand hotels but had a cosy British feel to it tops it off The location is great So central to everything Best time I had so far in London 
44937,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Very well managed hotel Facilities and room were high quality and comfortable and even the parts that were perhps a bit older like the carpet were well maintained and clean Staff were all very professional and friendly and seemed to enjoy working there They were wery helpful and everything was easy and quick I had breakfast in bed and it was very good 
44938,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Room spacious and beautiful The room was not business like or clinical at all Shower warm and powerful Very comfortable 5 mins walk to Tower of London Excellent location Like a country pub hotel in a city setting Reception lady was lovely and bubbly 
44939,The Chamberlain, 1 We checked in early in the morning and dropped our stuff at the reception When we came back to get our keys in the afternoon the receptionist gave us the keys of the other person s room in which we found personal belongings widely open etc The explanation at the reception knocked us off It must have happened due to your late check in Moreover we did not receive any proof of payment or pre authorisation Thus we got another room which did not have a bath tub which was displayed on the booking page 2 The next day we asked for a cab at the reception and we got a black taxi price wise maybe it is the same thus let it be Since we went to the Paddington station the receptionist must have thought that we had left the hotel thus he or his colleague checked us out In the evening when we returned our keys did not work so we had to inquire to activate them Because of this checking out procedure without any notice we were informed next morning that breakfast was not included into the room price anymore What a pain 3 On the day of departure the receptionist withdrew the amount for the 3rd night meaning that we had to pay twice to the banks for the international transactions etc We were lucky as she was smart and gave us a discount of 50 pounds We are very thankful for that but that does not change the fact that there was very poor service of the remaining part of the receptionists there 4 When we returned to collect our stuff on the day of departure the receptionist number I do not know which was loudly discussing his points of view concerning the EU and the UK matters with Polish guests who just arrived to check in He was so involved in explaining his point of being an independent islander that we were forced to listen to all that and wait when this person would finally return our belongings to us Thanks to him we had to run to the DLR station , There is a bunch of things we did not like or could not like but it is worth mentioning full English breakfast which was just great 
44940,The Chamberlain, Unfortunately I think that some dirty fat that a burger was cooked in caused me to have an upset stomach until Sunday It didn t taste right at the time but foolishly I ate it because it was late and I was hungry , It is perfectly placed for my office and has the right atmosphere for what i want 
44941,The Chamberlain, We ate in the attached Fullers restaurant which we thought wasn t particularly good quality for the money , Although not big the room was lovely and nicely decorated with a traditional but quality feel about the place staff were very friendly and couldn t do enough for us The bed was very comfortable and location was nice and quiet The cooked breakfast was excellent and breakfast menu choice fantastic The location for central London and the theatre s and museums isn t great as its two changes on the tube but for the Tower and Greenwich it couldn t be better We used the river clipper service from Tower pier to get about which is a short walk away We will definitely stay here again 
44942,The Chamberlain, Better staff could elevate this hotel to a whole new level Was surprised to hear unprofessional behavior jokes comments , Location nice rooms clean 
44943,The Chamberlain, Small and noisy room Not even close to what luxury room is Dirty carpet with smell of moist Dirty bathroom floor especially behind the door Water in bathtub wasn t draining properly filling in the bathtub while I was taking a shower Old noisy plumbing My room was on the first floor facing the street and Abbey club which was busy on the other side my door was facing the door to the lifts so I could here everyone getting in or out I thought from the pictures here that I would have a nespresso machine in my room but I was impolitely proved wrong by the tired front desk girl that her shift was off , The location was good since the metro station is only 5min walk 
44944,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Lovely room very snug warm Even with adjustable heating Although large windows to open Mini bar stocked with water beer milk complimentary 
44945,The Chamberlain, Nothing, Great atmosphere fabulous room fresh milk in fridge with 2 complimentary beers and bottled still and sparkling water Numerous toiletries Everything you could possibly want Very reasonable 24hour room service Staff so helpful 
44946,The Chamberlain, We had one dinner in the near Fueller pub nice place and we waited almost one hour to be served A little unpleasant episode during two perfect day A pity Surely only a case , Very good position near Tower Hill underground station circle line Charming hotel with very comfortable room Clean and silent Good rate quality price Suggested for fun or job staying The Staff is really kind 
44947,The Chamberlain, Finishings in the bathroom Not neat and dated especially against the rest of the room Reception too busy on arrival for one person Needed another person on call to help when needed , Supper comfy beds Great powerful and hot showers with deep bath Clean location very close to transport links and tourist hot spots of Tower Bridge and Tower of London pudding Lane and Fire of London monument Room decor was lovely and modern Fresh pint of milk for tea and coffee kept in a lovely cold mini bar Breakfast in bed available for a romantic morning loads of great little touches that really make it unique and personal in a very anonymous city 
44948,The Chamberlain, shower instead of bath, clean rooms Location close to subway Aldgate Tower hill within walking distance citybikes docking around the corner Good breakfast
44949,The Chamberlain, the bfast was rubbish continental bfast was shocking fried bfast was drenched in oil and made me feel sick all day not good value for money the food really is bad you have been warned, shower was excellent
44950,The Chamberlain, staff at reception would look more professional if wearing uniform and there was an issue with our payment that meant a slow check in , Room was really nice and spacious and large bathroom with a lovely shower
44951,The Chamberlain,No Negative, We arrived very early for check in about 12pm The staff checked for a free room for us and upgraded us from a standard double to a room with a gorgeous balcony free of charge Very secure as you need your room key to activate lift 5 minute walk from nearest tube and across the road from tower of London yet very quiet and no Street noise Room very clean and cleaned to perfection every day Staff observed do not disturb signs and waited til we left for housekeeping Shower fantastic and balcony was icing on the cake Would 100 recommended and stay again

44975,The Chamberlain, Nothing, Friendly staff excellent room with great shower all facilities were very good It was close to the tube and at weekend in a quieter part of London

44977,The Chamberlain,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful The main lift was out of order however there was a service lift which was perfectly usable The management informed me about the lift as soon as I checked in and provided complimentary beers for the inconvenience The tube station is just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel There s both a small Tesco store as well as another store that sells SIM cards drinks chips etc Many good restaurants and cafes around the hotel Enjoyed my stay there and would definitely stay there again

44980,The Chamberlain, Stop the drip on the shower that went on through the night , A well located hotel close to Tower Bridge and the London Tower Very close to shops bus stops Aldgate and Tower Hill tube stops and Tower Gateway DLR station All the open top bus tour buses stop round the corner too 
44981,The Chamberlain, A little note in the bathroom might be helpful to find the hair dryer in one of the drawers in the living room , We found the Chamberlain Hotel during our stay a very pleasant place only a few minutes walk from the Tower the Tower Hill Underground Station and DLR The staff members were very friendly and helpful We liked the clean and quiet room the comfortable bed also the coffee tea making facilites The excellent breakfast choice provided a good basis for the day 
44982,The Chamberlain, The room would get hot at times which made it uncomfortable even with the AC on which didn t really cool the room that well , Excellent location only 5 minutes walk to tower bridge Underground only a 2 minute walk The adjoining pub is good and food was very good Sunday roast Rooms had good tea and coffee facilities as well as water and a beer all complimentary Would definitely return Even got a free upgrade on my room which was good 
44983,The Chamberlain, Room service manu I didn t like that the menu changes in while day period The choices before 10 pm are different from after 10 pm and I couldn t order what I want , Friendly staff comfortable rooms quite hotel good location easy to find taxes and 3 minutes away of metro and bus stations 
44984,The Chamberlain, The main elevator was under repairs so it was either the stairs or the service elevator On the plus side we did get a free beer at the bar for our pains , Very nice English breakfast at the hotel s restaurant this was some of the best black pudding I ever had Free beer in the room s fridge was a nice touch too The reception had a selection of prepaid SIMs which was very convenient Proximity to the Liverpool station and hence to the Stansted Express was a definite plus too Overall this was the most enjoyable stay I had in London for a long time 
44985,The Chamberlain, Breakfast menu could do with a bit more variety food was nice but not much choice if you didn t like eggs , Staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly Rooms were clean and very comfortable
44986,The Chamberlain, Breakfast could have been better And by breakfast I mean tomatoes Not good But otherwise no complaints at all , The staff at reception and in the restaurant were friendly and very helpful The room was spacious lots of light very good facilities Great location with easy access to public transport just a short walk to Tower Hill tube or an even shorter walk to Aldgate 
44987,The Chamberlain, It was all great , The bathroom and bed were amazing The staff were very friendly and gave us a complimentary brownie for my girlfriend s birthday The breakfast in bed option was also a personal highlight 
44988,The Chamberlain, It was great to return to this Hotel and it lived up to our expectations We were upgraded not sure why and this certainly added to the enjoyment , Staff
44989,The Chamberlain, The lift broke whilst I was there I had to climb 3 flights of stairs not easy when one needs a walking stick as I do Could not open windows Building inside very worn, room very comfortable had everything that I needed 
44990,The Chamberlain, Noise from tube as we were on the 1st floor Bath towel had slight smell of vinegar , Fridge with cold drinks was appreciated in the hot weather Choice of breakfast was good served by very cheerful staff 
44991,The Chamberlain,No Negative, We arrived after a 23 hour flight to a warm welcome and delighted that we d been upgraded to a penthouse room with fabulous views over London The hotel is located within walking distance to The Tower of London and Tower Bridge
44992,The Chamberlain, Shower head is not height adjustable , Great staff cozy British atmosphere Located about 5 7 minutes walking distance to Aldgate Underground station and the tower of London Pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the breakfast Wifi quality also better than what I ve come to expect from the regular hotel 
44993,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Great location steps away from the Tower Bridge Super nice staff who checked us in earlier upgraded our room to deluxe double room and gave us two drinks for free in the hotel pub to compensate the inconvenience created by the renovation of the lift The room and showers were nice and clean Breakfast was good we had English breakfast a la carte but also they had continental buffet We enjoyed it a lot 
44994,The Chamberlain, The breakfast arrangements you had to order a cooked breakfast put pressure on a stretched staff The buffet was modest but OK The room had a window looking onto a services courtyard but there was no opening part room had AC however , The jaded grandeur offered glimpses of a hotel that has seen better times The bath was nice 
44995,The Chamberlain, Access to the room and lifts are a little tedious , Helpful courteous staff My early check in request was met with good effort by the Office Manager I liked his gesture to offer me a coffee whilst waiting for my room 
44996,The Chamberlain, Wall was a little thin or perhaps our location was not ideal we were right near the lift and could hear people walking around , The bar staff were amazing The food was delicious The room was very clean and modern 
44997,The Chamberlain,No Negative, We had a lovely night Thankyou for everything And Thankyou for the complimentary wine birthday card for my girlfriend it was so kind of you Much appreciated
44998,The Chamberlain, I didn t like the hotel policy of no smoking They are very smug in their belief of this hence they will never again get my custom The Grange City hotel is much better cleaner and has a good customer focus and they have a good attitude towards smokers, Not much
44999,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Lovely comfy bed we got upgraded for free as it was our anniversary complimentary drinks as the lift was out of order Fresh milk in the rooms and not the uht so an added bonus Would definitely stay again
45000,The Chamberlain, Breakfast is quite pricey compared to other places around so we decided not to take it but eat in the city , The bar restaurant in the hotel was very nice The main elevator was being refurbished so we received a complimentary drink on the house 
45001,The Chamberlain,No Negative, We loved everything The staff were very friendly and welcoming the room was very clean and had lots of space though no drawers for clothes the bathroom was one of the nicest we ve ever been in with a great shower if a wee bit small a separate tub big fluffy towels The hotel provides a complimentary in house beer and water in the mini fridge which is replenished every day It s mid way between two tube stops Aldgate and Tower Hill so is convenient to everywhere There s lots of restaurants around so you don t have to eat in the hotel restaurant but the food there is really good the triple cooked chips were addicting It s our new go to hotel for future visits to London 
45002,The Chamberlain, We were given complimentary drinks as part of our stay and when I asked one member of staff about it he became very judgemental about it Also the room service had quite a price to it and was surprised to see that they added 2 50 on for bringing to the room I thought 18 50 was already enough for 2 cheese panini s and 2 bags of crisps, Everything was perfect but 2 minor things
45003,The Chamberlain, Room was a bit dated Didn t like the way they bring tea coffee and half cooked bread at breakfast then you have to wait 10 mins before breakfast is served , Staff were very helpful
45004,The Chamberlain, Kitchen slow didn t come close First night we decided to have dinner there We managed to get served before a large group of 30 came in and only 2 waiting staff on Waited for ages before dessert which definitely wasn t worth waiting for First morning we came down and someone had already used our room number which was a bit worrying There was no issue with us getting served and thankfully no issues with that the remaining 2 days A long wait between ordering breakfast and getting breakfast Not much choice for the continental breakfast fruit salads looked like they were sitting in a gallon of juice Pastries didn t get topped up once they d ran out First morning we got asked if we wanted toast the remaining two mornings we didn t Second morning asked for pancakes they didn t have any Why because they d ran out of flour How does a kitchen run out of flour Third morning ask for pancakes 20 minutes later I don t know what was put in front of us but it wasn t pancakes More like deep fried lumps of lard which were solid And because it was streaky bacon it was more raw than crispy So first time I ve ever sent food back and then another 20 minute wait this time for eggs benedict Had eaten this the previous 2 mornings and they were fine on this occasion I couldn t actually cut through the muffin it was brick hard So that got sent back too Didn t have time to wait for a 3rd attempt at a cooked breakfast as we were checking out Got back up to the room to find water dripping onto the floor Apparently this is perfectly normal for the hotel as it was because we d left the air conditioning on and the drip tray was full Had to say glad we were leaving and that we weren t having to put up with water coming in from the ceiling Made all these comments to reception who didn t really seem to care , The location was great 
45005,The Chamberlain, The only thing i think is that it needs some renewing as it is too old, The staff was amazing i arranged with them some arrangements for our anniversary and they made everything more than perfect and give us a complimentary bottle of wine The location also is perfect as it is next to a bus and an underground station and the hotel is 5 min walk from the tower of london
45006,The Chamberlain, Fried Eggs at breakfast overcooked Probably my fault I should have been more specific, Friendly staff excellent location clean comfortable well furnished free wifi free welcome drink
45007,The Chamberlain,No Negative, The staff was great and so helpful in planning our days The room was so spacious and comfortable The pub is a great place to unwind and enjoy a pint 
45008,The Chamberlain, Nothing, We loved the room the decor the facilities the cleanliness It was private and quiet We especially loved the coffee machine and fresh milk in the bar fridge But still close to tube station and The Tower good for walking around London but space away from over crowded spots 
45009,The Chamberlain, I think the entry and lift access to the rooms could be improved as first impressions count , I have stayed here in 2015 and 2016 It is a good hotel and well staffed The area is busy during the week but being the city quieter on the weekend The room size was good especially for someone needing to do desk work 
45010,The Chamberlain, Lifts out of service , Lovely bedroom and very comfy bed Breakfast choice very good Staff really friendly Were given drink vouchers as all lifts were out of service Staff took baggage up to 4th floor which was much appreciated 
45011,The Chamberlain, Both lifts were not working and we were on the 4th floor with a 6 year old and 18 month old Food was a long time coming in the restaurant and cold but others of our party were happy with the food , Location is good and we loved the older building and the manager did cut some of our bill because of our difficulty with the lift Staff were very friendly 
45012,The Chamberlain, Everything was excellent , Everything was top class this hotel really lives up to its 4 star rating We have been travelling round UK and this is the best 4 hotel so far Tastefuly decorated quality fixtures and fittings great shower Bar next door has great atmosphere great food great beer Highly recommended 
45013,The Chamberlain,No Negative, After booking the date a week later than I should in error the reception team were fantastic in moving my booking to the day I needed Hands down brilliant in dealing with this 
45014,The Chamberlain, The free breakfast selection was very limited anything substantial and cooked was to cost more The main lift was out of order the alternative service lift looked dirty and dodgy The air conditioner started leaking water into the room on the last day Staff informed that all the rooms have this problem due to the inclination of some pipe I fail to understand why such a not so cheap hotel is unable to install the air conditioning system correctly Would have given a better rating on the cleanliness otherwise , Comfortable and spacious room and bed though I was upgraded to a nicer room Convenient location minutes away from the City 
45015,The Chamberlain, Things like carpets are begging for change They look awful Smell from toilets on the corridor wasn t nice as well Lift wasn t working but we could get free drinks as apology for that Fridge doesn t cool very well But all in all it is decent hotel for that price in London , Cleaning ladies were extremely nice Hotel is located very close to metro station In the bathroom we colud use both tub and shower Air conditioning worked better than at more expensive hotels in London I stayed in 
45016,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Friendly warm welcome on arrival As I arrived early from long journey was offered a cup of tea and bags were stored until room was available Room met all expectations Exactly as described and in a perfect location Would highly recommend and will definitely return 
45017,The Chamberlain, The staff in the restaurant were not friendly or very professional It is clear that they are understaffed we waited 35 minutes without anyone coming up to us to take our order or apologize for the wait As we were leaving the waitress said with a smile oh you re leaving ok Unprofessional standards for a hotel which is otherwise quite good It would be best to either hire more staff to handle a normal sized crowd it was full but not packed or do not offer a restaurant until you can run it professionally , Extensive breakfast selection good location close to the business disctrict The rooms were cozy stylish and had everything needed
45018,The Chamberlain, Bathroom Cold tap in the room didn t work so had to wait for the water to cool down before getting in the bath which was annoying after a 20 mile walk each day Told staff about situation and said that maintenance would have a look at it in the morning our checkout day but bloke ran to bar to get us drinking water which confused the hell out of us breakfast was not all it cracked up to be Room type wasn t the same as on booking com told had separate shower and bath but didn t Had room service for our breakfast on the last day which was continental breakfast which was not worth 22 which was had been paid in advance Overall lovely anniversary weekend spoilt by hotel really , Friendly service from staff
45019,The Chamberlain, Guest lift is not working and using the service lift was a bit slow and often had to wait Once rectified hotel will be great , A good size room tastefully decorated and exceptionally clean Bathroom modern and functional with lots of shelves Close to Tower Hill tube station Free beer and nespresso in room and a welcome beer in bar was a nice touch Would stay here again 
45020,The Chamberlain, Dinner at the restaurant was not very good Breakfast was okay , The hotel was perfectly comfortable and clean I needed a hotel near my business venue that was not too expensive yet comfortable This was perfect 
45021,The Chamberlain, Lack of outside space , Outstanding first impressions of the building and flowers Room 211 was very well furnished and comfortable the food was excellent and we certainly liked the pub atmosphere The staff were attentive and courteous but a special mention must be made for Laura in the Bar Restaurant a real Cockney sparrow who was a one woman entertainment program 
45022,The Chamberlain, The sausages have a weird herby flavour which was not at all pleasant But if that s all I have to complain about , All the staff were great Very helpful and polite especially Chris on the welcome desk 
45023,The Chamberlain, Slight concern about security and access to bedroom corridors from street, The real milk in the fridge The excellent staff and food at breakfast Room good too
45024,The Chamberlain,No Negative, The rooms are spacious comfortable and a lot of thought to detail and comfort has been given ie coffee machine iron to name two Excellent for Tower Bridge 
45025,The Chamberlain, Nothing stood out as particularly poor it is generally a very good value hotel clean and well equipped although we chose not to breakfast at the hotel as it seemed a bit pricey Perhaps the carpets could be replaced but that s being a bit picky , Amenities replenished daily 2 bottles of water free from the mini bar daily and fresh semi skimmed milk free paper daily very friendly and welcoming staff free drink from the bar nice menu in the pub restaurant Comfortable hotel a great location for the tube stations two within a very short walk and sightseeing a great base for a city stay Will certainly consider using again in the future 
45026,The Chamberlain, Nothing very significant The reception area was having work done and one if the lifts was having some repairs We were given a free drink to compensate so it was no hardship , Lovely comfortable room with bath robes big bed and comfy bedding Nice decor and lovely bathroom with powerful shower Really nice breakfast Check out was 12 so no need to rush around 
45027,The Chamberlain, I did not like the 30 per day hold on the credit card for extras Three days later this has still not been returned to my card balance, The breakfast was very good freshly cooked to order
45028,The Chamberlain, Breakfast is expensive and not so much Very basic and if you want something more simply fried eggs for example you have to pay more In the bar there is no service at the table You have to get everything yourselves from the bar I don t mind doing this but if you pay this much for food and drinks I would expect something more If you need a taxi go one street further and get one yourself If the hotel calls one for you you will get a nicer car but for double the price , Small but nice and clean rooms The beds were a little hard The bar and the restaurant are nice in the evening Food is good for a reasonable price Staff is friendly and the cleaning staff does a good job Close to the tube so a good connection to downtown London which is great for business and for visiting London Good wifi connection which I really appreciate 
45029,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Very helpful staff Great location close to London Tower and Tower bridge Near underground station Tower Hill and Aldgate modern and clean room Free wifi Included Tea pot and espresso machine with free and daily new Espresso capsules and teabags
45030,The Chamberlain,No Negative, They were doing maintenance work but did everything to make the stay as nice as possible including upgrading my room as a way of saying thanks for your patience Location is easy access to two tube lines and at the heart or Tower Hill Staff is great food is great and the bar is great 
45031,The Chamberlain, Everything is satisfactorily good so nothing to complain about , The hotel is very close to Tower of London and in city of London dlstrict The staff was kind and helpful The rooms are large and baths are comfortable which is important for me The main lift did not work during our stay and management offered us free drinks in the pub located in the hotel a very kind gesture Wifi is free and speed is good 
45032,The Chamberlain, We had to use the service elevator however the free drink made that ok , To start with we had a free upgrade complimentary daily newspaper and a bottle of beer and water in the fridge Lovely selection of hot drinks enjoyed the hot chocolate Will be booking this hotel again 
45033,The Chamberlain, Bed slightly hard Not always sufficient staff in dining area , Staff on reception desk were extremely helpful and attentive Homely and comfortable Rooms very spacious Close to two tube stations and river transport 
45034,The Chamberlain, A heavy weight duvet resulted in a fitful night s sleep The service for breakfast was very slow 25 minutes for a Full English to arrive We were told that a tip added to the meal bill would not go to staff if paid by credit card Dishonest , The location convenient to Aldgate Underground Station and the Tower of London was perfect for us as we were visiting the Tower 
45035,The Chamberlain, They can do some renovation quite some walls stairs etc show decay The floors in the hallway stairs smell a little Some of the staff were a little less representative Lights in the rooms not really romantic , Location is nice 5 minutes from two substations they have a nice bar quiet in the evening big rooms romantic English atmosphere nice shower We had to use the staff elevator but were compensated with free drinks 
45036,The Chamberlain, A little maintanence was being done on the main elevator not a big deal , Nice central Location Super friendly and helpful staff Cleanliness and comfort of room Very modern large bathroom and shower I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London 
45037,The Chamberlain, Slightly disappointed with one of our evening meals We were not advised that we needed to order a side dish , Good location The rooms are very comfortable quiet and well appointed Good value Would definitely stay again 
45038,The Chamberlain, Rather slow checking out 15 mins , Location was very handy to the areas we wanted to see The decor was great Room very comfortable Got free morning paper Good food in restaurant both morning and evening Even given a free beer 
45039,The Chamberlain, Ordered breakfast room service Arrived late and cold Next morning we decided to go down for breakfast Staff were so rushed off their feet Asked several times for things that were missing from the continental selection but after about an hour I gave up and left Heard other people complaining about the amount of time they waited for cooked breakfast etc Not staff fault think not enough staff on duty , Staff in bar area and room service were very helpful and friendly
45040,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Wi fi was great Free water and a bottle of beer in room was a nice touch Very friendly staff in both the bar and reception For its location very reasonable price 
45041,The Chamberlain, The elevator was unavailabe for days We have to use the elevator for luggage or the stairs during the stay Bedrooms corridor and stairs need some maintenance , Very nice old fashion hotel close to the Tower Bridge e de subway 
45042,The Chamberlain,No Negative, The staff was the best The location and the food were also great So was the room The airline had lost my luggage and the staff went over and above in helping me to get it back I would definitely recommend this hotel 
45043,The Chamberlain, breakfast was poor each item on the full english either over or under cooked , free beer in the fridge the reception lady on my arrival was very pleasent and friendly free beer because of elevator renevations nice forward thinking
45044,The Chamberlain, I think in general the hotel was not worth the money once I booked it a few weeks later it had gone down by over 100 pounds for the same period l asked the receptionist if I could have it at the lower rate as advertised on booking com however her English was not good and she could not understand what was trying to say It was my wife s 60th birthday and didn t want to spoil it I would not stay there again for the price , Staff location room
45045,The Chamberlain, Not sure why they use the sweetened sausage for breakfast The entire hotel is totally different to that shown in the pictures The actual things are a lot older Corridors are smelly , Location and friendly staff
45046,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Treated my mum for her birthday I arranged for a bottle of champagne to be brought up to the room as a surprise a lovely added touch of a handwritten birthday card from the staff to go with it which my mum loved Staff were lovely and couldnt do enough for you our room was beautiful with everything you would need for a comfortable stay We decided to have breakfast which we could not fault my mum had the arnold bennet omelette which was served in a little decorative frying pan which was lovely and cooked to perfection Couldnt fault anything about our stay 
45047,The Chamberlain, Elevator was down so we had to use service lift Also fire alarm went off and woke us up once Construction going on , Front desk was amazing at check in Great to have a bar and restaurant attached Bed was super comfortable 
45048,The Chamberlain, Not one thing, Exactly what we were looking for The perfect setting for our London vacation Decorated beautifully and a great atmosphere to go with it Staff was amazing the bar was magnificent and their local clientele were fun and respectful The good was delicious and we loved our amazing breakfast in bed We will definitely visit again Thank you for making our vacation memorable almost forgot conveniently located to attractions and transportation 
45049,The Chamberlain, For such a high class hotel and if they offer the facilities they should try to ensure it works For example the door to the balcony was not working properly and if I were to force lock it I am afraid it ll break it Plus they do have the retractable magnifying mirror but it could hardly stay upright In other words you have it but you can t use it They face serious lack of staff both at front desk and restaurant Not all staff portray good service , I got an unexpected upgrade which was great Room was comfortable and spacious and overall was great 
45050,The Chamberlain, Carpet in lobby smells bad It could not be concealed by odour rich spray More lightening in the bathroom would be appreciated , Great selection of English breakfast dishes Comfy beds Reasonably quiet street This was my second stay
45051,The Chamberlain, Nothing, I loved the location very close to Tower of London Tower Hill Tube 2 mins walk In a side street so quiet as well which is great when staying in the city Staff went that extra mile and made our stay special for my wife s 50th birthday Upgraded us and also had a card and cake slice in our room Comfy bed lovely room Absolutely fab well done all at the chamberlain deserved praise 
45052,The Chamberlain, Nothing really Main lift out of order but no hassle using service lift and got a free drink , We were upgraded and our room was lovely Particularly the shower the nespresso machine was a nice touch
45053,The Chamberlain, nothing all good, complimentary bottle of london pride in fridge of room we were also given a voucher for a drink each at bar as compensation for main lift not working other lift was only a few yards round corner Bed was really comfy nice bath good powerful shower decent and good value room service good and free wifi connection Great location was further away from olympic stadium than i wanted for concert attended but very easy on dlr with 1 change or slightly longer walk less than half mile to liverpool st for undergound or normal train with no changes needed We even strolled our way along the thames on way back to waterloo which on a nice summers day was very pleasant and i guess less than 2 miles all staff we came across reception bar staff waitress for breakfast room service were all very friendly and helpful my short stay here was great value and much enjoyed would very happily stay here again and for longer if i wanted a trip to london 
45054,The Chamberlain, It s pricey I was lucky to find a discount about 50 otherwise it would ve been impossible , Everything bed bathroom shower private terrace free wifi and everyone was amazing We loved it and hopefully we ll come back again 
45055,The Chamberlain, Staff were rude and unhelpful Huffing and puffing everything seemed such an effort like we were putting them out Nice hotel other than that , Rooms were well kitted out Clean and new 
45056,The Chamberlain, nothing, The room was really big for London s standards We were given a free upgrade As well as the location so handy to two tube stations it was close to cafes and restaurants Staff were great with particular mention of Chris A free drink was given to compensate for the main lift being repaired but that had no effect on our access to our room with the use of a second lift available Restaurant menu provided a wide range for dinner Highly recommend this hotel 
45057,The Chamberlain, The only minor complaint would be that drinks in the bar were a little bit expensive compared to wetherspoons which is a few minutes walk away, Really good stay the staff were happy and helpful Good tasty food clean hotel and good sized room I will stay here again 
45058,The Chamberlain, No gluten free gravy one of our party was told the gravy was suitable Having sampled it the waiter came to say it contained gluten Some confusion with another meal but were compensated with a free bottle of nice wine , The staff were wonderful couldn t be more helpful always a smile The rooms were spacious beds super comfy quiet with lots of extras Having a coffee machine proper fresh milk beer and water in fridge fab shower I was with a party of 10 including my 86 year old mother The staff were particularly nice with her and made her feel welcome 
45059,The Chamberlain, There was no wheelchair toilet in the bar or dining area , Friendly staff spotless rooms comfortable beds location of hotel and all the little complimentary extras 
45060,The Chamberlain, Could have had a roof terrace and a chauffeur driven Limo Only kidding nothing to dislike whatsoever , Hard not to comment on it all really Friendly and helpful staff Great location for everything Very clean everywhere Comfy beds The Full Monty 
45061,The Chamberlain, The restaurant food was good but it took a very long time to be served We ate both a breakfast and a dinner at the hotel and both meals to unusualy long to serve after ordering , The property was very nice Everything looked new but still had an old world charm Beautiful throughout the lobby bar restaurant and room The room was spacious and clean The bathroom in particular was amazing The location is only a short walk to the Tower of London and the Tower Bridge however it is in a business district and many of the nearby restaurants seam to close on the weekend Overall I would recommend this hotel for its beautiful facilities pleasant staff and good location 
45062,The Chamberlain, Nothing this exceeded expectations, Quiet spacious convenient cosy pied a terre for working from At least that s howit was on a Sunday night Room had everything a working person might need in terms of shower caps snacks shoe shine equipment newspaper of choice thrown in 
45063,The Chamberlain,No Negative, The service and staff was phenomenal The location is awesome too It is by the london tower about 10 mins walk and is beside the Aldgate train station 3 mins walk there s starbucks nearby too if you like coffee to start your day 
45064,The Chamberlain, the hotel withdrew a deposit from my account account for the whole stay 70 pounds for extras while checking out I still had to pay whole stay as the deposit would be returned later it took me OVER ONE WEEK to get it back Very inconvenient and outdated system Most hotels in developed countries don t do this I m not a bank to lend my money to a hotel ,No Positive
45065,The Chamberlain, The reception of the hotel is special for a 4 stars hotel it goes more into a Bed Breakfast style , The rooms are very clean functional and despite the street view no noise at all The situation of the hotel is top 
45066,The Chamberlain,No Negative, We stayed at The Chamberlain for the 5th time for 2 nights across the weekend All staff are a credit to the Fullers company and always make you feel welcome An ideal location for St Katherines Dock South Bank Shard etc Going back for the 6th time hopefully very soon 
45067,The Chamberlain, I thought the bar and restaurant were a bit drab and dreary and in need of an updating to match the quality of the hotel rooms , My hotel room was excellent very spacious and modern and with a very comfortable bed The room was also very quiet There was a mini fridge with complimentary sparkling water regular water milk for coffee and a welcome beer plus a coffee maker Who could ask for more The location has easy access to the tube and central London 
45068,The Chamberlain, Lift out of order had to use service lift which can be quite a wait , Nice touches such as toothpaste and toothbrush plus shaving kit Ability to open a door window and turn off aircon 
45069,The Chamberlain, Lobby a little bit dated didn t reflect our modern room or professionalism of staff Do yourselves a favour modernise your lobby Staff name badges or maybe I didn t see them , We liked everything about our stay at The Chamberln Staff Staff Staff everyone there had excellent customer care skills 
45070,The Chamberlain, Website said there was a Business Center and there wasn t not a big deal but maybe take that down from website then , It was really nice to get a free beer in the mini bar daily Staff were helpful and friendly 
45071,The Chamberlain, Nothing to complain about although main elevator not working and had to use service lift that might explain the free cold beer each day It was not an inconvience at all , Well suited to my needs Close to DLR station and only short journey to Excel where the trade show and conference was being held Also close to other public transport only 300m from Aldgate tube station and Tower of London only 5 min walk away Clean and Comfortable room and a free cold beer in the fridge each day was a nice touch Staff friendly and helpful 
45072,The Chamberlain, Squeaky floorboards may not have been liked by the room below us , Deluxe room upgrade location breakfast friendly local staff flexibility A spot on location for exploring the trendy East End close to everywhere we wanted to go 
45073,The Chamberlain, The lift didn t work the whole time and getting our luggage down before check out was a struggle, The lady on the desk was very enthusiastic and really pleasant when we arrived I wish I had caught her name because she was great 
45074,The Chamberlain, Room was very dark not enough adequate lighting for room size we had a deluxe King room View from window was fire escape with stairs over window in room 409 Wifi kept dropping out , Bed was very comfortable lovely bathroom good quality toiletries provided and fridge in room with complimentary water beer and milk Complimentary newspaper of your choice each morning Staff very friendly and polite Lovely breakfast 
45075,The Chamberlain, Nothing I can think of right now , Not my first stay at the Chamberlain reception staff were really friendly hotel was in a perfect spot great room Breakfast was excellent and the staff happy friendly and attentive will definitely be staying again 
45076,The Chamberlain, Eat in the bar one evening not the greatest meal ever but edible , Great room really nicely decorated and a good size Very comfortable bed and an excellent bathroom
45077,The Chamberlain, While I loved my stay I must say that the Chamberlain is looking a little bit tired and dated and to be fair that s not a complaint just an observation , The bed was definitely veeery comfy Staff couldn t be nicer or more helpful and the room upgrade was most unexpected and very much appreciated Will definitely be back 
45078,The Chamberlain, Hotel is located near the Tower of London and accessible by tube easily However there is a lot of construction nearby which makes accessing by car quite a nuisance Location is surrounded by offices do not many choices to eat nearby on the weekend The hotel needs a renovation painting is chipping and you can see the wear and tear The carpet in my room was ungluing , Rooms are big and silent Good value for money 
45079,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Lovely quiet room fresh milk in the fridge was a nice touch Excellent breakfasts plenty of choice served by friendly staff Hotel in good location close to tube stations water taxi Tower Pier Would recommend 
45080,The Chamberlain,No Negative, I booked my parents here for my mums birthday They have raved about the hotel service My mum was made a fuss of on her birthday which was really lovely 
45081,The Chamberlain, Unfortunately our bed had a faulty leg which broke during the night , Ambience friendly staff cleanliness comfy beds good quality food complimentary bottled water in room great value for money near The Tower of London and Docklands for the Medieval Banquet 
45082,The Chamberlain,No Negative, The staff were really friendly from start to finish and would do anything for you The main lift wasn t working so we had to use the service lift which wasn t a problem at all but the hotel gave us free drinks for the inconvenience Room was gorgeous and spacious We got a total bargain 
45083,The Chamberlain,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful the meal in the pub downstairs was good value for money I think I also got a room upgrade which made this late booking very good value for money in what is usually a very expensive part of London to get a hotel room 
45084,The Chamberlain, Nothing All was great , Free bottle of London Pride in the fridge was a lovely touch Free room upgrade for our anniversary was also much appreciated Bed was super comfy and shower was excellent Free drinks were also lovely because the lift was broken Staff were super helpful and friendly 
45085,The Chamberlain, Overall this hotel was a great choice for us good value and very comfortable there was nothing that we didn t like , The staff at this hotel were friendly and welcoming it was refreshing to have waitresses at breakfast who were happy to actually chat to you The breakfast menu was excellent and it was lovely to have it cooked to order instead of the usual hot buffet arrangement The room was clean and comfortable and larger than many hotel rooms we ve had before in other London hotels and we will definitely pick it again 
45086,The Chamberlain, Nothing All was great , Our stay at the Chamberlain was perfect The staff was very helpful and friendly the hotel is very clean and comfortable the location is fantastic During our stay the main elevator was out of service but that didn t make much of a difference for us as the staff went out of their way to compensate for it The food at the hotel is delicious and it was great to enjoy a couple of beers at the pub We would definitely go back to this hotel on our next trip to London 
45087,The Chamberlain, These are not huge things but probably worth mentioning Service during breakfast was a bit hit and miss the restaurant was almost empty but I had to stand around for a while waiting for someone to notice and seat me I was put at a table that was not fully set and had to ask for things like butter for the toast and jam I also had to wait for someone to walk past before I could ask for a coffee refill The staff were very pleasant but appeared to be not well organised There was music being piped to the restaurant but there was also someone in the kitchen singing very loudly not badly just loudly and together with the piped music different songs created a cacophony of sound The food though was very nice I found the lighting in the bathroom a bit dim for the successful application of make up , The room was very comfortable with everything you could possibly need right there waiting for you Very comfortable bed and lovely d cor Plenty of hot water too Loved that decaff coffee and hot chocolate were included in the tea and coffee selection along with a proper small bottle of milk in the fridge luxury 
45088,The Chamberlain, Breakfast and service on 2nd day , I requested a bottle of wine for our room on arrival to celebrate my husbands birthday The hotel also gave a birthday card complimentary dessert and beer The bed was comfy and the bathroom sublime The lift was being repaired and we were offered a complimentary drink for the inconvenience 
45089,The Chamberlain, Far from Oxford street and piccadly square far from shopping areas I consumed too much time in transportation to and from the hotel, Near from underground stations near from London Tower and Tower Bridge 
45090,The Chamberlain, Was nothing we disliked, Room was lovely and clean bathroom etc very roomy and spotless good value for money Breakfast was beautifully cooked and service was great 
45091,The Chamberlain,No Negative, We had stayed for 4 days The staff was very friendly and helpful The room was nice and clean Around hotel are many places to eat drink The tube is 5 min walking distance Highly recommend the place 
45092,The Chamberlain, Had to use goods lift as usual lift not in order but compensated by free drink at bar, Friendly stafff fresh milk for tea coffee in room and nexpresso coffee machine in room
45093,The Chamberlain, Rooms are a bit noisy e g if someone in the room above is taking a bath or a shower in the middle of the night Breakfast is very mean and bad, Style and layout of the hotel Location very convenient close to Aldgate Underground station Restaurant healthy detox meals Overall staff is kind and helpful Free internet access
45094,The Chamberlain, The only thing I d like to improve is the water saving due to a design shower faucet which was not the best to save water since you had to open it full to get hot water hence not controlling the flow , The location is perfect to explore the ever changing and trendy east of London brick lane up to hackney and broadway market The hotel maintains a typical British style combining a traditional public house look with the newest design of the rooms Bathrooms are great and have a lot of room In ours we had both a bathtub and a shower The bed is one of the best beds I ve slept on Breakfast is highly recommended and it s worth the price The staff is really helpful and nice 
45095,The Chamberlain, Nothing to dislike Everything was to our satisfaction , Great facilities in room coffee maker complimentary drinks etc Very clean and staff very polite helpful and friendly A great breakfast included 
45096,The Chamberlain,No Negative, The hotel is located close to 3 tube stations Aldgate Fenchurch Station Tower Hill which we found was brilliant and the room was an excellent size Dulxe room The restaurant bar was great to relax in the food was extremely tasty would recommend the The Chamberlain Burger The hotel is easy to find there are plenty of bars restaurants nearby Vodka Revolution Mary Jane s Subway Price for room was reasonable added extras such as small bottle of milk on arrival when we had run out was great along with free bottle of beer in fridge Would definitely recommend staying at the hotel would stay there again 
45097,The Chamberlain, Room a little brown and unexciting coloured Cjeck in and check out time consuming could do with more staff in the morning Pricey without a researching a web deal, Location near tube and city Fresh milk and free beer in the fridge Spacious room Friendly staff Nice cosy restaurant for solo biz traveller
45098,The Chamberlain, the lift wasnt working the 3 days we were there , the staff were friendly and helpful the room was great and the little extras in the room give the finishing touches 
45099,The Chamberlain, None maybe okay not special continental breakfast but we preferred to have breakfast outside , Rooms are not very big but very clean and you have everything what you need I would recommend this hotel Also a bar downstairs were you can have a drink and snack also dinner but we did not have dinner here 
45100,The Chamberlain, The main lift was not working during the course of my stay was required to use the secondary lift which appeared to be the service lift and not easily accessible with your baggage That said they were very considerate by offering guests a free drink in the adjoining bar for the inconvenience , Room was updated well appointed and clean 
45101,The Chamberlain, Main lift wasn t working when we arrived so had to use service lift As an apology we received a free drink at the bar the double Baileys and double scotch more than made up for any inconvenience , Good location and being in The City very quiet at weekends
45102,The Chamberlain, I was there few days ago Hotel in the ground floor bar area is facing issues with rodents It was the first time in my traveling times and i travel a lot I am a star alliance gold member I come up with such an experience I stayed for a night evening to morning in a nice room on a higher floor However during the afternoon and evening in the ground floor bar area and corridor to the back elevator I saw such 3 small mice running just in front of me in 2 occasions The first as i was going to get to the back lift as the main one was under repair The second as I was enjoying a complementary drink as the last customer in the bar where two little ones entered the large room to finish of some leftovers on the floor from a couple just enjoyed their beers with snacks 5meters in front of my table Really really weird experience For sure not expected in a 4star hotel I found my self going back to my room on a higher floor checking if some little thing with a tail and for sure not Mickey could fit under my door I do not know if it is the near river location or it was just that day or if there was another excuse for such a situation It is just unacceptable Needless to say i did not had breakfast It was served on ground floor I know my report may sounds strange or extreme but i cant keep it This is what I saw and I would appreciate to had such info well before I hope they deal with it soon cause rooms are OK and personnel too deserving much better , 3 5min walk to 2 underground stations train station Very nice room decoration Room size is reasonable For sure not large but ok Complimentary drink for the inconvenience caused by having the front elevator under repair Front desk was helpful and professional even when i reported and complained about some serious issues the building and facilities face 
45103,The Chamberlain,No Negative, We received a warm welcome when we checked in and found all the staff throughout our stay to be very friendly and efficient We were offered a complimentary drink at the bar and a weekend newspaper Appreciated having a lie is as our check out was 12 noon The bedroom was a good size and I loved the shower Breakfast was excellent we couldn t have asked for more and it kept us going all day 
45104,The Chamberlain, All very good , Staff excellent we were upgraded for my wife s birthday to a roof terrace room which was brilliant Food very good a really pleasurable stay Will definitely go back 
45105,The Chamberlain, Obviously not the Hotels fault there is no parking at the Hotel but better instructions on where to park would have been helpful , Our room was light spacious with a lovely comfortable bed power shower and coffee making facilities Loved the complimentary water beer and robes The hotel itself was warm and welcoming and the staff very friendly and helpful We ordered breakfast in bed and it came very well presented nice and hot with very friendly staff Food was excellent Location was superb 
45106,The Chamberlain, My only slight compliant is took quite a while for my full English breakfast to be cooked, Fully restored rooms great beer as this is a Fullers hotel attached to a pub If you like real ale this hotel has plenty to choice from
45107,The Chamberlain, The main lift wasn t working but we were compensated with a free drink , Loved the room it was really nicely laid out fair size and was modern decor but with a homely feel 
45108,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Very good location with easy access to Aldgate Station and Tower Gateway DLR Station 5 mins walk Also not far from Bricklane Market 15 mins walk The bedroom is clean spacious and cosy The bed is very comfortable giving us a very good sleep indeed The bathroom is also big as well as clean Breakfast is great with many options Staff are nice helpful and friendly We re really happy with our stay at the Chamberlain We ll definitely go back 
45109,The Chamberlain, The mice Mouse in the bar and another one in reception the following day Staff didn t seem to bothered when it was brought up , Room was nice Reception were friendly
45110,The Chamberlain, Very poor lighting levels in the room gave me a headache and unable to shave as too dark in the bathroom D cor and furniture tired a bit worse for wear cracks breaks patch ups etc Freeview TV with very poor signal only a few channels were watchable Meagre coffee biscuit rations in room two sachets of coffee one pack of 2 biscuits for two people , Location Very clean room Complimentary beer in the room Bathrobe slippers Deep bath and plenty of hot water Large flatscreen TV
45111,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Stayed here for the 4th time The area and proximity to car park is great Also ideal for St Katherines Dock Booking again for May Staff always helpful and room lovely Thoroughly recommend 
45112,The Chamberlain, The main lift was out of action for the whole of our stay , Two night stay to take in a show and sightsee in the City The room was really comfortable and the facilities in the room were terrific everything we needed for comfort and convenience But the staff made the stay they were super even gave my wife a birthday card a small cake in the room fridge 
45113,The Chamberlain, The room was overlooking the courtyard but that was ok , The staff were helpful location is very close to public transportation Room was quite large with a big bathroom 
45114,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Walking distance from tourist attraction The room was very clean and bed was so comfy Love their complimentary drinks and staffs were very friendly 
45115,The Chamberlain, Only showed rugby instead of playing one on one screen and football on another to give guests the choice so had to go elsewhere , Got upgraded at no extra cost room was lovely and modern and spotless Great location to everything couldn t have been any better great value for money Lift was broken but were able to use their secondary lift which was fine for us as on 4th floor Gave us a complimentary drink for the inconvenience Food and drink was reasonable 
45116,The Chamberlain, On arrival the room was cold until we reliesed there was a thermostat to control the temperature no one informed us at reception and it was a cold night Our room over looked the fire escape at the back of the hotel But it didn t bother us has we weren t in the room that much , Staff were friendly room quite large for London Very good bar and restaurant in hotel had lovely breakfast and evening meal Enjoyed our stay 
45117,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Great location Helpful friendly staff lovely rooms well furnished free bottled water and a beer The breakfast was excellent plenty of choice I would highly recommend a stay here 
45118,The Chamberlain, The hotel should not be afraid of publishing the fact it s part of the Fullers chain , Good breakfast comfortable bed Clean The chain as represented here in this combined Pub and Hotel is clearly trying to do a good job I would come back 
45119,The Chamberlain, Main lift was out of order but using a service lift wasn t an inconvenience and we were offered free drinks to apologize , Excellent location and facilities Great rate for a hotel of this standard in the heart of the City 
45120,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Great value for many spacious comfortable room spacious bathroom everything clean and new Very friendly and helpful staff Great variety of the breakfast menu Excellent place to enjoy your time in London 
45121,The Chamberlain, Nothing really the bar is a bit noisy when you are downstairs but we couldn t hear anything in the room so didn t bother us , Staff were very attentive from reception to the restaurant we were pleasantly surprised The lift was broken so we had to use the service lift a very minor inconvenience but they gave us a voucher for a free drink at the bar which was a nice touch Impressed with the breakfast which had a lot of choice and hot breakfast was cooked fresh for us Good value for money Room was nice and clean very quiet We had a great night s sleep 
45122,The Chamberlain, Breakfast was good but not always hot, Room was spotless lovely bathroom comfortable bed fridge Not far from tube station Staff were friendly and helpful 
45123,The Chamberlain, Only downfall was that we ordered room service late at night and had to pay with cash upfront and the lady had no change to give us Maybe this practice is more universal in UK but usually when I stay in hotels the room service is always paid for when checking out Also if this was part of their policy it should have been made clear to us on arrival or when placing our order for room service , The location is perfect very easy to get to from the tube and only a 5 minute walk to the Tower of London and Tower Bridge For anyone doing the Hop on Hop off Bus Tours there is a pick up point just in front of the Tower of London The hotel itself is simply beautiful staff were very friendly and helpful the food in the restaurant was lovely and the room was clean and beautifully designed We were given a complimentary upgrade to a Deluxe King which we were delighted it Also because the main elevator was under going maintainable the hotel kindly gave us both a complimentary drink of our choice from the bar to express their sincerest apology Overall I was very impressed and would highly recommend The Chamberlain Hotel to anyone visiting London 
45124,The Chamberlain, Reception could have been more efficient Gave us a room somebody else was occupying Thankfully when we walked in on them they were decent , Old style hotel with character Friendly bar and breakfast staff 
45125,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Big room big bed which was really comfy Shower was excellent The lift was out of order but the staff managed it excellently and offered gifts as compensation 
45126,The Chamberlain, The wall to wall carpet There should be rooms with wooden floors for allergy sufferers like myself It was too hot in the room A C just blew warm air although set to the minimum , The room was beautiful and well equipped bathroom was brand new there were free drinks in the fridge staff were very nice location close to the tube station bars and cafes right next door to the hotel 
45127,The Chamberlain, Unfortunately during our stay the lift was not working so we had to use the service lift which wasn t the greatest We were given a voucher for a free drink due to the inconvenience We were also charged twice for our breakfast so had to query this get a refund, Tasteful decor Really comfortable rooms A little bit out of the hustle bustle but just a short walk to the tube
45128,The Chamberlain, My room was apparently near the loading dock in the back as there was a considerable loading unloading ruckus at about 0700 AM , Good American IPA Sierra Nevada on tap in the bar Friendly staff Great central location in the business district if you are there for business and close to Tower Bridge Tower of London and Tower Hill metro if there for tourism Great breakfast Hotel offered complimentary drink at bar just because primary elevator didn t work although secondary elevator was made available nice touch 
45129,The Chamberlain, One of the lifts was not working oh but to compensate for walking up 2 flights of stairs they gave us a free drink in the bar , Easy check in pleasant staff clean comfy room lovely breakfast what more do you want 
45130,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Greeted and served by friendly informative staff Room was beautiful and clean Really good value for money Breakfast was great Easy access to tube and rest of London So good I recommended it to my company and booked some of our staff in for business trips
45131,The Chamberlain, Other hotel guests loud most of night cigarette smoking was obvious in certain rooms , Good bar Nice bathroom Great breakfast services and friendly staff throughout the hotel 
45132,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Very comfortable great location warm welcome Lift wasn t working so was given a voucher for a free drink even though I was only on the first floor Free bottle of London Pride was a pleasant surprise 
45133,The Chamberlain, Nothing negative to comment on Only minus point but a very small one was that the main lift was out of service but the service lift was easy to access and the Chamberlain more than compensated for this by offering free drinks The fact that they go out of their way to make up for what was in this case an absolutely inconsequential inconvenience indicates a positive and realistic approach to customer satisfaction which is very much appreciated by this customer , Proximity to Tower and Tower Bridge and riverbank Several underground stations DLR close by really useful for ready access to major routes for getting around London Love the hotel over the pub bar idea and enjoy the range of bar food on offer Rooms are clean and comfortable and come with useful range of facilities We really appreciate the little extras i e proper milk in carton bottled water sample bottle of London Pride quality of toiletries provided plus use of dressing gown and slippers These added extras make you feel genuinely valued as a customer rather than just another opportunity to screw as much money out of you as possible for every additional service facility This was our second visit and we intend to return when time and funds permit 
45134,The Chamberlain,No Negative, I booked a nights stay here last minute around 6pm arrived around 11pm and the staff were so welcoming The price was so cheap and I had the best night s sleep ever Would highly recommend great location and great shower thank you Amy
45135,The Chamberlain, Not a thing , Upgraded on arrival to a room with a balcony on the fifth floor which in summer would be lovely as it had seating and loungers The staff were a treat always polite attentive and friendly Being a Fuller s hotel the beer on offer is to die for particularly for an expat like myself who does not have access to their wonderful brews when abroad Very good breakfast choices limited dinner menu but good offerings all the same 
45136,The Chamberlain, Nothing, The staff were lovely fab having 24hr room service although there wasn t anyone available for us at the time we wanted something But room was clean and lovely 
45137,The Chamberlain, There was no bad experience if I was nit picking supplies seem to be short ie ran out of Baileys at the Bar some items short in restaurant at Breakfast I will add this was not a problem alternatives were offered by the very helpful staff , Excellent location 5mins walk from tube station 10mins walk from tower pier that s why we chose the Hotel we were on a Thames river cruise new years eve therefore we could walk to hotel Good bar facility with late opening for quest 
45138,The Chamberlain, Location isn t ideal for tourism being on the east side of the City of London but it represents real value compared to any other hotel within central London so that s a very minor concern , Very well run small hotel recently renovated and very clean and comfortable 
45139,The Chamberlain, It s perfect , from the free upgrade to the 1 pm checkout from the food breakfast staff and luxury items in room all as standard The pub attached is fabulous I stay in 3 hotels a month in London every month for leisure All things considered This is number one Look NO further I hated leaving Beverley Edo 
45140,The Chamberlain,No Negative, When we checked in we were told we had been upgraded for free There was a problem with the lift so we had to use the back lift The hotel provided us with a free drink each of our choosing for any inconvenience It was my husband s birthday and a card and cake were in the room for him Breakfast was great There was a really good choice of cereals fruit and cooked breakfast 
45141,The Chamberlain, We decided to eat in the pub bad move as you had only just reopened after Christmas Almost none of the menu was available and ax we had left it rather late we had no chance to go elsewhere and unforgivable there was no gin , Facilities and standard of room
45142,The Chamberlain,No Negative, When we arrived early we could check in 3 hours on before and we got a room upgrade The personnel was so friendly Because there were maintenance works on the main elevator we had to go through another elevator and the hotel management offered us some free drinks at the bar because of that It was one of our best hotel experiences Nice location if you want to do a Jack the Ripper tour 
45143,The Chamberlain, Just one disappointment the sandwich we ordered from room service My husband asked for a toasted sandwich but it wasn t toasted when it arrived We queried this and were told the toaster wasn t available which would have been ok if we d be told this at the time we placed our order I guess we could have sent it back and asked for a refund but we were hungry so ate the sandwich although left the wilted mouldy lettuce we found in the dressing on the side , Lovely room comfy bed great shower and towels The Nespresso coffee machine was a nice surprise Breakfast was very tasty and good value for a tenner There was a fairly wide selection of continental and traditional English food and good coffee too which is becoming hard to find these days My second stay here and we would definitely go back again 
45144,The Chamberlain,No Negative, The way were greeted in a friendly manner and we were given a complimentary upgrade plus a free drink The staff were always polite and cheerful and the service was excellent 
45145,The Chamberlain, The main lift was not working but it is really a minor thing , Location Free upgrade to a better room Beautiful spacious newly refurbished room No 315 Was a great stay 
45146,The Chamberlain, The cooked breakfast was the only thing that let this place down a little We were warned there was a rush on and that there would be a wait but it took absolutely ages and arrived with no toast We had to ask for some but by the time it arrived everything else had gone cold Shame , Amazing attention to detail Lots of complimentary things in the room comfy bed very helpful and friendly reception housekeeping and bar staff Great location 
45147,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Very helpful and friendly staff in the hotel and pub Great service Main lift was out of order so we each got to choose one drink from the pub as compensation although second lift right next to the pub was available Our room was very cosy brand new and really clean with complimentary ale waters and selection of tea and Nespresso Tidiness was immaculate Tower Hill and Aldgate stations just 5 mins away thus perfect connection to all public transport lines 
45148,The Chamberlain,No Negative, The bed was lovely I had a lovely sleep nice big TV on the wall Their was fresh milk in the fridge for when I had coffee in the morning Set the room temp at 21and the room stayed nice and warm just right for me All the staff were very good helpful and friendly will use this hotel again when out for a night out in London
45149,The Chamberlain, Nothing at all , From checking in to checking out absolutely perfect Free drinks in the fridge nice soft bed and lovely thick quilt what s not to like Absolutely spotless as well 
45150,The Chamberlain,No Negative, We loved everything about the hotel The staff were all absolutely brilliant polite attentive and helpful the location was perfect bar restaurant and food superb
45151,The Chamberlain, Being made to get out of bed at 5h20am for roomservice which I did not order was not something I appreciated When I mentioned it at the desk upon checking out I did not particularly like being told that the person ordering roomservice had probably given the wrong room number Some problems with the elevator but this was compensated with a free drink in the bar , Great location near the DLR station Aldgate and Tower Hill underground stations friendly staff good breakfast pub inside the hotel which serves good food until 10pm comfortable rooms 
45152,The Chamberlain, When very busy on the first morning there were not enough staff for breakfast , The refurbished rooms are excellent Staff are very friendly and welcoming Great hotel to stay
45153,The Chamberlain, Minor point but reception could have made it clearer that items in room were complimentary I missed out on complementary slippers and robes One has to pay 30 in case of extras refunded if not used but it was not made clear that it was to cover room service not for mini bar room extras , Very warm welcome great room great location great price for the area 
45154,The Chamberlain,No Negative, A very comfortable hotel in the heart of the city We stayed at this hotel to catchup with old work colleagues for our annual Christmas meal for the 25 year club 
45155,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Great location for burning candle at night and getting to Canary Wharf in the morning after a bit of a lie in They upgraded me to the top floor with large sun loung balcony and street views Breakfast very good Complementary bottle of London Pride every day beat that 
45156,The Chamberlain, The length of time it took to check in due to the pre authorisations required on each room The slow service at breakfast though the food was well cooked , Rooms were comfortable with lots of little complimentary gifts It was clean and our room which faced the courtyard was very quite Bathroom was lovely clean and with lovely products 
45157,The Chamberlain, No complaints, Hotel staff were fantastic extremely polite and helpful cleanliness of hotel superb towels changed daily breakfast facilities excellent location in regards to subway good only thing was if staying around here at weekends ie sat sun night The surrounding area bars and restaurants all shut down apparently due to being a financial working area However the hotel bar is open until 2am for residents and serves food until 10pm We also wanted food around midnight and the room service didn t have what we required the hotel staff are more than happy to order take out to the hotel 
45158,The Chamberlain, Shortage of staff in restaurant on Saturday evening View from room not great fire escape , Friendly slightly old fashioned ambiance Complimentary items in fridge including fresh milk 
45159,The Chamberlain, Passenger lift wasnt working but service was lift was working Restaurant gives a bad smell to the service lift area , Location cosy room friendly staff
45160,The Chamberlain, Nothing about the bedrooms or breakfast The meeting room we used was in the basement and too hot with no window to open , What a wonderful hotel I d recommend staying overnight here to anyone and my colleagues all agreed Comfy bed lovely linen and towels good water pressure on the shower very clean friendly staff excellent pain au chocolat and coffee 
45161,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Friendly staff great location for our needs amazing shower Had also told the hotel it was our anniversary prior to our stay and there was a card and complimentary chocolate brownie in our room Such a nice touch 
45162,The Chamberlain, Telephone call asking for card details again as you had previously experienced problems with Booking I will only provide details once for security Whilst appreciating that hotels are expensive in London I thought it was a little expensive , Location and accommodation were good as was the breakfast 
45163,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Old world charm but organised very efficiently the very extensive and reasonably priced breakfast was a very pleasing feature Staff were most helpful and ready to assist Room rates were very reasonable 
45164,The Chamberlain, Breakfast was terribel the egge was that well done that it looked like rubber The staff especially the lady in charge was very rude The, The room in the hotel was lovely 
45165,The Chamberlain, Sadly the hotel is situated over a tube line on the second floor very audible rumbles continued until after midnight If you can sleep through anything then no problem otherwise it will keep you awake Once asleep no problem I didn t hear them start up in the morning , I had a deluxe room at 50 discount same day booking which made it great value Lovely big room and very comfortable At full price it would be very expensive for the overall quality of the hotel A very convenient location for business in the City and a quick trip in out of the West End Soho for social 
45166,The Chamberlain,No Negative, Large room Cheerful helpful staff Location close to DLR underground etc
45167,The Chamberlain, We had a problem with the lights of our bathroom in the middle of the night but it was solved the morning after , Close to Aldagate East station The rooms sre comfortable and well equiped
45168,The Chamberlain,No Negative, It is in a perfect location for easy access to places of interest Majority of the staff are very warm welcoming and go the extra mile The room with a view we were allocated the facilities the extras with the hotel s compliments are all that make this hotel unique We enjoyed the package as it included breakfast and the staff both at breakfast especially Sarah and at dinner especially Mia the Duty Manager and Dominika at the Reception desk were such a delight

45174,The Chamberlain,No Negative, The accommodation was beautifully clean and comfortable and the breakfasts excellent Most importantly all of the staff we met were extremely friendly and helpful We were particularly impressed that they were able to meet our rather eccentric request to change the duvet for a blanket 
45175,The Chamberlain, Staff forgot we had breakfast included suspicious since I overheard the couple ahead of us in line having the same problem Beds were not set up as a double upon arrival 30 pounds are blocked for incidentals per night on credit card a obvious ploy that cheapens the hotel Elevator out of service entire two night stay , Location Atmosphere 
45176,The Chamberlain, We waited almost an hour to be served our breakfast full English and the overall waiting staff service was pretty poor When the breakfast finally came it wasn t very nice and rather over cooked , The setting was great the staff were friendly and our room was lovely
45177,The Chamberlain, Staff was very slow and non cooperative When i entered in the room there was open paint bucket inside Walls were half painted Very disappointed Later on staff changed the room though , The location is perfect

45183,The Chamberlain, Package was received without my name and after I asked for it twice finally on the third time the staff was able to find it too late of course for the use intended , Good location clean property good breakfast selections 
45184,The Chamberlain, Bathroom shower needed a little attention Shower bar slightly loose and door leaking But no significant problem , Room very comfortable and very clean bar downstairs served very good meals at reasonable prices Great location Really nice hotel 
45185,The Chamberlain, I think my only comment though is to have an accessibility ramp as I was hauling a big luggage and it was a bit difficult to take them up a few steps unless it was there somewhere and I hadn t seen it D , The hotel is perfectly situated in the business district of East London hope I m right about this though It s very close to Tower Hill station The room looked very nice and customers were right about not hearing any pub noise etc The bed was comfy and room cleaning was prompt and efficient I cannot fault the staff they were extremely nice and helpful They went the extra mile and treated me as a guest and not a customer I was not just a number to them There was only a bit of a miscalculation with my breakfast bill but it didn t become a hassle because it was efficiently sorted When I travel again to London I would stay here again It was my first time traveling solo and my first time in England Thank you for contributing to my positive experience in the UK

45196,The Chamberlain, Our a c wasn t working properly for a few nights but once we notified the front desk on a Sunday morning no less on our evening return the situation had been rectified , The room upgrade we received was very welcome and the private rooftop terrace with its table chairs and two sunbeds meant we could spend time in comfort in the hotel Our room was more than adequate for a week s stay the bed was large and very comfortable and there was good pressure in the shower which was over the bath The hotel is within two minutes walk of the tube station and the area offers a good selection of eateries We had stayed in a Fuller s hotel in West Ealing and were very impressed with the facilities and The Chamberlain was no exception from the check in out process to the first evening s turn down service the room itself the complementary and plentiful toiletries and the general appearance cleanliness and service everything was taken care of exceptionally well
