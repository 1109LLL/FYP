508293,Hotel du Vin Cannizaro House Wimbledon, Our only complaint was that the check in took a long time as there were only two people on the desk and they had to take the guests to their rooms However the manager saw we had been waiting for some time and covered the cost of the taxi we took later that evening in recompense So an excellent offer we gratefully accepted , The building was lovely and in a beautiful location We only had breakfast at the hotel but it was excellent quality and we were able to sit in the conservatory at the back overlooking the park blissful Staff very friendly We would definitely stay again

508300,Hotel du Vin Cannizaro House Wimbledon, A little noisy until midnight or so but it was Christmas time Didn t see any wombles , The hotel is very boutique and is sumptuosly fitted out Location wise it was fine for my purposes but would be harder for visitors without a car to get around as it is located on the Common and not more centrally in Wimbledon Staff were friendly and helpful Price was quite high but it was for work in London and I would expect to pay more here 
508301,Hotel du Vin Cannizaro House Wimbledon, Payment requested on arrival probably because hotel concerned that they had allocated us a room above a party no mention of party at time of arrival or when booking The noise level was such that the floor of our room was shaking with the music a noise level which meant we couldn t talk to one another without shouting and when the music stopped there was an external door being used below our room which was continuously banging shut until 12 45am We subsequently noticed on another review site that this was not a new occurrence for this hotel and so we will not be returning and would not recommend it , comfortable room
