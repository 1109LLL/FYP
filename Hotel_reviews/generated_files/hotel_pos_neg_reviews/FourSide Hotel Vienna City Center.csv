334788,FourSide Hotel Vienna City Center, Breakfast was ok but REALLY expensive and overpriced If you take a walk behind the neighborhood there are plenty of much cheaper options to enjoy a breakfast Water for those who drink still water is a problem also as you can only have it really overpriced again from the fridge machine opposite the reception One night we got back to the hotel late in the evening the machine did not have any still water bottles and staff told us there wouldn t be any until next day We tried sparkling but it made us more thirsty So if you are staying at the hotel always have your still water with you , Location of the hotel is great it is only 5 mins walking to two stations The hotel is modern and our room was really big bed was huge and very comfortable and all facilities in the bathroom were environmentally friendly One of the best bedrooms I have ever been on my eurotrips 
334789,FourSide Hotel Vienna City Center, There is a construction site near the hotel working going on all day some of the room are shaking with load noises Non smoking rooms smell of cigarettes Why to charge 16 Euro per day for parking this should be free The room is not maintain properly damaged or broken items , Room design Parquet floor Shower Near Supermarket and Metro lines 4 6

334793,FourSide Hotel Vienna City Center, Unfortunately there were a lot of unpleasent surprises First they insited me for the parking money in advance for all our stay in the moment I made the check in at other hotels I payed at the check out everything that was on the room Second one was that every morning at 8 am they started their construction site they are making a new wing of the hotel and there was awful noise from the excavator so if you wanted or not you had to get up at 8 am At the breakfast I saw each day little bugs in the tea area In our check out day at 8 00 am someone insisted knocking at the door housekeeping We told her to leave After that we tryed to sleep a little more but they started to do something at the below level that sounded like moving a lot of furniture Check out was at 12 00 not at 8 00 It s a shame because the hotel looks ok and has a good position It would be great if things would be managed normally without noise bugs and with better client services , The room and bathroom looks good with new furniture The hotel is situated close to the center 
334794,FourSide Hotel Vienna City Center, no view at all i was in a superior double room but from the second floor where i was i had only view to a 3 walls that were up to fifth floor on the ground of the shaft there was only uncultivated lawn , cosy room very clean tea pot in the room

334796,FourSide Hotel Vienna City Center, Not big deal but it s worth knowing that the room does not have a wardrobe but only a rack I had a room on the first floor facing the inner courtyard and therefore it was rather dark and the view was not very nice as I only saw other rooms windows Next time I will ask for an upper floor , I had an enjoyable stay at this hotel and will probably come back The personnel was very helpful the room relatively big the furniture was very modern and new I liked that the bathroom had floor heating The bed was comfortable which is very important for me All in all the report quality price was very good 
334797,FourSide Hotel Vienna City Center, Not having a bathtub or a demarcation between the shower and the rest of the bathroom which I do not like We were given at first a smoking room even though it was specified in the reservation that we needed a non smoking room The personnel working in the beakfast area was desperate to make you pay the food not letting you to finish the meal in peace and harmony I was told three or four times during the same meal that I have to pay it Ok I know and I get it but let me enjoy the meal , The second room offered was ok even though the first one was a former smoking room where you could feel the specific smell The rooms are generally fairly clean and they have a comfortable bed 
334798,FourSide Hotel Vienna City Center, Not a dealbreaker as I usually eat out but when I wanted to order dinner there was no option aside from sandwiches But you can easily order Uber Eats to be delivered to the hotel so no issue there , Service was excellent I arrived at 10am and the front desk Armin gave me a room so I can get into the room straightaway Two thumbs up for the great service The room was huge very clean and bed is comfortable The property is also located very close to a metro station which is less than 5 minutes walk with a supermarket located just across the station The city center is located 10 minutes away via metro Great stay

334816,FourSide Hotel Vienna City Center, The lady at the reception during my check in took out a blank white paper and asked me to write some personal details like name address etc and wanted me to sign it This is the first time I get such a request in my multiple trips worldwide it was not professional at all I presume anything can be written on the paper with my signature at the end and I have the right to refuse doing that After about 10 minutes of a bad attitude insistence from her side she got an existing contract and crossed the name and details then asked me to rewrite my details over Eventually I agreed as at least it was on the hotel s letterhead Other staff were all helpful and nice throughout my stay The water fossit was not properly located very close to the sink that I couldn t get my hand under the water The pictures of the hotel s front were not like the one in display the front entrance was too small, The room was clean and the bed was comfortable yet small though for a double bed we had to squeeze a little bit

334822,FourSide Hotel Vienna City Center, Breakfast price is way overrated You can get the same variety at half the price per person at the local market shops 300m down the road , Nice location quiet and close to a metro subway station Very easygoing stuff 
334823,FourSide Hotel Vienna City Center, The first room we are booked in did not have sound on the TV and aircon did not work So we got moved to a smaller room and the aircon stopped working there too No refund or reduction and we had trouble sleeping as it was so incredibly hot in Vienna in August Staff just kind of shrugged when we complained about the second room not working either Considering air con was the one must have on our list we would not come back, Close to transport market cafes etc

334826,FourSide Hotel Vienna City Center, If you have backache you won t like the bed The mattress is too soft I missed some REAL orange juice There was a machine offering orange juice but it had NOTHING to do with orange It was orange flavoured water In a 4 hotel that s strange In some places they offer freshly squeezed juice that s the best But there are so many orange juices on the market , Very friendly staff Good location close to subway station easy to rech downtown Great that the hotel has a parking but a bit pricey The room was spacious well equipped coffee tee for the guests Good WiFi Breakfast was good

334833,FourSide Hotel Vienna City Center, TV channel listings could have been more broad movie channels would ve been ideal along with sport channels to view football etc , Teamaking facilities were available which was a huge plus as these are mostly absent throughout mid range hotels among Europe Location was extremely convenient to get to the centre of the city Situated near underground station which was fantastic 
334834,FourSide Hotel Vienna City Center,No Negative, We like everything in our room from the bed to the kettle and free tea coffee The staff are very helpful showed where to Shop brought our sugar when we ran out of it showed how to adjust the temperature in our room and would say Good morning or hello when you pass by the reception area and that makes you feel good Checking in out was a breeze too Should have booked with breakfast The Hotel is near Meidling shopping street and is very convenient to move around with the UBahn Buses There are Halal Grilled Chicken Kebab pizza nearby Cafes Nordee Fish McDonalds Sushi Noodles too Supermarkets Pharmacies too Wi Fi very good at our room After a whole day of sightseeing our shoes were always dirty we always apologise to the lady who cleans the floor and yes she always smile and say Its OK

334841,FourSide Hotel Vienna City Center,No Negative, I like everything here especially all staffs The hotel located close to U Bahn and it s easy to get to the city center Plus there is a shopping district close to the hotel which you can find everything you need By the way I ve got pickpocket and lost all my things The hotel staffs saved us They helped us a lot We were really appreciated Highly Recommend 
334842,FourSide Hotel Vienna City Center, On the booking com website it states the hotel provides an airport shuttle One normally assumes this is free It costs 45 euro The shuttle turned out to be a taxi that was driven by a friend of the front desk staff The cab had its meter running and the cab ride would have been 10 euro less without the shuttle service Absolute scam , Room clean however bathroom smelled like mold 
334843,FourSide Hotel Vienna City Center, The Internet was extremely poor constantly in and out slow and weak This only reason makes me never want to stay at this place again Many ppl have complained and yet they don t seem to care to fix it Shame , Everything was very good for value of money but one thing that really put me off and I will never come back here again wifi was terrible

334848,FourSide Hotel Vienna City Center, We arrived late in the evening and were given a room on the ground floor As it tourned out it was a room for disabled persons connected to the next room through a door and we heard everything our neighbours were saying Furthermore the TV wasn t working and upon drawing the staff s attention our room was changed but unfortunately with a single room I didn t protest I m not a troublemaker but it seemed lousy and unfair on their part , The hotel is close to the subway we used the Langenfeldgasse station The double room is clean and spacious with one of the most comfortable beds I ve ever seen The staff was helpful and polite
