450210,Hotel Esther a, Additional luggage rack would be nice and a better hairdryer not one with the on off switch that must be pressed during use , Gorgeous boutique hotel on lovely canal street Beautiful furnishings and plush fabrics in rooms and common areas Very warm and inviting with coffee tea water and sweets offered throughout the day We stopped back at hotel mid day throughout our stay to get coffee and enjoy the posh surroundings Friendly and helpful staff Wonderful bar and breakfast Hope to return one day 
450211,Hotel Esther a, Nothing not to like , It s a small intimate and friendly hotel Loved the decor the atmosphere so romantic Love the drinks in reception and the little cakes in the afternoon is such a lovely gesture We will definitely stay there again 
450212,Hotel Esther a, Seemed a little difficult for the taxi s that brought us to figure out how to get to the hotel They dropped us off a block away When we left the taxi called by the hotel picked us up right in front so there was a way to get there the non local taxi s did not know how to get there , Beautiful lobby and rooms Very comfortable Seemed well thought out Helpful staff All the amenities we wanted Excellent breakfast 
450213,Hotel Esther a, The towels were small and would be better if they were bath sheets , The hotel was beautifully decorated and had a warm and cosy feel to it Staff were brilliant and courteous and knew their job Nothing was too much trouble We would definitely return 
450214,Hotel Esther a, Male reception staff were condescending and largely unfriendly, Comfortable plenty of good basic toiletry supplies very comfortable beds quirky deco constant supply of small sweet treats and coffee tea hot chocolateand flavoured waters Fabulous location Cleaning staff were quiet and unobtrusive
450215,Hotel Esther a, Didn t find a thing that wasn t up to a 5 star , The bar food and drinks were excellent as were the complimentary tea coffee juices and food snacks in the lovely common rooms This hotel is FANTASTIC Will definitely stay there on a return to Amsterdam Highly recommend 
450216,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, This is a beautiful old hotel really well situated to get to everything very easily The staff are generally very friendly and helpful however one of the front desk staff gave me the wrong information she had even checked with a colleague as she seemed unsure still got it wrong so I ended up missing a tour as I was waiting in the wrong place and when I finally got to the meeting point the tour had left and of course no refund This was disappointing but the only blot on an otherwise outstanding property 
450217,Hotel Esther a, Cannot think of anything I didn t like , Very nice breakfast Plenty of choice All staff very polite helpful and attentive Our room was lovely Very clean and well equipped with toiletries which it would appear are replaced regularly Lots of nice touches like free coffee sweets and biscuits in lounges Everything displayed beautifully furniture and decor outstanding Beautiful chandeliers and flowers everywhere What more can I say Excellent 
450218,Hotel Esther a, Nothing, This hotel was one of the nicest we have ever stayed in The staff was very friendly and helpful They provided many little things not available in other hotels but that added pleasure to our stay The lobby and bar area are extremely attractive and significantly changed weekly with fresh flowers and plants The rooms are small but very nicely decorated each room is different and comfortable There is no restaurant but the bar has a very good bar menu The location is perfect right on a canal We were able to walk everywhere and never took public transportation We would highly recommend this hotel 
450219,Hotel Esther a, The bathroom in room 507 was pretty tight but well appointed The shower tub was a bit awkward had to get the glass doors just right to avoid puddles on the floor , The staff was incredibly responsive and proactive The breakfast was a beautiful experience including champagne in a bucket if you wanted to turn your oj into a mimosa our room on the 5th floor facing the canal had such beautiful views The attention to detail and impeccable maintenance were appreciated by me the free cookies and sweets 24 7 were appreciated by my husband The best hotel of our 3 week European trip Thank you Estherea 
450220,Hotel Esther a, thought the bathroom could use brighter lights , Second time at Hotel Estherea and a very nice property Clean off the beaten track but close to great neighborhoods and the Metro terrific staff good bar menu and free cookies 
450221,Hotel Esther a, Room could have been slightly larger but made up for it with charm, All the rooms are different and unique it s more personal than stopping in a hotel chain with lots more character
450222,Hotel Esther a, Rooms updated with more modern furniture since we last stayed there however now appears to have limited storage space for clothes if staying a few days Bedside tables were just that no drawers A chest of drawers or similar would have been useful Modern wall mounted fridge totally inefficient with little shelf space , Convenient location free tea coffee biscuits and sweets in lounge area Bar snacks quite good so were cocktails Staff friendly and efficient 
450223,Hotel Esther a, Only breakfast served no onsite restaurant for lunch or dinner but several very close by so really not that big of a deal Shower design meant water would get all over the floor each time you used it , While the rooms are not large they are well appointed and beautifully decorated Breakfast is amazing and totally worth the cost Location could not have been better Staff was super helpful 
450224,Hotel Esther a, The traffic in Amsterdam especially be careful of bicycles ridden by other tourists , We loved the decor individual quirky but luxurious Friendly comfortable sitting rooms Excellent biscuits pastries sweets served free all day in the sitting room together with free hot cold drinks Rooms some may be small are perfectly fitted out with plentiful storage 
450225,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The nicest Hotel on our trip through Belgium and GB Staff was fantastic Location great All you could eat Butter Cookies my favorite part haha Would go back in a heartbeat Breakfast was fantastic Just remember you get what you pay for 
450226,Hotel Esther a, All was excellent, Great staff all helpful and friendly Great bedroom and very comfortable beds English TV channels Lots of bars restaurants near by
450227,Hotel Esther a, The only complaint is the spotty wi fi We were fine but some rooms on the first floor can get a lot of noise from the street at night , The hotel is unique and georgeous We were ready for a comfortable city stay after a week long road trip through Iceland We were smiling as soon as we walked through the door and did not stop The staff was helpful the decor was magazine worthy yet quirky and thoroughly unique It had more personality than a standard luxury hotel Wonderful L Occitaine products in the bathrooms The round the clock coffee and snacks was a huge benefit as well and truly pleased my coffee addicted husband We loved everything and will be back when next in Amsterdam 
450228,Hotel Esther a, I guess the only bad thing about this hotel is that you have to leave the key behind every time you go out but nevertheless it was not a big issue , The service by the staff was perfection and the hotel itself made me want to stay in Amsterdam longer 
450229,Hotel Esther a, The wifi was slightly annoying as you have to keep logging on everytime you switch on phone ipad it should remember you for an allocated time , I have stayed at this hotel on 4 occasions and really like it Its small and friendly and each room is different and nicely decorated Beds are comfy and bathrooms very clean with nice toiletries I would recommend asking for a room on the canal side as it will be quieter at night or on a higher floor 
450230,Hotel Esther a, Can t think of anything bad at all I would go back to this hotel anytime , Fantastic place Hotel is well located The rooms were luxury Staff was friendly and helpful Lots of great places to eat within 100m 
450231,Hotel Esther a, Not a thing I would return in a heartbeat, Staff incredibly helpful Coffee bar 24 7 Delicious cookies every afternoon Rooms are gorgeous can t beat the location Bathroom toiletries A1 Super clean Luxurious
450232,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Overall a great stay The rooms are setup very well and very thoughtfully adjusted to have all the facilities in the given space Location is central to all tram stations
450233,Hotel Esther a, Everything was nice except for the size of the room which is little small , I was happy with the hotel and its staff who were very welcoming and friendly 
450234,Hotel Esther a, I cannon think of anything to improve , Where do I start from the moment you enter the hotel it is beautiful There is always free tea and coffee with an endless supply of little treats Biscuits cakes and even little chocolate windmills We had a room on the canal stunning There is a coffee machine in your room an iron and an ironing board The staff and helpful and friendly both a reception and the bar Great location and the bar stays open 24hrs what more could you ask for 
450235,Hotel Esther a, Not good for light sleepers Walls and floors are thin Can hear my upstairs neighbor constantly padding around the room late at night and also awaken by same neighbor yelling at 6 in the morning , Good location to explore Amsterdam Good sized room and bathroom Charming romantic decor Good breakfast buffet 
450236,Hotel Esther a, Nothing, We loved staying at this hotel 4 years ago and knew we wanted this hotel on our return to Amsterdam The facility is beautiful and immaculate The staff is wonderful We really appreciated Ava and Leo They were the best 
450237,Hotel Esther a, I like having breakfast so I was a little disappointed that it was an extra cost But I realize many people don t eat breakfast so I think it probably was a good idea not to include it It is in avery busy part of Amsterdam but the hotel itself and room was very quiet , This is a beautiful hotel The staff was very helpful and accommodating The hotel is privately owned and luxuriously decorated It has a small family feel Everything was done to make you feel comfortable It was very clean and well cared for 
450238,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, One of the overall best hotels ever stayed in and especially Dolores and Amal Daily snack table was great hotel was very clean staff was exceptional and if ever in Amsterdam we would stay again at Hotel Estherea 
450239,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The location our view our lovely room our food and service all excellent We left our camera and the hotel is sending it to our home Wonderful hotel 
450240,Hotel Esther a, Room a bit small but this was due to hotel being made up of Amsterdam houses It wasn t really a problem , Lovely touch of luxury in hotel Breakfasts were expensive but very nice Great location walked everywhere 
450241,Hotel Esther a, The bar breakfast area would have been more comfortable if the thermostat had been turned a little higher , The hotel was terrific The staff was super nice and helpful The location is great in the old part of Amsterdam and close to all the sights but outside of the very noisy busy area near the Central Station The hotel itself has a beautiful decor in the public rooms complemented by always available tea coffee cookies and chocolate Our room was a canal view room with a king size extremely comfortable bed The room felt spacious with a small sitting area with two comfortable modern white leather chairs On that side of the hotel there is light streaming in almost all day and the view of the canal with boat and pedestrian traffic is nice The bathroom was very small but well designed bright and adequate 
450242,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Staff was very helpful We also like the 24 hour capacitor and coffee service and treat table that was available It was in a PERFECT location Highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again in a heartbeat 
450243,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Very elegant property excellent location Tea coffee in the lobby with biscuits etc at all times very good idea Relaxing atmosphere and very happy helpful staff Good breakfast
450244,Hotel Esther a, On our first morning we are breakfast in the onsite restaurant We were double billed for our food It took much too long to resolve but eventually were credited for the duplicate charge but it left us a little less happy with our stay there , Central location beautifully decorated lobby room very comfortable onsite breakfast convenient room had canal view
450245,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, tea and coffee with delicious biscuits were free and available in the hotel room In the luxury hall there was a collection of books and beautiful flowers 
450246,Hotel Esther a, Bathroom a little small and needed a little more storage, The bed complimentary drinks water and biscuits and decor was of a high standard Toiletries were also fantastic and also location was excellent 
450247,Hotel Esther a, Don t really have anything to complain about , Beautiful hotel and lovely staff Restaurants abound in the area and everything is within walking distance 
450248,Hotel Esther a, Nothing All that was promised was delivered and more , The friendly efficient staff the ambience of the hotel and the attention to detail The location easy access to tourist attractions Staying in a canal house equisitly decorated added to the Amsterdam experience 
450249,Hotel Esther a, Although the hotel etc was excellent it was also very expensive I thought for that kind of money it should have been even better , The location was very good and the room was fine The parking was excellent especially considering how difficult Amsterdam can be for parking 
450250,Hotel Esther a, Breakfast buffet was excellent but a little pricey , Beautiful flowers all the time Attention to detail and service Ideal location to good restaurants and tram lines 
450251,Hotel Esther a, Terrible Wifi that barely works anywhere in the hotel The staff shared their own wifi access but unfortunately that only worked well for a couple of hours Small room feels cramped You have to return the key every time you leave the hotel and ask for them when you re back Very inconvenient , Beautiful room in a quite area Close to dam square Very comfortable bed Great fresh breakfast with nice variety You can rent a scooter from the hotel which was very useful 
450252,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Great little boutique hotel in great location Ideal for walking to all the main sights They provide free hot and cold drinks and biscuits throughout the day Lovely treat 
450253,Hotel Esther a, The air conditioner didn t keep up with the heat The room was quite small with little space for open suitcases etc although it was probably not smaller than other old traditional hotels in Europe ,No Positive
450254,Hotel Esther a, First room so small we had to move Not sufficient wardrobe space and room overlooked courtyard with other rooms very close so no privacy Second room ok but tiny TV on wall you couldn t watch it from the bed Also the check In so complicated in as much as it was not clear what we were paying and still had to give a deposit , Free good coffee nice communal areas
450255,Hotel Esther a, Somewhat petty but the room could use more shelf space No clothes drawers at all The closet which had shelves was mostly taken up by a safe fridge and ironing board all of which we could have done without A glass table in the window alcove could have had some kind of dresser or desk with drawers The last two times we stayed here the rooms contained more than adequate shelf space , Super place staff and location We stayed only one night in transit Have stayed here twice before and would go back 
450256,Hotel Esther a, Too much furnishing in our room with multiple cushions etc and no room to put anything once these were off the bed Small room but lovely canal view , Refreshments available in foyer Restful area to wait while room prepared 
450257,Hotel Esther a, The air conditioning system could have been a bit quieter , Staff and facilities were excellent really liked the beverages cakes and cool water available 24 7 in the lounge reception area
450258,Hotel Esther a, We didn t breakfast at the hotel so can t comment , Pastries were delightful and fresh Coffee machine station excellent Beds very comfy A most enjoyable stay 
450259,Hotel Esther a, Shoebox bathroom which if you are taller than 5ft 2in forget getting under the bath hairspray and if you are bigger than 8 stone forget having a bath infact forget even getting through the shutters to the loo Didn t complain found out when we checked out after 4 expensive days that we would only have been moved to another room without canalview a family room Also the receptionist said most bathrooms were this small size anyway This explained why when we checked in there were no smiley faces or welcomes Just waiting for our comments I suppose We felt so unwelcome that we had our breakfasts out in local cafes It was my husbands surprise 65th birthday trip I had organised for him and I feel very badly let down , decor and furniture in the canal view double deluxe room in fact throughout
450260,Hotel Esther a, Can t think about something , We liked the intimate and well decorated lobby and entrance hall equipped with a free tea espresso cappuccino machine tasty variety of cookies and cold water lemonade proposed during the whole day 
450261,Hotel Esther a, The hotel is a gem service is almost perfect but just before leaving we realized my husband s blazer was missing after a transfer to a better room At the front desk after waiting for over an hour last minute shopping they claimed to be unable to find it Had they believed us right away and looked harder where we suggested it would have been found right away The blazer was found shortly after our departure they are now shipping it Since we are traveling It was the only dress jacket my husband had and needed today for a wedding Some form of compensation should have been offered at the time A small discount or free parking for a day a small gesture for a big inconvenience , The interior of the hotel was gorgeous Service excellent Dreamy Bedrooms
450262,Hotel Esther a, Unfortunately we did not look at room size before booking and at about 13m2 this was the smallest room we have ever stayed in relative to cost The glass shower and toilet opening directly next to the bed provided no privacy and after removing cushions and pillows from bed there was a feeling of claustrophobia I am sure other larger rooms would have been better , The lobby and bar areas were were incredibly furnished with free tasty snacks and coffee regularly available Bedroom furnishings of high quality and view over canal was great Staff could not have been more helpful 
450263,Hotel Esther a, The bathroom was a bit tight and it was also hard to get in out of the high bathtub when showering , We had a canal room which was lovely The hotel s lobby is also stunning with antiques chandeliers and gorgeous floral arrangements The afternoon cookies were also a nice treat 
450264,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Beautiful small hotel I am not sure if the canal view was worth the extra pay but the room was very nice The breakfast a bit expensive but well worth The staff was fantastic 
450265,Hotel Esther a, Parking is very expensive in Amsterdam We were lucky to find a parking spot right in front of the hotel but it was 45 euro for 24 hours The hotel has valet parking if you have a small car , A beautiful hotel in Amsterdam right on the canal and within walking distance of the local attractions Restaurants within walking distance Nice free snacks and drinks in the evening in the lobby Beautifully decorated lobby with nice and attentive staff that was always willing to help with our request for directions or information Nice bar area 
450266,Hotel Esther a, We didn t have a door for our bathroom but some kind of closet door it was very nice design wise but not very practical Don t know if it s like that on all rooms, Excellent hotel on excellent location Spotless clean Very good service Very good breakfast with extra payment Good room size quiet The cost was a little bit high
450267,Hotel Esther a, everything was amazing, Fabulous Hotel fabulous location we will return it was a wonderful holiday staff were excellent couldn t do enough for us only problem for me was the bed was too hard but the staff brought me extra duvets to make bed softer fabulous 
450268,Hotel Esther a, No complaints whatsoever Keep up the good work , Beautiful friendly and centrally located for seeing all the sights of Amsterdam Breakfast buffet was superb I would highly recommend 
450269,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Knowing it was a small boutique hotel I was not expecting much but this place is amazing from the decor to the location to the comfort it s perfect The owners are spectacular and accommodating very modern interior beautifully done I just can t say enough about this gem of a hotel 
450270,Hotel Esther a, We flew in early and requested early check in Unfortunately rooms not ready They did hold our luggage and were very nice Offered us cold water etc I know this is not guaranteed but would have loved to shower after long flight before we headed out It was unseasonably warm which we didn t expect , Hotel location is wonderful Right on canal in City Center lots of shops and restaurants near by Waling distance to Anne Frank House Van Gough Museum Rikjsmuseum although those are a bit farther Staff so very friendly helpful Lobby very comfortable with coffee all day and fresh flavored water Charming Would stay here again 
450271,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Staff was super friendly and helpful Restaurant and bar were excellent Surrounding shops and restaurants were great Walkability was wonderful Close to museums malls and town center 
450272,Hotel Esther a, Breakfast was expensive and not a lot of choice Much better to go to one of the many cafes and pancake houses close by Staff although friendly could have been more helpful there seems to be a lack of knowledge of where some of the best places to eat nearby were We ended up using the internet and booking things ourselves , Great location within easy walking distance of shops restaurants cafes and some of the popular sights Stylish bedrooms We stayed in a classic the cheapest rooms but were pleasantly surprised at good size room which was stylishly decorated Ensuite bathroom had bath with shower over the top but was powerful enough Loved the free iPads given on arrival which you could use to look up and plan activities tours and sightseeing Within a stones throw of some of the prettiest smaller canals close to Jordan district great for strolling in the evenings 
450273,Hotel Esther a, Some of the rooms are a bit flowery in design however this is an aesthetic judgement overall they are well laid out and we had a very comfortable bed jacuzzi bath and Juliet balcony overlooking the street so still very special , Excellent canal side location in a vibrant area Stylish interior design throughout the hotel but the common areas library lounges coffee bar etc are wonderful and inviting We greatly enjoyed the ambiance of Martha s Bar and found the staff friendly helpful and professional An outstanding hotel experience in Amsterdam 
450274,Hotel Esther a, Confused staff when settling charges at end of stay Two charges not ours Beware Erratic WiFi yet they give you an iPad that is supposed to tell you everything about the hotel Useless , Nice property Great location 
450275,Hotel Esther a, I can t think of a single thing we did not like about this hotel , This property is conveniently located to history sites public transportation cruise ship dock and the flower market The rooms were beautiful and the front desk staff first rate We will definitely stay there again is we get a chance There are a ton of restaurants within walking distance of this hotel 
450276,Hotel Esther a, The breakfast was a nightmare We were given no information about how it worked It was disorganised and chaotic Nobody seemed to be in charge of running it No staff spoke to guests it was a free for all It was also far too expensive at 36 euros For two Also I found being charged a different room rate plus city tax for each night very odd This was not fully explained by booking com and I paid more than I was quoted for my stay , Hotel room was lovely very large comfortable beds and great view The free beverages and snacks in the lobby were a nice touch The bar service was good The bar lounge area was pleasant and relaxing to sit in I liked the authentic old Dutch feel of the hotel and think this was preferable to a chain hotel The location was very central 
450277,Hotel Esther a, Bedroom very small and bathroom tiny only suitable for Ione person Shower screen too short, Very convenient location for walking to most sites Public rooms and bar very good Staff very helpful and pleasant View over the canal lovely 
450278,Hotel Esther a, BUT it had a very bumpy start We checked in after an all night flight from the U S and were shown a tiny room on a shaft that had construction going on in it They said there would be noise during the day This was unacceptable to us so they showed us to another room after waiting a bit that was as tiny but facing the canal We had never seen a room that small The toilet was a stall separate from the sink around the corner by the entrance door And then there was an equally tiny stall shower all about a foot from the bed We frankly couldn t believe that they were putting us in a room like that for four days having booked nearly a year in advance And at over 300 per night They said they were fully booked but would move us again the next day They did into a much larger and elegant room which is where they should have put us to start with We complained to the management It was an unfortunate way to begin our trip especially as we were so tired and couldn t properly unpack at the start , The Estherea is a lovely friendly and splendidly located 4 star hotel in Amsterdam We enjoyed our stay there for 4 days
450279,Hotel Esther a, Bed was a little soft and pillows were very fluffy , The property was on a quiet canal so was not noisy but was only a couple of blocks from the City Centre Good restaurants and cafes nearby easy access to the public transportation and within walking distance of the key museums and tourist sites 
450280,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The Bed and the Pillows were very comfortable We had a very sound sleep The whole decor of the room was done in the DELFT BLUE tones and print The toiletries were L Occitance As we were there only for a day and wanted to make the most of our time experiencing Amsterdam we were not able to explore the hotel facilities fully but the Dining Area Bar Library all looked very inviting The staff was polite and made us feel quite welcome Location was Superb Walking distance from Jordan Centraal Station De Wallen and right in the midst of lovely canals Would love to stay there again if given the opportunity of another visit 
450281,Hotel Esther a, A few more toilitireies available in the room for guests to use take one of the reasons I booked this hotel was due to the L occitan toiletries only a small complaint I just love that brand and expected a little more than one small body moisturiser and one small bar between the two of us , Beautiful stunning hotel complimentary very good coffee cucumber and mint water and snacks available 24hours in the reception area the hotel is covered in THE MOST unreal chandeliers ever Staff attentive and professional always Wish I could have stayed longer
450282,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The fabulous decor of the elegant hotel with a window looking out to the canal and the proximity to all of the major sites of Amsterdam We were able to walk everywhere The most beautiful hotel in Amsterdam
450283,Hotel Esther a, Louvre doors to the bathroom Not very nice , The Hotel was very well cared for and the staff were very helpful Rooms were lovely comfortable and had everything you need hairdryers iron and gorgeous toiletries Hotel lobby had complimentary 24hr hot and cold drinks and delicious cakes in the afternoon and evening We were 7 women travelling together and found the hotels central location safe and convienient to walk to all the sights A wonderful stay Thank you Estherea 
450284,Hotel Esther a, Didn t like the toilet shower so close to the bed if I had to complain but really great hotel, Staff excellent intimate feel to the hotel can t complain 
450285,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Everything about our stay exceeded our expectations The common areas are as luxurious and tasteful as can be we had a beautiful room with a view the staff couldn t have been nicer and the location is perfect 
450286,Hotel Esther a, Nothing, The hotel was excellent all round the staff were very friendly and courteous nothing was too much trouble The room was of a good size with all mod cons a very comfortable bed and just like it said on the tin 
450287,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, I loved everything about this hotel The staff were polite friendly and professional and nothing was too much trouble My room was beautiful overlooking the canal and the bed was very comfortable There was plenty of choice for breakfast 
450288,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Friendly staff welcoming lobby with lots of nooks to enjoy free coffee tea throughout the day comfortable room Have stayed there 3 times and would return in a heartbeat 
450289,Hotel Esther a, bathroom could ve been larger poor quality small tv no satellite tv no tea making facilities in room on one afternoon we returned after 3pm to find room not made up asked reception and waited in lounge Not ready till after 4 30 after three complaints to reception staff This delayed our planned early evening arrangements not impressed , nice hotel in excellent location very comfy bed decent sized room three large opening windows giving lovely views onto canal 
450290,Hotel Esther a, Nothing at all, Friendly and very helpful staff Staff would go to any extent to delight guests This makes the experience so much better Hotel is located in an excellent location There are plenty of restaurants nearby Its also minutes away from key locations like Ann Frank house and Amsterdam central Good location to walk with family Canal view rooms are exceptional Hotel was very clean and always pleasant Would recommend the hotel and I m looking forward to visiting again
450291,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Our room was exquisite The shower was luxe The location was central to everything The staff was helpful Plentiful and good coffee and tea plus cookies 
450292,Hotel Esther a, Nothing It was all good , Very comfortable Tea making equipment in the foyer available 24 hours a day Central location close to good restaurants Staff very helpful 
450293,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Amazing AGAIN The hotel is conveniently located near the centre walking distance to all the best spots and surrounded by many great places to eat The decor the staff the canal view are all top notch Can t wait to stay at Estherea on our next visit in Amsterdam
450294,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Recently redecorated and it is beautiful Very sophisticated yet warm inviting The room we had was quiet faced the interior courtyard Small room bath but nicely done comfortable You are given an iPad for your use in the room We are returning next week for a few more days prior to flying home 
450295,Hotel Esther a, See above as good and bad included there, 1 room price over priced vs today s prices Feel was taken to the cleaners paid way too much 2 breakfast NOT included 3 bath tub too small 4 bath floor slippery fell 4 no instructions re channels 5 booking com ripped us off by charging too much for room not including breakfast
450296,Hotel Esther a, The bathroom was literally a small corner of the room that had been sectioned off with 1 thick frosted glass It was not a separate room with a door The bathroom consisted of two tiny stalls one with a toilet and the other with a shower The toilet stall was smaller than an airline bathroom There was NO privacy for the toilet stall The toilet was about 4 ft from the bed and the swinging frosted glass door was open at the top There was absolutely no privacy whatsoever The sink was in the bedroom taking up valuable space in an already very small room The room was too small to accommodate people and luggage We had to move a desk chair out of the room so that we could shove our suitcases under the writing desk There was a small cupboard in which to hang a few items and there were some storage cubbies over the bed It was not unlike stowing gear in a sailboat , The room itself was lovely though quite small even by European standards There were two big windows looking right onto the canal The bed was very comfortable The room had excellent climate control 
450297,Hotel Esther a, Bed was really creaky air wasn t great in room couldn t get a consistent temp throughout the night and didn t like that it was two twin beds pushed together make sure you ask for a full or queen when you check in , Beautiful property Great staff very nice decor Also great amenities 24 7 bar safe area very stylish in general areas and in rooms Awesome shampoo and conditioner full size of all L Occitane products 
450298,Hotel Esther a, Very creaky floorboards We could hear other guests walking about their room above , The hotel was beautifully decorated and staff very friendly and helpful The complimentary drinks they provide near the main lobby were a fantastic resource after a long day exploring the city They had a good buffet selection for breakfast and the beds were super comfy Hotel was also very centrally located and within easy walking distance to most major attractions in Amsterdam The hotel also offer a taxi voucher that you can purchase for your ride back to the airport It is only slightly cheaper but still good to know 
450299,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Ordered breakfast to the room Good choice and very reasonably priced Fabulous having complimentary coffee tea in foyer and can also ask for tea coffee kettle in room if so desired Nothing was too much trouble for the lovely friendly staff 
450300,Hotel Esther a, We would definitely recommend a room with an outside view The rooms with a patio view were actually just a small courtyard directly facing the rooms across from us and were very dark We had a room like this We asked to be changed to an outside room and they did this promptly One of the best hotels we have stayed in anywhere , We liked everything The staff was the best ever and truly took personal interest in us and what we wanted to do they ALL have fantastic personalities Every day when returning to the hotel it was like coming home 
450301,Hotel Esther a, english cooked breakfast was very lacking only had bacon and eggs that i saw but plenty of toast and continental about , relaxed feel and laid back but we knew staff would excel to help if requested touches of free coffee and cakes all day invitation to join the nation for kings day with free hats and neck garlands etc
450302,Hotel Esther a, For a hotel of that standard I would have liked a larger bath towel , The hotel was within walking distance of the places we wanted to see and visit It was very comfortable and we were made to feel welcome If you want a taxi don t go on a public holiday in this case King s Day 27th April We went specifically to see the tulips which were magnificent well worth going 
450303,Hotel Esther a, wish the bathroom shower duo had been a bit more separated from the bedroom especially the way the floor flowed right from the shower into the bedroom , lovely pastries daily in coffee niche with natural flavored water urns lovely public spaces intimate and well appointed most amazing attention to flowers and floral arrangements in all public spaces beautiful bar restaurant was very impressed Loved the l occitaine products 
450304,Hotel Esther a, There appeared to be only one lift for the whole hotel but in an historic building like this it was a small price to pay, The staff were very friendly and helpful The bed was very comfortable and the room was well furnished The complimentary teas coffees and freshly made biscuits were an added bonus 
450305,Hotel Esther a, Room 105 on ground floor overlooked by other guest and cleaning staff so window shutters had to be kept closed Room was a bit small Bed a bit to hard for my personal preference, The staff were super efficient friendly and very professional The hotel decor is beautiful
450306,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Excellent Gorgeous Can t say enough and will definitely be recommending this hotel to all my friends and family if and when they travel to Amsterdam The staff could not have been more accommodating and friendly Shout out to Igor He was always helpful and never without a smile As far as the room we stayed in a triple and the decor was beautiful Definitely not dated In fact I would love to have that wall paper for my bedroom Thank you to all the staff 
450307,Hotel Esther a, Nothing to say I loved it , Beautiful hotel Well decorated The beds are extremely comfortable The hotel is well located close to the city center but quieter area Very classy I loved it and I ll definitely go back 
450308,Hotel Esther a, Could of done with tea coffee making facilities in room , Staff really friendly and so eager to help Exceptionally clean and comfy bed Will definitely be returning
450309,Hotel Esther a, A better explanation by staff of how the thermostat works in heating and cooling the room or maybe understanding celcius and farenheit would probably help HA , The location was so wonderful Right next to a canal easy walking distance to most major sights in and around Amsterdam 
450310,Hotel Esther a, Very tiny room with really cheap details Scratchy towels cheap tissue paper one little bar of soap that the maid did not replace I used the same one for four days Bad TV service which shut down at night A rerun of the same Amsterdam program which broke up every two minutes ONE TV news station and no local news or weather Bad layout to open the one drawer you had to open the wardrobe door But it banged into the bench so you had to move furniture to get a piece of underwear The staff gave me wrong directions to Dam Square and I almost missed my tour Then she said she was from Germany and didn t know the City So why give directions Many annoying details Bad breakfast buffet and they didn t tell you it was in another room So you sit there for 20 minutes waiting for a menu that never arrives No fruit served a bowl of tired grapes and some Kiwi slices was all Make your own coffee Really overpriced at 18 Euros , Beautiful decor lovely location good coffee but only in the lobby not the room 
450311,Hotel Esther a, Breakfast wasn t that great selection too small versus the cost Wouldn t choose to have breakfast here again , Hotel was fabulous Staff were extremely friendly and helpful Room beautiful nice touch of being left chocolates as it was our anniversary A very pleasant stay we will defiantly be back 
450312,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, If you wish to avoid the assembly line look and service of a multi chain hotel group this is a wonderful hotel with a personal touch Beautiful decor and wonderful location The free beverages and high quality sweet treats are welcoming and we enjoyed ending our day with a cup of hot cocoa in the well appointed hotel lobby 
450313,Hotel Esther a, Bathroom shower needed wider glass enclosure as water kept splattering out on floor , Everything from bathroom amenities l occitane the room styles vintage excellent bar food open late nights the staff very accommodating and efficient gorgeous hotel library sitting area lobby and location by the bar Appreciated the complimentary coffee tea and sweets daily 
450314,Hotel Esther a, my room was small but that happens in old European towns however the building s enormous exterior lighting is immediately outside the window and the bathroom ceiling is only 6 5 high The shower is only 5 11 high This tiny room and bath was completely inappropriate for a tall guest , great location with a view of a canal and professional staff lobby is very charming 
450315,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Excellent Hotel great old posh style with fully modern amenities very friendly staff best location along the Singel and close to very good restaurants Indian Italian Indonesian and Dutch Hope to come back

450317,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Loved the L occitane products in room The location was fabulous I felt very safe and comfortable in the hotel The rooms were extremely clean and comfortable Loved the free cookies and refreshments on the lobby Staff is lovely 
450318,Hotel Esther a, Their bar is only a few weeks old So the bar menu needs to be revamped We opted to dine nearby at other restaurants , Location could walk to everything Better than most European hotels Staff could not do enough to please their guests Opt for a canal facing room worth the extra money 
450319,Hotel Esther a, Was quite noisy at night on the street side but that s probably beyond your control, The staff were really helpful booking museums dinner reservations etc We appreciated the complimentary tea coffee and cake in the hotel salon
450320,Hotel Esther a, The river cruise from the hotel could have been improved by a more informative guide to tell you about buildings etc you are passing with out having to constantly ask questions , The room was beautiful with a view over the canal Very clean with added bonuses such as dressing gown all toiletries etc The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful If you have a sweet tooth lots of free sweets and on tap 24 hr complimentary coffee and great cookies All major attractions within walking distance or an easy tram ride away and being able to get your tickets at reception saves a great deal of queuing Old world charm but modern facilities I would highly recommend 
450321,Hotel Esther a, Room was rather small but more than compensated by quality of materials and equipment , Very charming room under the roof with view on the Singel canal Staff and service fully up to the 4 star promise Ideal starting point for discovering the whole City center on foot 
450322,Hotel Esther a, I personally would have liked tea and coffee making facilities in the room although you could go down to the lobby and get it at anytime I also think the fish were in a very small pond it definately needed to be bigger, The hotel was fantastic very plush and the staff could not have been more helpful
450323,Hotel Esther a, No decaffeinated coffee other than ghastly sachets Breakfast ok but not brilliant Awful bathroom hairdryers although a hand held quickly produced on request , Great ambiance Hotel has a lovely atmosphere Location perfect in the nicest part of Amsterdam for strolling around the canals Breakfast room very charming Room nicely decorated with good facilities although a bit on the small side which is forgivable given that it is in an old canal side property Staff very efficient and friendly 
450324,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, A really lovely hotel in a very Dutch Amsterdam style decorated and furnished in a traditional but modern manner Canal views from the front bedrooms are excellent The hotel is ideally situated for the shops in the Jordaan district and for the centre Dam square for instance in the other direction Two of Amsterdam s best restaurants are in the adjacent street Haesje Claes and d Vijff Vlieghen 
450325,Hotel Esther a, Absolutely nothing it was perfect, The staff were so kind and patient and nothing was too much trouble Our room overlooked the canal and even though it was on a busy ish street the noise was minimal Beds were sooo comfortable Location great Can t wait to go back

450329,Hotel Esther a, Separate toilet in bedroom rather small Coffee tea station free of charge was ok but cups with handles rather than cardboard and china mugs with no handles were uncomfortable with hot drinks The restaurants in the area were a mixed bag of good to indifferent , Excellent staff all responsive cheerful and helpful Buffet style breakfast very good fried eggs just right yolk a bit runny Comfortable bed and furniture in a smallish bedroom Good lounge with comfortable chairs and selection of newspapers in several languages Hotel location is very good within easy walking distance of many of the places of interest The one and half hour boat trip from directly outside the hotel was a good start to our time in Amsterdam 
450330,Hotel Esther a, Wife said room lightning not really bright enough for applying make up , The bed was really comfortable The staff were friendly and helpful Tea coffee machine nice touch 
450331,Hotel Esther a, We stayed in room 108 Whilst the view was good the size of the room would be considered small had it been a single but as a double i felt it was too small There is no seperate bathroom therefore a pane of frosted glass and about 12 inches was all that seperated the toilet from the bed For the price paid i didn t think the room size or room facilities were appropriate or value for money , Location is perfect staff and overall hotel were lovely and facilities were good 
450332,Hotel Esther a, Wifi in room was bad Street noise on Friday night was very loud Used ear plugs to sleep, Snacks coffee beautiful lobby bath products quality linen cleanliness helpful staff location was great
450333,Hotel Esther a, Room was good just not on the front Main road so no view from our room but then we are not here for the view The city was very interesting And we enjoyed our stay Staff very helpful and friendly And we all enjoyed the free tea and coffee room ,No Positive
450334,Hotel Esther a, Maybe would have been good to have continental breakfast included in price but many places to have breakfast rather than paying 18, The hotel was lovely Very well situated Free tea coffee and delicious cakes available 24 7 in hotel lobby Rooms are lovely and beds very comfortable Nice bar Staff all extremely helpful
450335,Hotel Esther a, Our room was small and we had a view of the road at the back not the lovely canal at the front which was a shame We were only there one night otherwise I would have asked to move , The hotel is lovely in a perfect spot overlooking the canal Singel near the flower market There is a canal cruise that leaves from right outside the front door The room was small but very pretty and the bed was very comfortable Bathroom was perfect with big bath separate shower and a separate loo so loads of space Breakfast buffet was very nice with loads of choice of hot and cold food There was a tea coffee machine to help yourself all day along with pastries and cake We didnt eat dinner in the hotel but there were plenty of restaurants nearby It was the perfect hotel for a night or two in Amsterdam
450336,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The hotel is like being in a beautifully maintained home The decoration throughout is stunning and has a feeling of luxury wherever you are either in your room the bar area or the reception The bed was one of the most comfortable beds ever although the room was a little small it was beautifully clean with the lights and lamps sparkling and not a speck of dust Toiletries provided amazing and hair dryer and towels just like home Having complementary coffee and cakes in the lounge area was lovely after a busy day in Amsterdam Stayed for 2 nights enjoyed breakfast both mornings which was plentiful and very tasty Staff all extremely pleasant and helpful booked us a table at a local restaurant after recommendation was clear when we got there that without the hotel making the booking we wouldn t have secured table Would definitely stay again 
450337,Hotel Esther a, Choice of food in the hotel in the evening is very limited, Hotel has character and a very comfortable atmosphere The position is ideal for walking to all major sites in Amsterdam The staff are very friendly and helpful 
450338,Hotel Esther a, Our room was not cleaned until 3pm in the afternoon When we inquired why we were provided attitude and rudeness by the staff The staff never apologised to us about the room and were told that we should wait in the lounge There was no follow up with us regarding the matter We had to go check ourself if the room was cleaned Which took another 30 to 40 mins Breakfast selection quite poor and expensive for what was provided , Very good complimentary coffee in the lounge area with some different snacks all day Some of the staff members were very friendly and helpful Very good location 
450339,Hotel Esther a, The room was very small toilet and shower was just in the room without separate bathroom The bed was queen size but in fact small enough Old fashion keys to be returned every time when you leave the room The room was very cold even AC did not help Small corridor Not the perfect level of value for money , Friendly staff very good location everything was in walking distance the room with channel view 
450340,Hotel Esther a, When the front seat handed iPad for hotel information Wish it was updated to give better restaurant information Restaurant was under renovation Wish manager on duty also somefront desk could have been a little more helpful Room on canal very noisy New windows needed , Beautiful location 
450341,Hotel Esther a, Nothing everything was spot on , We didn t book breakfast here but the room was amazing Best by far as I ve stayed in Amsterdam a few times and have always found it hard to find a decent size room 
450342,Hotel Esther a, Nothing, This Hotel was amazing The friendly staff the delicious food the comfort of the bed the decor the free coffee and cookies and cakes absolutely everything was lovely There was nothing we could fault with this Hotel it was amazing 
450343,Hotel Esther a, There was things not included when booking through Booking com but if you use their homepage paying the same amount you get way more things such as Gym Bikes and Breakfast etc , The design
450344,Hotel Esther a, would like tea making facilities in room, Free upgrade on arrival as hotel not full Fantastic bed good linen lovely room great shower didn t have breakfast as was a bit pricey but was told if we book direct as returning customers we get free breakfast 
450345,Hotel Esther a, We stayed in the Orange Suite which was adjacent to a lot of service doors and rooms It was very noisy especially early in the mornings with seemingly no respect from staff members or workers giving consideration to guests who are sleeping or trying to The bottles of water were very small , The bed was to die for Very comfortable soft The pillows were GREAT too but we would have liked 2 each so a total of 4 would have made it better The flower arrangements and lighting was fantastic The staff were extremely helpful and the hotel felt very homely Would definitely stay here again 
450346,Hotel Esther a, Initial room was nice but had no view We noticed the carpet was damp either due to cleaning or a leak Made the room musty we asked to switch but nothing was available for that night for the mustiness we were given a can of air freshener For the second night we were able to upgrade to a nicer larger room with a view for a small fee , Great location centralized to many of the places to check out in Amsterdam Breakfast buffet had a pretty good selection and tasted great Room with view of the canal is extra cost but nice In the bar area they have a small selection of pastries and a espresso coffee machine for guests to use The pastries were tasty and the cappuccinos the machine makes are better than what you usually get from the coffee shops in the US 
450347,Hotel Esther a, Wifi not top Funny some staff don t speak Dutch English only , Great location Hotel with charme Nice rooms Restaurant and centre walking distance from hotel Amsterdam Centraal train station 15 min walking

450350,Hotel Esther a, Noise above our room The floor boards squeaked above and you could hear foot movement above Not a major problem but enough to notice , Location an intimate hotel with a personal touch A better experience than major large hotels offer through exclusivity and quality of hotel You feel special 
450351,Hotel Esther a, There was nothing I didn t like Loved every bit of it , The room was gorgeous with a super comfy bed and altogether well appointed Cosy is the word 
450352,Hotel Esther a, Room had facilities to make coffee but not tea Lift often busy Quite pricey 18 for breakfast expensive Plenty of good cafes nearby though as an alternative , Brilliant location to explore Amsterdam Free tea coffee pastries and sweets in the lobby 
450353,Hotel Esther a, We loved it all, This hotel is amazing ticked all the boxes for us Staff amazing very friendly and helpful and the rooms are beautiful Very good location
450354,Hotel Esther a, There was nothing not to like apart from the cost of the breakfast In fact we didn t have it at the hotel but used the little cafe further along the canal , We had a deluxe room with very comfy bed and excellent large bathroom all beautifully decorated The whole hotel is really attractive with lovely carpets lamps and chandeliers plus comfortable furnishing Not to mention the constant free coffee tea cakes and biscuits The staff couldn t have been more friendly and helpful and the location was excellent 
450355,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Everything was just right about this lovely Amsterdam hotel the staff the atmos the room but the fact that there is a 24 7 access to great coffee machine with options to choose from as well as a plate with cookies and candy just bought us completely My full and sincere recommendation 
450356,Hotel Esther a, Very dark room with shower fan running constantly Staff said they often have complaints about the fan noise and a technician can go onto the roof to turn it off Is this really a satisfactory solution to wait until guests complain Some staff were bordering on officious seeming to forget you are a paying guest Have previously stayed here and all was fine so hoping this is just a temporary problem to the service although will consider carefully whether to stay again , Great location good wifi so easy to work comfy beds
450357,Hotel Esther a, The water pressure was low and the hairdryer was not powerful enough But these are just the minor things probably not even worth mentioning, We were upgraded to a deluxe room which was very nice of them since the upgrade was free of charge The room was really well decorated and spacious facing the canal The view was picturesque Everything was lovely The staff was nice friendly and helpful The location is also worth mentioning it seems that all the main attractions were just a hasteless 10 15 min walk away There was strong wi fi reception And there were two coffee machines on the ground floor so you can have free coffee whenever you like sometimes even with cookies and pastries We really enjoyed our stay and when I am in Amsterdam again I am definitely staying at Estherea

450365,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Our room was amazing we had a jacuzzi bath which wasn t working but staff came up to fix it within minutes of us reporting it Fabulous place well worth paying a little extra 
450366,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, On arrival the hotel is breath taking from the minute you walk through the doors the ambience is of a 1920s boutique hotel with beautiful chandeliers and lighting On arrival the hotel upgraded our stay to a canal view room with stunning views of the canal with it been my partners birthday they gave us complieary prosecco and loccitaine products which was a beautiful touch The hotel is so central to all areas you will want to access Staff are so helpful and friendly even offered an umbrella when it started to rain when we left one day This hotel has the quality of a 5star cannot recommend enough will definitely be back again 
450367,Hotel Esther a, They should have offered us umbrellas since it was pouring heavily although they did have which we saw being offered to some other guests, Ambience and Decor was cosy and welcoming and of course on the house coffee n cookies
450368,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Great location Near everything Walkable to everywhere but along quiet beautiful canal Lots of wonderful eating close by so skipping costly hotel breakfast makes sense Nice to have free tea coffee available at all times Very helpful staff 
450369,Hotel Esther a, Not much a little noise at night from drunk passing people but not the problem of the hotel sound proofing perhaps Stocked mini bar an empty fridge in a room at this price is not much of a welcome after your journey to this property , Room with canal view was well appointed lovely shower bath Breakfast was good and breakfast room if a little small had a great atmosphere unlike most modern hotels The bar and lounge at ground floor marvelous and again atmospheric more like a guest house with style a great experience would stay again when in Dam Can walk to central station so easy to get about 
450370,Hotel Esther a, Nothing to dislike , Exceedingly helpful and friendly staff Attention to guests comfort excellent Added complementary cakes were a bonus as was the Valentines extras

450372,Hotel Esther a, No complaints everything very good, No restaurant just breakfast served in the mornings which was super and snacks from the bar in the evenings Complimentary tea coffee cakes biscuits sweets 24 7
450373,Hotel Esther a, I think hotel didn t make any information about the renovation of their building noise and all the construction dust is awful breakfast is good but most of the personel especially a man is grumpy but the most disturbing thing about that personel was he was very cheerful to others we don t get it so we won t come here again we are very dissappointed ,No Positive
450374,Hotel Esther a, Awful stuff expensive and very long parking no one hurry to help you , Directly above the channel view of the canal All numbers under the old Amsterdam 
450375,Hotel Esther a, Stairs steep and narrow Didn t bother me personally though worth bearing in mind for some people though there is a small lift , Very friendly and helpful Nice public areas free coffee and snacks Nice views from canal facing rooms
450376,Hotel Esther a, Could have made it clearer about deposit before arrival checking i and asked for an unexpected extra 400 euro was a surprise could also let you know they can only take credit cards for deposit not debit cards, Place was very colourful free coffee pastries and flavoured water in lounge good quality shampoo and shower gel in rooms very clean rooms with bottles of water in fridge
450377,Hotel Esther a, Staying mid week there was a little noise from work being carried out in the hotel but nothing to disturbing , The location was spot on very close to everything

450381,Hotel Esther a, One member of staff was very rude when we were checking in Weren t told anything about a 150 deposited until we arrived Didn t get the same treatment from the staff as the other residents possibly because we were a young couple but that shouldn t make a difference Our stay was definitely not value for money , Beds were quite comfortable also the coffee machine in the lobby were great 
450382,Hotel Esther a, Almost all the staff were great except the receptionist at night They lock the door at night and when I arrived the receptionist wasn t there Another couple were waiting a few minutes before me When the receptionist showd up he was angry at us for continually ringing the bell It was January and it was freezing outside Yet he thought we should have waited with no complaints All he had to do is say sorry I had to do something and it would have been fine , While the rooms are small they are charming clean and well designed The location is wonderful 
450383,Hotel Esther a, Didn t have breakfast because thought it was a bit expensive , Decor and furniture were delightful amenities excellent Room stylish and bed comfortable

450385,Hotel Esther a, Room was v small , Lovely decor So comfortable and cosy Really clean Bedroom 207 was gorgeous but was small for the price you pay Lovely bathroom and accessories The trees outside covered in fairy lights gives a nice touch We didn t have breakfast so can t rate it Cocktails at bar were top class also

450407,Hotel Esther a, Well we had an incident with the improper payment procedure the hotel didn t charged us when we arrived and we were only told a small deposit was being frozen from the credit card but they froze all the sum of staying from the credit card that caused severe inconvenience when trying to make credit deals it was our second time in this hotel and not sure will be coming back, The bed is very comfortable the hotel is clean the staff is friendly but needs to improve its professionally its nice that there is a coffee tea and snacks and the location is superb 
450408,Hotel Esther a, I really regret choosing this hotel because the hotel reception staff dealing racist and I should also mention that I was booked good room that he did not that I had to pay 160 euros extra charge and on the final day open a 150 euro fine for more money from me for no reason During all the trips that I was the worst hotel I ve seen the racist behavior of personnel and blackmail, nice city

450421,Hotel Esther a, My husband and I arrived on a late flight Friday evening and got to the hotel at around 10 30pm We felt ignored by the reception team when we walked in who whilst serving other people didn t acknowledge our presence for a good 10minutes This left us feeling awkward abd slightly unwelcome , Location was wonderful and the rooms were each individually decorated providing a certain charm 
450422,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Fabulous staff All very friendly and helpful A student working extra during the weekends stood out however being exceptionally forthcoming and going out of his way to make our stay special 
450423,Hotel Esther a, Giving us an iPad that wasn t charged and then asking us to bring it back to reception to change it when we d already trecked down there to get the key working Then found Russians had had it before so could only change the settings by referencing my iPhone which was interesting Probably worth looking at iPads before handing them out which I think is a very nice idea, Loved the location decor and feel of the hotel Loved the library and internal courtyard koi pool Staff were on the whole very polite 
450424,Hotel Esther a, Clothes not belonging to me were left in my room while I was out They did not have a wine stopper on request , My room overlooked the canal and the view was beautiful

450428,Hotel Esther a, Nothing, The place is 1940s opulence Crystal chandeliers wood panelling and elegant ornaments abound The staff are informative witty and helpful Genuinely friendly We were upgraded without asking to the honeymoon suite which was staggeringly beautiful Champneys toiletries fresh coffee tea or hot chocolate on demand books a huge tv screen on the wall and yes fluffy pillows It was January so was probably quiet I didn t get to see a standard room but I imagine it would be fabulous Location was perfect Easy walking to Ann Frank museum galleries red light and Dam square Great bar called Gollum just round the corner which sells many many different beers

450430,Hotel Esther a, Nothing, Got upgraded to the pink suite Was fabulous and definitely a highlight of the entire trip breakfast was exceptional as well as service Wish we stayed longer
450431,Hotel Esther a, The older guy at the reception was a bit moody and borderline rude You don t expect this sort of greeting at 4 hotel The service could have been improved in general We are vegetarians and ordered a vegetarian breakfast The guy brought us a plate full of bacon When we explained that we are vegetarians he only agreed not to charge us for extra bacon which we did not order He did not get at all that it was unpleasant for us , Great location very close to the centre and easy to get anywhere Nice view looking over the canal Free coffee for guests at the restaurant Very cosy and nicely decorated rooms Female staff was very friendly and professional 
450432,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Great welcome lovely overall stay location great free tea coffee hot chocolate and sweet snacks all day Wonderful stay would stay again if were to go back to Amsterdam 
450433,Hotel Esther a, We were given the classic room that couldn t fit a single never mind 2 suitcases asked to be informed if other rooms available over the four and never got a phone call in response had to keep asking Very expensive for what we got Was extra disappointed when we checked out a couple checking in for only one night were upgraded , Location and tea coffee facilities 
450434,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Everything Beautiful hotel in a great location and the staff were very helpful It s a bit expensive but don t mind paying for quality Loved it and will go back 
450435,Hotel Esther a, Two single beds pushed together to make a double , Amazing location beautiful reception area and friendly staff Free tea and coffee on tap is also a big bonus 
450436,Hotel Esther a, In all respects it s an old fashioned hotel Can do with a complete renovation to give it a more upmarket and today s outlook , Very convenient location in the center of Amsterdam Perfect for exploring the city 
450437,Hotel Esther a, The wifi was slow , A beautiful hotel in a good location It s in walking distance of many attractions and surrounded by places to eat The staff are knowledgeable and helpful 
450438,Hotel Esther a, Breakfast cold food was good but no change in the breakfast hot food choices during five days Unstable internet connection, Decor Combining modern and traditional French decoration Beautiful flowers in the lobby and restaurant Traditional breakfast dishes Food Serving free tea coffee and flavored water with chocolate and cake at lobby Good and healthy breakfast Other Professional and courteous staff Cozy place with good access to the main centers of the city New Year s Eve gift Early check in and late check out
450439,Hotel Esther a, Despite the beautiful comfortable room it was difficult to sleep due to noise from other bedrooms We were often woken up with hairdryers others conversation etc Breakfast was also expensive 18 per person , Free tea coffee pastries available throughout the day for residents Location was excellent a short walk to many main attractions 
450440,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, We spent four days at this great hotel without a single discomfort The staff is friendly and professional They care about you when asking you about your day or how they might be of help You ask for a taxi and within the next five minutes they get it Amenities all around the hotel are very comfortable Rooms are beautifully decorated and everything works I will absolutely recommend this hotel Location is very helpful and I will be back there next time in Amsterdam 
450441,Hotel Esther a, Perhaps if I had to say anything negative it would be the size of the bathroom Rather small and hard to keep the shower water from not going everywhere in the bathroom, I loved this hotel Its location and fabulous decore My room Was spacious with a fantastic view of the canals 
450442,Hotel Esther a, Staff could have Attended bar area better The rooms could sometimes be a little noisey no worse than most hotels , Free coffee hot chocolate and tea Helpful very lovely staff however service in the bar area was sometimes slow as it seemed the staff where also multitasking in other areas All youd have to do was ask reception and someone would come running Very helpful Highly recommend Very clean rooms 
450443,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, We love this charming hotel and have stayed here three times now The decor is sumptuous and cozy The rooms are certainly not minimalist There are flower patterns cushions and quirky chandeliers The bathroom is great and equipped with l occitane products There is always something sweet to welcome you back to the hotel during the day Usually a lovely apple pie and hot coffee or tea The bar is a place to wear your best dress and shoes before changing into flats to walk along the cobbles to one of the many nearby restaurants 
450444,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, located centrally you can manage the city by walking around feeling like at home staff is paying all attention to make the visit as comfortable as possible
450445,Hotel Esther a, The view wasn t very good from my room No smoking in the room , The bed was comfortable the bathroom nice and neat The location is really central 
450446,Hotel Esther a, We had a very small room although I suspect that the nature of the old townhouses meant that most of the rooms were small This meant that there was nowhere to put away our clothes apart from hanging space and we lived out of our suitcases for the duration of our brief stay 2 nights , The location was fabulous and the elegant hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas We had a room overlooking the Singel canal within easy walking distance of all the main sites in Amsterdam The staff we extremely welcoming and the free drinks machine just off the lobby and cake at tea time were a generous and unexpected touch 
450447,Hotel Esther a, Breakfast was not included in the room charge but cost an additional 18 Euro , Hotel Estherea has a great location near the center of Amsterdam on Singel Canal Its beautiful lobby and reception area welcome you warmly with complimentary coffee and in the afternoon cookies There is a small lounge in the lobby area that provides an opportunity to relax and meet other travelers Our room was a nice size and included a full bath There were two comfortable chairs in a small window nook that provided a nice place to relax The beds were very comfortable and attractively made There are many small cafes and restaurants within a short walking distance that provide excellent meals at reasonable prices The tram and buses are close by and if you like to walk nearly every major museum is within a 20 minute walk 
450448,Hotel Esther a, Keep it as it is , Staff were happy helpful and efficient Site was wonderful close to the canal and a lovely part of town We both had a great time at the hotel and visiting Amsterdam The location meant we could walk everywhere Thank you 
450449,Hotel Esther a, Having to leave , We stayed on a room only basis The location was excellent We could not find any fault with hotel We enjoyed our two night stay and will definitely return 
450450,Hotel Esther a, It was a little expensive We had a very pretty room but some of the decor in the rooms Is a bit startling , Fabulous breakfast Easy walking to most places and Tram just round the corner 
450451,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Beautiful interiors ultra comfy rooms and kind staff A real gem on the Singel and incredible value for money Breakfast was plentiful and there is unlimited coffee and herbal teas 24 7 This place felt like a real treat 
450452,Hotel Esther a, To use blow dryer you have to keep a little button pressed which was awkward Would have been nice to have a vent in the bathroom , Gorgeous perfect location excellent public spaces with generous delicious hot and cold beverages and cakes and yummy candies Rooms were spacious and well appointed 3 teen girls in family room had huge bath with 2 sinks Very nice staff Can t wait to return Canal view heavenly The rooms were beautifully decorated Compares favorably with top US boutique hotels 3 cocktails in bar 20 euros Didn t try restaurant Many many places to eat drink and shop in the immediate vicinity 
450453,Hotel Esther a, Rooms are a bit small the bathroom was set into a kind of cupboard with no fully fitting door , Decor in the rooms location is fabulous and the constant availability of tea coffee with cake was much appreciated
450454,Hotel Esther a, Price for breakfest is too high Doors to toilete must be change Existing doors is ok for warderobe Toilete is less or more private space , Location designe grate matrace pilows Good staf they explain and find very good restorants will give the best suggestions 
450455,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The room decor was lovely and included a small sitting area by the window I liked that it was possible to borrow an iPad and the sweets and 24 hr coffee bar was a real treat We were very impressed by the decor the comfortable feeling and friendliness of the staff It is located right in the canal district and we were able to walk to most of the sights 
450456,Hotel Esther a, I loved it all , The entire ambience It was beautiful And all the employee s were extremely nice and helpful Would recommend this hotel to anyone who travels to Amsterdam 
450457,Hotel Esther a, Cost of breakfast is a little on the expensive side but very good nonetheless The hotel tried charging us for 3 days worth of breakfast initially but we only had one breakfast there , Location was superb This hotel really made the Amsterdam atmosphere feel special for our few days away Will be staying again The security at night is very good with a doorbell system and CCTV cameras 
450458,Hotel Esther a, Free wifi didn t really work too well, Bedroom was very cosy and comfortable staff were very helpful friendly The way the hotel is decorated made it feel very homely 
450459,Hotel Esther a, We liked everything the only negative we had and this is entirely out of the hotels control and will most likely be finished by the time you stay there was some road maintenance outside They started work at around 7 00 7 30 am with some very noisy equipment , This hotel was everything all the good reviews say We chose this hotel because it got such good reviews and we are glad we did The staff are very friendly and helpful take their recommendations for restaurants we went to three of their recommended establishments and really enjoyed them all Well done Our room was beautiful with lovely L occitane bathroom products There is free tea coffee hot chocolate and various cakes available during the day for when you pop back to drop off shopping The location is really near the more interesting boutique shops If your a cyclist Rapha is only 2mins away It took us less than fifteen minutes to walk with our suitcase from the station along Singel to our hotel In fact everything is within walking distance Come to think of it all the big chain stores are very close too but the other way if you re into those shops We are definitely staying here again 
450460,Hotel Esther a, The TV was small but that now suits me fine In a place like the Esther a there are far nicer things to do than watch TV The rooms overlooking Spuistrasse can be a bit noisy at night The canal view is no doubt quieter but probably costs more , A place that does Old World customer service professional personable genuinely interested that you have a good experience In 40 years of staying in hotels I ve never been asked Is there anything specific you d like to do while you re in our city That led to a couple of great tips from the lady at the desk You re never waiting long for attention at the Front Desk Check in and check out quick and fuss free The decor is eye catching and reflects the hotel s 50 years as a hotel shades of Period Romance with a modern twist The lounge area feels like somewhere you d like to lounge rather than a transition between elevator and exit The 24hr free hot drinks and biscuits fabulous adds to the temptation Reasonable selection of reading material Location is great a few minutes walk from a Tram stop We took bus 197 to Elandsgracht Bus Station and had a peasant amble through the Nine Streets Many interesting local bars shops and restaurants Upgraded to a Deluxe Room for free lush Large bathroom with double sinks and jacuzzi Separate toilet Queen sized bed The climate control actually worked Toiletries are L Occitane The shower was exactly what you want from a hotel shower full on thermal waterfall experience The free iPad to use during your stay is a great idea I enjoyed finding out about the history of the hotel The free Wifi was a bit buggy with my iPhone A quick call to the Front Desk and I had the password to the quicker Intranet that worked like a dream There s a good reason this family run institution 3rd generation now has stayed in business so long It s put me off chain hotels probably for good Can t really think I d want to look for anywhere else to stay when next in Amsterdam 
450461,Hotel Esther a, The wifi is flakey In our room connection was often lost and downstairs it also cut out from time to time It should be better , The hotel is is brilliantly located Couldn t be more central and there are loads of great restaurants and cafes nearby The main shopping street is 2 minutes stroll away The service is fantastic and everything is very luxurious The room was great and the bed large and comfy We loved the free coffee downstairs and there are cakes etc too The rooms were very quiet Breakfast was excellent There is no room service or restaurant which was fine as their are any number of restaurants very close by 
450462,Hotel Esther a, Decor is a bit 1980 s but it is a lovely hotel , Charming hotel We were upgraded to a suite and really appropriated it Amazing newly renovated bathroom with the greatest double head shower We felt very pampered indeed 
450463,Hotel Esther a, Nothing , Hotel reception rooms staff alloted room and breakfast were first class Beautifully decorated through out Nice extra touch is complimentary tea and coffee and cakes Perfect location One of the nicest hotels we have stayed in 
450464,Hotel Esther a, Only thing I didn t like is the bellboy who showed us to our room We did not even ask him to do so yet he would not leave the room without a tip He just kept talking and talking about random things until we gave him money He did not even have a cart He only carried one suitcase and we carried everything else which was a lot , The place was extremely clean Great location Free coffee and cakes all day Free bottled water Staff was helpful WiFi was really good 
450465,Hotel Esther a, Could maybe move the free hot beverage machine away form the bar area as it was quite noisy and usually busy because it is free 24 7 Creaky floorboards but old building so not a big deal Tiny lift but again no big deal , The staff were so polite and knowledgeable The bar persons Joana Tarik Mees and Leo were great always made time for a chat whilst keeping a clean bar Huge rooms with canal view and 4 post bed 
450466,Hotel Esther a, Canal room nice room but nothing special very overpriced 550 for 2 nights No breakfast included, Ambiance of the bar area interior of hotel and friendly staff
450467,Hotel Esther a, The lift appeared to have a mind of its own I waited fod 10 minutes with my luggage on tne 3rd floor , Every aspect was thoughtfully considered and catered for The coffee and tea making facilities in the foyer along with pastries and snacks were an insightful addition 
450468,Hotel Esther a, The adjoining room to room 104 was noisy The toilet and bathroom were on either side of room The lift area smelt bad No view and check out should ve been later , The complimentary hot cold drinks and pastries were a nice touch Nice atmosphere great location 
450469,Hotel Esther a, It would have been nice to have even a basic breakfast included in the price with the option of paying extra for a full breakfast, The coffee tea and biscuits were a lovely gesture and very welcome The bar food and service was also very good 
450470,Hotel Esther a, CFL lightbulbs have replaced regular incandescent lightbulbs in many places and here too BUT it has been proven that they are much more damaging tot the environment to produce and to dispose of Also they make a very harsh jittery light that makes spaces seem cold and unpleasant Switch back and you will feel the difference ,No Positive
450471,Hotel Esther a, Not much Perhaps the bathrooms could be larger and practical , The glorious elegant decore of the entire hotel and the comfortable atmosphere that it exudes Also The thoughtful touches for example coming back to my room on Sinter Klauss night and there on my bed was a present from Sinter Klauss How thoughtful The canal view room and the comfy beds are also so good Love this place and I will be back 
450472,Hotel Esther a, Everything was perfect , Great location Lovely staff good view from our room bed very comfy and complimentary hot drinks and cakes a lovely touch and very much appreciated I booked this trip for my Husband s 50th Birthday and this was acknowledged by the hotel staff who left a gift in our room for my Husband A small gesture that meant a lot Couldn t fault anything
450473,Hotel Esther a, Nothing Creaky floors but it s an old building Heard some people complaining that their room was cold but they never contacted reception for help with thermostat Don t complain when you leave , Staff are lovely and go out of their way to help Stunning hotel Was upgraded to a canal view room Perfect location Old ornately furnish canal house Free tea coffee cakes etc Nice bar 
450474,Hotel Esther a, Stains on the side of the bed not on mattress dirt stain on bathroom door and hairs on the carpet that didn t look like it had been vacuumed No drinks or food in the fridge in the room Price of breakfast very expensive compared to local restaurants , Location and lobby very decadent 
450475,Hotel Esther a, The room size was small and there is no view from this particular room but everything else was lovely Most city rooms are small There was plenty of space for 2 , The toiletries in the bathroom are lovely as are the decorations in the room and in the lobby They really go above and beyond to make guests feel welcomed Upkeep and cleanliness are great especially for such an old building Charming 
450476,Hotel Esther a, Room a bit small Shower doors awkward , Furnishings of room coffee and tea available plus pastry snacks helpfulness of staff especially dinner suggestions 
450477,Hotel Esther a, No one told us we could have bar priced breakfast we were only told Hotel price of 18, Pristine room comfy beds great walk in shower free hot drinks pastries 
450478,Hotel Esther a, Hairdryer wasn t very good Not powerful enough and looked quite old , Comfortable hotel friendly staff cosy bar Toiletries included conditioner as well as shampoo I think this shows they recognise the needs of female visitors It s a touch that gets full marks from me 
450479,Hotel Esther a, Quite expensive would have been nice if breakfast was included , Staff really friendly couldn t have done enough for us Especially liked the constant flow of complimentary cakes biscuits and sweets available in reception alongside the free coffee tea machine 
450480,Hotel Esther a, Nothing , All aspects of our stay at Hotel Esther were excellent Location is great We walked to all the itms wearer interested in on food Breakfast was great The idea of coffee tea and cold water available at all times in th lobby is an extra nice touch All staff members were helpful and very polite 
450481,Hotel Esther a, We liked everything , Very friendly and helpful staff Great location for the 9 Streets in the Jordaan Still within a moderate walking distance of central station for those used to walking a bit Very generous free coffee and tea in the bar with constant replenishment of cakes and biscuits etc Comfortable room Good wifi Good shower etc 
450482,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, This is one of the most delightful boutique chic hotels I have had the pleasure to stay in The staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel bar exquisite Great location
450483,Hotel Esther a, Nothing , Great hotel the room was fabulous we had a great time A free coffee making area always well stocked with biscuits and cakes a very nice touch 
450484,Hotel Esther a, Wasn t given an IPad on arrival so didn t have hotel directory until later , Great place to stay Close to city centre Staff very good Breakfast was good 
450485,Hotel Esther a, The breakfast was so lovely so much variety but expensive It would be better value for money if included in the price or at a reduced rate , Lovely boutique hotel with friendly staff D cor unique and location excellent So close to everything museums shopping and restaurants yet quiet and cosy 
450486,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The staff was very kind and willing to help The coffee tea area always had delicious pastry to offer to the guests The decoration of the common areas and rooms is wonderful Breakfast was very well served and had a wide variety of products The location is excellent We had a very good experience in this hotel and will definitely come back if ever again in Amsterdam 
450487,Hotel Esther a, The room was a bit small I should could of asked to move but it was fine Cosy and comfy and was not a big issue , Amazing position staff very nice lovely warm atmosphere coffee and tea machine great the sitting areas Just home from 6 nights at this hotel stay was lovely there everything is so near by lovely and warm when you walk back into hotel and a wonderful smell to I would definitely recommend and will be back 
450488,Hotel Esther a, Rooms somewhat noisy we could hear our neighbors and heating not very effective , Small but comfortable and cozy room Great bed good breakfast nice staff 
450489,Hotel Esther a, The staff were nice but not too friendly seemingly more interested in each other than the guests We got one very good dinner recommendation from one of the friendlier girls on reception At breakfast no one gave you any info making it a truly self service experience The worst bit was the bar There was only one girl serving If anyone wanted bar food she had to cook it leaving the bar unstaffed Two of the three nights we have up after 10 minutes trying to get a drink , The room was lovely the bed comfortable the bathroom and the products wonderful The location was superb right in the centre of everything meaning we could stroll along a canal to wherever we wanted
450490,Hotel Esther a, The shower in the tub was a bit tricky since the tub is so narrow Conversion to simply a shower stall may be most appropriate , The old country character of the facility was great 
450491,Hotel Esther a, The pricing should be more transparent I e City taxes etc , The bed was incredibly comfy and the staff were extremely accommodating Situated within a 10 15 minute walk of everything but withou being in the main hustle and bustle 
450492,Hotel Esther a, the room was extremely small even by European standards I asked for two beds got two twins and could not be pulled apart Only had about a foot between the end of the bed and the wall to get to the bathroom extremely hard at night not to wake the person when you tried to sneak by to go to the bathroom, the staff was excellent
450493,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Staff were excellent and very helpful Our 6 month old daughter received lots of compliments and a toy when checking in they know a thing of two about keeping families happy Wooden cot bed was provided for my 6 month old which was lovely rather than a travel cot bed which feels less solid Brilliant location 
450494,Hotel Esther a, Noise from the street we asked to be moved to a quieter room and were given a room over a courtyard which was much quieter , Very friendly and helpful staff The room was very comfortable and clean Excellent location for exploring the city 
450495,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Lovely hotel in a great location Beautifully decorated room with a view of the canal Great selection of tea coffee and cakes in the bar ideal after a day of sightseeing Staff were all friendly and helpful 
450496,Hotel Esther a, Everything was perfect could not have imagined a better stay , The hotel was superb Every single member of staff were helpful kind and simply lovely Location is great within short walking distance to basically all top sights Oh and free tea coffee cake at any time of day what a superb idea We will be back for sure Thank you Hotel Estherea for making our weekend so great xxx
450497,Hotel Esther a, Small room and problem with hairdresser, Good location with channel view very beautiful interior polite personal and free coffee and bisquets in the lobby
450498,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful We had a room with a canal view which exceeded my expectations The location was perfect for sightseeing We were able to walk to all the places we had planned to visit I loved the l occitane toiletries in the bathroom a nice touch 
450499,Hotel Esther a, This is not a business hotel for sure and this should be made very clear to those who come for business Transport access is not so good as railway is quite away and no tram really nearby Taxi would have problems waiting for you as the street is very narrow and the there is no place for car to wait Coming to the hotel at 11am on Saturday I could not get any cleaning service for one shirt until Monday evening Hotel staff was useless in arranging this outside of the hotel Promised to help and forgot about this Needed to do all by myself find I am not local at all go order and collect Ceilings in the rooms are really low and most of the rooms are looking to the inside building walls and windows To have a street view and not to look into other rooms windows which are 2m away from your own window you need to pay a fortune You can hear all what is happening in the next room or next floor sound proofing is bad Facilities in the bathroom are somewhat old , Lobby is very nice and the breakfast is good indeed 
450500,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Loved this hotel It was spotless beautifully decorated Staff were lovely The room backed onto a tiny courtyard there were better views if you had a room looking over the canal but our room was silent at all times and the bed was the comfiest I have ever slept in Highly recommend 
450501,Hotel Esther a, Breakfast was quite overpriced for that reason we ate elsewhere during our stay , Location was brilliant Staff were excellent Room was amazing Would definitely stay again 
450502,Hotel Esther a, The loading area of the hotel is near the suits They brought new furnitures at 8am making enormous noise that we could hear from our room , My room was upgraded to a small suite It was perfect
450503,Hotel Esther a, Our room was a bit tired looking and not as pretty as the photos online There was no power shower The toilet was not in the bathroom and had no hand basin so could not wash hands if bathroom in use , Lovely bar and reception area very pretty and welcoming Very helpful staff Excellent location in the heart of Amsterdam Very nice being able to check out at midday rather than 10am in a lot of hotels 
450504,Hotel Esther a, A bit expensive but its an expensive city , The hotel was centrally located the staff was very friendly and helpful We were provided an IPad during our visit There is also a selection of cookies and sweets coffee and hot chocolate free in the common area 
450505,Hotel Esther a, I think the staff are more accustom to tourists than a single non typical female professional woman traveling for work despite my attempt to describe why I was there Having to return and ask for the key to your room each time you go out and come in Breakfast was v expensive even if traveling for work and I preferred to eat outside , Location was excellent Cute tiny little room with canal view Free small bottles of water Tea and coffee making facilities downstairs
450506,Hotel Esther a, Very disappointing view from the room lift shaft almost touching distance , Very friendly helpful staff Free coffee and hot drinks a lovely touch Best bit choc ever 
450507,Hotel Esther a, Our room overlooked the back of the hotel This road was very noisy long into the night early in the morning so we didn t get much sleep for the duration of our stay There were insufficient surfaces to place things in our room just one small coffee table and dressing table and no chairs For a family of three this was not enough so most of our belongings had to be stored on the floor not good The bathroom was very tiny and again no where to put your belongings I had to store my toiletries bag on top of the closed loo seat not ideal People in the room above us also made a lot of noise but this was because the floorboards creaked every time they walked around Would stay again but make sure room is not on the back of the hotel , Beds were very comfy Help yourself to free tea coffee biscuits all day long in the hotel lobby Beautiful lobby reception area to sit and read Very friendly helpful staff Ideal central location so easy to walk to everywhere 
450508,Hotel Esther a, Breakfast was not included but had a great variety of food and pastries Found that European hotels either included it or it was 20 Euros or more per person , The staff was very friendly and accommodating The property was very beautiful well maintained and on a quiet picturesque canal 
450509,Hotel Esther a, Nothing we loved everything , Great location about 2 blocks to the Kalverstraat shopping street lots of little shops in the alley with bakeries etc Lots of restaurants in the road behind the property They were so sweet they upgraded us to a suite in the ground floor when I informed them that my mom was using a wheel chair It was very convenient that we didn t need to use the elevators There was free coffee all day and free snacks pastries for afternoon tea Their staff are all very friendly and willing to help with everything It was nice having the canal right in front of the hotel and really feeling Amsterdam We loved the hotel and hope to come back again 
450510,Hotel Esther a, The only thing that would be better would be 24 7 room service as there is no minibar in the room I was in This is not a bad thing but being able to ask for bottled water or a drink late at night would be a bonus to an already great hotel, Great location well presented and comfortable room exactly as described The staff were charming and attentive I wouldn t hesitate to stay there again 
450511,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, This hotel has several gorgeous sitting rooms and even a library off of the lobby to relax and enjoy watching the canal traffic right outside the windows They have an espresso machine that makes all variations of drinks free and pair those drinks with a variety of local sweets It s wonderful and a favorite place of ours in Amsterdam to sit and relax and enjoy

450517,Hotel Esther a, A little noisy in the early morning hours, The staff were so attentive and happy to help with anything Great with kids There was complimentary tea coffee and hot chocolate all day and then afternoon biscuits The lobby and bar area have amazing d cor 
450518,Hotel Esther a, The doonas were very heavy in our room and woke us up The room heating is so good that lighter ones would be much better, Beautifully appointed hotel and the rooms have everything one needs 
450519,Hotel Esther a, Some staff on reception duty could b more friendly with genuine smile Cld b improved to enhance it further , Old fashion charm availability of coffee and snacks thou we did not make use of it much Lovely rooms around could b improved with more English articles Overall an excellent home away from home Will stay again if back in Amsterdam 
450520,Hotel Esther a, Our window looked out on to the glass lift so had to keep the shutters closed all the while we were in the room as everyone could see in , All day free coffee tea and cake central to all sites and museums felt very safe walking home at night 
450521,Hotel Esther a, The sound proofing between rooms was poor and when you are paying 350 euros per night you would expect better The heating was not very user friendly and seemed to do what it wanted, The bed was really comfortable The staff were generally young and very helpful The views when you woke up were just how you would imagine Amsterdam to be like The bar was open 24 7 always good in my book Very strict on no smoking so hotel was always fresh
450522,Hotel Esther a, Their retairant setting was quite dark not as inviting to eat , The staff was friendly and helpful although there was no refreshments in the room more than enough was provided in an area in the lobby You could get as much pastries chocolates coffee tea and infused water as you liked 24hrs

450525,Hotel Esther a, Not crazy about the pink and flower decorations No biggie, Great friendly helpful staff Very good location 24 7 Coffee and pastries and fruited water 
450526,Hotel Esther a, We booked 3 twin rooms but 2 of the rooms turned out to be rooms with a double bed not two singles as booked and advertised we were told by staff couldn t be changed as the hotel was fully booked Not a big deal but it kinda annoyed the boys who had to share, Great hotel Great location close to Dam Square The rooms were beautiful Free coffe in the bar It s a good four star
450527,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The location is perfect close to main shopping area and dam square The hotel itself is quite unique with fantastic over the top chandeliers and indivually decorated rooms but without being tacky I don t usually return to hotels but I m getting ready for my 3rd visit Staff are extremely friendly and happy to help with anything they can

450530,Hotel Esther a, I couldn t fault this hotel, The hotel is fabulous in a perfect location the rooms are spotless the bed and bedding are so comfy I really couldn t fault it plus they have free coffee tea etc machine and also some cakes and sweets 
450531,Hotel Esther a, Price as compared to room facility space quality is unmatchable in a negative way Price is high but other factors are not at par the price comparing other hotels in the region , The value for money with the room space and quality is not satisfactory 
450532,Hotel Esther a, Breakfast was expensive Not a lot of wardrobe space we needed to take the ironing board out of the wardrobe to place our clothes in , Staff were very helpful Hotel was spotless Rooms were beautiful and comfy Nice to have complimentary coffee and pastries in the afternoon 
450533,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The staff was friendly and exceptionally helpful There was ample gathering space in the lobby The rooms were large bed was king size and comfortable Bath had a walk in shower in addition to a jacuzzi tub They always had complimentary beverages available including flavored water and some pastries Will definitely stay again on our next trip to Amsterdam 
450534,Hotel Esther a, A luggage rack in the room would have been nice , Loved the eccentricity and cultured beauty of the hotel The lobby area is large and very well decorated There is a library bar area and several sitting rooms This is not only delightfully encouraging for guests to interact but makes guest feel like they are not confined to their rooms for their stay Hotels seem to miss the importance of this today Having a well made cocktail at the bar was a highlight So nice that there is free coffee tea water and sweets available as this also encourages guests to interact and share experiences The hotel location is fabulous There are small restaurants literally next door Italian Greek traditional bakery conditorei and in the Cheese Shop a care deli and on the street over a large selection of cafes and restaurants basic cafes to full service restaurants So here s the interesting part of our visit We drove from Germany and parked in the hotel parking garage but left a light on in our car so had a drained dead battery upon departure The hotel staff couldn t have been nicer or more attentive even though I was impatient and stressed Alles Gutes safely home in Germany a later drive than anticipated but no fault or complaint to the Hotel Esterea staff So next time we ll fly or train to Amsterdam and definitely stay again 
450535,Hotel Esther a, The only thing that was a little disappointing was that the hotel doesn t open its restaurant in the evening , Hotel is beautiful The staff were very friendly and helpful We had a lovely room Lovely cocktail bar 
450536,Hotel Esther a, Was nothing not to like , Excellent reception staff especially Melissa on arrival very obliging in every aspect beautiful decor excellent location Special mention of Martin also very efficient and friendly All in all a wonderful time at this hotel Faultless 
450537,Hotel Esther a, The maintenance and drilling work being done whilst we sat at the bar on our first evening and thought the taping off of an area looked unsightly, Beautiful entrance to hotel Very pretty and comfortable bedrooms
450538,Hotel Esther a, Only stayed one night for a long layover so not many negatives to account I would have gladly stayed longer , For upscale 9 Streets posh location in the canal district this hotel is superb and fairly priced Canal view king was beautiful and roomy pictures don t do it justice Very friendly and extremely helpful in answering all my questions 15 20min stroll to every sight in Amsterdam 
450539,Hotel Esther a, We requested early check in but room was not ready til late afternoon There were no options for changing clothes etc after transatlantic flight Tiny public bathroom down small curved stairway not easily navigated Checked out mid day next day , Beautiful canal views from rooms Charming interior decor 
450540,Hotel Esther a, Nothing , Location Staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful The small touches sweets cakes hot drinks The combination of quirky with modern twist 
450541,Hotel Esther a, The hotel is filled with travelers of a certain age Mind you i am 50yr and felt like a child Way too much stuff everywhere The hotel lobby is a just very old looking and needs a make over Not the most inviting first impression The bathrooms are really really small More like 3 ft X3 ft closest Internet is a mess doesn t work at all And we were told the next time you visit book directly because breakfast is free What a terrible thing to say to a customer who is checking out Why not offer it up front Since its included in the price when you book directly , The hotel is in a good area not the prettiest canal though Overall it was clean but the hotel seemed like a pack rat designed it 
450542,Hotel Esther a, The design is too kitsch to me but it s only a small detail and a question personal taste Great hotel really , Bathroom Jacuzzi bath tub and shower cabin plenty of towels and toiletries floor heating two sinks spacious separate toilet Great staff very good location in a quiet area Locked securely at night 24 7 reception 
450543,Hotel Esther a, The air conditioning did not work well in the first room we were assigned to As well as not cooling effectively the fan was directly above the head of the bed making it very noisy After our first night we were moved to an outside room on the back of the hotel where the air conditioned worked better and the fan was further away from the bed Also the interior room did not have an outside window so it felt very confining , This hotel is centrally located midway between the Centrael Train Station and the museums The hotel is beautiful inside both in the lobby and the rooms 
450544,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, This was the most beautiful hotel we have ever stayed at We had a canal view room We loved the staff the treats the bar the quieter neighborhood everything We highly recommend staying here when in Amsterdam 
450545,Hotel Esther a, No major issues but it mostly had to do with the bathroom which was a bit awkward The toilet seat was high and I am tall and the shower glass only covered 1 3rd of the tub making it very difficult to take a proper shower without spilling water out of it The nozzle on the shower head was not adjustable to different spray settings Also the meal I had for breakfast was quite poor and definitely below expectations , Excellent staff friendly service Very clean Very comfortable environment excellent location and great value overall The complimentary coffee and desserts in the lobby was a nice touch 
450546,Hotel Esther a, It would be churlish to be critical all really good , Room had great views and was a mini suite Free tea coffee was useful after days sightseeing 
450547,Hotel Esther a, The rooms were very small and too expensive When we remarked about the room size and price to the staff we were told this is Amsterdam , The location was very good 
450548,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The location is excellent the rooms bathroom and bed are sumptuous as is the reception library and bar The staff are superb and the two hotel cats just made our stay even more perfect Thank you we hope to stay again 
450549,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Position of the hotel friendly and helpful staff and the fact that their were great restaurants close by Free coffee and snacks were also a bonus 
450550,Hotel Esther a, Our room was in the rear of the hotel over looking what was described as a quiet courtyard It was really just an approx 10 x 10 enclosed area but it was quiet The room and bath were were on the small side but fine as we only spent sleeping hours there , Great location friendly staff onsite breakfast buffet option lovely decor and good value A cold drink and cookies awaited us at the end of our days of exploring I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others 
450551,Hotel Esther a, No recommendations Loved the experience and hope to return , Location excellent room sophisticated but cosy and comfortable breakfast service and offer very satisfactory Front desk helpful and efficient Well staffed 
450552,Hotel Esther a, Dangerously narrow bath under shower TV reception was poor Noise of people walking about in room above EUR18 breakfast was sub par for this class of hotel , Sweet snacks and coffee available in lobby Friendly helpful staff Sumptuous common area Prepaid taxi fair to airport added to hotel bill 
450553,Hotel Esther a, Nothing , THe staff were fabulous Always attentive ready to help booked tours taxis carried luggage made us laugh and eased all our travel pressures Would have stayed longer if they were not fully booked The location is excellent and the staff are helpful with suggestions for meals and directions to wherever we needed Felt very safe Property was very clean nice breakfast buffet and the 24 hour coffee and juice in the lobby was a wonderful treat that made it feel like home Would stay there again and again

450556,Hotel Esther a, Bathrooms are small and not very private but they are very clean , This is a great hotel Absolutely beautiful common areas Wonderful and friendly staff We 2 couples would definitely stay here again 
450557,Hotel Esther a, We felt the buffet breakfast should have been free with the room as it is in most 3 4 star hotels in Europe Otherwise our experience was excellent , Everything was wonderful
450558,Hotel Esther a, With the recent fall of the pound against the euro it ended up being a lot more expensive than we planned when we booked it However with the upgrade to the suite it was worth every penny for every second we spent there , We had a complimentary upgrade to a suite The staff were so friendly The hotel was absolutely stunning spotless and pure luxury So many added little extras Just out of this world 
450559,Hotel Esther a, Our room although really comfortable would have been even better if a bit larger Neither of us are small so had to breath in while passing each other , Hotel lovely and staff wonderful nothing too much trouble 
450560,Hotel Esther a, We were there during a large convention and prices were nearly double what they normally are at all hotels , Very quiet hotel on a very nice canal centrally located Hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful Hotel was possibly the quietest hotel I ve ever stayed in 
450561,Hotel Esther a, The rate was expensive so didn t provide value for money but we understand that there was an annual conference in the city which contributed to the high rate , Very well located and helpful staff A good 4 star hotel 
450562,Hotel Esther a, Perfectly satisfied , The room was updated bright and cheerful and the bed was great We stayed in many hotels during our travels this summer Hotel Estherea was my favorite 
450563,Hotel Esther a, Breakfast we would only say good compared to 4 star Scottish hotel breakfasts The used dishes were left at the table too long and hot food was not closely monitored often needing refilled but the croissants were excellant Because of the issue with our flight being cancelled I feel it would have been nice of the Hotel to have a little understanding and offer us the extra night at a reduced rate , Staff were lovely very friendly the way they presented themselves politely professionally but also had a giggle with the customers especially the evening nightshift making us feel very comfortable and relaxed Staff had very good communication skills and customer relations All hotel staff appeared to work together as a team obviously the management care about staff and look after them which gives the impression of the hotel having a warm caring and friendly atmosphere Room was very clean bed excellent so comfortable To be honest we did find the rooms very expensive especially when our flight was cancelled for 24 hours We telephoned the hotel from the airport as soon as we were informed but they still charged us for the room on the night we missed with the city charges added even though the cancellation was through no fault of ours When we tried to book for an extra night they requested 450 euros on the telephone then when I asked them to confirm by email they requested 590 euros this was very disappointing but we did actually managed to book the same room through Expedia for 400 euros We have stayed in many 4 5 star Hotels around the world and would like to say THANK YOU to the staff It was very nice that they took time to have conversations with customers as well as carrying out their work to high standards Scotland 5 8th September 2016

450568,Hotel Esther a, Nothing worthwhile needing comment, The room and most comfortable we overlooked canal free coffee etc with cakes well laid out room ex choices for breakfast food would stay again lobby staff very helpful 
450569,Hotel Esther a, There were a few fruit flies around the bar Nothing big but the hotel may want to address it going forward so it doesn t get out of hand, Everything was fabulous especially the staff 
450570,Hotel Esther a, More bathroom privacy with a real door , Amazing to have coffee and goodies available all the time Staff made amazing restaurant reservations for us 
450571,Hotel Esther a, We didn t bother with the food as breakfast appeared limited and rather pricey 18 euros This didn t detract from our experience, Quality hotel that didn t gloss over things cosmetically e g quality toiletries decor and furniture Clean and well maintained the flower and fauna arrangements were outstanding

450578,Hotel Esther a, we have been to Europe a number of times and this trip I have noticed that price of a continental breakfast seems very high paying 20 for coffee toast and cereal seems a bit much , The hotel was exquisite and the location perfect The room was very quiet despite the fact we were on a canal street 
450579,Hotel Esther a, I have zero complaints , Aesthetically the hotel is absolutely beautiful Every single staff member I encountered was equally hospitable and kind The hotel and staff exceeded my expectations I had a wonderful time 
450580,Hotel Esther a, A short walk 10 minutes from the city centre , Very impressed with the comfort and cleanliness of this hotel All staff very helpful and we REALLLY liked the free tea and coffee always available in the foyer 
450581,Hotel Esther a, Nothing at all, We had a fabulous room on the 5th floor overlooking the canal D cor was beautiful and room spotless The hotel is unusual and beautiful throughout Breakfast was too die for but what really made this hotel was their professional friendly and efficient staff 
450582,Hotel Esther a, Nothing, We have stayed here ten years ago enjoyed it just as much we booked at the last minute because the hotel we had booked was not great not disappointed Beautiful hotel with all you need great location 
450583,Hotel Esther a, The staff are lovely but one rude and surly receptionist was most unhelpful demanding cash for a museum trip when they had already taken a credit card swipe and knew I was still in the hotel and they would get paid Very unprofessional and unhelpful when we needed the cash to get family to the airport in an emergency late at night , Hotel in a great quiet position rooms comfortable but very dark 
450584,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Reception personnel were very attentive to our request especially Martin Our room 211 is beautiful comfortable bed and the location is great walking distance to everything food bus tram Although it rain during our stay it did not stop us from going on a tour and the hotel provided us umbrella to use I am sure will stay here again

450586,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, We had a lovely stay at this hotel which we chose for our honeymoon The staff are so friendly and helpful and it was a lovely surprise to find a bottle of prosecco in our room to congratulate us on our marriage The room service menu was well priced and we liked having croissants each day for breakfast and the hotel provides its guests with a free ipad to use during their stay which let us find out where to go in Amsterdam The bar is small but nice and does a great range of cocktails We thought it was a great hotel in a great location Couldn t really ask for more 
450587,Hotel Esther a, Our bathroom was a bit tiny without a solid privacy door , I ve stayed at the Burj al Arab in Dubai and the St Regis in Bora Bora and NEVER have I received the high level of personal attention kindness and excellent recommendations as we did at Hotel Estherea Everyone who works here is wonderful Coffee machine and tea and candy and goodies 24 7 Gorgeous lobby with lots of seating nooks Quiet location near fabulous boutique shopping Close to everything we walked everywhere

450590,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The courteous staff was able to check us in early after our red eye flight Room layout was great Staff was informative helpful and so very pleasant Great visit 
450591,Hotel Esther a, be perfect if hotel provided a mini bar and tea coffee making facilities in room as well as in reception A choice of pillows would be nice as I prefer a firmer one and don t like feather but not a huge problem, cleanliness and customer service was excellent everyone was lovely
450592,Hotel Esther a, The hotel was quite expensive especially since it was a room only rate , The decor was beautiful and our bed was really comfortable The free tea coffee flavoured water and cakes were a nice touch Great location too 
450593,Hotel Esther a, Enjoyed our stay but one of the gentleman reception staff on the evening shift wasn t friendly at all Very abrupt Was even unpleasant to the other staff ,No Positive
450594,Hotel Esther a, Total lack of privacy unless curtains were drawn Located in a back facing room , Reception and ground floor decor were superb Located on a quieter part of the canals 
450595,Hotel Esther a, It would have been good to provide some food service that does not come from a restaurant close by No cooked cereal available at breakfast , We loved the Estherea Hotel Staff are incredibly helpful friendly and courteous We had the room in the roof sort of so it was different and v friendly Not the usual hotel room A trifle too small The bed cramped against the wall on one side But full of character and imaginatively furnished Very cosy bed and pillows The Lounge and bar areas are very well arranged And sumptuously fitted out and decorated 
450596,Hotel Esther a, Not a thing , Loved everything from the pretty room with four poster comfy bed to the super convienent walkable location to the attention to detail such as the L Occitane products in the bathroom the stunning lobby and fairytale bar and fabulous friendly service 
450597,Hotel Esther a, only a very minor thing It would be nice to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room but it was still very nice to have all the facilities in the lobby , Great welcome friendly helpful and professional staff Great location smart d cor very clean and comfortable plenty of toiletries provided a safe fridge and water replenished daily
450598,Hotel Esther a, A very minor point maybe coffee making facilities in the room if you didn t want to venture down to the breakfast dining room , Central location to Amsterdam city Very helpful and friendly staff Comfortable room with full facilities great bed good bathroom and air conditioned We were on the top floor on the canal side awesome views The hotel had everything we wanted required or could have wished for 
450599,Hotel Esther a, We were happy with everything, The hotel staff were extremely friendly and very helpful they provided complimentary hot drinks cakes and sweets The weather wasn t great it rained a lot so the hotel provided Ponchos and umbrellas which was brilliant
450600,Hotel Esther a, Breakfast was overpriced Doors in room opened to center courtyard seemed a bit unsafe , Great location Nice bar area Beautiful old building Loved the ipads with restaurant recommendations 
450601,Hotel Esther a, Nothing, Incredible boutique hotel in the most amazing town of Bruge Staff excellent impeccable style in common rooms as well as suites Water view terrace is fantastic 10 marks across the board Recommend for special occasions very romantic
450602,Hotel Esther a, Free tea coffee in lounge we went to get coffees 3 times twice the machine was being cleaned and the last time the machine was being replaced I guess this was a problem which has no doubt now been resolved with the new machine , The bed was amazing Plush traditional decor in communal areas and bedrooms very tastefully decorated Staff very friendly and could not do enough for guests 
450603,Hotel Esther a, Rather expensive as all hotels in Northern Europe, Hotel with a perfect location in the center of Amsterdam on a canal with easy 50 euro day public parking Very nice staff nice rooms ours was superior class Good breakfast I would gladly come back 
450604,Hotel Esther a, The price was exorbitant plus we had to pay for breakfast at an extra E18 p p There were no cafes open nearby so it was starve or eat at the hotel , Attractive rooms and great location 
450605,Hotel Esther a, Room to small and uncomfortable particularly for a five night stay Staff showed no interest or help in changing just threatened us with two night cancellation charge if we left early we were too tied after travelling to argue but wont be returning , The garage parking facility only little else glad to be leaving will not return
450606,Hotel Esther a, The decor in the room was a little outdated , The staff were super friendly and made us feel at home The hotel was in a fantastic location and we were in walking distance of everything that we wanted to do The room was well equipped and we especially loved the bottled water that was left in the fridge for us everyday We would definitely stay here again 
450607,Hotel Esther a, Room v small bathroom arrangement eccentric wi fi connection in room v poor At least it was quiet but people standing waiting for the lift could see into the room somewhat disconcerting, Very comfortable and good public spaces Excellent location
450608,Hotel Esther a, I can t think of any thing we disliked, The tranquil and welcoming atmosphere and friendly helpful staff The complementary coffee sweets and pastries were a very nice touch it was also very well located
450609,Hotel Esther a, Although the hotel was pricey it was well worth paying for the quality , We particularly liked the overall quality of the hotel from beautiful decor friendliness and helpfulness of the staff Martin was fabulous quality of food and most of all the comfort of the beds Everything we asked for was delivered promptly and with a smile 
450610,Hotel Esther a, The elevator is tiny 2 people with luggage max The elevator is also slow as H The buffet breakfast is way overpriced for what you get The good news just a short walk to plenty of good breakfast spots , The location is hard to beat Central but on a quieter street on the Singel canal The canal is not frequented by the larger canal tour boats The staff was friendly and professional 
450611,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The bed was like a cloud The staff was extremely helpful recommending restaurants calling in reservations calling us a taxi The location was charming and felt close to everything we wanted to see 
450612,Hotel Esther a, Breakfast was a little pricey, The staff were very helpful and extremely friendly The hotel is in a brilliant location and is decorated exquisitely plus the barman really did make a fantastic cocktail 
450613,Hotel Esther a, Our room although beautifully decorated was really very small the bathroom smaller than tiny Although functional it was definately not worth the hefty price tag I wanted to love it but couldn t get past the disappointment , Location and decor were fabulous as was the staff service 
450614,Hotel Esther a, For 295 euros the first night we had a small room without a view facing another room 10 feet away to which we had access through a dark and sinuous corridor Not worth that money ,No Positive
450615,Hotel Esther a, Travelled with my disabled mother and as with all the canal buildings the access to the hotel required being able to transverse several steps LIkewise on returning to the hotel my mother wanted to use the toilet in the lobby area but found she couldn t due to steep steps and no lift access Breakfast was a little pricey , Beds were comfy tea and coffee freely available all day and night Personal attention by staff was second to none and this combined with the beautiful facilities in the bedroom and the lobby and reception area made my mother feel so spoilt Staff went out of their way to help my mother overcome difficulties she experienced wit access etc
450616,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The rooms were quirky but carefully decorated and had every amenity The breakfasts were fabulous The staff were lovely and could not have been more helpful and pleasant 
450617,Hotel Esther a, Can t think of anything , Hotel Estherea suited our family parents and teenagers very well The central location was excellent quiet and beautiful beside the canal and a place to sit outside Very comfortable and clean Traditional decoration refreshments biscuits and cakes available in the lobby at all times Gym was put to use and enjoyed Staff very helpful and pleasant We would stay there again 
450618,Hotel Esther a, As an American I don t understand European shower drains they don t seem to catch water and floors always get wet Why doesn t shower door go all the way to floor , Breakfast exceptional Best croissants and apple cake anywhere Lovely to have complimentary coffee and tea plus pastry all day 
450619,Hotel Esther a, Poor light and ventilation Room faced small but nice inner courtyard If we opened a window the air conditioning automatically turned off AC never got room cool enough for us , Proximity to everything Great breakfast spot on corner tons of nearby restaurants Walkable to everything although museums were a bit of a hike 
450620,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The hotel was very beautiful comfortable and centrally located without feeling like you were in the thick of it The staff was friendly and accomodating I highly recommend it 
450621,Hotel Esther a, Staff was perfunctory for the most part there were a couple of extremely lovely and helpful front desk staff but also a couple of surly ones , Location was lovely cosy rooms and nice bathrooms lovely entrance and one immediately felt comfortable 
450622,Hotel Esther a, A little expensive 380 for sat night 180 for sun night, Tea and coffee avilable free of charge all day a really nice touch Also my husband loved the complimentary sweets in room Beautiful hotel and very welcoming
450623,Hotel Esther a, Rooms a bit small but adequate for a city hotel A bit over decorated but that is personal, Staff very very helpful public rooms comfortable and nice Great location near dam square flower market walking distance of museum quarter lovely tea coffee nd cake free in lobby 
450624,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Wonderful hotel Beautifully decorated and in a great location So many restaurants and cafes nearby Right next to the 9 streets shopping areas which was also a plus We could also walk to all the major museums Truly felt as though we were in a magical little place We loved how unique the hotel felt as compared to larger hotels Our room faced the street which was not loud at all at least compared to NYC Would certainly recommend Note We are in our mid twenties and the rest of the guests seemed much older than us by a decade or two We didn t mind at all but something to consider if you are looking for a younger hotel 
450625,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The bathrooms and showers are wonderful Very comfortable bed Really enjoyed the lounge bartender Leo friendly informative serves very good drinks Bar food was delicious
450626,Hotel Esther a, nothing , We appreciated the attention we received from the staff They wanted make sure we had a great visit We liked the location In addition they put out some nice cookies in the afternoon to satisfy my sweet tooth 
450627,Hotel Esther a, The staff had us wait for a long time almost 3hours to check in considering we have informed them of our arrival time , The room although very small in size is beautifully and colorfully decorated looking directly at the canal It is situated at the heart of amsterdam and everything is a few steps away 
450628,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Outstanding service the staff could nt do enough for you Quality throughout from linen to coffee Within walking distance to main attractions Comfortable beds 
450629,Hotel Esther a, Prefer a regular bathroom door Room was a bit small, Room was beautiful albeit small Location right on canal was romantic Everything about the place was tasteful 
450630,Hotel Esther a, Shower floor very slippery with no safety bar Staff didn t know about Marionette Theater or bike rickshaws , Great walking location Staff helped us switch to a room to accommodate my friend s physical needs Coffee bar pastry cookie variety best of entire trip including cruise iPad use library were great Nice that lobby had numerous spots to rest chat and enjoy coffee or tea 
450631,Hotel Esther a, We drove to the hotel which was very challenging but we had too many bags to take the train in I had considered dropping the car at the airport prior to going into the city , Everything was quite lovely We did not eat at the hotel because for me breakfast can never be worth as much as they charge 
450632,Hotel Esther a, The bathroom lighting could have been better I found it difficult to apply makeup because of poor lighting particularly in the vicinity of the round makeup mirror Our room 115 had very poor natural light We had requested a canal view and were told it was unavailable but would be receiving an upgrade We failed to see any upgraded features in this room Our only window faced into a courtyard with poor natural light and also looked directly into the room 10 feet across the courtyard For any kind of privacy we had to keep our curtains shut , The beds were very comfortable We enjoyed the complimentary coffee bar and the mint raspberry water We also enjoyed having 2 bottles of water in the refrigerator daily The breakfast was excellent Location of the hotel was great for walking to all the tours we had planned 
450633,Hotel Esther a, Had to wait each time at reception for staff to finish dealing with their pc Felt like the invisible guest on arrival and departure No help offered with luggage on departure , Comfortable quaint bedroom very peaceful Excellent breakfast in lovely breakfast room Location in the 9 streets Staff are efficient if somewhat distant
450634,Hotel Esther a, Spa bath in room 201 I think the blue and white room was very loud making it not very romantic The breakfast staff weren t initially very helpful talking is through what was buffet and what was brought to the table We sat down and was left to own devices but we d not eaten there before so didn t know exactly what the deal was , Amazing Should be more stars
450635,Hotel Esther a, Nothing at all And I m a pretty hard person to please , Hotel staff very helpful Beautifully decorated hotel Bfast was good quality food I particularly liked how they had tea and coffee and always lollies and sweets at your disposal without paying and juice and tasty mint water 
450636,Hotel Esther a, The stairs between floors are extremely steep scared to fall going down Also it would be nice to have more counterspace in the bathroom for personal belongings , Loved the location of this hotel and the friendliness of the staff
450637,Hotel Esther a, Nothing to report here, Location was fabulous room was comfy and bathroom was huge 24 hour capucino was a plus too Front desk helped with dinner reservations at excellent fish place one night I never would have chosen on my own 
450638,Hotel Esther a, They took extra charge for lake check out when I late only 30 minutes No restorante and room service for lunch and dinner, Nice interior good breakfast lovely lobby and bar
450639,Hotel Esther a, Told we had an executive room and it was tiny Needed to iron clothes but ironing board too big to put up in space we had to move in 235 was an extortinate amount for the room , Great location
450640,Hotel Esther a, Buffet breakfast was expensive at 20 However you could order room service or from a waiter and eat in the bar area for less money , Location was accessible to most major museums And numerous good restaurants were within a 5 minute walk Hotel is beautifully appointed and guest room was comfortable though a bit cramped for storage space for clothes 
450641,Hotel Esther a, Nothing , First and foremost the location is absolutely perfect overlooking the Singel Canal and central to everything A very pleasant surprise was the breakfast buffet which is lovely and a true value Delicious baked goods and an excellent assortment of breakfast choices The Hotel Estherea is a lovely boutique hotel that oozes romance and perfection for enjoying Amsterdam 
450642,Hotel Esther a, I don t normally provide feedback however this hotel is terrible The walls are paper thin you can hear the people in the bathroom going about their business in the room above walking around with squeaking floorboards hear people walking around the halls The ceiling height is incredibly low making you feel like you are in a cave The free wifi is predominantly slow or doesn t work at all The shower is ridiculously small and pressure variable at best The hairdryer may as well have been one of the staff members blowing hot air out of their mouths There is no services welcome manual in the room The decor is pretty much dressing mutton up as lamb I don t recommend it would steer clear I paid half the price at an IBIS and although small you got what you paid for PLUS high speed internet friendly staff free breakfast and a comfortable bed , The location
450643,Hotel Esther a, I found the staff at the reception fairly unpleasant and uninterested in helping their customers They seemed bothered when I asked them for restaurant recommendations in the neighborhood and vaguely indicated one direction I should walk towards for sandwich shops I tried to call the reception from my room to ask for more towels and they put me on hold for 45 minutes until I gave up , This is a very well located cosy hotel The room had a view on one of the internal gardens ie 2 square meter but was very quiet and pleasant The breakfast is delicious with lots of variety and high quality products Great internet spacious bathroom and fairly nice bed 
450644,Hotel Esther a, Nothing, This is a great hotel I would not stay anywhere else in Amsterdam It has everything you would need and the location can t be beat Our room was huge by NY standards Beautiful koi pond even a fitness room Breakfast is not included but really nice and worth the extra money They even lent us an umbrella when it was raining 
450645,Hotel Esther a, The ceilings were a bit low that was the only thing that made the room feel a bit small but other than that the basic room was convenient spacious clean and perfect for our needs , The location of the hotel is amazing in the beautiful area of the nine streets quiet area with lots of nice restaurants and cafes and yet very close to the central of Amsterdam as well as the south canals the museums Vondel park Jordaan area Leidseplein It was really a nice walking distance to almost everywhere the location is perfect The staff was extra nice and helpful 
450646,Hotel Esther a, The room was very small tiny even and it was very expensive for us But it had a great view and was very clean , The staff was very helpful we liked that they put water bottles in our refrigerator every day and that coffee with cakes are free at the lobby all day 
450647,Hotel Esther a, The room was a bit old fashioned and the murphy bed like setup was a little strange Didn t care for separation of toilet and bathroom No on site food or room service , Service was excellent attentive and friendly staff Lobby is charming with free coffee and tea service and cookies and candies all afternoon and evening 
450648,Hotel Esther a, Rooms were small at times a little noisy on canal When compared to other places we ve stayed while on this trip it seemed over priced, Great location We thought it was very lovely unique with little extras like coffee machine candies cakes Lovely bar

450651,Hotel Esther a, I would have preferred being given a card key to get into our room I did not especially like the room key system that they use where you have to give the key to the front desk each time you go out It was a little inconvenient otherwise it was a great experience ,No Positive
450652,Hotel Esther a, Third night surprise by charging 45 euros more this was not quoted when I made booking Reason given was hotel availability , Breakfast and staff were excellent
450653,Hotel Esther a, Our room 215 was a little dark as it overlooked a courtyard but was overlooked by other rooms which meant we needed to close curtains even in daytime , Bed excellent Bathroom very good Good shower Delightful cosy bar and very friendly staff 
450654,Hotel Esther a, Staff offered to arrange shuttle to airport and didn t follow through so we had to pay extra for a last minute taxi , Great location We appreciated it was in a quieter area
450655,Hotel Esther a, The lift was the smallest I have ever seen and the first flight of stairs is scary for anyone with a foot larger than average size The showers were very slippery until used a couple of times and the hair dryer was a little average in effectiveness The hotel put a large holding amount on the credit card used to secure the booking and this was not released for two working days after check out This was not necessarily the hotels problem but something to plan for BUT the above issues would not stop us from staying there again , Room was very comfortable and well sorted with bathrobes slippers quality body shampoo in the shower and other nice touches The breakfast assortment was very large with the best fresh fruit selection we have experienced in Europe The bar is cosy and beautiful The he location is very good with quality cafes and restaurants close by

450672,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, fun decorations good breakfast great bathrooms nice bar great complementary coffee tea and cookies 24 7 complimentary ipad for use during the stay very nice and helpful staff
450673,Hotel Esther a, Room was small the tv was from the last century and not up to modern standards Limited wardrobe space meant we were unable to unpack Breakfast should have been included as standard and not an extra , Location is perfect close to most things but away from some of the seedier parts of Amsterdam we had one of the older rooms which had a view over the canals but was a little cramped but still 250 night without breakfast Common areas in the hotel are limited to the reception area and a small bar and sitting area 
450674,Hotel Esther a, Room a little small but that is probably the case everywhere in central Amsterdam where hotels have been created from old houses , Location great Staff very friendly

450679,Hotel Esther a, Only one coffee machine working at breakfast so needed to queue for a hot drink Lower rear rooms positioned around very small internal area with view into other rooms with only minimal natural light from high above Zero exterior view Expensive compared to other luxury hotels nearby , Comfy bed lovely room overall Luxurious feel to the hotel Good breakfast selection 
450680,Hotel Esther a, The room was small but it is Europe so the canal view made up for that , Our travel documents passports went astray on our way to the hotel The staff were exceptionally helpful calming a very distressed couple helping us locate them We also loved coffee and all the extras available all day Fabulous 
450681,Hotel Esther a, Help with luggage when leaving Non existent Which was odd because everything else was perfect , Amazing staff very friendly couldn t do enough to help 
450682,Hotel Esther a, You really hear the people come in and out in the hallway , The location is fantastic the premises are charming the staff is very friendly and helpful
450683,Hotel Esther a, There was no space for cases in the rooms and the high sided baths with shower overhead were we thought a hazard, Position was great and rooms and decor were charming Huge chandeliers lots of flowers in common area We had a lovely view over the canal floor staff were excellent and we loved the tiny bar which we used for breakfast and pre dinner drinks
450684,Hotel Esther a, Hair dryer in bathroom useless, Our bedroom was very bright and comfortable Breakfasts excellent though could do with a few more staff on clearing duty possibly I am being a bit picky hate piled up plates on table
450685,Hotel Esther a, The classic room is adequate but a bit small The bathroom tub shower is narrow and deep and presents a bit of a challenge getting into and out of In thinking of future renovation the hotel would be wise to consider putting in a walk in shower in lieu of the tub , The center city location is great within walking distance of good restaurants and attractions Trams stop nearby as well The boutique hotel is nicely appointed and the staff is focused on service We enjoyed a great stay 
450686,Hotel Esther a, No problems at all with the hotel BUT Traffic problems led to delays for taxis journeys took longer than expected , Very good location to explore Amsterdam also to visit some of the many good restaurants Staff excellent 
450687,Hotel Esther a, A small kettle in the room so that hot water is available for guests who need something warm before sleeping and early morning Eventhough chilled bottled water was available it wasn t ideal to take it with medication , The library is especially beautiful and comfortable I felt i could read for hours there without feeling like a stranger I also like that the staff were readily available to help yet not intrusive 
450688,Hotel Esther a, Would have been a nice touch to have tea and coffee served at the table for breakfast instead of self serve Also to have two key cards issued per couple and not one large heavy card key Also to have some items placed in the minibar from which to choose from , Most comfortable bed I ve ever slept in and the staff were exceptional nothing was a problem only too happy to please They were so helpful with any questions we had 
450689,Hotel Esther a, Can be a little noisy due to proximity to Charles Bridhe, Charming old time inn we had the suite for 3 nights and it was good sized and comfortable Standard room was quite small just bigger than the bed The building is several hundred years old with 20th century upgrades Has wifi and good continental breakfast 
450690,Hotel Esther a, Nothing it seemed perfect to us , We had a deluxe room perfect in comfort size and aesthetics The staff went out of there way to help The lobby was very well appointed One of the greatest hotels we have ever stayed This was our second visit 
450691,Hotel Esther a, Got room on first floor u can hear noises from neighbors , Fantastic location on canal Good staff young and dynamic Good wifi small but ok fitness room 
450692,Hotel Esther a, The smell of the room was muffig The Wiev was the wall of the same building in 2 3 m distance But I did not care of it for one night Breakfast was ok I missed fresh fruit , The location is perfect and beautiful just in centrum of the old town Staff at reception was very friendly Comfortable lobby with free coffee and tee

450699,Hotel Esther a, Breakfast was very expensive so didn t choose that option, This is the most beautiful hotel lobby and bar I ve ever seen Staff were very friendly 
450700,Hotel Esther a, I ve stayed in quite a few of the more fancy hotels in this area bearing in mind how expensive this hotel was it was not up to scratch Small room poor storage for clothing no drawers shower was a stand up in a small bath not good enough, Location and staff
450701,Hotel Esther a, The bathroom was a little small and when I booked they said I could email them if I had any requests As it was my boyfriends birthday I asked if they could do anything in the room to make it special but they never got back to me , My boyfriend and I went for his birthday and got offered the opportunity to upgraded to a nicer room for only a couple of pounds more which overlooked the canal and had a four poster bed Was really lovely and a great location Had cocktails in the bar after we came back from dinner Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind is one of the best I ve ever had and my boyfriends sister is a professional cocktail maker Definitely worth a try and no more expensive then you d get in London 
450702,Hotel Esther a, Bathroom is not quite privet Doors not closing fully Noisy in the night time You can hear other guests walking and doors closing on the floor , Good location Nice and friendly staff Beautiful rooms with canal view as an option

450705,Hotel Esther a, The window in our room faced the elevator in the central atrium so we had to keep our shutters closed all the time for privacy, Complimentary beverages in the lobby were excellent and the staff were very professional and friendly
450706,Hotel Esther a, We had difficulty booking in Staff on reception a little casual regarding our booking couldn t find it Then informed us it was only one night and then didn t realise already pre paid Good thing I had a hard copy of my booking and confirmation Although room was good size it was still stuffy Room over decorated and too many lamps , Location was great Breakfast was very varied and good Room size good obviously you get what u pay for Bathroom spacious Shower and pressure just average If you are tall it would be difficult to have a shower comfortably Although the hotel was busy it was still quiet and plenty of space to sit downstairs 
450707,Hotel Esther a, Nothing, Where to start This hotel is fantastic From the moment we arrived the friendliness and professionalism of the staff was exceptional Anthony handled our check in and as we had travelled from Austalia and arrived at 7 30am feeling shattered he was able to get us into our room as soon as possible thus very thankful The all day tea and coffee is a lovely touch and most enjoyed while sitting in the beautifully decorated lounges The rooms are lovely and the beds are heavenly I loved the large size bath products and a quality brand L Occitane The buffet breakfast is well set up and beautifully presented The scrambled eggs were delicious Finally the location is perfect great restaurants shopping and all walking distance 
450708,Hotel Esther a, Room was a little small but nothing really to complain about , Hotel gives good first impression on arrival Beautiful lobby lounge area and bar Availability of refreshments and tea coffee water anytime Beautiful and generous buffet breakfast at reasonable price All staff friendly spoke English and happy to assist in any way i e maps calling taxi advise on what to see and do around Amsterdam 
450709,Hotel Esther a, The TV reception was not very good , We had a spacious and very comfortable room with an interesting street view The coffee station in the lobby with fresh biscuits was great The breakfast was also very good and you could always take a banana or apple with you for a snack The location of the hotel was excellent within walking distance to most of the tourist attractions and with lots of restaurants close by to choose from Also close to a tram station Loved the fresh flowers in the public areas 
450710,Hotel Esther a, At 400euro per night vastly overpriced Indeed Amsterdam is an expensive city to visit Tourism is its main livelihood and works on premis of no repeat visitors Hop on hop off bus etc awful and overpriced , Art Deco period style So a quaint alternative to steel and glass Van Loon gardens and house salvaged the visit Cycling was also fun 
450711,Hotel Esther a, Water from tub had a sewage smell , Location great staff beautiful room and building Small snack and 24 hour availability of beverage was wonderful for those windy cold rainy days 
450712,Hotel Esther a, Our room was tiny We were charged 18 EU for breakfast because we booked through Booking com our friends were charged 13 eu for breakfast , Staff and hotel was wonderful couldn t have been nicer or more accommodating Other guests were mostly Europeans which was fine 
450713,Hotel Esther a, We ran reception for a taxi to the airport and were quoted 49 Euros however when we got to the Airport it was 70 euros The driver said the hotel quoted us wrong, The hotel was beautiful we went for my friends hen do and it was the prefect mix of elegance and relaxation It was only 10 min walk away from the main district and the staff were amazing nothing was ever too much trouble for them
450714,Hotel Esther a, Bedrooms and bathrooms were on the small size We wanted twin beds but they were not clearly defined and very close , The location was very central The breakfast was good although self service The beds were comfortable Staff were helpful 
450715,Hotel Esther a, It was an expensive stay but probably worth it , The location is very central so as a tourist you can walk to all the main museums The area around the hotel is quiet Tea and coffee with cakes were available free all day in the lounge which meant we spent less in cafes We had a room with a view of the canal 
450716,Hotel Esther a, Our room 408 was the smallest double room I ve ever stayed in at any hotel we were constantly having to move out of each other s way just to get around the bed However don t let this put you off the rest of the hotel more than makes up for this and I d definitely recommend it to you , The hotel was in a great location on the edge of the old town and near the museum quarter The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the hotel was very clean and comfortable Wifi worked well everywhere and my wife loved the decor in the lobby bar area

450718,Hotel Esther a, Nothing could have been better , I liked the location The hotel is a formal old fashioned style like South Carolina or Savannah Georgia It has Old world charm that is sophisticated and cozy The staff was wonderful and helped us park our car and move luggage There s a cozy bar that provided a beer and nosh while the car was parked There is a real nice British type breakfast and a coffee bar that provided coffee any time Rooms with views of the canal are available 
450719,Hotel Esther a, I didn t take the breakfast option At 18 per day for a coffee yoghurt and fruit was a bit pricey and there s a supermarket 2 mins walk away , The most beautiful bar in the lobby I have ever seen The location is fantastic with many restaurants is easy walk Beds are great and the rooms were not overheated like a lot of hotels Staff very obliging 
450720,Hotel Esther a, Breakfast was expensive and bar staff very slow , The decor was outstanding refreshing change from minimalism Free tea and coffee was great as was the Mac that available to use 
450721,Hotel Esther a, Every room has extravagant wall paper and soft furnishings in silks velvets and nets this plus heavy furniture and chandeliers everywhere would not suit everybody If you can cope with it then the hotel is a delight with loads of flowers and little internal courtyard , Very helpful and efficient staff Superb breakfast which was very good value for money Any type of tea and coffee and cold drinks available for free all day and night Delicious cakes and biscuits also provided Hotel well maintained with plenty of soft seating in sitting rooms papers magazines and books also provided Excellent gym 
450722,Hotel Esther a, Bathroom had poor storage space for personal items No one knowledgeable about restaurants , Location staff cleanliness cats extra touches such as beverages out all the time

450725,Hotel Esther a, Rooms relatively cramped and old but comfortable, No restaurant but good bar and delightful sitting room Staff friendly and helpful Well sited on one of canals close to city centre
450726,Hotel Esther a, Beds could be more comfortable and rooms are VERY small but adequate , Location of this hotel can t be beat It s close to everything in beautiful Amsterdam and overlooks one of the prettiest canals 
450727,Hotel Esther a, The dining area is quite small so it s a bit of a jostle at breakfast time and tea pots would have been nice, Lovely room with lovely big big bed Lovely lobby and bar area too the decor is fab
450728,Hotel Esther a, Sometimes the service at the bar could have been slightly more efficient , The reception staff were extremely helpful and pleasant especially when recommending restaurants which is so important when you are visiting somewhere for the first time Our bedroom was well serviced and comfortable 
450729,Hotel Esther a, small room with no ability to have separation between beds Shower temperature could be tempermental no awareness from website that gym existed staff had no personal touches just a functional service no character except from the building furnishings v little to do within the hotel , V Clean without awareness of the cleaning staff complimentary coffee etc at reception area nice lounge area with atmospheric furnishings 
450730,Hotel Esther a, Upon checking in the reception staff mixed up our rooms and gave the double deluxe to a single traveler and gave the smaller room to two travelers sharing a room The next day they offered to have us change rooms but it was too much trouble to pack everything up and move The single traveler was charged for the double deluxe room We were compensated with a box of chocolates Wow , The hotel is beautiful The staff was professional The location is perfect 
450731,Hotel Esther a, At breakfast at busy times not enough room , Small hotel in the very heart of Amsterdam with that Luxuary feel from the start Staff extremely helpful and polite Would most defiantly stay here again 
450732,Hotel Esther a, The air conditioning would only work for one hour at a time which meant I had to get up every hour during the night to reset it This is NOT what one expects in a five star hotel , Breakfast was wonderful even though it does cost extra The room was quiet and the staff did try to correct air conditioning problems which were finally fixed on my last night there

450773,Hotel Esther a, Two things bothered me about this hotel 1 Breakfast not included in the rate and cost of 18 euros which frankly I think is quite over priced Instead had coffee fresh squeezed orange juice and a bagel 2 minutes from the hotel at Bagel and Bean for only 9 euros 2 They took a caution on my credit card for the full amount of my stay plus 25 This seems abusive to me especially since there s no negotiating that point when your arrive with your bags and your stuck , This hotel has a quite nice decorative style with period wood panelling in the lobby It s also a quite good location on the Singel Gracht 
450774,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The room was beautiful spacious clean and comfortable The bathroom was lovely and the toiletries seemed good The bar and food were great Walking distance from the train station town museums etc 
450775,Hotel Esther a, Rooms were tiny which was unexpected due the to pictures We were placed in an awful room at first with marks dents and scratches all over the room and the bath had long black hairs in and was so dirty Our window was facing the glass elevator so we would have had to keep our shutters closed the entire time The second room we were moved to due to complaint was also tiny and the bathroom was filthy The walls are very thin and you can literally hear everything if you know what I mean The sheets aren t changed or cleaned The service is terrible and very slow they failed to inform of a number of things such as we should leave our key with the reception upon departing the hotel everyday otherwise the key deactivates itself on arrival we should have received an iPad for room service and other informative things such as tourist attractions but didn t receive this until a day before we left Due to the weather being so bad another guest informed us that the hotel should have offered us one of their umbrellas on the way out and we didn t received this service once The service is very rude and unfriendly no smiles no welcome no greetings The hotel wouldn t let me use their phone to call my taxi to the airport to check where he was and one of the Receptionists ordered me to use my personal mobile which would have cost me a lot of money I was in shock , The chairs in the lobby were comfortable The snacks with the tea and coffee were nice The pomegranate water was lovely

450781,Hotel Esther a, The breakfast wasn t what I d expect of a 4 hotel Good selection of fresh fruit and great breads very poor cooked selection only bacon eggs and undercooked cocktail sausages and only one cereal cornflakes and expensive at 18 euros Very small bar though it is 24 7 and you can take your drinks in the foyer but it lacks atmosphere Room was very small with no hanging or storage space so had to live out of my suitcase for 4 days The 2 small wardrobes held the ironing board and the safe minibar But it was warm and comfy , The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in in an hotel and the pillows were terrific The location is great quiet but with all main attractions no more than 2 miles away and for non walkers there is a good tram service Good eateries locally esp liked Vasso Italian restaurant and O Reilly s Irish pub for the best triple cooked chips anywhere 
450782,Hotel Esther a, Would have liked a kettle in room but being picky Free water was ok until we went to reception for warm drink, Staff very friendly and helpful Room lovely decorated and clean location fab Extra touches like coffee machine and cakes free in reception Free use of computer and printer Hotel decorated tasteful throughout

450802,Hotel Esther a, I guess and old house can t provide with bigger rooms but this comment is really a bit of nitpicking serving to emphasize how everything else has been great , Everyone on the staff was fabulous I ve never enjoyed service of such a nice knowledgeable kind helpful and yes beautiful and intelligent people more than I enjoyed it at the hotel Esther a 
450803,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Excellent service really friendly staff Great location 10 mins walk from station by the 9 streets Free tea coffee and cakes Fab breakfast Great little bar
450804,Hotel Esther a, At breakfast the service was the only thing that let down our stay slightly It wasn t bad but there wasn t any milk was so we had to request them bring some and and would have expected that the staff would organize tea and coffee for you and bring to the table but this was self service which was surprising, Rooms were really nice and decor of hotel was much more boutique styled which is much nicer than a big chain
450805,Hotel Esther a, Poor pillows only one pillow each and both pillows were flat Was other cushions but they were for decorative purposes only Woke up with a stiff neck Shower gel bottle in the shower was empty next morning took one off the cleaners trolley and put it next to the empty bottle so it could be changed Cleaner took it back and left the empty one So had to pump shower gel from the bathroom one into a glass to use in the shower again Cleaners need to check the levels of toiletries on cleaning rooms , Beautiful hotel gorgeous decor perfect location cosy little cocktail bar and nice breakfasts Good choice and variety of shops and restaurants close by

450807,Hotel Esther a, This is a small gripe but both nights we finished the evening in the hotel bar On the first night the barman did not give us any change only a couple of euro and on the second night the barman tried to overcharge us for 2 x G T s by about 5 it was only when I questioned him he apologised The bar is small and pretty but it left a bad taste , This was a lovely quirky hotel that had a nice homely vibe to it All rooms are different we stayed in room 517 and it was beautiful The hotel is in a very central position and is suitable for families and couples The central train station is only a 10 minute walk away and Dam Square is within a stones throw The staff were very friendly Our credit card was charged twice by the hotel in error but once we brought it to their attention they immediately apologised and resolved it within 24 hours Very impressed with everything here and will be back 
450808,Hotel Esther a, Bathrooms a bit on small side not much room to put bits and pieces , A very welcoming hotel great warming atmosphere very friendly and helpful staff Clean rooms with comfy bed and pillows Rooms a bit on the small side but lovely and cozy Only downside was bathroom a bit too small so we struggled finding space for our toiletries Saying that though they did provide nice soap shampoo etc Didn t try their breakfast or bar but looked good Loved the complimentary coffee pastries and chocolates Paid extra for canal view but quite high up so view wasn t great so wouldn t bother with the view room personally Would definitely stay again and recommend Very enjoyable stay 
450809,Hotel Esther a, There were a couple of small criticisms about the cleanliness of our room There was a item of litter on the bathroom floor left by a previous guest which did not get removed for 2 days when we removed it ourselves There was also a very dusty ledge in the bedroom which had clearly not been dusted for ages Having said that the general impression of the bedroom and bathroom was good, Nice bright decor Very helpful desk and bar staff Comfortable hotel Would return if visiting Amsterdam again

450814,Hotel Esther a, Everything was good The room is really small but it seems to be the case in all Amsterdam hotels at least the centric ones And with a view to the canal it felt like a ship s cabin , The hotel has a very special feel and interior very Amsterdam like We had a great view on Singel canal from our room The location cannot be better 
450815,Hotel Esther a, The view we had was unfortunately the windows of other rooms and felt like shutters had to remain closed for privacy Gym isn t really more than a small room with minimal equipment not unexpected really , Room was comfy and clean good convenient location Polite staff nice little bar

450836,Hotel Esther a, First room had a shower inside a small bath that was dangerous for your footing Also the room was very noisy with staff starting to walk around at 6 a m on a higher floor , We were grateful for a change of room to a very nice one after complaint thanks to competent and flexible staff member Tariq Breakfast is excellent The bar provides reasonably priced cocktails mixed expertly by a most competent barman If you like striking wallpaper this is the hotel for you 
450837,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Classical decor and cozy feel to the whole place if you re after ultra modern don t expect it here but a beautiful hotel in a great location with lovely staff 
450838,Hotel Esther a, The dressing table in the bedroom didn t have a mirror nor a plug The mirror was hidden behind the tv It s not very practical if an entire family has to use a bathroom and the only option to do hair make up etc is in the bathroom The lobby is great but the free coffee tea facilities hardly ever worked , The decor in the lobby and breakfast room is absolutely gorgeous The bedroom decor was also lovely Space was also great 
450839,Hotel Esther a, With the likes being said the only issue we had was depending on which staff member you asked would determine how much help you received , The location of this hotel is premium and the decor of the hotel is just so inviting The hotel offers free coffee tea lemonade and small snacks 24hrs We stayed over Christmas and they made a brilliant mulled wine and housekeeping left us a gift of L Occitane lotions and chocolates in our room which was such a nice gesture Overall the staff was very helpful and pleasant 
450840,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Great room Lovely and comfortable room Public areas lovely and smart and staff really charming and helpful loved the decor in the bedrooms but especially the lounge Gorgeous 
450841,Hotel Esther a, After a certain time at night the bar wasn t very well staffed because the member of staff was serving as a receptionist and a bar person , We really enjoyed the feel and decor of the hotel And the staff were very friendly The facilities in the room were very good 
450842,Hotel Esther a, No restaurant, Everything I had a very nice clean room bathroom with L Occitane products enjoyed a very welcoming cosy lobby with fresh flowers I liked the hot and cold drinks stations free of charge and the bar food was great Very polite staff 
450843,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, We liked everything about this hotel Friendly and helpful staff lovely breakfast and beverages and lovely biscuits at our disposal Everywhere spotless 
450844,Hotel Esther a, My biggest problem was there is no hotel restaurant This is not really a problem because there loads of good restaurants just around the corner making an in hotel restaurant pointless I was only looking for one because I was unwell at the time , I loved everything about this place the rooms were gorgeous and all unique There was a lovely place to sit and read downstairs The staff were on the ball and unfailingly pleasant I was unwell at the time because of an accident and just being there made me feel life was good despite my injuries 
450845,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The little touches were lovely i e it rained we were given an umbrella the pastries with tea coffee we wanted canal view and it was no problem lovely hotel 
450846,Hotel Esther a, Our room was on the cold side with no additional or controllable heating Particularly cold at night No Tea coffee making facilities in room however this was available in lobby , The Hotel Estherea is situated in great location and within easy walking distance to central areas and points of interest Small hotel interesting and stylish decor Friendly staff who were eager to help Hotel Estherea is uniquely different to other comparable hotels in the area 
450847,Hotel Esther a, N A, Everything in this hotel is amazing FACT Myself and my partner had the best time in Amsterdam and one of the main reasons is this place cant wait to go back 
450848,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, I really enjoyed my stay and strongly recommend it The staff was very kind and gave me all the attention I needed I look forward to staying there again The great is that the next time I travel to Amsterdam I will not have to search for hotels Tremendous breakfast which is worth every euro Some might complain about the room size it didnt bother me at all though Excellent pick 
450849,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The hotel was superb Lovely welcoming foyer and complimentary coffee and chocolates Room was lovely and very peaceful Choice of restaurants at doorstep Bar was well stocked and superb service
450850,Hotel Esther a, Massive bathroom yet tiny toilet closet , Perfect location quiet but only 5 mins walk to the city square 10 mins to red light district Great service and room cleaning Small touches that not all 4 hotels offer e g porter and reception look after keys Free tea coffee biscuits and pastries
450851,Hotel Esther a, Central heating we could not change the temp of room due to if being as part of central heating We called to ask for help and the staff said they would come see what can be done but no one ever came I asked to book my shuttle back to which the staff member at central desk said you could do so yourself on the computer Only after I insisted that I already booked and just need to schedule did they call But this is minor and they were helpful afterwards , Most beautiful hotel room I have ever seen felt like royalty We didn t prebook but upon arrival we were given a beautiful canal facing room 107 Was a bit concerned about how the wifi will be due to past reviews but it worked excellently The amenities provided upgraded our stay hugely and are that extra touch to make you feel truly spoiled The iPad recieved upon arrival the coffee and tea station there are deserts some times too etc There is a 24 hour gym it isn t big but it does it s job Tv has English channels Would highly recommend this hotel Note that price doesn t not include city tax 
450852,Hotel Esther a, Hair in bath over priced breakfast for a week was the same and very small choices Bed was not comfortable and king size bed was two small beds togethir which make them moving alot, Location staff and cozy place
450853,Hotel Esther a, Very busy reception area tricky to pick up and drop of keys Giving guests a swipe card would save time , Great location attentive staff and beautiful decor makes the hotel worth a visit In a quiet area close to shops and restaurants away from the tacky tourist traps the hotel is a quiet refuge after a busy day sightseeing 
450854,Hotel Esther a, The hotel authorised my debit card 3 times prior to arrival and took 127 128 and 131 out of my bank account without warning I ve had many phone calls with them trying to get my money which cost me a lot of money After the first 2 authorisations I got my money back and upgraded to a deluxe room however they then took a third payment out of my account the week before Christmas when I specifically said don t take anymore without speaking to me they did anyway The hotel states pay on arrival yet when I got there they still had 131 of my money They took 131 on the 18th of December 2015 and I got it back on 6th January 2016 after my holiday was finished My hotel price on booking com was 520 Euros but when I got there I was asked to pay 600 Euros save yourself the hassle and go elsewhere Booking com was just not worth it It s a shame because the hotel was amazing and staff were lovely and I had a great time but the hassle leading up to my stay left me out of pocket and stressed , Great hotel in the end great location and lovely rooms 
450855,Hotel Esther a, The door to my room was broken you needed to push hard or check twice else wasn t locked As well as the rates of the room goes up and down on business days , Friendly staffs good location clean and nice Excellent 
450856,Hotel Esther a, The one thing I did not like is that the walls are thin and I could hear the people above me and next to me , The property is absolutely beautiful and loved the location It is so close to everything The rooms are spacious and very well appointed 
450857,Hotel Esther a, Our room was lovely except not quiet We could hear every footstep from the room above us and beside us It was our only negative and perhaps just down to where our room was situated Other than that we enjoyed our stay very much , Lovely staff all very helpful Quirky decor and free access to internet helpful for getting around Nice touch with 24 hour free coffee tea etc near the reception It rained a lot when we visited so the complimentary hotel umbrella was much appreciated Great location walking distance to main areas and near the tram We didn t avail of breakfast as it was extra but the restaurant looked nice 
450858,Hotel Esther a, absolutely none, This hotel is one of the best I have ever stayed in friendly attentive staff beautifully decorated not overdone very personal if you like a plush style great cocktails impeccable room service comfortable high quality bed etc We had the good fortune of a free upgrade for which we were very grateful The class of the house is also shown in the fact that nobody made a fuss about the upgrade They did not announce it in a very important voice saying We can offer you today a free upgrade to one of our best rooms or something equally silly which always leaves a bad taste in my mouth They just smilingly inquired next morning whether we had liked our room Really high class 
450859,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Delightful smaller hotel Lovely traditional decor Rooms on the smaller side but still very comfortable We usually stay in larger 5 star properties but this hotel was a welcome change and we will definately be back next time we travel to Amsterdam Look forward to another cocktail from Leo at the bar 
450860,Hotel Esther a, Room was little on the small size with no view But we don t really go to just sit in our room all day , Lovely classic style Hotel with friendly helpful staff all in a great location 
450861,Hotel Esther a, Room domestics could be rather rude and quite noisy in the mornings, Great location reception and bar staff very helpful and obliging very comfortable quiet location
450862,Hotel Esther a, It was a tad on the expensive side for our budget but it was a wonderful treat for Christmas , This hotel is fantastic We stayed over Christmas and the hotel was wonderful The staff was extremely helpful knowledgeable and friendly The decor of the hotel was not necessarily my style but the rooms and lobby are very well appointed The bed was comfortable and the location was perfect for us 
450863,Hotel Esther a, Inconsistent guest information from staff Check out was disappointing and unfriendly We checked out at 6 45 the young man who we think worked night shift and was cleaning reception was very offhand I think 800 Euro for two night deserved at least did you enjoy your stay and have a safe flight or look forward to welcoming you back , Location bed comfort L Occitane products in bathroom Complimentary bubbly wine on New Years Eve All day free tea coffee and hot chocolate and snacks 24 hour Bar Resturants and bars and shops and city highlights all within a few minutes walking distance
450864,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Hotel Estherea were a delight to stay with A lovely hotel in a great location the main doors open to reveal a sumptuous decor with very friendly staff We came to stay for the New Year celebrations and were offered complimentary champagne in the room Being teetotal they kindly swapped this for mocktails at the bar Lovely comfy decor great breakfast selection but overall a very friendly and relaxed atmosphere A great place from which to explore Amsterdam 
450865,Hotel Esther a, it s supposed to be a suite you pay the price for a suite but it s actually a hall transformed in a suite the only room that has no pictures on the website I understand why now Pink color everywhere The heater didn t work There is like a veranda inside the room Through the veranda we could see the people in the lobby better not to forget to close the curtains after the shower The fridge was practically empty it contained only 2 small bottles of water The barman charged us 4 beers instead of 2 Price for 1 night 400 euro 2 pers 55 euros for 24h parking get a place in the street , Close to everywhere
450866,Hotel Esther a, Floorboards creaky so you can really hear the people upstairs no tea coffee in the room, Great staff d cor beds location nice bar fun ambience
450867,Hotel Esther a, Not bring able to turn lights off from the bed lighting generally not great in room, Location individual decoration style in each room spacious room fantastic helpful and welcoming staff
450868,Hotel Esther a, A nice old building however very noisy rooms due to wooden floors , Hotel perfectly located in walking distance to all attractions Coffee hot chocolate and cookies complimentary in the hotel lobby Good WiFi signal 
450869,Hotel Esther a, Other than breakfast well done the hotel food wasn t the best on the couple of occasions we tried but then this seems to have matched our food experience in Amsterdam generally , Fantastic location easy to walk most anywhere Pretty and charming rooms with good floor space and amenities Noise proof windows Lovely personal touches gifts from hotel at Christmas and New Year s Great choice if you have aesthetic expectations seek convenience and comfort and value a personal and friendly experience 
450870,Hotel Esther a, Room too hot and airco centrally controlled in this case not working so the room was at a 25 C and more Noisy environment we asked quite room and got room on 1st floor above entrance street side Squeeky floors above neigbour was up early and walking around , Charming hotel special boutique decoration location
450871,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, We stayed at this beautiful and elegant hotel for 4 days and an overall experience was great The staff was professional and friendly the breakfast was good and reasonably priced Also the hotel has complimentary tea and coffee station and when it s raining the hotel provide quests with umbrellas which was also a very nice touch 
450872,Hotel Esther a, Baby cot was very narrow my 8 5 month old didn t really fit in it her arms stuck out Cot is for small babies only Thin walls Didn t bother us too much because neighbours were considerate , Beautiful hotel we had a spacious room with a canal view Baby cot was set up for us in the room We got a nice Christmas gift as well very thoughtful Our baby was asleep so we had to check out a bit later was no problem Would def stay here again 
450873,Hotel Esther a, Some of the staff thought we where breaking in one night when we were guests which affected our comfort for the rest of the stay Made the complaint next day to manager and received apologies , The other professional staff room decorations and location
450874,Hotel Esther a, Bedrooms are not being prepared for the night Strange setback , Friendly staff nicely decorated bedrooms and all the public area 5 Price policy is seasonally adjusted and flexible 
450875,Hotel Esther a, I didn t like leaving, Quirky chintzy romantic and absolutely charming The hotel was beautifully decorated with lots of small cosy sitting areas The staff were attentive and super friendly We had a superior room which was small and sumptuous and very quiet with a very comfortable bed Luxurious l occitane toiletries and Great bathroom with walk in shower and jacuzzi bath This was a great find a little gem of a place if you are looking for something with a little more character in a great location next to the canal with some great eateries and bars close by Loved it 
450876,Hotel Esther a, Small rooms breakfast was expensive pre authorisation of the card before check in and while booking , Location All main tourist attractions including Dam Square is within walking distance Free coffee tea with cookies is provided in the lobby Free wifi and 2 macs to use
450877,Hotel Esther a, My daughters were in a deluxe room no canal view and it was very small with only a window into a roofed courtyard so very dark , Fantastic location My husband and I had a fabulous canal view room which was spacious light and felt like a real treat 
450878,Hotel Esther a, Snacks in bar a bit limited for allergy issue gluten free Couple of nights there was quite a bit of noise outside from happy revelers one night it was particularly annoying , It s a lovely hotel Comfortable friendly little extras like chocolates and sweets next to the self serve coffee bar Decor great Location very good Room was very small but lovely and had super view over canal 
450879,Hotel Esther a, Wifi did not work very good only 1 elevator small bedroom but happens in most all European hotels , Perfect location cute rooms with excellent bathrooms great breakfast great staff great ambience They have tea coffee chocolate machine free of charge Really worth it for the value
450880,Hotel Esther a, There wasn t a single thing we didn t like , We loved everything about this hotel I couldn t stop smiling as we walked in Staff location cleanliness and rooms were all glorious Stay here and me amazed 
450881,Hotel Esther a, The rooms did get quite warm at night and after turning the heating right down it then went up to 24 degrees by the morning , Loved the decor it was very chic and quirky and the rooms were so cosy
450882,Hotel Esther a, Old fashioned hair dryer attached to bathroom wall Would prefer a more powerful one near the dressing table 18 for breakfast is expensive, Very central location but quiet away from traffic noise Beautiful decor Free tea coffee hot chocolate in lobby Comfortable beds Large bathroom
450883,Hotel Esther a, i liked EVERYTHING but if i have to find one thing i was missing a smal gym, staff were excellent service in top the room was beautyfull and BF excellent the best loction in town 
450884,Hotel Esther a, The deco was a bit outdated and the staff a bit pedantic At our arrival around 5 pm we had to wait 1 hour in the lobby for our room to be prepared And they say it is a four star hotel well , good location
450885,Hotel Esther a, Having stayed here several times in the past I missed the fish tank in the foyer Also we booked a canalside room but were told that we d been upgraded to a large suite at the back on the ground floor it took some while to get our canal room back The very bright floodlighting at the front of the hotel from 4pm to 9am means that you have to keep your curtains very tightly drawn this is something that could be looked into , Wonderful situation and helpful staff our negative comments are relatively minor 
450886,Hotel Esther a, Not a big deal but restaurant only open for breakfast Could easily walk to restaurants but would have been nice to have the option of staying in just because it was rainy while we were there , Staff was very friendly building was quaint location close to restaurants and within walking distance of all attractions while being in quieter part of town Room was small but that is to be expected in historic building Made good use of space Had been recently renovated so very up to date 
450887,Hotel Esther a, I can think of nothing worth complaining about, Hotel Estherea was compact and decorative It had everything I wanted and the location is well placed between center of town and museums Quiet location on a canal 
450888,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, simply amazing and i thank the algorith of Booking for allow me to have booked the last room for an amazing price The hotel is simply the coziest place i have ever been Amazing Breakfast freshly squeezed orange juice Simply Beautifull 
450889,Hotel Esther a, We had a Canel View room out the front they have big spot lights that light up the front of the hotel and also your room at night even with the blinds drawn Stupidest thing I ve ever experienced ,No Positive
450890,Hotel Esther a, Sound proofing in the rooms is so very bad You can literally hear people upstairs talking walking even turning on their beds The floor is VERY squeaky So ask for the top floor room , Location and views are terrific staff is helpful 
450891,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Friendly and helpful staff Wonderful location in heart of Ams Lovely views from upper floors Free tea and coffee all day Room decoration is always surprise
450892,Hotel Esther a, The Breakfast was much too expensive for a marginal selection of food For 18 Euros i had to pour my own coffee while the waitress stood around acting like they were busy Over priced breakfast Room location poor and decor was overly lavish and room was dark Shower room missed the mark and bathroom was narrow Would not stay here again Front desk clerk was unprofessional and not trained to answer questions Turning in the key and then retrieving it upon our return to the hotel took too long old fashioned system , Ideal location right in the heart of town easy access to Trams buying district
450893,Hotel Esther a, That I was only able to stay for a night , My overnight stay has definitely given me a reason to know that I will be returning again the moment I walked in the door I was greeted by a member at reception great personality and had a professional approach towards myself as a guest The Over all stay was extremely comforting as the lobby was being decked out with xmas decorations The room was absolutely gorgeous and clean 
450894,Hotel Esther a, Really picky but it would have been nice to have some drawers to put our clothes in , Absolutely excellent fantastic staff and I m planning on going back allready 
450895,Hotel Esther a, Nothing, Great location excellent rooms friendly staff 24 hour bar FREE 24 hour coffee tea facilities and free use of computer and printer facilities could not have stopped at a better hotel
450896,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Perfect atmosphere location in Amsterdam very cozy and comfortable rooms meal and service were great staff were very kind and cheerful the price was fair compared to the equivalent hotels around 
450897,Hotel Esther a, Had room 505 between lifts so lot noise Not good sleep Showers not hot enough , Comfort of rooms Location excellent Free tea coffee water cakes Staff friendly 
450898,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, A rarity amongst hotels it looked as good in real life as it does in its pictures Very comfortable and full of thoughtful touches For example instead of the usual mini bottle of shampoo in the shower there was a large shampoo a large conditioner and a large hair repairer There were free tea and coffee with mini cakes and biscuits 24 hours a day There was even a large glass container of iced mint leaves for those who like mint tea Oh and jars of sweets too The bedrooms are all individually designed and lack nothing The staff were constantly attentive and cheerful and nothing was too much trouble The breakfast choice was very extensive the best we have come across in our four years of travelling Europe and the scrambled eggs were constantly replenished so that they were always fresh and never past their best as so often happens if you get to breakfast late Breakfast was available until 11am another plus point Downsides 55 per 24 hour for parking but still cheaper than street parking The only thing that could improve the hotel would be a large open fire blazing away 
450899,Hotel Esther a, Wifi was not working was extremely slow This is not acceptable considering the room price guests are paying , Central location comfortable bed clean room 
450900,Hotel Esther a, If we had booked direct through the hotel breakfast would have been included for the same price that we paid booking com after which we then had to pay 18 each to have breakfast , Fantastic staff Excellent hotel with beautiful decor 
450901,Hotel Esther a, Room too warm and the temperature control panels didn t function Plethora of lamp shades made room a bit dim for reading , Loved the local shops bars and restaurants Free coffee cakes and sweet jar a nice touch Quiet location by canal with good tram connection to centre Friendly helpful staff 
450902,Hotel Esther a, No tea and coffee making facilities in the room trekking down to reception is not the same, Decor wonderfully over the top Staff very welcoming but could have known a bit more about stuff such as cost and frequency of trains to Schipol trams to other parts of the town good place to eat reistafel etc etc 
450903,Hotel Esther a, I wish I had booked more than one night and used the gym But everything was perfect Very impressed , This hotel far exceeded my expectations and will most certainly be my go to hotel for all future stays in Amsterdam While my single room was small it was beautifully and uniquely decorated and I felt pampered by the high end bath products and elegant details I could have spent all day in the comfortable lobby drinking delicious mochas from the espresso machine and had a hard time dragging myself out into the dreary weather to explore the city Highly highly recommend especially with a Booking com discount 
450904,Hotel Esther a, Breakfast is a little expensive at 18 but if you book through the hotel you get breakfast included in the price , Beautiful luxurious hotel Friendly staff who couldn t do enough for us The breakfast was lovely with loads of variety 5 minute to the centre of town Would definitely stay here again 
450905,Hotel Esther a, Room size is too small and this hotel is getting much too expensive for what you get I used to stay here before they were the location of a TV reality show it s now become a poor value , Location
450906,Hotel Esther a, Stayed for a long weekend the only thing that annoyed me was a group of Germans hogging the hotel bar they must have had beach towels on the bar stools , Beautiful hotel and location Staff were very sociable and friendly
450907,Hotel Esther a, Small tv no tea or coffee facilities in room but lovely coffee machine in lobby , Breakfast customer service and comfort of bed amazing bathroom and great canal views 
450908,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Beautiful design great location good breakfast Upgraded our room to a Royal Suite that was outstanding Thank you for the lovely staff 
450909,Hotel Esther a, Hotel is positioned as an upscale property and price and location reflect this There is something amiss in a negative old school way that business is conducted however Front desk operation was inattentive Young men staffers spent as much time kidding each other and winking over private jokes as they did servinfg customers One young woman staffer was cold and could offer no advice on dining or directions She seemed bothered to have been asked and not very knowledgeable I would not describe this as a warm welcoming place despite the elegant setting Others may have had a different experience however Disappointing given the high expextations we had Room we had was quite small and had only interior view to airshaft An outside view would have been worth the upcharge though the hotel is a bit pricy to begin with , Hotel has a lovely setting facing one of Amsterdam s famous canals Buildong is unimposing from the exterior but once inside you are immediately impressed with an elaborate elegant lobby and sitting rooms with chandeliers and beautiful woodwork and paneling Room we rented was small and an interior view Winding narrow hallways were either quaint or dangerous depending on your point of view Comfortable bed small clean bathroom many amenities you would expect Breakfast room looked comfortable There is a small bar 
450910,Hotel Esther a, The bed could have bin better we have back problems , Every thing you gave water coffee coco small cookie s candy Always ready too help us if we needed And you make us want to come back and we will 
450911,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Lovely hotel Staff very friendly room was compact but beautiful We had a canal view The free coffee was great and so were the cocktails The location was also excellent we would definitely recommend 
450912,Hotel Esther a, Pressure in the shower not the greatest but adequate Would prefer to have the breakfast included in the price , Excellent location friendly staff very good breakfast We were able to check in a little bit earlier as our room was ready Chinzy decor that had to be checked out Family run business 
450913,Hotel Esther a, All good , Lovely decor and ornaments in reception rooms and bedrooms Everything was immaculately clean someone had spilt their coffee on one of the armchairs and it was cleaned immediately leaving no mark on the cushion Staff were friendly and helpful Location ideal but also peaceful on a lovely canal Great having free tea and coffee in the reception area 24 hours where you could relax or take it to your room 
450914,Hotel Esther a, My payment was taken twice from the card as confirmation of the booking I was assured it would be refunded and as of yet the funds are still held , Location excellent Some really great staff Tom the porter gave loads of information while dropping us to our room and Martin on reception went to great lengths to assist with dinner recommendations Really lovely atmosphere in the Bar and fabulous decor 
450915,Hotel Esther a, For contemporary travellers with smartphones they really need more plug sockets and in better positions in the rooms The television selection and reception could have been better As a minor point we had told them in advance we were on honeymoon and it would have been nice if they had made some small gesture to recognise this , The staff were brilliant friendly efficient and knowledgeable we appreciated the recommendations of places nearby to eat and visit The room was comfortable and the bed was very much so The location was ideal and the canalfront view was perfect 
450916,Hotel Esther a, The double room we booked consisted of twin beds pushed together which was extremely uncomfortable and unromantic A deposit of 70 was taken to cover any minibar items we used We opened the minibar to find two tiny bottles of still mineral water which you might have thought would have been free at 364 night and nothing else There was no shampoo in the dispenser The saloon doors between the bathroom and the bedroom meant that any sound other than powdering your nose would have been rather unpleasant for your partner We had a drink at the real bar but they had run out of clean wine glasses it was 6pm and there were 6 of us there Definitely not the worth the price and we won t stay there again , Location was excellent We liked the coffee and cakes biscuits available at all times in the foyer 
450917,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, Enjoyed our stay so much Location excellent less than 10 minutes from dam square hotel is beautiful rooms are excellent and staff very helpful Will definitely recommend and will be booking this hotel next time I go to Amsterdam
450918,Hotel Esther a, Cleaning staff starting to disturb at 10am and not stopping until saying we were going to lesve in ten minutes Unacceptable for a 320 euros night room, Rooms not too big but very nice decorated nice hotel and bathroom
450919,Hotel Esther a, There really wasn t anything we didn t like except maybe the fact they didn t serve diner and we had to leave before breakfast But we found a great place very close for diner , Very charming old world but had all the amenities we needed We loved the large shower We found everything we wanted to see was within a pleasant walking distance 
450920,Hotel Esther a, Only negative remark would be when checking in we gave deposit for room and only got half of it back due to city tax We were not informed of this when we checked in and feel it should have been included in our overall payment when we checked in rather than being told we would get full deposit back This was very misleading Also we were supposed to get an ipad with tourist information on it with room but we were not given one We were not offered this when checking in but anyone else we saw checking in on other days received one This was clearly just forgotten about for us which is understandable but it would have been a great facility to have had so we were disappointed We also had no working fan in our bathroom Other than that I can t fault the hotel These issues were very minor , Excellent location Beautifully decorated Very friendly staff Unique hotel It was very peaceful and luxurious Stunning cocktail bar with amazing drinks Would recommend this place to anyone staying in amsterdam 
450921,Hotel Esther a, I ll couldn t stay there any longer , Beautiful hotel and staff When we go back we will definitely be staying in this hotel again It seems pricey for breakfast so we didn t have but when we went out first day for breakfast we ended up spending a lot more money So for the other two days we had it in the hotel and it was the nicest breakfast I have had at a hotel with plenty of choice If you are debating what hotel go to then this is your best bet Easy and beautiful location Definitely give it 
450922,Hotel Esther a, lobby is small , walking distance to everywhere anne frank house dam square red light district and even central station all within 10 20 minutes of walking 
450923,Hotel Esther a, Breakfast was a little pricey but proseco was on offer alongside the juices so can t complain , Sumptuous romantic rooms lit by chandeliers Tea coffee and cakes always available in the foyer Lovely little details even the bill was printed on decorated paper folded with care and sealed 
450924,Hotel Esther a, Some of the staff were a bit indifferent Having stayed the previous year at the Ambassade where every staff member that we encountered was warm considerate and conscientious without ever being obsequious the contrast was quite noticeable I also found the decor in the lobby and dining area to be a bit dark and garish again compared to the Ambassade but I know that s only a matter of taste , Location comfort general ambience Our room overlooked the canal and the view could not have been more splendid a genuine aesthetic pleasure The two very plump and very endearing cats that roamed in and out of the downstairs lobby rest area 
450925,Hotel Esther a, The ventilation in the room I was given at first was very noisy and coulnd t be switched off but the staff were extremely kind and helpful and I was given another room for the two following nights of my three night stay , As always the coziness and very comfortable atmosphere of the place the convenient location the friendliness of the staff
450926,Hotel Esther a, Quite expensive like almost everything in Amsterdam A security deposit check was made in my credit card when I booked the room It was also performed when I checked in the hotel For one night stay I felt it a little bit over secured , The hotel room was very clean It was very close to the city center although was quiet Free WiFi without extra charge Unfortunately I only stayed one night I would also choose this hotel for my next stay 
450927,Hotel Esther a, The hotel is really old The colors the atmosphere seems to be a little bit depressing , The location was really good and our room had a beautiful Singel view 
450928,Hotel Esther a, Some details missed at check in so that we ordered a collection of bar snacks rather than a meal for room service lack of an an onsite restaurant for dinner delays in service in the bar an item was left behind that we enquired about to collect on our way back through Amsterdam that was not followed up by the Hotel , The rooms we had were large beautifully decorated and very comfortable the lobby area and bar were beautiful to view
450929,Hotel Esther a, congested streets and road being blocked off kept us from getting very close on arrival fortunately taxi driver helped with luggage, excellent central location 
450930,Hotel Esther a, Room rate didnt include breakfast 18 per person was quite high for what was served at the open buffet 1st morning we took our breakfast at the hotel but 2nd and 3rd mornings we had our breakfast at a beautiful cafe around the corner which was twice delicious and half price of the hotel s breakfast , Interior decoration and the ambiance of the room was stunningly beautiful The lobby and the breakfast hall were so beautiful as well
450931,Hotel Esther a, I did have a problem getting into the hotel as I have a walking frame but the staff were very helpful, The decor also the avalibility to help yourself to drinks etc

450951,Hotel Esther a, The employees in general were not too polite To get in at the hotel you have stares wich means that its hard to carry your luggagge and a baby car without help There is no ramp for handicapped people the rooms are too noisy so you can hear everything from the room above yours There is no place to change the baby , The hotel is quite confortable in common areas and inside your room
450952,Hotel Esther a, I had a couple of things that I felt could have been better 1 The staff didn t have similar information on recommended tours and restaurants As in when the first check in attendant would recommend me a certain tour or restaurant and I would come back to the desk to make a reservation or buy the ticket there would be then another check in attendant who would contradict the recommendation previously given to me and would give me completely different recommendations This made it difficult for me to choose and decide as I was confused which recommendation was the most accurate It would be great if staff was trained and given similar type of information for tours and restaurant recommendations so they wouldn t contradict each other 2 I put up a no distrub sign as I didn t like my pillow cases changed everyday however on 1 of the days I came back and found my whole room cleaned and reorganized It was annoying as I had the sign up Also some not all of the staff at the check in desk spoke to each other in Dutch while helping me out even they had perfect English It made for an awkward atmosphere as it made me feel that I was being talked about I do have to note that the night staff wasn t like that and was very friendly and when I fell ill on one of the nights they were very helpful and tried to be accommodating , The hotel is beautiful inside with very nice decor and friendly staff 
450953,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, I loved the location which was within easy walking distance of Dam Square but away from the hubbub I loved their two gorgeous cats I also liked their complimentary coffee tea snacks

450992,Hotel Esther a, Pricey for a short stay Probably a good value if you stay long enough to take in all the sights and activities around the city center Bed was to soft for me , Beautiful hotel right in the heart of Amsterdam city center but away from the crowds Right on the canal surrounded by small shops and cafes

451012,Hotel Esther a, Why is it that the more expensive the hotel the more snooty the staff Staff were intimidating We were woken at night by furniture being dragged around in room above It was like they waited till 3 in the morning to redecorate the room No although this hotel is beautifully decorated it is not a relaxing stay , Great deco at reception tea and coffee available at reception 
451013,Hotel Esther a, We arrived on the first hot day of the year The air conditioning either didn t work properly or was inadequate We were given fans to help cool the room down but during the day housekeeping turned them off and opened the drapes to the hot sun , The hotel was charming and the staff very friendly helpful

451017,Hotel Esther a, Did not have bad experience but do recommend caution in avoiding hitting your head on the attractive beams in the sloped rooms of the upper floors , Hotel Estherea is a wonderful medium size hotel with a friendly and efficient staff very attractive and pretty rooms an excellent and substantial breakfast and a small fun bar for the end of the day The hotel is on a great canal the Singel and right near Spui Square which is a fun location in Amsterdam with restaurants and easy access to the tram This is an independent hotel owned by women whose family have owned improved and cared for the hotel for over 50 years and it shows in many ways 
451018,Hotel Esther a, When we checked in they told us there won t be a problem that if we stay another day but the next morning when we wanted to keep the room for the following day one guy at the reception told us that they are all full we had to find another place and this guy is been quite rude when we check out , The decorations of the room is quite different the dark wooden furniture makes it like the home instead of the hotel most of the staff at reception are very nice 
451019,Hotel Esther a,No Negative, The sumptuous hotel decor was the major attraction and with the service of the bar staff made this a memorable stay The position of the hotel along a canal made it easy for me to stroll to the museums and shops

451030,Hotel Esther a, The receptionist made me believe that it was cheaper to park the car in the hotel than in the street in front of the hotel This was clearly not the case and when I complaint about it staff got rather unfriendly and no one wanted to accept responsibility On top they made me walk all around the property to get to my car instead of passing through a door to the garage from where I also entered the hotel Last but not least the rooms are a lot smaller than they appear on the pictures , The hotel is well situated in the heart of Amsterdam s old city
