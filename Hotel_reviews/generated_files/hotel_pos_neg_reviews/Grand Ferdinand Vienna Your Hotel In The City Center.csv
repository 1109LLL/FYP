447536,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Only the location wich wasn t that great either, Horrible layout of rooms staf are not helpful and have zero comunication skills and condesending to muslims Never seen such staff This hotel deserive a 0 star with the horrible staf and room layout
447537,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Hotel just wasn t even close to the standard I expected from the price Waited 15 minutes trying to call room service to have water brought up Called reception and the girl said we don t have room service so you will have to go the restaurant and get it yourself not the hospitable answer for sure And hotel overall smelled funky Especially lobby area and elevators Had a really mediocre meal in the upstairs pricey restaurant and fortunately they removed it from the bill Beware that pool is tiny and cola with very limited seating area Design and price attempt to establish this hotel as high class but service and food says otherwise , Nice design style and overall pretty boutique hotel 
447538,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Extremely small room comfort of the room is last thing design is the first Having open wadrobe with 4 hangers for 4 nights is rediculous Shower glass door is facing the bed wich might be ok for some couples but the distance from the shower door to the bed your sleeping partner not more then 80 cm awkward uncomfortable wet floor when getting up wet phone on the table by the bed Asked for cotton pads one night house keeping forgot to refill received tissues not cotton pads And no cotton pads for four nights No hair conditioner provided in the room so if you might need it bring your own , Nice hotel great design nice location Breakfast is superb many choices Small swimming pool is a bonus on a hot August day 
447539,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Booked superior double room for extra space and got a small room lighting was poor and air conditioning did not work Staff and service was particularly poor The hotel has a pool on roof terrace which tempted us to book this hotel but the surrounding area only had enough room for around 8 to 10 people so would not recommend booking this hotel if looking for pool facility as insufficient for number of people in hotel We were looking forward to using the pool area but did not get the chance as no room Food and drink also very expensive , Cleanliness and comfy bed

447544,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, We were on our honeymoon and had asked to be picked up at the airport our flight was delayed and so we called to let them know the new arrival time but when we arrived there was no car and they said as the couldn t get in touch with the airport they didn t send a car We had also asked for a chilled bottle of champagne to be in the room and again this didn t happen When were at the pool we went to the bar to get drinks and were told not to worry someone would come over and take our order no one arrived so we went back to the bar and ordered These drinks did not arrive in the end we went back to bar and cancelled the drinks as by this point we had been in the pool for an hour , The location was fantastic the front desk staff were very friendly and helpful and the pool was incredible for a cold dip on those very hot days The rooftop bar was great for a quiet drink in the evening The rooms were lovely and comfortable

447557,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, I had two meals in the restaurants the chicken with morels and rice was disappointing It was cold in the middle although it was cooked through which suggests that it was precooked rather than being cooked to order Rice was easycook rice like bits of rubber I think this was what made me ill I suggest you go out to eat You ll probably get a better experience of Viennese food I was a single occupant of a double room which was very nice with separate toilet but shower was in the room closed in by glass blocks Very nice but not suitable unless you are a couple , Nice and clean and friendly efficient room staff Good security you need your key card to work the lift elevator Staff spoke English and were very helpful and polite

447578,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, I still think hair conditioner is a good idea as the hair and body gel makes the hair quite dry At checkout we were first charged EUR 15 for the minibar we didn t use The staff corrected this very fast and this caused no issues at all the situation itself however left a somewhat unpleasant final touch about the stay But again it was fixed very fast so it s not a major issue at all , This was my second stay at this hotel Location is perfect it s a 7 10 min nice walk through the Central park from the Mitte train station the station where the CAT train from the airport arrives Just as my first time reception staff was friendly and helpful The room was ready in the morning and it was spotless clean each day we stayed Double rooms have view to the Ring which is nice A special word needs to be said about restaurant on the 8th floor The breakfast in very high quality so is daily and evening menu The restaurant provides excellent views of Vienna

447585,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, The breakfast was pricey and the pool area is over sold it is very small and right next to the restaurant so it s not an area you would feel comfortable using , The hotel rooms are very comfortable with nice decor The top floor restaurant was a highlight with great food and fantastic views The champagne and goulash bar was also a lovely casual alternative

447601,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, The hotel room although comfort double does not correspond to 5 hotel room according to the commonly accepted standards such as the room square meters the bathroom square meters available amenities etc The room is so small that from the door you can directly go to the bed There is no desk a chair or even a little table simply because there is no space Even more can you imagine there is no wardrobe just 2 hangers on the wall what to hang on them first your coat or your suit And the other clothes in the suitcase The bathroom just a shower and you can hardly turn around If you have some extra pounds be aware The same is with the bed there is no normal path between the bed and the wall respectively between the bed and the window You should skin through aside Between the so called bathroom and the bed a small wash basin No bathroom amenities except a big bottle of liquid soap already used No slippers no bathrobe no body cream no hair shampoo or hair conditioner just nothing , Location is great Bed is comfortable but only the bed and nothing else 
447602,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, My wife s suitcase was stolen from the CAT train on the way back to Vienna airport along with lots of other people s The police said it was a daily occurrence but didn t have to staff to deal with the problem , Great city great hotel

447604,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, The range of drinks and the staff at the bar could have been much better , Centrally located well designed hotel with nice rooms and excellent restaurants 
447605,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, No space to put clothes in the room little hanging space and no drawers or shelves at all Very inconvenient Pool very disappointing misleading in marketing details Told there was no room service so we had to carry drinks to our room, Very good breakfast
447606,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Noisy Hotel cleaning staff sounded like they were walking down the corridors in lead shoes Also the room didn t have a wardrobe or tea coffee facilities which I would expect in most hotels especially one at this price , Rooms were comfortable clean and very stylish

447608,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, The bedrooms are quirky and would benefit from some drawers and coat hooks Also reception staff less reliable as despite a request for a car on New Year s Eve confirmed by email and when we arrived with room number and time no booking was made , We have had a lovely stay at Grand Ferdinand The highlight each day was breakfast on the roof terrace This is a sun filled conservatory with outside balcony The breakfast choice is amazing I would strongly recommend including this when booking this hotel The breakfast staff are delightful All in all for us a perfect choice of hotel to stay for New Year 
447609,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, The configuration of the room the shower being directly next to the bed The lighting was dark and you could not turn it up plus there were no seperate buttons for it The toilet was like a dog box No concierge plus no one to open the doors for you to the entrance of the hotel Lacked that 5 star hotel feel, The bed was comfy
447610,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Avoid all 02 rooms they have pipes that are permanently clogged and smell rotten The staff knows this but still gives these rooms to guests Don t expect any value for money here nor should you expect a sauna this hotel is big pretentious has a full sized stuffed horse in the lobby and churns through guests like a Hilton or Marriott A very solid meh for a hotel in an absolutely lovely city , Location couldn t be better 
447611,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Poor pipe lagging meant noisy night Partial carpet outside meant loud early morning with suitcases and high heels going by Wildly overpriced breakfast at the roof restaurant Minibar not checked thoroughly before we arrived so someone had drunk but not paid for the white wine No gym no lounge to relax in , Beautiful rooms newly decorated Very central pleasant staff 
447612,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Stylish yet slightly akward with storage space, Stylish rooms and cozy beds to die for Breakfast on a roof top is outstanding believe even more in spring and summer time Good location walking distance to all major sights

447618,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, We had problems with the lights in the room which we had to wait until the following morning to have repaired Given the lack of natural light and the decor even though it was very stylish it made it particularly dark in the room when trying to get ready , The bed was extra comfy which was needed after a long day of exploring the sites The food in the hotel for breakfast and dinner was delicious 
447619,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Couldn t find the stairs , Very helpful and friendly staff unusual room but good Just loved it Especially the horse in reception and the roof top bar and pool Would definitely recommend

447623,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Minor environmental concerns we would like to be given the option not to change towels every day Also some hooks to hang them from would be nice , Helpful and welcoming staff cosy elegant and relaxed atmosphere Good location not far from the heart of the old city and the CAT fast train to from airport and right next to the famous philharmonic Tasty room which strikes a good balance between modern elegant and comfortable Super comfortable bed

447693,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, The rooms are small which the designer has tried to offset by placing the shower and the wash basin assembly in the room itself rather than separately Only the toilet is separate There is a separate mini bar just for Champagne but no closet for clothes and not a single drawer for underwear etc Also not a single chair only a decorative horse carriage inspired in green leather bench that was rather uncomfortable The electric safe was out of order The lighting while artistic is illogically controlled making it difficult to say read and watch TV simultaneously , There is an equestrian theme running throughout the hotel from the full size stuffed horse in the lobby to the leather items in the room The breakfast buffet is high class and the service excellent 
447694,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center,No Negative, We arrived quite late but there were two options for dinner we chose the restaurant on the top of the hotel with amazing view of the city I also must mention that the restaurant prices were fully acceptable compared to the location The breakfast was really good wide selection of food The room was cosy and we had a great night s sleep 
447695,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, The shower room 619 was not working properly and would splash a little and the reason it was broken is because switching it on off was not easy the hotel could consider having some explanations This is a very minor point in an excellent stay ,No Positive

447721,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, No privacy in the bathroom I travelled with a friend and having no doors on the shower room was unusual and unnecessary No drawers or cupboard space nowhere to put clothes but on a couple of hooks and hangers Probably ok for a business person on a one day trip not for a longer five days in our case tourist stay Just awful No complimentary tea or coffee would be nice to have No twin beds staying with a person who is not a partner can be a challenge , Super location central for all we wanted to do Efficient staff Very nice rooftop spot for a drink 
447722,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Our shower was in the room next to the bed Kind of quirky but a bit impractical , The Grand Etage on the top floor is an excellent place to have breakfast or grab a meal in the evening 
447723,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Swimming pool looked a lot different on the web site so was disappointing when we actually got to see it We were thinking of having a morning dip before breakfast but upon arriving at the pool it was pretty much next to people eating their quiet breakfast , Location was excellent view from the top floor restaurant was great Like the design and decor of the hotel Staff were very friendly and helpful 
447724,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center,No Negative, We liked everything Great staff location the room was clean silent bed very comfortable very good location Next time will definitely stay there 
447725,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Design of the room Toilet lavobo and bath are located seperately Room is very small doesn t have wardrop Two sperate quilts in a double beds which are very small to cover one person , Location Breakfast Staff
447726,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Service the check in took too long We booked a suite and it was totally different from the photo on the web site It was much smaller and with totally no view While we were in the room some people stormed in without even knocking When they saw us they said somethings that the manager wanted to show some guests the suite Can t you think of calling and asking if we were comfortable with that Or at least knock and ask if you can come in The breakfast is poor The whole service is awful , Location is great
447727,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, The pool had tables around with people eating lunch so we felt too uncomfortable to go in , This hotel is like a home from home So clean and comfortable 
447728,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, To many this will seem trite My key criticism of this hotel is the lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the room whilst I recognise that such facilities are not a common European feature they do enhance a stay , Room was small but very well appointed and very tastefully decorated The shower was great and most importantly the bed was very comfortable Our interaction with the staff lead us to conclude that they were lovely and wanted to please their customer 
447729,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Nowhere to plug in music No wardrobe space Lighting was little dull , Fabulous decor and breakfast was splendid The setting of the bar on 8th floor is so beautiful Staff were always pleasant and helpful 
447730,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Room is not big and quite odd shower and sink are made as part of the main room not bathroom probably to make it look bigger then it really is , Great location clean comfortable

447732,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, breakfast too expensive for what s on offer, awesome location spacious luxurious rooms with comfy beds modern and stylish impressive Grand Etage with fantastic view
447733,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Very bad organization of work on the reception desk The receptionist not only made check in but also concierge and gave phone informations for Our experience a receptionist served an Italian guest about 15 minutes not only check in but also touristic guide and in the meantime took a phone call All check in procedure very complicated In restaurant a lot of mistakes in receipt , Location
447734,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center,No Negative, The location is very convenient that it s so near from the railway and the Wien Konzerthaus The environment of the hotel is fashion and cool The pillows and the quilt are both soft The reception staff is nice and helpful She helped me to call the police when she heard my backpack was stolen at the gas station on the way and she tried all her best to help me and solved my problems I m very grateful 
447735,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, 1 Charging 29Euro for breakfast is in my point of view too much For two people in 1st district you could not a breakfast but a hole dinner 2 The shower near the bed is in my point of view a bit strange solution, Everything was amazing The Bar upstairs is very nice with fantastic view 
447736,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Room is not spacious although it is very comfortable Street view room may be a bit noisy if window is opened , Absolutely new hotel friendly staff incredible restaurants perfect location for visiting Wien city center 
447737,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Few times asked for the iron desk and didn t get ones To the hotel management please to buy it enough , New hotel Location Original style Comfortable bad Breakfast on the 8th floor with a nice Vienna view 
447738,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Blinds do not block intence facade illumination from penetrating the room Shower within the room not isolated by a door results in room dampness Aircondition control does nothing the room remained too hot irrespective of control position No kettle in the room Haphazard collection of design items does not constitute a style , Location Having breakfast on the roof
447739,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, My room was located to the inner yard I assume the street view is much nicer but as I arrived late I didn t mind , A wonderful hotel well located with the most friendly staff I ever met in a hotel Lovely restaurant on the 8th floor nice terrace 
447740,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, bad treatment from staff not cleaning the room blaming it on our cat not nice stay at all and will never book this hotel any more i have travelled abroad and my wife 7 5 month pregnant wife stayed there and it was very unpleasant for her and when we asked the reception how many stars you have they said we have no stars and booking com mentions that they have 5 stars which is not right my wife had to ask them everyday to come and clean the room and the way they cleaned was awful and bed sheets were never changed only after 4 days of stay please try update the info of this hotel thank you, only good thing was location and food everything els was not nice at all 
447741,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, The room was hot and for some reason needed the airco to cool it down when it was 10 degrees outside The room is pretty small for two people if it was an extended stay The pool on the roof is for summer swimming only , The design is very cool The bed was heavenly The room felt homey and not sterile The rooms are simple but they have all the right stuff The breakfast on the roof is spectacular The location is right in the center of everything

447744,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, I did not like the design of the room bathroom facing the bed with glass door It was not attractive for me , Staffs were nice and the service was nice 
447745,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center,No Negative, Nice design and thats all about that hotel No room service food is so so fitness club is horrible Gym is situated on 1 floor which makes you feel trapped Only 4 train machines and nothing more Not even a water or towels available 
447746,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Rooms design decor may be not for everyone s taste and preference , the suites are gorgeous beds are very comfortable service is outstanding A nice addition to Vienna hotel scene Do try the food in the restaurant The staff is attentive and tries to satisfy even the most demanding requests 
447747,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, We stayed three nights our room get cleaned only once We stuck in the elevator for 10 min it was strange for a new hotel the rooms are very small and I found the design was not fancy , The location
447748,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Liked everything in the hotel but Reception and lobby area could do with some seating Would have preferred the shower to look out on to the wall instead of the bed, Hotel had ambiance and character the restaurant on the 8th floor had a fantastic view was comfortable with diverse seating Food and drink was brought to your table quickly and service was attentive Breakfast was good The restaurant downstairs had Austrian fare and was very tasty somewhat a little overpriced though Service was excellent Bedrooms were very comfortable and stylishly decorated Location is central close to the shops and restaurants all within walking distance Would definitely stay at the Grand Ferdinand again 
447749,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Very small rooms no place to put a laptop a sink in the room Reserved in twice as much money than the cost of the rooms Management had an idea that we ll drink all from the mini bar eat dinner and go away without paying Breakfast started at 6 30 but the bread was brought at 6 45 and there was no hot dishes ,No Positive
447750,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, There were no 5 amenities in rooms Small rooms for a 5 hotel Inexperienced staff in general especially in the rooftop bar and little attention to detail , Comfortable bed nice d cor great location 
447751,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, The room was good but there was no place to put the clothes No wardrobe no cabinets I thinks this was just too strange , Great location and very helpful staff 
447752,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, I didn t like the lighting in the room at all it hurts the eye No wardrobes in the room The sink is in the middle of the room not in the toilet The room is extra hot and they couldn t do anything about it so we had to sleep with window opened in february No brochures in the reception unlike all the hotels that i stayed in vienna But when i asked about it they got me from inside The reception team lack info about the programs in the opera so we couldn t take any recommendation Most of the rooms are facing an under construction building so it s noisy when u sleep with workers working from 3 am But we managed to move to a quieter room and the staff were very helpful The showers doesn t have a place to put the shampoo or soap or even the eyeglasses so u have to put in on the floor We ordered a coffee in the room so the room service said that we can prepare it gor u and u pick it up from downstairs How come a 5 stars hotel without a room service No conditioner or bar of soap in the room Shampoo and shower gel only , The location is very good the staff are super friendly and helpful the rooms are clean Both restaurant are with amazing views and super nice menus and yummy food Rooms are spacious

447754,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Just one thing The door of the shower is absolutely transparent If you are not in a honey moon mood it is a bit too much on the other side if you are it is perfect , Brand new hotel Smells very good I really don t like the smell of old Top location and top service Wonderful beds and bed linen Design very modern suppose some people will like it very much
447755,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Nothing, Everything Room location staff views large romantic candles lit thought the hotel everyday It was all wonderful and we d absolutely stay here again 
447756,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Layout of the room hotel design felt dark and sterile not personal enough for a boutique hotel lights in room are not intuitive overpriced and a bit pretentious no toiletries apart from soap dispenser in the room shower wasn t hot and cold, The design location and roof bar views 
447757,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, A bit poor restaurant menu but more than ok if not to go anywhere else , Amazing design and extremely friendly and helpful staff Location is very central with all major sightseeings on a walking distance 
447758,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Having taken note of comments on Trip advisor which complained that the rooms were very small and lack of cupboards for clothing we decided to upgrade to business class when we arrived However the room that we were taken to was very poorly arranged with the shower opening straight onto the bed no cupboard or wardrobes and looked out straight onto the building works taking place behind It was also appeared very cramped I rang reception to say I was surprised that the room was so small since we had upgraded to business class We had to wait over an hour till someone came back to us We were shown another business class room which had a much better arrangement of furniture shower and washing facilities Please note that the washbasin and shower are not separated off as implied in some websites which state that there is a bathroom There is not only the toilet is completely enclosed This room had a much pleasanter view so we went with it and it was fine for two nights as we were out most of the day However there was nowhere to lay out clothes only some hangers on protruding rails The other thing that could be improved was the lighting system If you turn off the light switch by your bed all the lights in your room go off so it is not possible for one person to read at night with just their own bedside lamp on There may be a way to arrange this but we experimented a bit with the light switches but could not work it out so left it These weren t major issues for us but I would expect a bit more from a hotel that is described as 5 star , We liked the d cor which was a modern urban style The beds were very comfortable There wasn t a lounge area in the lobby but there was a caf style area beside the ground floor dining room or a lounge area on the top floor where you could sit and read The staff were on the whole very helpful The entrance area was lit up with candles at night which looked very chic There was an open air pool on the top floor but it was quite small and the weather a bit too cold though I imagine quite nice to sit in in the summer 
447759,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Superior Room gloomy with view in ugly dark courtyard No wardrobe Breakfast mediocre at best service personnel not attentive and overstrained Limited tables for breakfast in the bel etage still very cramped Absolutely lousy value for money Better invest in a real 5 star hotel , Location comfortable bed
447760,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, dark small room with no closet and not even enough hooks to hang clothes No tea coffee facilities no curtains small shower no no No very depressing style of the room and very dull hotel itself with no character staff doesn t know anything room service and house keeping are useless same as the hotel s concierge was very disappointed with our stay, mattress and pillows 
447761,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center,No Negative, We had an absolutely wonderful stay at the Grand Ferdinand the hotel was beautiful and in a perfect location on the Ringstrasse Everything was brand new and we loved the interior design The staff were so helpful too they put an extra bed in the room for us stored our luggage let us check in early Loved the atmosphere the Christmas window decoration the view from the rooftop We also had a meal in the restaurant and the food was fantastic We ll definitely be going back 
447762,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, I asked to meet us at Vienna Central Railway Station personnel lied me in e mail message that they will arrange it but nobody met us Also on booking order bathroom been included in list but in reality too small room and personnel explain to me that hand wash basin is really bathroom Too expensive for such little room and service Definitely not the best price quality reference , Ideal location of the hotel and restaurant service 
447763,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, This hotel is not a 5 star hotel at all They have no kettle no english tv channels the water is hot and cold and not constant terrible when showering it goes from a nice temperature to piping hot and then cold Their was construction noise that woke me up early every morning apart from Saturday when the builders were off , The staff are friendly enough and the location is great 
447764,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, We didn t opt in for the breakfast so we tried it the first morning and while good was overpriced at 29 Euro a person We ate out at local places nearby from then on Although the view from the restaurant on the top floor is impressive , Excellent Service from the staff Stunning modern decor Extremely comfortable bed Rooms are quiet even those facing the street Ideal location in the heart of Vienna If ever my travels take me to Vienna again I will surely stay at The Grand Ferdinand
447765,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center,No Negative, Breakfast in the roof restaurant with the amazing view over the roof tops of Vienna Friendly helpful staff Excellent location in walking distance to CAT and all the main sights 
447766,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, This brand new hotel while in a 5 location is a 3 4 hotel It is like a nice clean holiday inn express among the ritz four seasons and st Regis Room was minuscule Shower is next to bed Literally you can get out of bed and step into the shower No privacy there The building is new and sterile No charm It s too bad You can see the top of the line touches and realize was spent but it is nowhere near the quality and luxury of a 5 hotel , The staff Everyone was so nice but I m afraid they won t stay long Too many people like us were checking out early and finding somewhere else 
447767,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, The room was bleak there were not enough bathroom amenities no hair conditioner no body cream and they could not provide them after request no bathrobe no shoe polish the room smelled strongly of new leather the shower was broken The lobby was under construction , The location is good 
447768,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center,No Negative, perfect location parking lots available outside in particular in the evening very clean and hyper friendly staff Breakfast on the roof top was different from the usual crowded breakfast halls 
447769,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, Claiming to be a five star and to have opened in the summer this hotel actually just opened with all the decoration smells There is not even a single chair or desk in the standard room and there is no space for them anyway Watch very carefully the staff have lots of rules to enforce on the guests and you may easily incur a charge of around 50 euro if you check out a little bit later than 12pm , Location is not bad some staff tried to be good
447770,Grand Ferdinand Vienna Your Hotel In The City Center, A minor gripe was I found the bed to be too firm for my liking like lying on a park bench But mattresses are so personal you ll never please everyone Major gripe was the glass shower opening direct into the bedroom I had taken my mother to Vienna for a long weekend and was sharing a room with her weird and awkward I would send her to sit in the toilet while I hastily showered I suspect all rooms are like this and while they may think it a design feature it s hugely impractical if you re sharing a room with someone other than your significant other Overall we agreed the hotel lacks soul and atmosphere In some small part that may be because it s new but the absence of interesting art on any wall no music playing softly in the foyer or rooftop bar and no flowers or anything green anywhere all makes for a somewhat stark environment This wouldn t solely deter me from staying of course but just interesting Also note they do have a rooftop bar bistro pool as well as downstairs restaurant they didn t us this at check in and no info in the room about facilities room service offering etc , Newly opened property as at early Oct so the interior including furnishings are all new and the staff were eager to please and certainly professional The food in the onsite restaurant Austrian Hungarian was also quite good the one night we chose to eat dinner in the hotel and the rooftop bar enclosed was a nice enough space perhaps a little more soul and it could be better Above all the location and proximity to the old town is terrific ten minutes walk gets you to most of the key attractions or points of interest and the central shopping areas There are also decent restaurants close by Our taxi from airport cost us 41 outside rush hour and taxi to Westbahnhof train station on departing was 12
