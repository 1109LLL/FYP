360832,Eurostars Ramblas, Expensive and rooms are quite narrow Noise from La Ramblas can be a problem for some , Very big and comfortable bed Short walk to the MRT on the La Ramblas Very helpful staff Huge bedroom

360834,Eurostars Ramblas, Room not cleaned in three days we were there breakfast very poorly managed everything kept running out cups plates water in coffee machine milk tea bags, Location perfect for restaurants and hop on hop off buses
360835,Eurostars Ramblas, Had a room at the rear of the building as thought this might a bit quieter during the night Unfortunately the back of the hotel backs onto a noisy square with children s play area an Irish Bar , Perfect location Excellent rooms with comfy beds 
360836,Eurostars Ramblas, The view from our room with a brick wall and air condition units , Lovely rooms fantastic air conditioning desk and chair really comfy bed with amazing soft crisp sheets lovely helpful staff and although directly on the Ramblas pretty quiet
360837,Eurostars Ramblas, TV channel should be of each area For example if I want to watch Asian Indian Pakistani channels I should have this option too , Location is good There s calm environment 
360838,Eurostars Ramblas, Shame there was no kettle in the room for british tourists who like a cup of tea every now and again , Very friendly staff location is really good if you want to be in the cente The hotel is clean and i can recomend staying here
360839,Eurostars Ramblas, It is a pity there isn t a lounge bar area for guests in the evening Hotel facilities are fairly basic in that sense Other than that an excellent hotel if you want to be close to the city centre and wish to explore Barcelona without costing you an arm and a leg , Beds were unbelievably comfy Great hotel if you need somewhere fairly central and comfortable to enjoy all the attractions that Barcelona has to offer 
360840,Eurostars Ramblas, No storage in rooms No wardrobes or drawers just a hanging rail Safe positioned on floor so difficult to access Need to ask for a kettle Nespresso coffee machine No hotel bar or other facilities just breakfast room , The beds were huge Great shower Continental breakfast Good wifi Drassanes metro station 1 minute walk 
360841,Eurostars Ramblas, Decor was a bit sparse impersonal but fine Did not like that there really wasn t much space on the edge of the basin in the bathroom for a female you need more space to put things down , Good sized bedroom for a double Liked that it was close walking distance to Metro and Gothic quarter Close to the sea port too also walking distance Liked that I could hang my washing in the shower spacious bathroom 
360842,Eurostars Ramblas,No Negative, The staff was very friendly and helpful The location could not of been better very clean And can not hear a single noise from the Main Street that you are on Great stay
360843,Eurostars Ramblas, Glass doors to the bathroom and only rain shower Too simple breakfast No slippers and bathrobe inacceptable for a 4 stars hotel , Great location with Rambla view Clean Large room 
360844,Eurostars Ramblas, I was disappointed the room didn t have any tea or coffee making facilities The room also lacked adequate storage for clothing and cases There was satellite TV in the room but unfortunately the only english speaking channel was BBC world news , The free wifi was fast and the bed was comfortable 
360845,Eurostars Ramblas, I did not like it is not value for money I would not recommend for a family to stay in the hotel as you will be pushed to stay in 2 rooms as I was Although it is 4 star hotel I did not find a kettle to have tea and had to ask from front office Breakfast is not as it should be in 4 star hotel Selection was poor I, I liked only location and friendly staff of the hotel 
360846,Eurostars Ramblas, The room was a bit small We didn t get hot water during 1 day because they got some problems with their provider but the manager was very professional and offered us a fair compensation , Perfect location verry nice and helpful staff Comfortable bed and very quite room despite the central location 
360847,Eurostars Ramblas, There was lots of noise outside our room because of people on the street meaning we didn t get a very good night s sleep There is triple glazing so no fault of the hotel We were on the 2nd floor perhaps if we had been on a higher floor it would have been less of an issue , The location was great The bed and room was very comfortable The staff was very helpful and friendly 
360848,Eurostars Ramblas, Breakfast was overpriced for what it had to offer which wasnt much better have breakfast at La boqueria market which we ended up doing , Friendly staff perfect location the bed is giant and so comfortable same goes for the shower bathroom Modern room love wooden floors and a little balcony which we enjoyed 
360849,Eurostars Ramblas, Our room was on first floor overlooking la rambla it was quite noisy late at night from revellers and then again early morning from the street cleaners, Reception staff were lovely and their help and advice was invaluable when I was unfortunately the victim of theft at a restaurant on our last night 
360850,Eurostars Ramblas, Just wasn t a bar in hotel but plenty of options just outside the hotel door , How convenient it was to port and main attractions Large clean very nice rooms 
360851,Eurostars Ramblas, Could have been tea and coffee facilities in the room The bathroom door was a little odd totally glass didn t appear to close properly minor detail , Good basic hotel no frills Excellent location for sight seeing Clean with excellent service from staff very helpful sincere 
360852,Eurostars Ramblas, The basic amenities that all hotel rooms have were lacking There was no closet dresser or nightstand One pillow per person on the bed and none were available when more were requested , The location was terrific 
360853,Eurostars Ramblas, Lack of wardrobe cupboard space 4 hangers on an open hanging rack beside the bed no drawer space or shelves for underwear and personal belongings etc so had to live out of our suitcase for our 4 days stay More wire coathangers were supplied on request Safe was on the floor underneath the hanging contraption meant that you had to lie down on the floor to get to it Massive comfy bed took up most of the floor space in the room One plastic chair provided so nowhere for 2 people to sit except on the bed Bathroom ok but shower had half of it missing no slider just the fitting where it should have been Quite a good breakfast on offer not included in room price but not cheap This hotel is definitely not Eurostars best but you are probably paying for location in Las Ramblas , Ideal location in Las Ramblas short walk to harbour Lots going on outside all the time so plenty of atmosphere 
360854,Eurostars Ramblas, Although the location is good in terms of accessibility it s horrible in terms of noise Because it s right in the middle of the square it is incredibly noisy because all night you can hear the people outside who are drunk and partying until minimum 5am It is incredibly loud and disruptive for travelers who are trying to rest for an early day start to explore the city Also the staff aren t very friendly They seem like they don t want to be there and that they re annoyed with the hotel guests whenever they re asked questions They also misinformed us that our breakfast was included in the booking We assumed it was a nice gesture because we were on our honeymoon so when they told us that we said thank you and had breakfast during our stay At checkout we were asked to pay extra for breakfast and when we explained we were told it was included the front desk staff said my colleague must have been confused And at that the breakfast wasn t very good limited selection always late and cold , The location was good in terms of accessibility to the Ramblas square and buses transportation for touristic trips 
360855,Eurostars Ramblas, I believe I wasn t given credit for the deposit made when previously When I return to USA I ll check my records and contact you, Location was very good staff was very attentive
360856,Eurostars Ramblas, Sometimes responses were slow to calls to the desk , The staff was so friendly and always ready to help The room was larger than I expected and the bed very comfortable 
360857,Eurostars Ramblas,No Negative, The location was great The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable The breakfast was very tasty and there was a wide variety to choose from The staff were very friendly well mannered and helpful Would definitely stay there again 
360858,Eurostars Ramblas, Pillow and linens smelled too bad Toilet shower and all areas were not clean enough Price comfort ratio is not satisfactory Staff is not happy to work there , Too close to Drassanes metro station Close to seaside 
360859,Eurostars Ramblas, No tea or coffee making faclities could have done with more towel but staff did assist after enquiry , Location and friendly of staff especially for front desk could not fault the help of all of the staff Room had excellent air conditioning after WIFI connectivity
360860,Eurostars Ramblas, I didnt like the bed No closet for clothes No engilsh channels, The location is great the end of la rambla Nice staff Nice smell of the rooms and bathroom The bathroom is big
360861,Eurostars Ramblas, It would have been nice to have a little outdoor space Rooftop terrace or courtyard But loved it and will definitely return , The breakfast was fantastic beautifully cooked pastries plenty of choice The room was spacious with everything you could need The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in and despite being on the Main Street it was so quiet and cool Also the staff were alwSys on hand to help out i would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona 
360862,Eurostars Ramblas, Small room which is perfect for a weekend break but not enough space for clothes for a longer stay , Fantastic location Exceptionally comfortable bed and great shower Very modern and clean 
360863,Eurostars Ramblas, Eurostars doesn t deliver what you order For the second time in this chain I ordered a double bed room and they reserved me a 2 single beds room When I asked them to change me to another room they said the hotel was full ,No Positive
360864,Eurostars Ramblas, perhaps more infomation given to us as guests of what to do in the local areas and opportunities we could take advantage of , The bed was hands down the best feature of this hotel it was huge and soo comfortable The location was perfect for us not far from the beach close to the square and right in the heart of the night life which we really appreciated the rooms were noise cancelling so no problem sleeping at night
360865,Eurostars Ramblas, Our room was on 3th floor facing inner yard There was however a bar which was really noisy at night early morning and there is quite poor soudproof in the hotelroom windows I had earplugs when I went to sleep , Really nice hotel and excellent location Friendly and helpful staff who gave just right information when you needed it Breakfast was really good and fresh Room was clean and just right size as you see in pictures Beds are comfortable and really good pillows Me and my friend had a great four days vacation in Barcelona Shopping sun food and drinks and happy people 
360866,Eurostars Ramblas, somewhere to sit and enjoy the sun we had to be out of the room for 12pm our flight want until 11pm that night it would have been nice to have somewhere to change and freshen up , Everything was modern and central staff are very pleasant 
360867,Eurostars Ramblas, Awful breakfast Only espresso Nespresso machine no option for capuccino Cold cuts did not look fresh chesse was stale Staying 4 nights and seeing exactly the same items every single day made us not hungry at all , Location great
360868,Eurostars Ramblas, Doesn t have a closet for the clothing, The hotel was in a very good location Walking distance for metro buses beaches historic center RESTAURANTES etc
360869,Eurostars Ramblas, Don t do the breakfast The room is underground and the hot food was cold, Great location Good shower Nice staff The rooms are well sound proofed and I slept well
360870,Eurostars Ramblas, Only a single rail to hang clothes no drawers or storage so we had to keep most of our clothes and other belongings in the case No facilities other than free wifi Hotel is supposed to be a 4 star hotel but due to lack of facilities we weren t so sure , Good location Decent sized clean rooms and bathroom 20 minute walk to the beach Lots of cafes and restaurants in the vicinity 
360871,Eurostars Ramblas, The bathroom door was frosted glass which was a little strange No counter space in the bathroom Because we stayed a Friday night the cost of all 3 nights Wed Fri was significantly increased Not a great value , The bed was great The AC was fantastic The shower was solid The location was great The wifi was the best we had in all of Spain 
360872,Eurostars Ramblas, Could have had a larger selection of food for breakfast however what was on offer was perfectly adequate , Our room was very well furnished The bed was superbly comfortable and very large 
360873,Eurostars Ramblas, Facilities were mediocre and minimal We asked for body shampoos but were delivered only one day Was not worth the money It was more a three star hotel than a four star one, Location was good Breakfast pastries were good
360874,Eurostars Ramblas, Dropped our bags in at 9 am and used toilets in the hotel they where filty and no hand driers or tissue to dry your hands there was a girl cleaning them as I left so I never reported it to reception We came back just after 12 to see what time our room would be ready and I used the toilet again and there was still no facilities to dry your hands when I mentioned this to the receptionist she told me they had to get paper towels from another hotel I could not believe it There is no bar or lobby to even sit and relax in while you wait for your room I asked her how they could be rated as a hotel and she made a comment about good lifts and things I don t know what things are because there is nothing else in the hotel A little so called restaurant in the basement beside the filty toilet anyway got to our room lasted about 10 minutes and had to leave smell of smoke in the room was unreal hairs on the bed shower was dirty I couldn t go on and on but I won t We had to leave and book another hotel for the night thank good for booking com So our 1 night in Barcelona cost us the price of 2 hotels and a bit of a nightmare However our 2nd hotel ROYAL Barcelona was lovely , Location
360875,Eurostars Ramblas, No English TV channels not even BBC or CCN The movies were already dubbed into Spanish but unlike some other hotels I have been at this hotel it could not be switched to the original English soundtrack I already sent an email to the hotel group to complain about this issue but so haven t had any response Probably never will either , Location could not be better Large room with comfortable bed Big bathroom
360876,Eurostars Ramblas, Paid for a view which was okay but window small , Excellent location and very clean comfortable room Didn t bother with breakfast as split for choice right outside the door 
360877,Eurostars Ramblas, Mattress too soft towels small rough and worn Given only one soap floor was filthy my feet were black on the bottoms no baggage table Breakfast was good and worth the 11 euro charge , Location
360878,Eurostars Ramblas, We didn t stay much in the hotel so we can t really judge the staff or the facilities , The location was perfect if you want to see the city mostly Its a short walk from everything But The beach is about 20 minutes away 
360879,Eurostars Ramblas, The rooms have no flat surfaces to put anything on i e Dressing table or hooks to hang things on It sounds strange not really a complaint , Good location modern and clean
360880,Eurostars Ramblas,No Negative, The location was very convenient to the Gotic section as well as the harbor We had a great view of Las Ramblas and the activities there Bed was the best we had on our trip 
360881,Eurostars Ramblas, The breakfast area is in 1 level so only artificial lighting and the room is also quite small, Great staff comfortable beds good wi fi speed and amazing location
360882,Eurostars Ramblas, The hotel has lost the 4 sheen Room furniture damaged and badly stained There was a stale dank smell from the bathroom The floor in the bathroom near the door and shower was badly stained and rusty There was a crack in the sink Apart from news channels there was no entertainment in English on the tv although most films were English dubbed into Spanish French or German We were totally unable to get answer on number 9 reception room service The towels were disgraceful hard thin and worn through not 4 quality quality, The bed was comfy and the location super The female receptionist who initially greeted us was very good 
360883,Eurostars Ramblas, No proper wardrobe or drawers Thus living out of suitcase Expected more for a 4 star hotel , Location on la rambla was perfect View up and down was great 
360884,Eurostars Ramblas, Breakfast was a little limited but more than enough for couple of nights stay , The location was spot on couldn t have wanted better for our stay on la ramblas The staff were friendly polite and helpful not that we needed any staying at this hotel Will definitely be returning to Barcelona and would be looking at staying here again 
360885,Eurostars Ramblas, Squeaky bed Asked for double got two singles Lack of storage no tea and coffee and no natural light in the room The sound proofing of the room was terrible and so we could hear the lift and reception coversations throughout the night and in the morning, Location was good definitely not four star facilities Staff were helpful
360886,Eurostars Ramblas, The food provided for breakfast should have a complete review and it should not be impossible for the staff to ensure it was always available The rooms did not have any covered storage space and it was not good having to live out of a case for a week The Hotel should be classified as a back packers hotel not a four star holiday accommodation A one night business hotel without facilities but not suited for evening or breakfast business meetings Not the place to stay for an enjoyable city holiday , Not a lot The rooms were serviced each day and any faults were corrected
360887,Eurostars Ramblas, We ate breakfast only one of the days we were there Young waiter was very helpful but rushed off his feet and it all seemed a bit hectic and not very relaxing , Location was excellent and we looked directly onto La Rambla but any noise was minimised due to double glazing Room was very modern and clean Would definately recommend this hotel 
360888,Eurostars Ramblas, Breakfast not worth the price Very little shelf space in Bathroom , Great location and staff very helpful Scale for weighing luggage in lobby very helpful but there was a charge of 1 Euro per bag Room while not spacious was very modern and nice 
360889,Eurostars Ramblas, We had to ask to have the room cleaned better if it was done as a matter of course , Absolutely marvelous location Staff were very helpful efficient Breakfast options were both plentiful varied 
360890,Eurostars Ramblas, There is not one drawer or shelf in the room for clothes etc You must live out of suitcase This was barely tolerable for three days but would not be for longer , The location was absolutely perfect Everything was right out front 
360891,Eurostars Ramblas, We didn t have breakfast as thought 12 Euro was a bit steep, The staff were extra friendly and helpful and the location rooms and Wi Fi were excellent
360892,Eurostars Ramblas, Safe at floor level but I new that before we went It is a little awkward for a 71year old to lie on the floor and set the code for the safe , My ratings reflect this hotel This was our second visit and we will be back the staff from cleaners to front desk are just perfect 
360893,Eurostars Ramblas, Could have had tea and coffee making facilities We were only there for three nights had it been longer the lack of drawers and wardrobe space may have been inconvenient , The hotel was clean the room was as you would expect the location was excellent the staff were exceptional with a special mention for Victor who could not have been more helpful 
360894,Eurostars Ramblas, No tea or coffee making facilities in the room, Brilliant location Rooms were comfortable and clean Staff friendly and helpful Breakfast plentiful with lots of choices 
360895,Eurostars Ramblas, Our hotel room had a faint smell of sewage which is common in Spanish hotels in my experience The view from the balcony overlooked the back of a building behind the hotel and the alleyway below a view of La Rambla would have been much better but I understand that not all rooms can have such a view After checking out by 12pm we had some time to wait before we had to go to the airport but there is no lounge area in the hotel just four armchairs in the reception area next to a sliding front door that opens and closes every few minutes because of people walking past , The hotel s location is excellent no more than a few minutes walk from Plaza Catalunya el barrio got c the marina and La Boqueria and a couple of hundred yards from Drassanes Metro station 
360896,Eurostars Ramblas, Torn linens room small bed was not comfortable sandpaper towels old and worn no place to unpack This is not a 4 star and the price was a complete rippoff , Location
360897,Eurostars Ramblas, Scrambled Eggs at breakfast were very dry But the rest of the food was delicious The only view we had was a brick wall , First time to Barcelona the Hotel was lovely in the heart of the city just the Ideal location 
360898,Eurostars Ramblas, the breakfast was not that good with Scandinavian measures the location is ok but the Rambla is very touristic I would not chose this location unless it was for the need of being close to WTC , the room was fine recommends it with view on la Rambla 
360899,Eurostars Ramblas, nothing, really spacious and contemporary furnished room overlooking las Ramblas comfortable and huge bed really very very professional staff They did the best for our needs
360900,Eurostars Ramblas, Kettle in the room would have been nice , Superb location fantastic room 5th floor looking onto the ramblas Lovely decor and clean place No complaints
360901,Eurostars Ramblas, The shower was an issue they are not as shown in the photos the flexible heads have now been removed and it is just a fixed overhead unit If we had known this we would have looked elsewhere , The hotel was right on the Rambla which was brilliant The staff were very very helpful in all respects 
360902,Eurostars Ramblas, The wifi was pretty poor and if you are a traveler in today s marketplace you expect a workable speed less than 2 mb This needs to be improved Breakfast was bare choice and I would suggest that you omit this from the investment and go out and enjoy a local eatery, Location was amazing and as listed if you want to be close to the action in LA RAMBLA then this ideal
360903,Eurostars Ramblas, Check in staff is not very friendly and very rigid regarding check in times I stayed twice in two weeks and my rooms were pretty noisy from outside sources Safe location is horrible , The location is good right on La Rambla It is convenient to get to the port and many restaurants are nearby 
360904,Eurostars Ramblas, Nothing I loved every second of it and will definitely be back , Staff were friendly Location was fantastic great value for money absolutely spotless lovely views 
360905,Eurostars Ramblas, Glass walls in the bathroom and no wardrobe, Design comfort excellent soundproofing and the main place on the one hand the port the other center of the city all in accessibility
360906,Eurostars Ramblas, The facilities were so poor such as TV and gardrobe The hotel s cost was too expensive with these poor facilities and the intresting thing was that the hotel didnot has breakfast it was owful, Be in Ramblas street 
360907,Eurostars Ramblas, The room had a lot of large scuff marks which gave the impression the room wasn t clean which wasn t a good first impression when you think you are going to a 4 hotel , Location Staff were helpful
360908,Eurostars Ramblas, Every thing was perfect But the wifi is to weak that s it , All the hotel staff was really nice and kind to us helped us in everything that we needed 
360909,Eurostars Ramblas, The receptionist staff who did the check in was not clear and honest on the timings and was with bad attitude The rooms were not daily properly cleaned and they do always forget to keep drinking water inside the room after the cleaning , The location of the hotel is great
360910,Eurostars Ramblas, We didn t have Wifi in 4 days We aren t happy with staff they couldn t find a solution for us , The location and also the rooms were confortable
360911,Eurostars Ramblas, Customer satisfaction is less important than hotel revenue Service personal could be more helpful about customer comfort and wishes I ordered double bed via booking but they were not provide our wishes I asked question by booking com they didnt answer etc , Best thing is location of the hotel You can access everywhere in a minute 
360912,Eurostars Ramblas, Unsafe Automatic clear glass doors are opening while it is visible from the outside that there is no staff at the ground floor No security at entrance and no light outside only inside so good visibility for robbers and terrorists No security at all Young staff friendly but with no local knowledge training or education No parking and no assistance with luggage No hand shower in the douche only rain shower Loud television during breakfast in a cellar Personal not willing to shut off the television even if you are the only clients Staff want priority in the breakfast area in the elevator and also when cleaning your room Personal is demanding respect without offering any service to clients , Large room and location 
360913,Eurostars Ramblas, The room is small no cabinet no kettle bed is not comfortable However i booked the best room in the hotel I will summarize that this hotel is not 4 stars hotel , The location
360914,Eurostars Ramblas, The bathroom although very pleasant was very much part of the hotel room rather than a separate room and it felt rather awkward as it was not sound proof it was translucent and didn t have a lock , The hotel was located in a brilliant area and the staff were really helpful 
360915,Eurostars Ramblas, No closet cupboard for clothes but they have an open movable cupboard but it didn t fit all our clothes, The location is fantastic facing the Rambla street directly stuff is so helpful and flexible and the room was quiet and very comfortable I ll go for it when I go again
360916,Eurostars Ramblas, small hotel not 4 stars breakfast alittle bit of everything location in the ramblas but at the end of the street, location although it is at the end of the street you need to walk 15 min to go to the center of the ramblas 3 min walking to train station nice room
360917,Eurostars Ramblas, Room service food was bad Make sure you don t wear shoes in the room as you will get complains Stuff was kind Overall u did not enjoyed it at all ,No Positive
360918,Eurostars Ramblas, The noise in the evening also with the closed windows was loud The view wasn t so nice in front of a Garage entrance , The location of the hotel was good Directly on Rambla
360919,Eurostars Ramblas, no coffee or tea in room not a four star rating standard on your knees for the safe box can be noisy at night from residential area behind the hotel , central location good bed no noise neighbours clean room and bath area open cupboard for clothes paid underground parking very near to hotel every day clean towels
360920,Eurostars Ramblas, The lift was a bit slow but it is a small hotel so there is no need for multiple lifts , The location was superb right on the Ramblas The staff at the hotel displayed a can do attitude to all questions and were always cheerful 
360921,Eurostars Ramblas, There weren t any alcoholic drinks nor nuts chocolates in the mini bar Just a few beverages , Very central Friendly staff Wonderful breakfast especially the coffee was the best we had in any hotel in Europe Comfy bed Spacious clean bathroom Because of good isolation the room was really quiet eventhough it overlooked La Rambla 
360922,Eurostars Ramblas,No Negative, Perfectly located on the Ramblas close to the harbour close to the subway The windows are perfectly islolated so that you won t hear much noise from the crowded street Take a room with view and balcony from which you can soak in the Ramblas freeling Very friendly staff 
360923,Eurostars Ramblas,No Negative, No service at all i was very sick i wanted a cup of tea thier was no service and no boiler in the room no resturant nothing the staff was very rood and untrained
360924,Eurostars Ramblas, Room very dirty The hotel smell like garbage Expensive for no reason bad service their wifi does not work and very slow You hardly can check your email , Nothing except the location
360925,Eurostars Ramblas, Poor wifi was constantly frustrating and disappointing for the price we paid We would choose another property for this reason alone even though the hotel was otherwise good , Great beds location good shower reasonably spacious room balcony overlooking La Rambla access to metro 
360926,Eurostars Ramblas, Beds are not too comfortable a bit tired off but big price could be lower , Great location both on Ramblas and near the Marina area elegantly designed nice clean rooms wifi in the room We liked it 
360927,Eurostars Ramblas, Wifi is terrible in room and lobby for those people who need to check their emails or googling with hotel wifi it is not easily Possible , Location was great You can easily access to anywhere 
360928,Eurostars Ramblas, Wifi was a bit slow No tea coffee facilities in the room Only one English TV channel However in all fairness the tv and tea coffee issue seems to be the common standard across Spain , Location was in the heart of La Ramblas Close to metro station Comfortable room
360929,Eurostars Ramblas, The condition of the room is APPALLING Design of bathroom terrible So uncomfortable to be in the room The walls were marked Shelf in bathroom falling apart and no where comfortable to put toileletries for two people not even for one no drawers or shelves to put cloths Hardly any room to move What a shame as it really spoiled the good standards of other Eurostars hotels we stayed at The breakfast was so poor and non tasty I have never tasted such bad scrambled eggs in my life , staff were very helpful and spoke good English They helped when required
