49081,La Tremoille Paris, For the price they charge the room didn t include basic facilities like tea and coffee bags that most travellers would expect One of the taps in the bathroom was leaking At one occasion the room cleaning staff tried to open the room for cleaning the room without even knocking to ensure there was no one inside and that too at 9am , Location 
49082,La Tremoille Paris, I liked everything about the property however it wouldn t be somewhere you could stay every time you visited Paris due to the price Well worth it for us and our special trip though , The staff were so accommodating and the property was gorgeous like something from a movie The rooms were a good size and the location was fantastic Easy walk to the Eiffel Tower Perfect for us 
49083,La Tremoille Paris, 15 Euro for a bowl of fruit was excessive but it was 2 am and we were starving from traveling all day The fruit was fresh and delicious however and we worked our way through it all week Very little complaints , The staff was amazing Opened every door greeted us with umbrellas when getting out of our taxi prompt laundry room service I have only good things to say about this hotel I would absolutely stay there again 
49084,La Tremoille Paris, Price quoted in NZ dollars wS a lot less than equivalent in Euro I was shocked I had booked it with NZ dollars and expected the price per room to be about 400 Nz dollars but I paid more than 800 Euros for two nights makes no sense For this reason I don t think I will book ever again with booking com unless it s prepaid ,No Positive
49085,La Tremoille Paris, There were no tea coffee making facilities in the room, The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly The location is excellent The bar lounge area is welcoming and relaxed providing excellent drinks and food The bed was very comfortable 
49086,La Tremoille Paris, i asked a reservation for a dinner party for nye and they make a reservation for a 3 star michellin restaurant with bed food and no party 4 thousand euros with out drinks I think they get a comition with this kind of reservation, location
