308515,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, The construction and refurbishement going on to the restaurant and the noise and vibrations, The hotel restaurant was under construction During the day this was noisey and disruptive
308516,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Nothing, The location literally could not be better The hotel is clean and modern My room was really spotless and the bed super comfy It was also a really good size for a single room and included a lovely big bath The staff are wonderful as well very friendly and professional 
308517,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, I realise that it is difficult but dealing with the mould on the tile grouting in the bathroom would be of benefit to the apperance , Staff were amazing very helpful and friendly
308518,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Very bad value for money 3 stars hotel not 4 as claimed Tiny room Massive reconstruction downstairs and noise And not a single warning about that reconstruction at the hotel page , Clean Close to railway station and not far from the canals
308519,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Building works meant no foyer or bar restaurant available Only one lift for whole hotel Had to have expensive breakfast in another hotel We asked for a double bed and got twin beds The extra pillow in the cupboard was stained We asked for extra pillows which never arrived The bathroom light didn t work The room was very small and at 329 per night very poor value for money We ve paid much less for vastly superior 5star hotels , Friendly staff and good location
308520,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Construction work was going on which we were not informed about before booking Room did not have the greatest view but was quiet otherwise , Location is super central and very close to main train station 
308521,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, there was no mention of renovations on the hotel restaurant which meant very loud noise and vibrations in our room We had booked this as our last hotel and wanted something relaxing and indulgent but we were unable to sleep and had to leave the room during the day Also the room is very tiny and doesn t look at all like the size in the photos And obviously no room service or breakfast available,No Positive
308522,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, No information that the hotel restaurant is under construction means no breakfast in the hotel only in the hotel next door no possibility to eat or drink in the evening only outside ,No Positive
308523,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, the decor was dated conversations between rooms can be heard easily the wifi would partially work in the rooms there was a pungent odor from the bathroom or exterior , the location is excellent the customer service was friendly and very helpful 
308524,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, The Hotel is currently under construction re modelling If i had known this before booking i wouldn t have booked Drilling every morning that vibrated throughout the whole hotel from 9am onwards Very small and basic rooms so small that the bathroom door doesn t fully open because of the bed Definitely not worth 210 per night No bar or restaurant as it s under construction Feel this hotel ruined our trip I m sure there s better hotels in this city for the money This defiantly isn t a 4 star hotel , Good location on Dam square everything in walking distance Clean and staff are friendly 
308525,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, unfriendly staff dirty rooms rude treatment trying to make more money than 300 Euros that I paid for a half single bed per night knocking my door every morning 9 am to make the room and wake me up knowing at my door in the middle of the night saying im smoking when I ddnt even have cigarettes with me Noise all day since early morning from construction restoration of their restaurant,No Positive
308526,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, I really do not have anything negative to say The staff bent over backwards to accommodate us It was worth the money and would definitely stay there again , The front desk staff was welcoming and very helpful The restaurant was closed for renovation The hotel was centrally located We could not have picked a better choice 
308527,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, We had a window to the alley and it was quite noisy from time to time The restaurant was beeing renovated and therefore not in use Did not really bother us but if you are a light sleeper and want to have breakfast at the hotel , Super friendly staff top location 
308528,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, The restaurant was being renovated while I was there and you had to use the one at the hotel a few doors away Also there seemed to be a carnival that went until late in Dam Square and this made it quite noisy at night , The hotel is centrally located and within close proximity of many shops restaurants and historic venues in the central business district The front desk staff were polite professional and went way above and beyond in responding to questions and helping me to find my way around My room which faced the main street was bright and clean 
308529,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw,No Negative, The staff were all faultless and so friendly and helpful it was like staying at a family run hotel They easily arranged taxis and booked restaurants or gave advice on where to go Rooms were basic but clean with incredibly comfortable beds Perfect location and would stay there again or recommend to friends 
308530,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, The room was very noisy sound of lift machinery all night Rooms quite small and bathroom tiny and not very well laid out but I suspect this is par for the course in Amsterdam , Excellent location and staff very nice Excellent coffee machine in the lobby 
308531,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Bigger towels Service the lift property Breakfast would be a good start, Very clean but spartan budget room Very very small towels Very slow lift Good security Great wi fi connection Good free coffee No breakfast Quiet room considering it s in dam square
308532,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Serious construction was being done at the front of hotel rooms shouldn t have been given out as there banging made it impossible to rest this information should have been given out before , Great location
308533,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, The elevator was slow The floor was n my room seemed so never The floors were bare and seemed uneven Not sure why , The staff was very helpful It was at a good location 
308534,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Price I paid a total accommodation only 370 including all taxes For two nights yes two nights only in a room not more than 6 msq The hotel was having some constructions on the other half of it with some drill sounds in he morning not on the weekend But if I come to Amsterdam again will compare the price with other hotels if price still the same I will take the same small room again , So the hotel is really small and hidden but location is just perfect In front of tram stations close to it and at the fork where you can chose your destination I didn t try their food as their restaurant was closed for renovation Rooms were very clean more than just clean I got the smallest room ever you can imagine single size bed but it was like a gift box clean and cozy space was not an issue for me as a solo traveler 
308535,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw,No Negative, Excellent location about 10 m from Dam Square the room was small but clean and confortable and had individual temperature controll what was great the staff was very kind and helpfull I strongly recommend it
308536,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, The room was dusty especially on top of the units If I had known about the front of the hotel restaurant being totally renovated then I would not have booked it , Friendly and helpful reception staff who tried hard despite the renovations going on 
308537,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, It was not stated when booking on the Non Refundable web site that the resteraunt was closed for renovationthe Rooms were the smallest I have been in in the last 40 years of business travel size wise very poor Bed excellent, The Hotel reception were extreamely helpful friendly and spoke excellent English they were 5 
308538,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, The restaurant and reception were being renovated which we weren t informed about before we booked or travelled , Superior room was very comfortable quiet and clean 
308539,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, I apsolutely didn t like the fact we didn t get an email to tell us the hotel lobby and dining area was being refurbished It was my partners birthday on our last morning there and I wanted to treat him to a breakfast in the hotel Disappointing I m afraid In my opinion and also other guests that I heard comments from this was a major inconvenience and one that was unexpected warrants compensation, Warm and cosy Excellent location
308540,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw,No Negative, I ve never had the chance to go to the hotel because of the new years bombing in istanbul And i was almost going to cancel it but they were so welcoming and they told me i can visit the hotel whenever suits me They also said noone should go through what we are going through in istanbul I respect how much they see everyone as equal humen Which is a lot more important than the comfort of the bed or the taste of the food or even the hygiene Because it is the hygiene of a heart So i checked everything with a point of perfect Because it is important to be a human At the end i ve never had the chance to visit the hotel because of another crisis in istanbul But oh well i will come and see you guys and thank you in person

308544,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw,No Negative, Room was small but adequate for our needs Modern and clean room Bed was comfortable slept well although there was some noise coming from the corridor Location of the hotel in the very centre of the city was perfect 
308545,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Rooms are not soundproof I can literally hear all the footsteps and conversations of people passing through the hallway But we can let it pass we ll stay here again if ever we ll be back in Amsterdam , Helpful and welcoming staff They got you covered and will assist you in everything from check in to check out Location is superb as you are literally near everywhere main train station dam square Madame Tussaud Red Light district etc Starbucks McDonalds KFC and convenience store are your neighbors 
308546,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Bathroom smells like sewage it s too small and the towels doesn t look fresh The mattress is terrible too old and it seems like it hasn t been changed since the opening , Location Staff
308547,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, The hotel did not fulfill their reservation for a standard twin room and instead put me in a very small single room on the top floor The view was a brick wall And they said Well it s already paid and the room difference is only 20 per night The Hilton has better rooms and similar rates for a slightly longer walk The hotel does not have bike rental deals with Black Bike the biggest in Centraal and no racks for guests Though there is great bike parking across the street The restaurant has good food but my steak and potatoes was not worth 27 and I left with 80 for one person of which 35 was liquor , The hotel is on the main road Damrak leading from the train station and is within 100m of the palace square It s a great place to take a walking tour of Amsterdaam center

308551,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Small rooms room furniture is nothing like a hotel you can hear everything inside the room like the elevator the room above the ac made a really loud noise poor furniture the toilet felt like a dorm toilet they do fire alarms which sets off every room on the floor I have been to three starts that have better rooms , The hotels location
308552,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, A mirror over the vanity The room was nice and clean The staff was very nice and the restaurant was great , The breakfast was good The bed was hard The lights were confusing It would be nice to have a mirror over the desk to use as a vanity

308555,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, A little bit noisy but it is in the town centre, Nice breakfast plenty to eat very close to Dam Square and all the facilities and attractions the tram from central station stops directly outside the hotel
308556,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Only down side was ironing room on 3 Floor I would rather iron in my room than going to another floor to do ironing in a 2 sqm room , Everything was great 
308557,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, The rooms are extremely small There is only one small and slow elevator Some of the staff are not friendly at all The wifi is very bad, The location is amazing one of the best in amsterdam The rooms are very clean
308558,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, I thought the price was rather steep , The staff were all friendly helpful and professional They also had great senses of humor and good advice re places to see nice restaurants etc The superb restaurant accessible from the lobby serves a fantastic breakfast buffet in addition to lunch and dinner Be careful walking out of the front door you might get mowed down by the crowds coming from the train station just down the street The hotel is in the city centre Due to its location you should expect sirens early morning revelers singing in the streets and lots of people from all over the world all day every day The hotel staff does a good job of keeping problems away from the hotel not that Amsterdam is all that problematic 
308559,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, The room and the bathroom were too small for what is expected to be in 4 stars hotel for that price , The location is fantastic the staff was really nice and helpful 
308560,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, My single room was tiny I hate those air conditioner units They either over heat or freeze one and are noisy in a bedroom , The location was perfect for me to visit museums and galleries I noticed great attention by staff to security This was particularly reassuring to me as a solo traveller Staff were excellent efficient and friendly I have stayed before and will stay again Excellent location secure clean basic accommodation 
308561,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Breakfast distinctly average Room ok but bathroom tiny Can hear doors opening and closing of other rooms Hotel rated as 4star which I think is stretching it a bit More like 3 star Would not have paid full listed price Can t complain though as I got a good discount for booking last minute , Location just off Dam Square Couldn t be better Also close by to great choice of restaurants Dept store right across the street for shopaholics and tram stop right outside front door
308562,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Room was very small and a bit basic for a 4 It was clean and comfortable enough for a short stay The restaurant is excellent but a little pricey especially for breakfast , Location was ideal for everything Easy to get to bus tram outside and station short walk 
308563,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw,No Negative, The staff are excellent nothing is too much trouble even when I chose to upgrade rooms half way through my stay The hotel is beautiful very spacious and spotless I would definitely stay here again and I would be more than happy to recommend this as the place to stay while in Amsterdam 
308564,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, The shower screen in the bathroom wasn t big enough resulting in the bathroom getting soaked each time we had a shower Very minor issue , The hotel staff were brilliant they couldn t do enough for us The room was really well designed and massive The location was spot on right in the heart of things and close to all the best restaurants 
308565,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Nothing , Near to everything perfect for families with kids too or only ladies secure elevator u can walk near by at 2am street wont be empty really recommend alot of hotels near by but I think this was one of the best Min to the dam square 5 mins walk to red light Macdonald Starbucks supermarket just next to u body museum madame tussaude next to u Heineken and flower Market 15 to 20 mins walk Big list of recommendation
308566,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, As it is central it is quite noisy both in terms of external noise and if the person upstairs makes some noise , Clean rooms friendly staff and nice restaurant Very central to visit everywhere 
308567,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, We elected to have a breakfast the first day and in our opinion it was not worth the the money We have been in the hotel trade for 40years and would not have served scrambled eggs that were cold and insipid ,No Positive
308568,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, The price was higher than I would have expected for this kind of hotel but it was a busy time and for a work convention so it was market rates , The location and accommodation was great 
308569,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Our room was around the back facing a tiny courtyard type thing so it meant the room was quite dark wasn t an issue obviously had lights in our room still absolutely LOVED the place , We were worried our room would be quite small but our room on the 1st floor was huge and location was ideal all staff were extremely polite Rooms made up each day fresh towels each day can not fault the service at all would even say it was more like 5 service than 4 Made our holiday in Amsterdam what it was and we will definitely return when we are next back Hopefully get around to trying the restaurant in the hotel looked lovely Value for money definitely worth the extra pennies to stay here They allowed us to keep our bags there while waiting a few hours before our flight to go home and when we arrived we were 6 hours early for check in dropped in to leave our bags and our room happened to be ready so got straight in so that was a huge plus after being awake since 3am that morning needed a snooze 
308570,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, The shower was crazy tiny and whatever you did the bathroom got flooded , The room was very comfortable linen was lovely floor was a bit cold could have had mats 
308571,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, We had a room with a small window to the roof But was good , The hotel is in the middle of the city and next to everything nice restaurant downstairs people who works there were very welcoming and polite only one he was rude I don t remember the name They gave us a room with bathtub 
308572,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Building work on a shop at the back of the hotel at 7am but wasn t the hotels fault but it just discrupted us how early it was , Throughly enjoyed my stay with my partner service was amazing and the location was so central for walking distance and also tram service 
308573,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, There is no parking in the hotel only a public parking with 4 minutes walking in front of the hotel, Location Location and Location Also the staff was so friendly
308574,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, The wifi was horrible The room a little bit small and without any natural light , The location as well as the breakfast were quite perfect Most of the people there were very nice 
308575,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Bedrooms far smaller than I would have thought from website or other reviews Tiny bed in cramped room Bedroom was also very cold had to ask for extra blankets Did not think this sized room and bed were value for money, Excellent location walking distance of everything Very clean hotel and staff all very friendly and helpful 
308576,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, One particular staff at the reception lady maybe a supervisor I m not sure Definitely not Claudia or another younger lady This particular lady most probably in early or late 30s She commented that I could not bring any food to the lobby So I told her that the food is to be brought up to the room She made some gestures with her hand faces like talking to a little kid which I think is unnecessary We were guests paid in advance of the hotel not school kid staying in a hostel , 1 Location tram stop in front of the hotel 2 View from the room 3 Comfort of the bed pillow mattress
308577,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Walls are a little thin could faintly hear the guy next door snoring , Located right in the middle of the city near Dam square Great value for money

308582,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Paid a high price for a tiny room off a narrow corridor The thin walls meant I could hear the doors of other rooms constantly slamming shut which was extremely annoying City tax is added separately and the actual price you end up paying to the hotel in euros once the exchange rate is factored in is much higher than the price originally quoted in sterling on booking com Having stayed at the hotel a number of times in the past it would have been a nice gesture to be better looked after , Clean room Hotel is in a good location 
308583,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Room and en suite shower very small but well equipped Room not great value for money , Excellent location Pleasant restaurant friendly service and good food Ideal for solo traveller 
308584,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Floors in corridors make noise and made of wood , Location is perfect in the moddle of everything Close to shopping area and night life Our room was very quiet and staff are helpful and friendly 
308585,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, Noisy I had a quiet room on a back alley and even that was noisy It is in a very busy noisy area of town Plus there was a fair on the square while I was there And to top it off a staff member mistakenly called my room at 6 15 am Rooms are very small Awful lighting in the bathroom I would not normally notice this detail but it was really very hard to see , Clean rooms central location 
308586,Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw, We stayed in this hotel for four nights It seems that the standard rooms are not standard For the first night the room we stayed was really small no space to move around after putting a luggage on the floor The worse is the fact that the only window is facing a back staircase However we raised our queries why the photos shown in the website were different to reality we were then accommodated to another room for the rest of the stay Besides the toilet is very small with a little shower area The floor is wet after showering , The location is perfect for visiting Amsterdam Most of the tourist spots are within walking distance Restaurants and shops are just downstairs Staff are responsive to queries as well
