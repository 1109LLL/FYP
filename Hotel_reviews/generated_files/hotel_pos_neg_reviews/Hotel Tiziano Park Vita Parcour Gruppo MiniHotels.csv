492467,Hotel Tiziano Park Vita Parcour Gruppo MiniHotels, I noticed a lot of small ants in the room , My experience with the hotel was average I liked the secure parking they provided breakfast was ok and rooms were clean 
492468,Hotel Tiziano Park Vita Parcour Gruppo MiniHotels, No room service for late travellers like me and the breakfast slots very also not flexible The young gentleman behind the counter was not helpful and not friendly , the room was spacious and clean although very basic 
492469,Hotel Tiziano Park Vita Parcour Gruppo MiniHotels,No Negative, Nice hotel in a silent part of the city with easy access to metro Breakfast was good Air conditioner was in excellent condition silent and effective The room was a bit smaller than I expected but was clean and comfortable In general this is a good choice for short city visits 
492470,Hotel Tiziano Park Vita Parcour Gruppo MiniHotels, I can hear everything the people in my next door were saying or maybe they were just really loud Thank god it was in Italian which I don t understand, Clean Good value Good breakfast Good location
492471,Hotel Tiziano Park Vita Parcour Gruppo MiniHotels, The room was extremely cold We tried to work the heat in the room but it didn t work But since we didn t stay in the room that much we didn t take the time to talk to the front desk about it The receptionists were ok not very excited about helping very short in answers when questions were asked I m sorry to say but the breakfast was definitely not good I mean for a 4 star hotel the breakfast really was a joke There were no vegetables not a big range of bread the eggs were horrible the bacon was not made properly The girls working there and one guy were very nice though The location of the hotel is a little bit off , All in all it was a ok hotel With that said it was not worth the price tag I understand that Milan is a expensive city but I would expect more from a 4 star hotel 
492472,Hotel Tiziano Park Vita Parcour Gruppo MiniHotels, Small rooms small beds modest breakfast , Great location Few steps from subway 10 15 min by subway to Duomo Quiet green and good district with calm atmosphere and plenty places to eat Wonderful park view from hotel s public areas
