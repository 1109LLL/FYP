263954,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Room was positioned close to Lift shaft so the fire door created a vacuum in the corridor rattling our bedroom door , Really comfy beds lots of toiletries provided
263955,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Nothing everything perfect, Comfy beds and air conditioning that actually works Cannot fault this hotel staff were friendly and helpful They went out of their way to make myself and my niece comfortable Excellent location and would definitely stay again 
263956,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We were woken at 8 30am on a Saturday morning to ask when we would be checking out check out time was 11am We were then disturbed again at 9 30am to see if we were still in the room When we mentioned this at checkout we were told we should have used the Do Not Disturb switch in the room I think this happens because you can check out by app whenever you like so they do not know who is still in the hotel , Comfy bed
263957,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The first room we saw was spacious and well equipped but had a damp smell On opening the windows for fresh air the traffic noise was very loud The second room was fresh clean quiet away from the street but was small ideal for a single traveller But it was fine shower room was clean if tiny and we slept very well , Very comfortable bed room was very quiet away from traffic noise Room had a hairdryer safe iron and ironing board kettle and tea coffee Bedside had a double socket above the bedside table with two USB ports as well Tiny shower room had excellent mirror and shaving mirror heated towel rail and fluffy towels Interesting independent shops restaurants and pubs nearby 
263958,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Dealing badly by reception staff Room service is not available after 5 00 they didn t provide a taxi to transport to the airport as requested where I requested to provide a private taxi from the hotel and accepting credit card this was embarrassing with the taxi driver The rooms were not provided with the same booking specifications and the receptionist said that this was based on availability The rooms and bathrooms are very narrow, The rooms are clean and the breakfast is good The location is great and easy access to Oxford Street
263959,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, Whilst having a horrible experience at the initial London booked hotel Holiday Inn Bloomsbury I needed to change hotels and found the Radisson Blue online What a pleasure it turned out to be made all the more enjoyable by across the board great staff especially Bettina Pedro and Mohamed completely to be recommended It was great value for money at an excellent location 
263960,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The single room was very small but fitted out so well and had everything you could want, Had a problem when we booked in as one room had been cancelled inadvertently but it was sorted out quickly to our satisfaction Lovely bar tea which was very pleasant in the evening and a super breakfast
263961,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Stayed here Sunday and Monday night 16 17 July The single bedroom was just too small the toilet wasn t flushing very well the tap in the sink was missing a nozzle so water was spraying all over me when i had the tap on full but worst of all is that this room was off the main corridor beside where the housekeeper stored stuff and there was constant noise from early morning There was also some works being done outside my door Room 423 see picture When I checked into the hotel I asked if I could get an upgrade the girl asked if I stayed here before told her no but that I had stayed in a Radisson Blu in Ireland I was then told they were full I really don t believe that was the case at all Also there was no Mini bar in the room Really disappointed that I didn t get a good nights sleep the hotel obviously knew they were doing works outside the door very inconsiderate It costs a lot to stay in London and what I was given and the sleep experience I had was certainly not value for money , Breakfast was great staff were very nice and location was excellent for the things I wanted to do
263962,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Room was small and very dated No plug sockets beside the bed Bathroom was a bit rough around the edges although clean Overall needs a refurbishment , Very easy to find easy walk into the west end Breakfast was good and service quick Room was available early and we received a complimentary cake as it was my husbands birthday We were told that our room had been upgraded but I would dread to see the other rooms if ours was extra special 
263963,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Noisy AC no cheese at breakfast the only sort they offer is not good ridiculously small wash basin in the bathroom, Helpful staff spacious room comfortable bed robes and slippers good breakfast fast and reliable wi fi 
263964,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, There seems to be an unpublished uninformed internal policy that you cannot exceed 50 pounds credit which lets face it in central London barely gets you a round of drinks without being hassled to settle your bill DESPITE having credit status TRANSPARENCY is required to allow guests to feel welcomed more than left feeling as if they re going to run off without paying Bar bills are NOT auto credited with your 15 pound discount again this means you have to go and ask for it to be discounted It s supposed to be an offering not necessitating a guest to ask these policies are not at all guest friendly and create bad impressions , Upon check in you receive a handy little key envelope that indicates you have to either pay cash or have credit sign for things on your bill very handy and clear You are told you get 15 pounds bar credit every night very clear 
263965,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Used to staying next door in the Radisson Bloomsbury much better all round thought we d give this slightly cheaper option a try as it s just next door Conflicting info from staff some of it clearly meant to just get the guest to shut up verging on rude Windows in our room sealed closed terrible when taking a shower and airless during warm summer nights Attitude in the bar is pretentious and service is less than impressive The new online check out bill option has no option to remove the optional yet added service charges Very busy due to being cheaper than it s sister property next door and the property feels it s entitled to give as it wishes due to consistent max occupancy We also choose where to stay and it won t be at this hotel anymore , Radisson is was a favorite destination rooms are generally comfortable and the location is great for our needs 
263966,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Thought it was expensive for the size of the room Breakfast was an add on for 20pp which i think is very expensive Room was on the 1st floor with a busy road next to it so it was a little noisy , Hotel was good in a great location for walking to and from Theatreland The rooms were nicely decorated and the beds we re very comfy 
263967,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The shower nozzle dripped and the fridge was packed with drinks we weren t interested in making it harder to store water bottles and fresh fruit , The staff consistently went above and beyond in their service We arrived at reception on a hot day after many hours of travel and were immediately offered ice cold watermelon flavoured water Our request for a late check out was willingly accommodated and we were able to checkout at 4pm at no extra charge The concierge was very knowledgeable about transport in and around London saving us considerable time The option to avoid unnecessary changing of sheets and towels during short stays to minimise the environmental impact was a great initiative The offer to date money to a charity for every day this option was exercised was an added plus Hats off the Blu Radisson for this environmentally friendly initiative 
263968,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Keys unreliable Perhaps the room door lock to blame Double bed not big enough for two adults Sink tap dripped Security box had to be repaired or given a new battery ,No Positive
263969,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I was put in a twin room not the double I had booked and the bed was short and uncomfortable I do expect to be given a double if that is what I have booked They gave me free breakfast which was nice but I was tired after a very poor night s sleep , Location and bar
263970,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, After checking in online on Friday for an overnight stay on Saturday Sunday our room number was given as 115 During our time in London on Saturday we received a text to say that our room number had changed to room 106 presumably because another guest had seen the room and decided it was too small and had requested something bigger The room itself was very small with minimal facilities and only a two foot gap between bed and the walls on all three sides More space and better facilities would have been provided at a Travel Lodge at around a third of the price The only view outside the window was of pipework with no view of the sky available from the window We booked this hotel for a better experience than staying at a Travel Lodge However in future we will stick with the Travel Lodge rather than waste our money on this overpriced accommodation A very unsatisfactory experience all round , Bed was comfortable enough and it was reasonably quiet 
263971,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, For me the mattress was a little too hard These hard mattresses are common in Europe generally but I find they are not great for older bodies That being said I slept really well , The location is excellent in the heart of Bloomsbury and steps away from The British Museum My air conditioned room was nice and cool during warm weather and it was super quiet with almost no street noise and no corridor and neighbor noise either Room was super clean and well appointed and the staff were great friendly and knowledgeable 
263972,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Nothing loved it all , Absolutely loved this hotel Building was clean and had modern amenities but retained a historical feel Beds were a bit hard but were still very comfortable Staff left a nice card and delicious cake for our anniversary I would stay here agin in a heartbeat 
263973,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Breakfast was horrible 20 pound for nothing so bad that in the second day I skipped it and went out for a decent breakfast Rooms are small 1 elevator it can take you up to 10 mins to get to your floor , Location is great Staff was pleasant 
263974,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I needed to work at the desk for several hours When the sun shone directly in it was slightly inconvenient having only Roman blinds which I had to pull fully down rather than vertical or Venetian I found the pillows too high plump However I forgot to ask for others the next day I imagine some could have been found if I had , Excellent breakfast very good choice at the buffet and well cooked Eggs Benedict Unlike in many hotels the shower screen was big enough and well enough fitted to prevent water splashing flooding onto the bathroom floor 
263975,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We booked a twin room which they didn t have available We We re offered two separate single rooms This wasn t ideal but was our only option Many of those arriving at the same time as us didn t get a room in that hotel at all , Location
263976,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The pillows were HUGE I had to sleep with a folded towel Whilst the breakfast would have been good the plates were cold the food got cold very quickly and items like the bacon were not available at the same time , I liked the location of the property The room was nice The waiter in the breakfast room was very good and friendly but he was on his own in his area and seemed rushed off his feet therefore forgot our coffee Shame 
263977,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The Restaurant menu could have included desserts The Restaurant opening hour could have finished a little later for guests, The helpfulness of the Guest Relations staff Anna and Liliya
263978,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I would love to have been able to turn the air conditioning off when I was in the room it was a little chilly , The staff were helpful and friendly Breakfast was very good The restaurant was nice for dinner The lobby area was pleasant The concierge knew his city It was a pleasant surprise to find fresh fruit in the room It is the first hotel I gave stayed in where you can choose to have your room cleaned or not and if not they donate money to charity Great idea and I went with not clean the room and it was perfectly fine I would definitely stay here again 
263979,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I never had such a small room 10 m2 for such a high price and a very little bed 1 20 m width for 2 elderly adults That s 25 m2 night,No Positive
263980,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Electric sockets not near a mirror awkward when drying hair , Great location friendly staff spotlessly clean excellent breakfast all in all a wonderful stay
263981,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Rooms were slightly smaller than expected but it wasn t a problem per say , The location was great whether either walking or needing an underground it was in close proximity for shopping theatre or just a general buzz 
263982,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room allocated was extremely small more suited for a double for single occupancy than two travellers, Bed pillows and duvet were fab air conditioning was efficient and quiet 
263983,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Very few tv stations and some were bad receptions The breakfast wasn t as good as other Radissons Very odd choice of cheese at breakfast far too strong The bar and lounge area was tiny and was effectively just the corner of the dining breakfast area , Very comfortable bed The location was perfect as I was filming in the museum that evening The staff are excellent 
263984,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, Excellent hotel with great location staff were all very helpful and kind at all times Breakfast was superb Only 5 minute walk to nearest tube Tottenham Court Road 
263985,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, First double room we were given was very small The double bed was pushed up to the wall so only one person could get out of bed easy The other person would have to climb over the other one The room was just bigger than a double bed with nowhere to sit Very uncomfortable Luckily we asked to be moved and where given a very nice and much larger room This made all the difference to our stay , Excellent location Nice restaurants nearby 
263986,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, Breakfast is always great The rooms are comfortable and this time I stayed at the front of the hotel which was much better Some rooms seem small but I guess that s London The location is good and staff always found a taxi for me when needed The gym is small but ok for a short trip I like the idea of the grab and go breakfast when you need to leave early although opening the dining room a little earlier would help I had room service which was also good For a business trip I can t really fault it 
263987,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, There was no mirror beside the desk and power sockets in which to look when styling hair or applying make up Also there was no full length mirror in the room which is most unusual It had a corporate feel to it but surely business travellers also like to style their hair and check their appearance before meeting clients On the first morning the shower was not working properly but this was fixed by the following morning , The location was superb because we wanted to be in Bloomsbury Room service was prompt and the food was most acceptable The room to which we were upgraded was spacious and nicely furnished All the staff were brisk friendly and efficient especially the staff in the bar restaurant 
263988,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Nothing we had a really enjoyable stay , Our weekend stay was excellent We had a twin room with very comfortable single beds The room wasn t huge but had everything we needed This is a great hotel within walking distance to Covent Garden Markets The hop on and off bus was just around the corner and the staff were very helpful getting taxi s and offering information about the local area Breakfast was excellent and we ate dinner one night in the restaurant No complaints from us we enjoyed our lovely stay and will be back next time we are in town 
263989,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The view from my window was not great but I did ask for a quiet room and they put me at the back It was really quiet just not a great view so you can t always have everything , The staff were very friendly and helpful The food was really good 
263990,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room was far too small more like a corridor with hardly any room at the side of the bed Supposedly a stand double but in reality was an adjoining room with door to next door and noise transferred from adjacent rooms Not up to usual Radisson blu standards and actually not good value for money, Staff welcoming and attentive any issues sorted promptly
263991,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Rooms were smaller than we were accustomed to in other parts of the world but was adequate , Rooms were clean bathroom was nice service was excellent breakfast was excellent 
263992,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The hose would have been nice in the shower but we managed anyhow perfectly well without it , The location was perfect for us Soho night life and Covent Garden in walking distance Bus stop behind the corner The room was nice tidy and provide everything we needed WiFi was excellent The staff was friendly helpful and professional We would definitely stay here again 
263993,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, Colm and his coworkers at the concierge desk were wonderful The restaurant was really great Rooms are nicely appointed and location is perfect for theater goers 
263994,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Not suitable for a stay of more than two days A large well appointed room Deluxe with absolutely no shelf or drawer space for clothing Had to use our suitcase to store sweaters and shirts No beside drawer or storage no reading lights by the bed a safe that required kneeling on the floor a desk with a myriad of connections but couldn t use in the evening because of lack of lighting Staff very helpful brought a reading lamp but had to use an extension cord across the room because no outlets by the bed Disappointed that senior management ignores guests s needs We are obviously not the first to complain about a situation that could be rectified by a simple chest of drawers , Everything except for the inefficient design of the room see above Excellent full breakfast with huge variety Helpful staff Location by British Museum is perfect for walking anywhere in Central London 6 min walk to Underground 9 min to Leicester Square or Selfridges 
263995,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Being sent to stay in the hotel across the road with no proper explanation Poor service at reception desk very poor service in the breakfast restaurant staff stopping service to eat their own breakfast On the second day the restaurant lead served us herself the breakfast order still came wrong Leaving messages in the room pointing dirty areas out to the cleaner Then the room still not being thoroughly clean Very poor access to room card lift system didn t work 99 of the time , The location 
263996,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I was woken on Morning 1 around 6 00 by the fire alarm going off 3 times during a 15 minute period for about 10 15 seconds each time By the third time there was no chance of being able to go back to sleep but there was no apology for the disrupted night I was woken on Morning 2 by the sound of dripping water and I discovered that there was a leak from the air conditioning and a pool of water on the floor , The room was comfortable clean and spacious 
263997,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We didn t stop for breakfast as the price seemed extremely high per person 20 and when we went downstairs the queue to get into the dining room was quite long Would have expected faster service for that price , The location is absolutely brilliant for shopping sight seeing and a lot more Definitely the key selling point Our room was lovely too and we had a quiet room at the end of a corridor as requested which was perfect 
263998,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, The hotel was to a high standard Great breakfast and every staff member we encountered were very polite and happy to assist you had a lovely time and couldn t fault it 3 mins to Shaftesbury theatre 
263999,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, They have the British style cold and hot taps which was slightly different from what I am used to but it s minor compared to excellent service , The service is amazing Every staff member goes really out of their way to make your stay incredibly smooth I loved it I would always come back to the room to find small gestures by the housekeeping that makes you feel more at home rather than a hotel Even my taxi got late so the concierge volunteered to take me to the station in his own car which was extremely kind I definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again 
264000,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room was too small Asked for a room with a shower as I was with a disabled person and even though the room did have a shower it was not suitable for a disabled person as it was far too small and in fact there was very little space in the wash room all together, The staff were friendly and helpful
264001,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Sorry used the wrong box for part of this , The Scoff and Banter took ages to make our Irish Coffees and the waitress didn t know what it was so we said bring us coffee and 2 whiskies and we ll pour it in The man in charge of the bar couldnt find the Jamiesons whisky which my husband had asked for to go in it Then they got it wrong and although i said white coffee for me and black for my husband we both got black They did apologise but it looked as if nobody really knew what they were doing There was also an awful repetitive head banging music in thw background which was too loud It was also piped in the foyer of the hotel I told to the waitress how we had to get away from it and she agreed it was awful Seating was lovely and comfortable though and the whole room looked stunning Our bed pillows were solo comfortable that I want to buy some Does anybody know which shop I can get them in please 
264002,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room and bathroom was a bit cramped and the shower was rubbish, The location and checking in process particularly getting a text when the room was ready and being able to get in early as we were going to the theatre
264003,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I can t think of anything WE will recommend this hotel to everyone , Bed very comfortable and the breakfast was the best we have had in a hotel THe staff extremely helpful and I got a surprise birthday cake 
264004,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The receptionist Candy is her name on arrival allocated me the worst room in the hotel the window was on an ugly terrace and the view was of torn and flapping black plastic wrapped around a chimney like structure telling me that I had been upgraded strange given the rate charged I wondered if the sub standard room was given to me because I was alone had booked through booking com and had already given credit card details On my complaining I was given another and better room Candy could easily have given me decent room first up It was mean spirited I would suggest that you ask hotels to treat your clients fairly particularly single women traveling alone and not to palm off the worst rooms because they are already captives , It was a comfortable stay
264005,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room we were booked into was so small the very small double bed was right against the wall so there was no way to get out of bed that side This meant the person sleeping that side had to clamber over the other person or shuffle to the end of the bed obviously this immediately woke the other person In addition the only place to put cases was at the end of the bed so in practice it was nigh on impossible to get out of the end of the bed As a couple past retirement age this was not a good thing and neither of us got a good nights sleep The next morning I asked to be moved and this was done without quibble to a larger room with access to both sides of the bed Unfortunately the mattress was so hard I didn t sleep that night either All in all although the location was great it was way too expensive and there too much hassle for a relaxed visit to London I will not be staying there again, The fact then when I complained about our room we were moved
264006,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, location is perfect 5mn to subway by walking breakfast is delicious healthy foods options was good rooms are quite and comfortable but maybe is a bit small wifi is good 
264007,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Bathroom was on s slant esp the toilet Fairly noisey from outside Not many bars locally , Fairly good location Small but cosy room Friendly helpful staff 
264008,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room and bathroom were very small, The location was great with a number of tube stations very close by also there were a number of restaurants nearby 
264009,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The pillows were hard and the constant door banging from other residents at 3am was annoying and inconsiderate I know carpets are not great but it would quieter the corridors down especially on an evening early morning, The location was perfect and staff were more than accommodating
264010,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Elevators were strange one room at a time due to security system gym had one working treadmill rooms on small side , Very nice clean property located right near British Museum Nice staff and rooms have all the amenities 
264011,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, No bin liners in the bins in the room Tv channels and signal weren t the best , The room layout Comfy bed Staff were friendly Smelt fresh Access to fresh cold after at the counters downstairs 
264012,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The noise from the road at night , Had a great stay Had one problem and was sorted out straight away Staff were really good would definitely stay again 
264013,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We had a coffee on arrival we waited a long time for this and when it came it was cold Handcut chips were good though , Staff friendly and attentive Accommodation was lovely and clean with good decor A birthday present for my mum a night away with and a show Thoroughly enjoyable 
264014,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room was quite small for the paid price But what really bothered me was that once I called housekeeping to ask for a cup no cups were available in the room I had to discuss for 5min with the employee in which hotel I would be it seems that she serves different Blue Radissons in the are and to convince her that I provided her the correct room number , The staff at the reception is very friendly and supportive I kiked their approach 
264015,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The breakfast not included in the room price and also to expensive room was a little on the small size , comfortable beds Good location for theatre trips and shops 
264016,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The view from the room I was first assigned I was told people like it as it s quiet , Speedy response via Virtual Butler to get my room changed 
264017,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, First room was smallest room I have ever seen but we were able to move to a better room fortunately Didn t like the fact that we could see directly into other people s rooms if we had the blind up at all , Location customer service breakfast 
264018,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, You are either lucky on the day with a nice staff member or unlucky to find another staff member not so nice I have had a bit of both to be honest , Excellent location very central near west end Very clean Comfortable bed Sufficient coffee making facilities
264019,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Requested twin rooms and were given double rooms Double room not suitable so staff very helpful and we re given single rooms which were very disappointing , Complimentary breakfast excellent All members of staff excellent 
264020,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Standard double room is tiny and the bed is a small double so not adequate for 2 people Only book a standard double if you will use it as a single room A move to a king size bed cost an extra 40 per night , Location is excellent for the West End Soho and Covent Garden Nice bar area 
264021,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Single beds couldn t be pushed together and were quite narrow fell out of bed twice Room was a bit tired and tatty looking, Good location Decent breakfast selection and tasted good Staff were friendly
264022,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The gym was a disappointment A couple of treadmills a crosstrainer a bike and a few dumbbells Not enough for a thorough workout The concierge was helpful and recommended the world s very first YMCA an historic place which is next door and is a great place for sports if you re willing to pay the extra money The shower was really small and without a proper handheld shower you ll have to perform gymnastics to get properly clean , Location is perfect close to Oxford Street Soho Leicester Square Piccadilly Circus yet in a quiet neighborhood You can actually sleep with the window open without waking up because of traffic Breakfast is awesome with a variety of things to choose from and everything prepared with utmost care and quality The single superior room is worth the extra money Though small the bigger bed makes the stay more comfortable Coffee tea and water are complimentary which is appreciated Staff was helpful and accommodating in every aspect 
264023,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The air conditioning was extremely loud yet ineffective The bathroom was tiny and had loud plumbing issues Rooms were quite dated and had to ask for cups a couple of times, There were sometimes sweets in the foyer and water nice touch Location was great
264024,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, There was a hair dryer in the room however it didn t work The room was slightly small for the price and the bed was a small double so not much room , The facilities were great within the room interactive mini bar kettle which was stored in a cupboard out of the way the bed was comfy and the hotel was in a great location 
264025,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The toilet did not flush well and the sink a bit small for washing your face in Double glazing not great so noise at night from traffic , Every need catered for in the room Comfy king size bed excellent choice at breakfast 
264026,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, The hotel is really wel located in the very center of London We almost walked to every places It is really easy to get to the hotel if you travel by train from Saint Pancras direct by bus The room is small but very comfortable great bed The breakfast was included in the reservation and it was worth it a large choice in the buffet and a la carte 
264027,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Told we had free upgrade Wpuldnt like to see the room before upgrade Room we got was so small Barely enough room to get ready comfortably Also only mug for tea and coffee facilities , Lovely clean hotel Great location
264028,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I had a single room and I knew it would be small which it was and I m fine with that However it could have used small touches to make the size a bit more bearable such as a coat hook on the door removing their magazines from the small table so you can use it etc , Great location great price for the area and friendly staff 
264029,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room was dark The outlook was awful Like a prison Bathroom was too small The bath wasn t user friendly This room certainly wasn t value for money Not much choice at breakfast the service was poor the actual breakfast that was available was good however , Location
264030,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Very noisy ventilation Don t forget your earplug nor your night mask , The staff is very kind The bed was perfect the breakfast was very very good and the location is perfect 
264031,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, They need more staff in bar plus very upset that we could not get food after returning from Theatre because the food stopped at 10 30pm especially as we had got just after and especially as it was a Friday evening so had one drink which took a while and went to bed on empty stomach Was told we could get 24 hr room service and order food Went to our room at 11pm phoned to order food was told we could only have a Toasty which would cost 12 plus 1 50 room service not what you expect at a 4 reputable Hotel as a Chain, The location was great for the Theatre and very close to underground
264032,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room was so small that I even could not keep my suitcase open on the floor Bathroom was not very new the shower cabin was so small that I hited the walls with my elbows all the time And the shower was attached to the wall no flexible hose , Friendly staff and good breakfast 
264033,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The restaurant messed up my order and brought the wrong meal after I d waited for a long time for the food to arrive By the time the wrong dish arrived it was too late to cook the correct food There was no hot water in the basin of my room 512 , The support of the Concierge was good 
264034,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room could be larger with a more modern design no carpet for example , The position of the hotel is great for visiting the centre of London by walk Liverpool and Holborn and Convent Garden too underground are very close The room was nice maybe a little small for a double bed accomodation but with all the stuff you need USB socket for recharging excellent wifi electric teapot and a large bathroom Breakfast was the best part with healthy and fresh food fresh fruit organic musli Bircher yogurt almond milk besides the usual english breakfast 
264035,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, The staff were excellent and made me and my mum feel very welcome Check in and check out were so quick and made very pleasant by the lovely friendly staff Would definitely stay here again It was good value and a brilliant location 
264036,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, Staff were exceptionally friendly but not overly pushy The breakfast was excellent Good quality produce with home produced ellements which we really emjoyed Spent tge evening at the ballet which was thebpurpose of the visit excelkent location for Covent Gardens 
264037,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The double room was much smaller than anticipated not the size depicted in the photos on the website Unfortunately we felt that the dining room staff at breakfast were not working effectively On day one we were shown to our table and told that someone would take our order for tea coffee but this never happened instead we had to actively seek out somone and ask for it The same again on day two Likewise we were never asked if we wanted to order from the a la carte selection again having to seek out someone to place an order when it became apparent we weren t going to be offered it On our last day we were wise to this so we asked the waiter who showed us to the table to bring us tea and that was fine A little more emphasis placed on welcoming the customers rather than looking at the technology mobile used to identify us as guests would have made the experience better We hope this constructive criticism provides the staff with an opportunity to improve , Excellent location very friendly and professional staff good amenities in the room excellent choice of breakfast items well presented Scoff and Banter very nice bar to relax in 
264038,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The only issue with the room is that there could have been a mirror on the dressing table the mirror there was was at the side of the alcove 90 degrees to the table so awkward for my partner to use , It was my partner s birthday we were given an upgrade to a kingsize room and they even left a cake in the room for her with a card 
264039,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room is very small, Good location room is clean and all hotel staffs are nice providing high quality service inclusive breakfast is also valuable
264040,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The taxi service they use charged me 3 times the rate I let the hotel know as this reflects badly on them , The location close to Leicester Square soho Very comfortable beds 
264041,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Restaurant staff were poor One order was forgotten I was eventually served after asking 3 times On another occasion I had to go to the bar to find someone to take a drink order ,No Positive
264042,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, rooms were lovely but very small Possibly a Central London standard though Room temperature was too warm, Staff were very helpful decor modern beds comfortable plenty of complimentary water left location fantastic walked to from Euston 15 mins walked to Covent Garden 10 mins tops 
264043,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Breakfast was good but would prefer toast to be delivered to table I find the toasters dangerous Also lift was too small and wait was long, Location and decor
264044,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Asked for a twin room but was given a double was rectified within minutes but was advised if i booked again to go direct not to go through Booking com Bathroom was not the cleanest I ve stayed in and silicone sealant was peeling away from the bath , Staff were excellent and were quick to swing into action when i asked them to change our room because the bed set up was wrong 
264045,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The doors are locked overnight and the doorbell does not work I spent about 20 minutes waiting for someone to let me in be aware if you are planning on late night revelry , Rooms are well appointed albeit a bit on the small size 
264046,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, Room size was tiny you could just about walk around what looked a 3 4 double bed NOT JOKING Mentioned this to Lucas Manager who instantly transferred and upgraded us to another room Lucas could not do enough for us fabulous customer service Jojo from Porto in the bar Bloomsbery lovely friendly and chatty girl Fantastic stay after a dodgy start with the smallest hotel room l have ever seen 
264047,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Our room was a the size of a large cupboard not even big enough for the bed in it I had to climb over bed to reach my side like a child s room bed against the wall , Friendly service
264048,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I ve stayed at Radisson hotels before in London but not this one on Great Russell St Location not brilliant room ok but I ve had better and the breakfast I thought was not up to the standard of my previous stays ,No Positive
264049,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The double room was so small you couldn t swing a cat Very claustrophobhic Asked if we could change and informed no other rooms available Originally must have been used as a store room , location
264050,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Had some problems with Wifi which was slow at the time Also I had problem sleeping due to a loud traffic outside and very high pillows in the room personally I can t sleep on high pillows , Great location next to the British museum Excellent breakfast and friendly staff very clean room 
264051,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The rooms are tiny and WiFi breaks all the time with the slowest connection ever Not expected from Radisson in 2017 No socket next to the bed so you have to plug your phone to the other end of your room for charging No window blinds either everyone from other buildings can peep into your room or you get zero light with thick bamboo curtains all the way down , Location 
264052,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Received an email on the day we were due to arrive asking us to check in online which I did and was advised that all we had to do was collect our room keys from the concierge however the concierge sent us to the check in desk where we had to check in anyway so online check in seems a little pointless The person that checked us in gave us no information about the hotel facilities breakfast or where we might find our room he literally said two words to us He also seemed reluctant to take payment for the room when we arrived and was just not very helpful in general Staff we encountered all seemed a bit withdrawn Room was quite small which we didn t mind as the location was amazing and we got a good deal however I imagine some people will get burned if they book late and pay through the nose , Bed was really comfortable amazing pillows and duvet which meant we slept well every night Fantastic location especially good if you are in London to see a show Breakfast was excellent as well 
264053,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Room temperature takes a bit of playing around with thermostat Can still hear a background hum from the air conditioner but nothing too noisy to disturb my sleep Due to narrow space of toilet the bath towels did land on top of the toilet seat when try to extract towel , Home made marmalade flaky croissant interesting juice choices good quality sausages and nice bread Decent filter coffee Bed comfy Corner room is indeed quiet can t hear the street 
264054,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Room was a little cold I didnt want to change any settings in case I made it worse and was facing a busy road but otherwise fine , Lovely comfy bed breakfast was very nice Staff very helpful and pleasant 
264055,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Only thing I was not keen on was the shower which was fixed overhead and no shower cap provided, The staff were very friendly and helpful the beds were very comfortable and the room quiet Breakfast was also good
264056,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Very poor checkout and desks in a poor layout Extremely small room and dated broken bathroom Leak in restaurant meant we couldn t have pre drinks at the bar and breakfast was so expensive we didn t even consider it , Location was great as we were hosting a party at a venue in Charlotte Street 
264057,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Breakfast cooked food scrambled egg bacon not very hot , Bed really comfy loved the fluffy dressing gown slippers great to have good size shampoos etc All very clean tidy
264058,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Only reason for poor restaurant rating is that we had to go to a sister property across the street twice during our stay due to a burst pipe in our hotel , Fantastic location comfortable size room slept very well 
264059,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We had requested a non smoking room but when we entered our room it stank of cigarettes smoke We complained and were moved to a different room Credit to the staff they were very apollogetic , The bed was very comfy and the bar was also very nice 
264060,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The domestic staff have a job to do but a little noisy outside in the corridor We were very tired and wanted to lie in but were woken up by their coming and going Lots of rattling and banging , The room was clean just the right size for just staying over night toiletries were nice towels soft and just the right side of fluffy The beds were very comfortable The staff were friendly and efficient and we were able to store our luggage before we needed our room and the day after we d booked out Appples fruit water and sweeties available very welcoming 
264061,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, There was ejaculate and dried skin all over the bed the bathroom was completely different to what I see online The water did not work all morning , Leaving 
264062,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The lift used a room key to operate and it took ages to get it to work , I had booked in on line but on arrival the room that I had selected had been given away The receptionist was very apologetic and gave us an upgrade 
264063,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Hotel main and probably only entrance is very small and with steps and on the bus lane side so cars can only drop you a few steps away from entrance , location close to tube and oxford street breakfast was very good free wifi was very good 
264064,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The standard room is extremely standard and tiny There are no pictures of the room on the site so you do not expect what you get However raised my issue with Lukas on reception who helped us resolve it and made sure we were happy He even checked everything was good for us before he finished his shift , Room was very clean breakfast was excellent Lukas on reception was very friendly and extreamly helpful when we had a small issue helped us to resolve it both courteously and in a timely manner got the feeling nothing was too much trouble for him
264065,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, 1st floor room and noisy due to poor window glazing Also TV options poor , For a single room didn t feel cramped Very comfortable bed Storage very good no shortage of hangers 
264066,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, In my booking I requested a twin bedded room because I suffer from a sleep disorder In fact we were assigned a room with a small double bed The hotel staff claimed that the request was not communicated by Booking com I was very unhappy about this and said so , The hotel manager did his best for us following my complaint We were offered a room with a larger bed We were grateful for the effort although not perfect this was an acceptable solution 
264067,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Very little lift is very small so may be an issue if very busy but I walked the stairs in the main so didn t effect me, Good location excellent breakfast friendly and helpful staff the room was compact but ideal for our needs and the bathroom was decent size with a good shower
264068,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room was much smaller than I expected I expect small in London however I booked a standard twin room which is advertised at 15m squared and my room was well below this It also did not look like the twin room in the photo used to sell the room to me so beware The bathroom was minuscule think one spot to stand in sink in front of you step left you re in the shower and right you re in the toilet I think there should be an option to select a bath as I had no choice when booking Breakfast The bacon was very fatty and not cooked very much there could have been more sweet items at breakfast e g muffins and it was very difficult to toast bread properly using their machine There were no biscuits with the tea and coffee in the room or otherwise All in all the room size was my main bugbear The rest were minor issues , The location was amazing and the key selling point of the hotel Staff were friendly There was high quality and a good variety of fruit available at breakfast Overall I probably would book this hotel again but I would make a few requests just after booking Check in and out were very quick and smooth though I visited at a less busy time of year 
264069,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Nothing everything was absolutely fine , The rooms are very comfortable and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful A great location for theatres and central London 
264070,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I thought I was booking a twin room and the email confirmation of my booking from Booking com specified i had asked for two singles However when I tried to check in I discovered that the Kenilworth sees all such bookings from Booking com as Doubles I was given a twin as it happened to be available but that was pure luck and I was told that many people expecting a twin booked through Booking com at this hotel are disappointed Anyone who wants to be certain that they will get a twin room should not book this hotel via Booking com The phone number provided by Booking com in the email confirmation was actually for the Bloomsbury Radisson Blu instead , The staff were very pleasant and helpful The location is great 
264071,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Preference for twin beds was not granted some negotiation with staff required to get it in the end, Perfect location close to Tottenham Court Road metro station Fully renovated and very confortable rooms Excellent quality breakfast
264072,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Breakfast in room very poor refused to pay for it room wasn t ready till 15 40 not acceptable really , Bar area really nice staff really friendly
264073,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, Staff was friendly Very easy to get to from City Airport and walking distance to Tottenham Court Station About 5 minutes Nice little bar restaurant at the lobby Breakfast was refreshing nice selection of the cold dishes I skipped the hot buffet Love the croissant and homemade spread 
264074,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Long check in took us 30 minutes First we were sent to location next door apparently same hotel next despite reservation for twin bed we got double Twins were not available Room dark and small , Convenient location close to many theatres restaurants and Covent Garden Nice bar with good cocktails and snacks downstairs Quiet room Super nice bathrobes 
264075,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, My bed was extremely uncomfortable and my tv did not work properly despite someone coming to look at it , The breakfast was excellent My grandson particularly liked the sweets in the reception and a very nice receptionist on duty on Saturday evening very kindly went and got some more foamy bananas for him as there were none left in the dish I thought she made a very kind gesture it was lovely 
264076,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, There comes a time when money comes into it and although all was excellent its not possible to do more than once or twice a year at 200 per night, Bed was very comfortable breakfast was lovely Staf were first class
264077,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Nothing, Staff were extremely friendly accommodated us for late checkout and stores our luggage for us when we checked out so we didn t have to trail it around london
264078,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Did not sleep Heavy traffic outside 24 7 and inadequate soundproofing Truck deliveries at 4 am right under window No soundproofing could hear people outside on street talking Room stank of cigarette smoke revolting Cold water burst from shower every 5 seconds when trying to have hot shower Awful heat insulation freezing near windows Heating was from AC unit with squeaky loud fan Asked for a double bed in advance and was given a twin I ve had dozens of nights stay with Radisson around the world this was the worst I ve ever had hotel needs complete refurbishment including substantial improvements to facade soundproofing insulation,No Positive
264079,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The very very small room and a bed which was up against a wall and for two people staying was not acceptable Also a very small bathroom with a tiny sink , Friendly staff
264080,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Room was tiny Room service quite poor A burger for 17 should be one of the best burgers you have eaten but instead it was a cold burnt to a crisp saucer with a bowl of cold brown chips yuk , great breakfast lots of healthy choice chilli guacamole at breakfast brilliant Staff very friendly
264081,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The restaurant adjoining the hotel The Scoff and Banter great name however menu is very poor You cannot even get a sandwich or a decent snack Having said that the quality of food was very good however a sandwich or even an omelette would have been ideal , Location is fantastic and the staff are very helpful 
264082,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We were disappointed with our room From the photos on your site we had hoped for a lovely top quality room especially as we had gone for a special occasion only to find we were up in the attic with low sloping ceilings which my partner kept hitting his head on each time he got out of bed The room was also small and pokey as was the bathroom , Their homemade marmalade was amazing The staff were all very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful 
264083,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Pillows were too big and uncomfortable Cleaners took our 2nd key when cleaning so had to use 1 for electricity and to enter lift , The breakfast was fresh even at 10 30 
264084,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, More food choice after hours not that we needed any more Didn t get a chance to use the 15 credit we were given , Fantastic stay staff were incredibly helpful and went out of their way to sort everything out for us Perfect room very clean and comfortable Breakfast was such a treat so much choice Would definitely recommend and hopefully stay again soon

264086,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Bathroom could have been a bit cleaner , Location was right next to British Museum and walking distance to Euston Station and The Palace Theatre for Harry Potter which was the purpose of my visit 
264087,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Although extra pillows were provided they too were over plump and not necessarily a good alternative Was a bit disappointed with breakfast Great choice but served on the cold plates that were already on the table and no apparent alternatives No side plates or chance of one Very good choice of continually replenished breakfast items but coffee only warm and tea mediocre What is the problem with promoting what is good about Britain in a great quality product like Yorkshire Tea 20 is a lot of money for this breakfast which although plentiful is not a quality product , Very good location and impressive hotel Staff were always friendly and welcoming 
264088,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, Some rooms too small hot and stuffy The hotel was happy to change our room after an uncomfortable sleeples night The room we were moved to was a lot better 
264089,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, When we phoned from our room to request items to be sent to the room 3 out of 4 times the requests were not carried out as no one turned up with the items Also the shower was very weak and the temperature was always changing, The bed was extra comfy and the rooms were lovely The staff were very friendly at reception 
264090,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The Rooms were small For what I paid for I have paid less at a Premier Inn and received more with same quality and service also within central London The other disappointment is that we have stayed at the Raddison in Manchester airport and everything there was top quality and was far more Superior to the Premier Inn and that is what we were expecting to have in London ,No Positive
264091,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, The location of the hotel is perfect for a weekend trip staff is very friendly and bed comfortable Special thanks for a birthday cake for my husband that was a great surprise 
264092,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Hotel lobby dining area is good a little over priced on alcohol etc but to be expected Rooms could do with a makeover A little old fashioned and tired out however beds are very comfortable , Location of the hotel is fantastic within walking distance to majority of the main attractions with loads of shops dining to chose from Easy to get to from Stansted airport Express train to Liverpool st then central underground line for approx 4 stops 
264093,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Room was quite small and the beds weren t comfortable Noise of showers and bathroom area in neighbouring room was quite loud Particularly as the guests in the next room took a shower at 1am On other occasion they chose to knock the adjoining wall assuming this was to get our attention Not sure if there was a problem with Booking com or the hotel but room was booked and paid 5 months in advance but had the annoying and embarrassing situation where had to go through whole booking again and even prove my identity Never had this problem with other Booking com bookings I was told room would be ready between 2 3pm but had to wait til half past three , The location was great for the theatre or visiting British Museum and it was quite near Tottenham Court Road tube Most of the staff were helpful and friendly 
264094,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Extremely small rooms and bathrooms was not 100 clean when we checked in Too expensive for the size of the rooms and the comfort , Super location nice breakfast
264095,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room was a little disappointing for 4 star deluxe It was small and with a horrible back view The tv screen slightly obscured the bathroom door We were misled as to bar charges , The bed extra comfy the breakfast excellent and at great times Everything clean and they looked after our case when we went to walk about British Museum literally across the road 
264096,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The hotel was excellent and worth the money paid but I wouldn t say I got an excellent deal, The bed was very luxurious and comfortable the staff were very accommodating and happy to answer any queries and give directions welcome text and quick check out was excellent
264097,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Didn t seem like a 4star but get at the right price and definitely worth it , This hotel is perfectly near Tottenham Court Road tube station There are shops and theatres near by Lots of eateries including a 24hour one Breakfasts 20 pp so if you get deals with or without you can see which is value for money Breakfast was good But if not enough choice nearby for a cheaper eat including a Sainsburys and Morrisons local 
264098,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Stayed in room 417 traffic noise was ridiculously loud had draughty windows the bath was near in impossible to run without having to step in to it shower door could do with opening outwards as I don t see how an elderly person would of been able to access it, Very convenient place to stay for what we needed it for very easy check in out extremely helpful friendly staff would stay again
264099,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, room was small for price and had to change room at11 o clock at nite light flashing in room told reception but did not get an apology for inconvience, beds really comfy
264100,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, If your after a lovely view then maybe choose somewhere else but I don t stay in the centre of London for a view so wasn t a problem to us, Got a free upgrade to business class room which is always nice Bed was an absolute delight and the room was very nice all round Situated a walk from the dominion theatre Leicester Square and Covent Garden it was perfectly located Very pleased with our stay overall and would deffinately recommend

264102,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Felt we d paid too much for the quality of the hotel Have stayed in much nicer hotels for much less money , The room was small and too hot Air conditioning didn t seem to work Breakfast on first day was chaotic The hot food trays lay empty for over 20 mins and the one lift was inadequate for the number of guests in the hotel 
264103,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, My room was on the mezzanine floor and it was so noisy from downstairs music dancing in the late evenings of Friday and Saturday that affected my rest , Location of the hotel is very convenient Close to main walking street with shops and restaurants 
264104,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The orange juice at breakfast seemed to be liquid cardboard Staff at breakfast and in the evening at bar time was either chaotic and forgetful sometimes had to order tea 4 times before we got it or super focused and lightning fast after 4 days we find out how to get their attention The bath shower are for small people when you are over 1m90cm you cannot stand under the shower or lay in the bath tub The windows of the room are drafty lots of cold comes in as does a lot of noise from the street The sofabed has cushions that are worn no longer comfortable No parking for our car only couple of blocks away not very convenient The toilet is placed in such a way that tall people can only sit sideways on it and that is very inconvenient and at times painful , Breakfast is ok especially the fresh fruit and the omelettes The beds are comfy Staff are all very friendly and helpful The rooms are lovely The location is excellent Wifi is excellent 
264105,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, After paying 279 on arrival for a one night stay with breakfast for two they requested 1 98 for breakfast service charge really it was self service and 15 per head, Great location for a easy walk to all attractions 
264106,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Nothing , Friendly staff clean and comfortable room and added bonus of complimentary 15 00 to spend per day which we were unaware of until our arrival The location was excellent about 3 minutes from tottenham court road tube station 
264107,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We had room 515 and for 200 a night I would of expected a lot more The room was very small and the bathroom was looking dated and in need of refurbishment Not happy for the money we paid as it was our tenth wedding anniversary we wanted a little more than a travel lodge , Friendly helpful staff Great location
264108,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The post code in booking website took us 40 minutes on foot the wrong way Our first room was like a box very cramped, Staff were excellent and moved us without requesting to a much more spacious room for our second night
264109,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Room 627 faulty air con loud noise and when turned off cold air continue to operate so room was freezing Room and bathroom are the smallest ever seen in a 4 star hotel Room changed on second day , Bed comfortable and rooms quiet Breakfast buffet
264110,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Poor Lightning in the room and although a cake was provided for my partner birthday no plates knife or cutlery were forthcoming We requested this of room service never materialised, The room was lovely and staff very polite and helpful The hotel overal was very well appointed and did not disappoint Great location easy to get to Covent Garden West End and Soho 
264111,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The rooms need renovation The guest service department has to work on communication among themselves It seems that one hand does not know about the other hand which leeds to bad service, Good location breakfast wifi Front desk workers are nice
264112,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Bar staff follow you if you leave the bar even when they have a room tab open even if you head outside for a cigarette they follow you , Lovely bed very nice reception staff good size room
264113,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The bathroom was tiny I would have loved a bathtub , Friendly staff excellent breakfast buffet Very comfortable bed and it was surprisingly quiet It was in a great location 
264114,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Although well maintained due to the building s age expect some minor small slow elevators and not so minor poor soundproofing extra squeaky wooden floors nuisances Breakfast average and its price did not include specialty coffees espresso is still considered specialty Long queues at check in out Staff although polite seemed hardly on top of the situation , Convenient location walking distance to many of London s attractions and shopping districts 
264115,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Small room and bed next to window husband banged head and arms on wall Waitress cleared our table at breakfast when we had gone to get food We both had almost full cups , Nice breakfast and comfortable bed Good location in the centre of London 
264116,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room is smaller than expected no mini bar or fridge The hairdryer is very old and the shower water temperature kept switching from hot to cold then back to hot I called to ask for adapter and the front desk told me he will see what he can do and hung up but never called me back , The breakfast and the location
264117,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, No mirror near hairdryer Very small twin room and small bathroom I think when your with a friend a little more body space would be appreciated Shower from above head so difficult to shower if you wanted to keep hair dry No shower caps provided No tissues in dispenser for 2 days , Great location
264118,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Paying 12 5 service charge at the bar as I bought my drinks and was just standing at the bar bit steep to pay for that service and it was only 2 drinks, The location and my room was nice
264119,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Staff were very unfriendly and unhelpful window would not close properly and they attempted unsuccessfully to repair this meant the room was very cold and no other rooms to move to , Location
264120,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Staff a little slow and didnt let me know about eggs options But main problem is those arm chairs are too bulky for everyone to move round , Quality of was excellent
264121,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Went to Kenilworth rooms booked not available took us across road to Bloomsbury had a wait for rooms but on different floors not at all what we booked Won t be booking with booking com or advise anyone to book with them due to hassle we had,No Positive
264122,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Looks like again smallest room available given to Booking com clients Room 202 if you need to know Shower door would not stay closed whilst in use Reported to reception Breakfast a total shambles Many guests including us cleared our own tables 7 8 people waiting to be seated but up to 8 tables still not cleared Staff very slow and there seemed to be no supervison or organisation from the the Duty manager in the breakfast area My accomodation did not inc breakfast which the door person informed me of Had to tell him many times to add to my room Noticed many other people coming in via another door who just sat down and were not checked On checkout my bill was incorrect as they had not added the breakfast Staff said not posted from the breakfast area Had to argue that we had had breakfast and would like to pay It was my wife s birthday and this nearly ruined the whole trip Not up to the normal Rad standards Cost was not a issue but I really felt that this was not value for money , Location and check in staff 
264123,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Expensive breakfast but there are many nice cafes in the vicinity so that s not really an issue Although staff were really friendly and helpful there was the occasional absent mindedness the concierge offered to send up my bags to room but didn t so I had to call twice and still ended up getting them myself them as nobody came and after 1 5 hrs I really needed my charger which was in the suitcase Also cleaners came very late in the evening to tidy up room and forgot to add toilet paper , Well put together hotel nice decor and detail both in common areas and rooms Really friendly staff both at reception and concierge desk Appreciated all the amenities e g good quality hygiene products in room as well as the small thoughtful details water and sweets available in lobby Excellent location on a quiet er side street but still close to most you want to do or see As London hotels go this is a really good one and I ll certainly come back 
264124,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Tiny rooms double bed pushed against a wall had to climb over partner to get out of bed Very small claustrophobic bathroom, Good location easy check in out
264125,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Extremely noisy It needs insulated windows as cars and buses are very noticeable even on the 5th floor Plus there is a non stop working ventilator in bathroom All not very energetic friendly , Great location Very kind staff clean and very comfortable bed
264126,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, For the price we paid it was very ordinary The room was tiny and the double bed small No individual toiletries just wall mounted dispensers like a budget hotel By comparison a couple of weeks earlier I stayed in the nearby Holiday Inn Bloomsbury paid half as much for a room twice the size and with proper toiletries , Breakfast was excellent Free Wi Fi was fast and easy to log on to 
264127,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Our room wasn t ready when we arrived at 3 45 despite check in being 3pm onwards The room was very very small and the bathroom ridiculously small Dusty in areas No facilities , The location is great Sweets and water was a nice touch at reception
264128,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, One of the staff was abit rude we felt like he profiled us and assumed that we wasn t staying at the hotel, The pineapple water was crazy And the early hours stafff were very polite and helpful
264129,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Room was a like a cupboard my friends words I know location plays a part but the price for the size of room is ridiculous On the Internet the room isn t shown just don t stay in single room , Location and lovely hotel front desk staff very friendly
264130,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We stayed at a Premier Inn in Enfield the previous evening for various reasons and were looking forward to an even more comfortable night at Radisson On leaving the Radisson we both commented that we wish we would have stayed at a Premier Inn and paid travel costs into Soho instead I understand the location is reflected in the price but we paid circa 150 00 more and the premier inn had more comfortable beds brighter cleaner room I had to do my makeup with the assistance of my phone torch etc It s all just a bit lack luster It s not bad enough to complain but i most definitely wouldn t return , The location was brilliant Walking distance from Ronnie Scotts in Soho which was perfect for us and close to loads of the main attractions places to see The British Museum is virtually across the street Staff friendly and accommodating and we found parking at Bloomsbury Square NCP a breeze and reasonably priced 
264131,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Can t think of anything , The beds bed linnen duves we slept well Service and friendliness of staff Quiet room and suitable for two small persons 
264132,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Our room was right opposite a service lift which was noisy in the mornings and the afternoons also some guests were using it instead of the proper lift so they were queuing right outside our door On one occasion our room was not tidied in the evening and on another our cups were not replaced The package we had included breakfast as there was not other option however we found we were paying 19 95 for coffree juice yogurt and fruit and a roll or croissant when there was one compared to some people s full English which we did not want When we checked out we did not appreciate the girl in reception saying yes to us whilst staring at her computer screen she couldn t even be bothered to look up and it wasn t busy There would be more room in the bathrooms if you got rid of the baths and just had a walk in shower this would be easier to get into as well Please put up notices asking people to talk quietly in the corridors this applies to staff as well The 15 per night for use in the bar included in the package is a rip off it s use it or lose it and we got scammed even more as we were brought a more expensive brandy then we asked for We changed to lager on subsequent nights Then the receptionist at check out had the nerve to ask us to pay an extra service charge tip for the waiters as she told us this was not included in the 15 , Your example says were the croissants extra flaky in fact the croissants were so flaky they were non existant by 9 00 on the Saturday morning However we did like the king size bed and the comfortable pillows 
264133,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Only one elevator near front desk , Good buffet breakfast Quiet location near British Museum Air conditioner works well on cold days Business room has a large desk and bright lights 
264134,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Double glazing as road noise was still audible at times Air con also quite noisy, The room was sumptuously presented A plethora of toiletries were on offer Staff were extremely pleasant and helpful 
264135,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room was small and the bathroom was tiny , The staff were very friendly breakfast was excellent The day before we left we were asked if we wanted to store luggage on the day we were leaving which I thought was a nice touch 
264136,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The confusion on our booking Booked 2 twin rooms and single room and got one double room and three singles Single room very small so did not want to stay in room at all , The location was brilliant
264137,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Room very small and cramped would classify as a single room rather than a double , Hotel did recognise our wedding anniversary with a bottle of prosecco which was a nice touch and appreciated
264138,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, My room was so small I had to climb over the bed to close the blind so that I couldn t see the man sat on his bed at the opposite window not value for money , Well situated hotel within easy walking distance of Dominion Theatre Tottenham Court Rd and Oxford Street shops Very clean comfy bed friendly staff good breakfast 
264139,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, When I made the booking I requested a twin room but had to have a double room which was very awkward as I was sharing with my brother I complained but they couldn t change our room till the next day I will book direct with hotel next time , The staff were very friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble 
264140,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Not many negatives at all Two slight little niggles In my mum s bedroom there was a nasty brown stain on the curtain and also in her shower cubicle it was a little dirty around the sealant between the tiles and the shower glass I also felt the hotel was slightly overpriced compared to what I ve stayed in before around London , The hotel is in the perfect location for the theatre district and only a 5 minute walk from Tottenham Court Road tube station The staff were friendly and welcoming and were happy to help in anyway they could The room was a decent size with a lovely bathroom and a very comfortable bed The interior and exterior of the hotel were also lovely 
264141,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I requested a wake up call at 7 45am I got it at 8 17am I had a meeting in the Langham hotel with a chap that flew in from Las Vegas I was embarrassingly late Mention it to reception and they didn t make too much of it , Style of hotel and comfortable bed very important
264142,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Room a little on the small side and shower was especially tiny Would be OK for a night or two but I was staying 5 nights so it was quite a claustrophobic experience , Nice staff good breakfasts bottled water in room every day fluffy towels great central location with shopping theatres museums Covent Garden etc all within comfortable walking distance 
264143,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The bed was a small double and therefore too small for two adults We couldn t co ordinate the light switches to only have the lights above the bed on in the evening , Excellent having a heated towel rail for drying towels quickly and drying any hand washing The room was just big enough and the desk was great with the charging units supplied 
264144,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room size was a shock when I first checked in which spurred an instant reaction to request a bigger room which was given to me instantly I still feel that the price paid wasn t full value for money Some staff members were helpful however some were not at all especially late in the evening when we returned from a long day of exploring the city of London , The location of the underground tube and being able to walk to areas like Piccadilly 
264145,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, Excellent location right next to the British Museum and within a 10 minute walk of Covent Garden Very friendly and helpful staff We stayed in a deluxe king size room which was very comfortable quiet and attractively decorated

264149,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Booked twin room None available on arrival Informed that we should have booked directly with hotel chain Ended up with two exceptionally small single rooms which hotel initially expected us to pay extra for , Comfy bed and a bath shower in an exceptionally small single room Breakfasts are amazing Very central too with easy access to hubs such as Covent Gardens 
264150,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Bathrooms a bit dated weak shower going from hot to cold whilst showering Air conditioning ever so noisy , Good location helpful staff comfortable bedrooms
264151,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, For the price of Radisson you are receiving service and comfort of cheap hotel Hotel looks very old rooms are not meeting current quality standards Avoid this hotel Just cross the street you have modern and cool another Radisson for the same price , Just location

264157,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I have stayed in many rooms across London and this room was the smallest I have ever experienced The price at circa 200 is comparable to other hotels the room not The service in the bar was slow , The staff 
264158,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Could nt open the window in my room which was on the 5th floor Must be for safety reasons but a small opening of a few inches would have helped to get some air in , Helpful staff very clean hotel good food and quiet
264159,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I asked for twin beds and did not get a room with 2 beds I paid an extra 40GP for 2 nights to get a room with a pull out bed When I got to my room the second bed was not made there were not any linens for the bed in the room When the linens finally arrived they were not the correct size for the bed I found this VERY unacceptable ,No Positive

264161,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room was small and in the eaves of the roof which meant it was difficult to walk around the bed without knocking yourself out Bathroom was OK but not a lot of room to spread out toiletries , The breakfast was excellent proper fresh orange juice and wasn t watered down and good choice of cereals eggs pancakes toast etc Smart d cor Great location 
264162,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, Staff are fantastic and friendly with attention to detail including suprise cake for my wife s birthday and the chocolate dipped strawberries for our anniversary placed in our room Thankyou Raddison Blu
264163,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Smallest room in London yet And the bathroom layout was ludicrous Not a single photo on Booking com showed a room so small no seating no lamps didn t feel like four stars , Location was exactly what we wanted main reason we picked hotel 
264164,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Not all rooms are as large as the one shown on the website for a double so request one of the larger rooms in advance , Excellent and attentive staff Very friendly and welcoming I had an issue that was immediately acted on and ultimately had me upgraded so I was pleasantly surprised Both my recent stays were highly pleasurable at this property 
264165,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The fire alarm went off 3 times during the night on our stay so we had very little sleep One member of the reception staff was extremely rude to us when we complained We asked to speak to someone else and spoke to customer relations who was extremely polite and refunded us one night s stay It is a pity that one female receptionist is clearly in the wrong job ,No Positive
264166,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Nothing comes to mind , Very nice to find that my daughter had arranged for an anniversary cake to be placed in our room by the hotel staff thanks The food in the restaurant was very tasty as was the food in the nearby Radisson restaurant For a central London hotel it was nice and quiet

264171,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The air conditioning wasn t great for the small hot rooms though it was there Late night staff were incredibly slow when our keycard didn t work to get to our room , Location easy check in and out good concierge service Clean and reliable fast wifi 
264172,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Expected more of the Luxury brand On arrival we noticed that we did not get 2 x 1 person bedding as requested via Booking com The reason being that my comment was too long and they only received the 1st 100 or so characters in their system In stead of asking what I wanted they made the bed with standard double bedding This resulted in us having to wait for an hour more before finally going to sleep when arriving at 23 00 midnight by our biological clock Next time I ll book a more standard chain hotel outside of the center and take the tube where we want to go , Location was good but not great room size and bed size was decent Adjacent to the British Museum so perfect if you want to visit there 
264173,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room was lovely but it was on the 1st floor situated at the front of the hotel The noise on the street was really bad and it was hard to sleep a lot of police or ambulance sirens , The location was fantastic lovely area Hotel was very clean and staff friendly and effective Restaurant was very nice 
264174,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I prefer soap rather than gel but that is so trvial as to seem snippish to mention , The room was compact but very comfortable and quiet alrhough the location was extremely central meaning most key sites were walking distance or easy public transport away 
264175,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Our first night the fire alarm went off multiple times We had no idea what was happening and there was no message communication about it from the hotel, Location and helpfulness of staff The staff went out of their way to explain details and features of the hotel and rooms

264178,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I left my pandora bracelet in room 308 when I rang to explain this There was apparently nothing you could do and it was not found I know I left it in the bathroom so It would have been there when it was cleaned The bracelet is so very precious to me as this was a gift from a family member who has now passed on I don t understand how it can t have been there when it was cleaned as I know I left it in the bathroom I am not Happy with your lack of service , It was in walking distance to the places we wanted to visit

264181,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We stayed for 2 nights and our morning on both days started with the fire alarm The alarm kicking off at 7 00 am on Sunday morning after a late night was particularly a shock to the system Luckily on both occasions it was a false alarm and there was no evacuation , You can t fault the location 
264182,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, N A, I was celebrating my birthday and when I went to my room there was a hand written note from the guest relations manager wishing me a happy birthday accompanying a cake It was a lovely gesture and so unexpected 
264183,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, When we arrived we were told that because we had booked through an external site that they did not have a twin room I requested this 8 months ago They were extremely rude and said that Ireland must have lots of space for twin rooms and that the Americans also complain a lot it was unbelievably ignorant They said they give priority to those who book through Radisson website We eventually got a twin room the following day They did not have non feathered duvets which I am allergic to and they said they were too busy to bring me a blanket Ii was the worst experience I have had in a hotel ,No Positive
264184,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, The courtesy of the staff What they didn t have was a room with twin beds available so they transferred us to the Raddison Grafton in Tottenham Court road
264185,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I was surprised to find that there were no hot drink making facilities in our double room nor was there a non slip mat for in the bath quite a high step in or bar of soap The towel radiator in the bathroom couldn t be adjusted which made the room quite warm , Superbly comfortable bed polite and very amiable staff the concierge and Keith in the restaurant in particular who always engaged with my seven year old daughter The breakfasts were excellent a wide range to select from and the finest omelette to order I have ever tasted We were thrilled on Day 2 to return to our room after a day out and find two swans fashioned out of towels on our bed the staff on the front desk had known that we were in London to see the Bolshoi perform Swan Lake the night before 
264186,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I had no idea that you could still smoke hotels so didn t know that you had to request a non smoking room We were on the mezzanine floor which is apparently a smoking floor You knew this by the smell the corridor outside our room smelt horrendous The view from our room was all the boiler pipes and that was it lovely So was this room value for money definitely not I mentioned both these points on checkout The guy on reception passed on my comments and I was told that the hotel had my email address and would be in touch I have not heard a thing PS I am a smoker so can t think how bad that must be for non smokers ,No Positive
264187,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Nothing, Excellent Location Staff friendly and helpful Room good size and clean Air Con very good and a must at these temperatures Breakfast was very good Highly recommended 5 Plus Will certainly stay at this hotel next time I am in that area of London 
264188,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Pillows were too high and no top sheet but that is a personal view , We stayed in a deluxe king room which was very spacious Breakfast was very good with a wide choice Complimentary 15 was a very nice gesture It was a perfect location for us

264191,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I decided to stay at Radisson Blue with my daughter as our 1st holiday together as mother and daughter as I thought we would be made to feel special unfortunately this was not so as when we went to check out Lukas who I imagine was the manager and who had checked us in had an air of arrogance around him as he thought we were with the lady in front of us who clearly had a single room as both himself and Remus struggled to sort out her tab Although the room was comfortable and the hotel very nice due to the arrogance of Lukas this left my daughter very upset and basically spoilt our holiday ,No Positive
264192,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Closet but no shelves drawers or hooks for clothes and no bars or hooks for damp towels My pet peeve trivial but I hate hotel hangers which you can t take out just with the little hook to detach from the wooden part The hotel should buy some cheap plastic hangers if they re concerned about theft , Great location Helpful staff Lunch in restaurant was good 
264193,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The hairdryer cable wasn t long enough to allow for the distance between the mirror and the nearest power socket so we were unable to style hair whilst drying We pointedthis out to the staff whilst there Otherwise a nice hotel in a great location ,No Positive
264194,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Checkin very slow Room not ready Took an hour to be moved to another room Room Had previously had a leak so carpet was wet and smelled , Rooms were comfortable with all facilities you could want

264196,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Economy room was very small 8 feet wide could be a problem for large people bed was smaller than queen size AC is weak and shuts off when key card for lights is removed we left a card in AC while gone during the day and it helped the cooling , There was a 115 volt outlet in room An affordable laundry 60 meters from the hotel on Bloomsbury St next to ATM with good exchange rate TV and WiFi worked great in our room Very friendly staff All marble tile bath with good lighting and lots of shelf space for toiletries Would stay here again we are not that large in size 
264197,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Smallest double room I have ever had Small bed jammed against the wall with barely room to walk around it nowhere to put our carry on sized suitcases Grubby tatty carpet Aircon that sounded like a jet engine Location does not nearly compensate for price paid for teeny poor quality room , Nice bathroom and lovely fluffy towels 
264198,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, we had to pay extra for the tele , Hotel was lovely and really close to the Dominion Theatre where we was headed that night Breakfast was beautiful
264199,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We asked for twin single beds and they did not deliver They said that that was a recommendation that they not have to follow because it was performed using booking com platform unbelievable They upgraded us for 80 pounds extra charge to another room with an extra bed that turn out to be a sofa unbelievable again , Very good location

264201,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Traffic virtually gridlocked outside all the time made it a little difficult for taxis Full English breakfast was average, Very near to the British Museum and 10 minutes brisk walk to Covent garden We found it inexpensive for a 5 star hotel
264202,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Rooms are small and need to be renovated Curtains are not practical , location is good but too much traffic at the Bloomsbursy crossing breakfast is good Food at the bar is good

264204,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I requested a twin room as travelling with a friend but this was not given to us and we had to share a double bed We were offered an up grade but would have to travel to a new hotel , Location near to Tottenham court road Breakfast was fabulous
264205,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I booked a standard double room and based on the photos provided by the hotel of the room standard and previous stays at the Radisson Blu I can only say I am extremely disappointed The photos were very misleading and I was allocated what can only be described as a box room at the end of the corridor It certainly wasn t what I was lead to believe the room would look like and barely provided adequate space to walk around the bed I have visited many different hotels within the chain and always been happy with my stay but this will unfortunately make me think twice about staying there again , The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the standard of the hotel as a whole was high
264206,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Layout of room from a practical point of view Hairdryer did not stretch to use mirror Mirror tucked In corner of room difficult to use Plug socket on far side of room so unable to plug anything in next to bed, Breakfast was excellent staff were friendly location brilliant couple of minute walk to tube Walking distance to many restaurants bars and shops Comfortable bed Great shower
264207,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Nothing, Definitely a classy place to stay great location clean nice foyer great standard rooms with space Proper free wifi everywhere appreciated 
264208,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The size of the room was the smallest I have stayed in and there was very little natural light from the window but I have not stayed in central London before and there was very little light from the window as it looked inwards checked in on line asked to select a room my wife went for a lower floor room as she is a smoker the pics of the room were misleading as in they look bigger and brighter We went to the bar at around 22 30 and there was no food or even a bar menu as they had finished and that was that apart from some nuts , The bed was comfy bar staff friendly
264209,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The cleaner kept knocking twice between 08 30 09 00 I appreciate there is a do not disturb button but I do not feel I should need to put this on so early in the morning ,No Positive
264210,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I regretfully had to cancel my booking due to an Easy Jet flight being cancelled and despite requesting to simply amend the booking to another night the hotel refused to do so resulting in my losing the full booking fee ,No Positive
264211,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We booked a twin bedded room which was small and very cramped Comfortable beds but rather small however the room was well equipped Twin room fine for children but would book a double room next time , The staff were absolutely lovely from reception to the dining staff We couldn t have been made more welcome Breakfast was excellent A huge choice on offer Rooms beautifully clean and well serviced Great location for visiting the British Museum The steak and lobster restaurant part of the hotel a brilliant meal and again lovely accommodating staff 
264212,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, My mother and I were in a double room with 2 single beds which were very uncomfortable and slanted downwards towards the outside of the bed The room was tiny with little room to maneuver in The hospitality manager did give us 14 off the room once he had established that our complaints were justified and that the beds were indeed slanted and uncomfortable , The staff was extremely nice and helpful the restaurant had very nice food and a beautiful buffet for breakfast 
264213,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I found it a little disappointing when checking out to see a long queue and when I asked the Concierge if there was an express checkout or box to deposit our room key he told me that no I would have to go to reception to check out I joined the queue but then spotted the box in the foyer where I quickly deposited my room key I felt slightly disappointed that a Concierge would not know that he had an express check out in his own foyer , The location was excellent as was the standard of the hotel 
264214,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Rooms are very well appointed but pretty small although probably quite normal for central London , Good peaceful medium sized hotel in a central location ideal for theatreland Friendly staff Good breakfast choices 
264215,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The hotel and staff were great if a little let down by the concierge on Saturday 18th June morning not very guest focused and slightly rude unlike he rest of the team , Great staff they made the hotel fantastic The breakfast team were efficient and so attentive Every member of staff I walked past acknoledged me said hello Great training and a great team 
264216,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, My room was very basic it was a very generic experence Had to ask to change rooms as my frist room did not have a window , Great location In house bar and restaurant was excellent
264217,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, hotel stuff should use the elevator in limited scale during morning rush hour, bedsheets towels high quality comfortable bed very nice breakfast offer clean and smart bathroom
264218,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Pillows They need to also offer one soft pillow per bed made of down or down alternative instead of only the super hard ones But it didn t effect my stay I just went without pillows , Was perfect Staff was great Bartenders were also awesome Room service was great The literal only complaint at all is the pillows Yikes Very hard Otherwise a perfect stay

264220,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The shower head was very high a hand held option would have helped and the access into the tub was a little awkward A mirror over the desk area would have been very convenient for using my curling iron , This was a wonderful location The staff were all very friendly and helpful The breakfasts were amazing The rooms were very clean and the bed was very comfortable It was an easy walk to many destinations and restaurants and taxis were always available at the front entry 
264221,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, check in took a little long but that s being really picky, did not have twin room left but upgraded to two single rooms which was good service The breakfast was excellent
264222,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The decor in the rooms is looking a little tired and there is not much natural light on the inner rooms , Staff extremely courteous and helpful Very friendly hotel and the breakfast was delicious Beds are super comfy and plenty of pillow options 
264223,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room was the tiniest room I have ever seen and had zero view over looked the back air conditioning units I have stayed in hotels with bathrooms bigger than this room It was also right next to the service elevator and door so there was staff going up and down past my room all day shouting at each other Also they decided to paint the halls one day without warning The chemical smell woke me up and gave me a migraine headache It was not good value for the price I paid even though I had apparently got a great deal I would have moved to another hotel if I had to pay full price for that room , The location was good close to shopping and the tube The breakfast buffet was included in the price The food was well stocked and fresh but there was only one 4 slice toaster so you had to make your toast first or you did not get any or would be done your meal by the time you got your toast The staff was good but on the last day I was there until the buffet ended 10 30am They didn t even give me a few extra minutes to finish the meal before they started vacuuming around me 
264224,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, A little disappointed with the size of the room and bathroom as we stayed in a king deluxe room , Good service and choice of food at breakfast Very comfortable bed Receptionist helpful 
264225,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Room was smaller than expected you can say very small On this review At the purpose of your trip you should have also business leisure, Very nice and helpful people Very clean Very good Breakfast 
264226,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Staff all look grumpy They have a habit just walking in your room without knocking I ignored the drilling noise I heard because I thought it was just that but it was the doorbell staff just walked in and acted like it was my fault , Location

264230,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Described rooms as doubles or two singles we both got 3 4 beds in small box rooms no way big enough for a couple to share therefore a very uncomfortable nights sleep On complaining the staff agreed we both had the smallest rooms available Really Then why allocate them to couples We were offered a free upgrade next time we stay which will be never ,No Positive
264231,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, N A, We were in London for walk the walk the location was excellent and after walking for 26 2 miles the bed was a dream Very pleasant stay the staff were very friendly and helpful we ate in the hotel restaurant Scoff and Banter again superb food and cocktails 
264232,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, nothing , The location was excellent Very close to the British Museum The single room is small but very clean The shower is large and very nice The breakfast buffet was excellent
264233,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room was very small as in particular was the bathroom but we were not allowed to open the windows for fresh air and had to rely on the air conditioning to keep cool which we did not like at all , Excellent supper in the dinning room 
264234,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Despite booking a twin room two months earlier I was given a very small double room with a tiny bathroom which I was not happy with as sharing with my daughter Very unhappy about the reason given for this as told this was Booking com s fault I have not experienced this problem before I had picked a hotel with twin availability I expect more for 215 per night , Breakfast and location
264235,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The windows in the rooms were very draughty to the point that sitting beside them in the restaurant was impossible without a scarf around my neck this was also the same in our room , Very good concierge service Very helpful and willing 
264236,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Pillows were very large and stiff gave us neck ache Feathers would have been better King size room was quite small not much room All plugs in one place not spread throughout room , Location was excellent Staff were helpful Was clean and in good decorative order 
264237,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, the only issue I had was that the hairdryer was secured inside the drawer which was fine except that the mirror was nowhere near the drawer just a little thing but it was irritating Also I discovered to only spray deodorant in the bathroom as using it in the bedroom set of the smoke detector not good , Staff were very accommodating really enjoyed the cooked breakfast 
264238,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I booked rooms for my wife and me and for our friends We paid very much so our expectations where high Me and my wife got a decent room but not better than it should for the price However our friends first got a really small room that shouldn t be given to anybody for that kind of price It was really small and poor looking They complained and got a new room but still it was small and the double bed was 120 cm That is not acceptable for for a price over 200 pounds per night Even for us which were upgraded it was not good enough for that price With this kind of worn out hotell prices should be considerably lower Its a shame for what I thought was a Radisson standard This hotell has teared down my imagine of a Radisson minimum standard because it was really far away from my perceptions , The location and the very good breakfast Most personell was Great and behaved excellent 
264239,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Our room was small nowhere to put our suitcases Tiny bathroom too and shower cabinet not ideal very small and shower head on ceiling rather than on a side wall , Fantastically quiet We had a room on Floor 6 Great breakfast everything you could think of as well as more on a menu included in the price 
264240,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Size of the room the noisiness of the fire doors closing all night view of the air vents On a Sunday night I feel sure there was a better located room available , Location of the hotel friendliness of the staff helpfulness of the staff
264241,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, One small lift is insufficient for a hotel of this size and standard , Upgrade at no extra cost and all the facilities and comfort you expect from a quality hotel Breakfast was the best I ve tasted at home or abroad The hotel is within easy walking distance of the more lively and interesting areas of central London Soho Covent Garden and theatreland 
264242,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Our only criticism of the room is that the bathroom was very cramped it was quite difficult to get in and out of the shower it would not suit someone with any sort of mobility problem or a slightly bigger person than average , When looking for a great hotel near Covent Garden and theatres my best friend and me found this gem of a hotel as it seemed just perfect for us and it didn t disappoint Very professional staff greetings were all friendly from reception to dining to bar from the moment we checked in until we left Our room was spacious the beds very comfy the furnishings were clean not worn looking and everything was extremely comfortable Despite the room being street side with double windows equipped we encountered no noise distraction whatsoever The hotel is placed in an excellent spot in the Heart of Westend within walking distance to everything It s barely 5 minutes from Tottenham Court Road tube station literally just around the corner from the British Museum and a pleasant easy walk to all the theatres in the Westend The concierge kindly held our luggage the next day when we went out for the day before travelling home so we could enjoy some more window shopping in Covent Garden without lugging a case about Breakfast was buffet style and very delicious freshly cooked and there was a wide range which would suit all We will definitely be staying here again and won t hesitate to suggest the hotel to anyone All in all our short stay was a success 
264243,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, One lift in the foyer wasn t really adequate especially at check in and check out times It s OK to use the stairs if you re not carrying luggage but otherwise a long and frustratiing wait for the lifts Bar prices were absolutely outrageous compared to other London Hotels we have stayed in , Staff very friendly nice clean comfy rooms 
264244,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Rather small room seemed smaller than the London norm and not as good as Radisson Bloomsbury across the street All seems tired and in need of repairs little repairs Public carpets stained , Service oriented staff upon arrival when it rained for information Great pillows Good windows against the noise but stuffy inside and loud if the conditioner is turned on 
264245,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Standard rooms are really extremely tiny , Excellent breakfast with good choice and unusually high quality ingredients Helpful friendly staff Comfortable and reasonably spacious room once we had upgraded from the box like standard room we had originally booked The hotel is very well placed for the West End and Covent Garden Would definitely stay here again 
264246,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room was in the back of the hotel and very small but that is usual in central London The price to pay for very central location if visiting in the Bloomsbury area , Location was excellent wifi service good clean room good breakfast
264247,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, The staff were professional and friendly The room was very nice and no noise to disturb us There was plenty of choice for breakfast and all hot food was fresh and hot 
264248,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Room was smaller than the pictures Getting in to the shower involved a tight squeeze between the toilet and having to step into the bath no walk in separate shower , Great location modern clean staff were helpful and well presented On checkout the staff were arguing between each other regarding going to work and making friendships whilst the other member said they don t come to work to make friends 
264249,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Rooms were kind of small beds were rock hard didn t sleep well I asked for 2 beds and the room was supposed to be a double room The shower was hatd to get into I also asked for a room with a view and had a view of a brick building , The rooms were very clean 
264250,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, In need of some staff training hadn t checked out and member of staff proceeded to enter our room despite us informing him we were still present He still tried to gain access even after me he was aware of this wanting to check our window frames Had to ask him to return when we d checked out unacceptable Also cooked breakfast serve yourself only one type of egg on offer cold do better , Located very close to Dominion theatre and other places to visit
264251,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Couldn t do early book in as it wouldn t go past upgrade room this screen was blank so couldn t upgrade Front desk was no help when we got to hotel No bedside lamps Bit of a bugger when one wants to read other one needs to sleep Over head bed light flickered very annoying was asked if we wanted to change rooms but at 9pm who wants to pack up a room No mirror where the hairdryer was fixed Trouser press didn t work Nicest hotel we have stayed in but room was disappointing , Bed comfy Room clean Very nice breakfast
264252,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room was really small and made to feel even more so due to it having a sloping wall ceiling It was more like an attic room The bar area did not have very comfortable seating, The breakfast was good The receptionist was friendly and helpful
264253,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Very surprised that an extra 50 was pre authorised for each room we booked and no mention of this was stated at check in Took eight days and two telephone calls for the pre authorisation to be released Longest period for any hotel we have stayed in Spoilt the stay really , Very nice stay Rooms small but comfy Breakfast excellent Drinks very expensive All staff very friendly Good location for tube stations 
264254,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Expensive for what it is some tiles damaged in the bathroom and the room is just big enough to have the double bed in it The channels on the tv are wrong not in the normal order like you are aboard trying to watch tv , The bed was really lovely and had a view of the shard on the 6th floor Breakfast was amazing 
264255,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, At lunchtime I ordered a toasted sandwich and thus wasn t cooked properly and had to send it back I ordered a chicken ceasar salad on the evening and it was a bed of lettuce with 4 tiny strips of chicken with no dressing it wasn t great We had to move rooms because the first one had a big draft from the window and the second room wasn t clean the bathroom was tiny the bathroom was noisy and the sheets smelt unclean the room was terrible , The breakfast was fantastic the staff were friendly and treated both my son and I very well The staff were excellent 
264256,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Room was quite noisy due to gap between double glazing and window frame , Breakfast and comfortable bed along with convenience of location for all we wished to do whilst in London
264257,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The breakfast was abit dissappointing didn t really have much to offer, The hotel was close to nearby tourist attractions Room was clean and cosy 
264258,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, Right from check in to check out the staff were superb Nothing was too much trouble for them We were intending to eat out both nights of our two night stay but ended up having lunch one day and an evening meal the next because of the quality the food and service 
264259,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Booked several hotels this weekend My 90 year old mother had a heart attack so family reunion had to be postponed This was the only hotel that would not allow us to change or cancel even with mitigating circumstances Then persisted in harassing us with emails and texts while we were at the hospital and had already informed them of situation ,No Positive
264260,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The small room, You couldn t swing a cat in the room Honestly a door way 5 five foot walk way Bathroom to left and about another foot your 4 3 double bed and that s it but clean If your over weight you ll find the shower cubical very small I only slept in the room got up showered and went out as its London city so for night sleep it s fine 
264261,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Bedroom a little on the small size but adequate , Brilliant location very close to the Underground theatres Oxford street and walking distance to many sightseeing attractions 
264262,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The smallest hotel room I ve ever been in Not worth the money we paid And service was poor 2nd morning breakfast , Good location and very nice communial areas
264263,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Our room was quite run down especially bathroom , Very helpfull Staff Allright breakfast Excellent location very close to Covent Garden and Soho but quiet street non the less 
264264,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Minor things It all depends on the room you stay in Overall the experience is rather positive which made me come back for the second time , Great location great breakfast friendly staff decent WiFi 
264265,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The usual London experience of a tiny room with a tiny bed but well laid out and so quite manageable There s a bit of traffic noise but quite minimal at night Only one tiny lift again not unexpected for a London hotel Had the irritating modern bar fridge where you get charged if you so much as touch any product so you can t use it to store your own stuff , Brilliant location across the road from the British Museum a short walk from the Tube within a short walk of the Bloomsbury bookshops posh Fitzrovia restaurants Soho the theatre district Oxford St shopping and a gentle 20 minute stroll to Trafalgar Square Just down the road from a chemist and a supermarket just round the corner from a laundry so useful if you re on the road for a while Lovely staff friendly and helpful Fabulous breakfast in the hotel restaurant enough to keep you going through until dinner time Wifi was reliable and speedy 
264266,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We booked this hotel thorough booking com for one night as we had a show booked in London s Westend After a lot of research we chose this hotel on the reviews left by other customers We paid over 200 for one night in what was described as a Deluxe King room On arrival it was nothing like the description There was a mild unpleasant odour the room was very small the carpet was stained the paint above the tiny bathroom was peeling away and the view wasn t great The room was very tired and dated I was very disappointed My partner decided we had nothing to loose to so he expressed our views to the lady on reception She really delivered She upgraded us to the Edwardian across the road at no extra cost This room was just what I had expected from the description and reviews I had read previous to booking The original was by no way value for money or as expected We were happy with the upgraded room but would not be recommending the kenilworth due to value for money and the tired room , The location was within walking distance to the centre of London and the west end theatres 
264267,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Room was a bit noisy had to close bathroom door to eliminate noise Very minor problem though only mentioning it because you asked , Room was comfortable but small however we were in the centre of London and the price you pay represents location Comfortable bed and slept like a baby The seat we were given at breakfast originally was not really suitable to sit as you were right next to neighbouring table and no room to sit if you sat on the bench beside the dumb waiter We moved to another table Breakfast was beautiful and everything was there that you needed We walked round London in the morning and after a very long walk went to collect our bags from the concierge I felt a bit wobbly on my feet and sat down in reception to a very refreshing watermelon water All in all a lovely friendly clean comfortable hotel We stayed at the Radison Blu because it was ideally situated to the theatre as we were seeing a show We are keeping an eye out for other shows in the area so we can have an excuse to visit again 
264268,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room space is not big enough I also attempted to extend my stay but to move to standard double room alas the bed is certainly too small for double , I love the cleanliness and the nearness to spectacular locations The staff courtesy and attentiveness is per excellence They are always willing to be of assistance 
264269,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The rooms were tiny not as depicted on the website when I booked a double room After moving from my first room due to a problem with the toilet I was given another room that was all plastic furniture of blue and white no desk just a plastic work top and plastic chair like I was in a completely different hotel Disappointing as I paid 129 for the night in a supposedly 4 star hotel ,No Positive
264270,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, There was a stain on the bathroom floor It didn t affect us but looked a little unsightly , The bed was incredibly comfy and the pillows were massive Had both bath and shower which i love Breakfast was amazing So much choice 
264271,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room was rather small but was okay for one night When I booked I had requested a twin room with two single beds but they had booked us into a double However they did have a twin available , Great location comfy beds and excellent breakfast Although we overlooked the main road there was no traffic noise We were within walking distance of the British Museum and Covent Garden so there was plenty to see nearby The range of food available for breakfast was very good and the staff were very helpful We would definitely choose to stay here again 
264272,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The double room we originally booked was absolutely tiny It was like a walk in wardrobe We had to pay extra for a business room on the top floor which was what I would consider to be a normal sized room The photos on booking com are very misleading The mugs weren t replenished after our room was cleaned so we had to drink out of the cups in the bathroom There was dust floating around in the room and the leather headboard had splatter marks on it We weren t allowed to open the window The shower temperature kept fluctuating while my fiance was having a shower in the morning The lifts are very small and there aren t enough of them for the size of the building , Excellent location Very good breakfast buffet lots of choice Concierge to store luggage Comfortable room once we had upgraded to a business room on the 7th floor Our room was very quiet and we hardly heard any noise from outside or other guests Polite helpful staff

264277,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Small double bed No bath just a shower but perhaps I should have specified that Minor problem with window blind which didn t work would only stay fully down Check in and out especially in was very slow I have stayed in the Kenilworth on a number of occasions over the years , It was close to the Bloomsbury hotel and the staff were generally helpful especially Hannah Joel Avi Schlagman Both really worked hard to resolve a problem and as a result we had an excellent function 
264278,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We enjoyed our stay and can think of nothing we didn t like Thank you , Very comfy bed in a gorgeous room All staff very friendly and helpful Tasty breakfast

264283,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Our room had air conditioning but no opening windows It would be better if natural fresh air was available , Clean comfortable room Plentiful breakfast 
264284,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, As mentioned on departure we had issues on Sunday morning which we were not happy with The toilet would not flush and so was backing up The shower screen would not close properly so the water caused a huge puddle on the marble floor which was so dangerous and also just after 9am the workmen started in the room next door lots of banging and chatting I appreciate they need to do their jobs but I do not appreciate such disturbances in such a plush hotel I appreciate that you upgraded us as it was my husbands birthday but I do not expect such things in a hotel with as high a reputation as yours had I paid 59 for a holiday inn then maybe but I paid 170 and therefore feel it needs to be mentioned I was promised that I would be contacted but I am still waiting , Lovely room Lovely Breakfast
264285,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Our room was on the small size and we had a hand held shower because we had a sloped roof Unfortunately they were updating soft furnishings on our level and they began at 8am , The hotel was very clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly We had a drink in the bar restaurant and it was a very pleasant area Breakfast was very good and lots of choices 
264286,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Unfriendly an incompetent checkin strange checkout completely different for two identically biked and paid rooms Just third class service for breakfast and overcrowded dining room You had to ask for everything three times eg butter milk a knife or a spoon Just lowest class Heating in Bathroom didn t work February Was here because other hotel across the street was booked out Now I know why , Close to the west end etc but there are nicer alternatives for this priced or less felt Hotel

264288,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, Breakfast was fab Hotel has reciprocal deal with the Raddison over the road too so you can breakfast in either and charge drinks to your rooms at both Was good for us as we had friends staying at the other hotel and we could all have breakfast together 
264289,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, There are a number of things to be aware of room 707 is the smallest double room I have seen with a sloping ceiling which would have made it impossible to get out of bed without banging your head I immediately asked reception to change our room she responded that there was no other rooms available unless I wanted an upgrade for 50 pounds I insisted I didn t intended to pay so she miraculously found room 120 when she showed me the room which was bigger and had a large bay window overlooking the main road I asked her if this was noisy and she responded not at all We moved our things to this room and quickly got showered and dressed for dinner before our theatre ladies if you wash your hair the mirror isn t near the hairdryer After a wonderful pretheatre dinner at Brown s resteraunt highly recommend and a great show we headed back to the hotel bar be warned 2 pints of lager 2 bottles of lager a decaf American and a Bacardi and coke nearly 35 pounds I know this is central London but I think 4 pounds for a small americano is extortionate Then to bed to unfortunately listen to a very busy road with sirens motorbikes and buses eventually sleep arrived at 4am unfortunately woken up at 7am with dustbin Lorry s not good This visit was a disaster but to be fair to the management the following morning when I complained they did compensate us without any problems they genuinely apologised and I did feel they meant it so well done to the reception and duty manager for dealing with Come on radison blu we expect better advertise some of your rooms as Been small doubles and price them accordingly same for your noisy rooms , The breakfast was good

264291,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The ensuite smelt of sewage and was unclean The room was very cold and had a huge draft blowing through the window Room service was prompt but the food was absolutely terrible Having arrived late with a child we ordered a pizza the was nothing short of a microwaved soggy supermarket pizza the smelt foul and tasted even worse Although I didn t expect a great view the black air conditioning unit taking up the entire window covered in pigeon poo was not pleasant , The bed was comfortable and the breakfast was excellent Staff were friendly and helpful 
264292,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Allocated room was extremely small and bathroom only had a shower which was hard to enter due to proximity of sink Gin was served as doubles explains their extortionate price Replacement room larger with bath but must have been a smoking allowed room, Breakfast was worthwhile Staff were very friendly Location was very good

264306,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The night before I left home I received a phone call from the hotel saying that they had my booking but they didn t have a room I was shocked When I managed to regain my wits I protested that I had booked the hotel a month in advance and planned my whole time in London around the fact I could walk everywhere from the hotel He was planning to put me in another area entirely Then he backed down and said I would have a room I m wondering now what s wrong with booking dot com Don t they have enough clout to forbid such practices , Location location location

264311,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Nothing to dislike always plenty of staff around reception Bought drinks from the bar and put them onto my room bill and was charged a service fee that s London I guess , Central location handy for all sightseeing and shows
264312,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, One small complaint I m grateful that they have a gym but the rooms that house the exercise equipment are tiny They have only two treadmills a bike and an elliptical not much for a hotel of this size On the other hand I never had to wait for a machine so perhaps this is sufficient , The hotel staff is extremely accommodating We asked to change rooms as the original one they booked us into seemed a bit cramped They happily put us in a more spacious room another Deluxe King that whose floor plan was configured differently The concierge was extremely helpful in booking a cab to the airport Also the hotel has great amenities including a 110 volt outlet in addition to multiple 220 volt outlets The full breakfast was generous fresh and delicious 
264313,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, Amazing location friendly staff breakfast selection was brilliant Staff went to extra lengths as I told them it was my boyfriend s birthday Really impressed 
264314,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Room had been inadequately serviced when I arrived Rubbish on desk no free water window unlocked and alarm left set went off at 5 am Several times room was not properly cleaned Bed was rock hard and pillows were too high cricking my neck Topper put on bed helped a little but no alternative pillows available so had to use a cushion I complained twice and was offered a free upgrade on my next stay Like I m ever staying here again , Location free wifi friendly helpful concierge breakfast ok 
264315,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, My room was the room they give there staff it was crap tiny and right by the lift which was inconveniently loud one of the f b team laughed i got stuck in there not so funny when you pay for it though Room service was not till 5am i tried at 3am and got a call at 4 30 by a guy who clearly just decided he would be nice and make me something but even that had a downside as they couldnt even give me water with it Finally the cleanliness my shower was welcoming with hair still in it watermarks on the glass and the little shampoos and stuff missing if you ask me the staff housekeeping team are crap Im not one to complain face to face so i hope my comment helps people make there decision , Location and staff
264316,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, If it weren t because this booking is non refundable i don t think I would of stayed there for that long , The staff at the reception were really nice and helpful 
264317,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Told by barman that Guinness from a can was draught Guinness when ordering a drink Like most hotels too hot , Comfortable and well located Very good breakfast 
264318,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I could not be checked in earlier as requested as I arrived at 09 30 having flown in at 07 20 albeit that this was due to unavailability of a room at the time I was initially checked into a tiny room with no view and that did not have a safety deposit box as per my booking Finally when I requested to be moved to a different room as per my order my laptop bag with the laptop inside was misplaced thankfully it was found with everything inside intact , The location is perfect just a short walking distance from Tottenham Court Road train station The food is great both at the in house restaurant and the Steak Lobster restaurant 
264319,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I received a phone call from Reception asking me if I was enjoying my stay which came at 11 00 at night If it had happened the night before I would have been awoken from a deep sleep Luckily I was awake when I was called on the second night of my stay or I would have been cross , It is super comfortable and has a relaxing atmosphere The staff members are unfailingly helpful and pleasant 
264320,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, It was my 30th birthday husband rang ahead and spoke to someone to arrange champagne and flowers in room as a surprise and it didn t happen Total let down and husband felt bad it not happening, Lovely location and restaurant staff were lovely
264321,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Few details to be improved for perfection New pillows too big and too hard on our taste not comfortable at all that were the only model existing in the hotel Air conditionning system in our room a bit noisy and delivering cold air straight on to the bed so in a very incomfortable way Single slow lift for seven floors creating congestions in the morning , Hotel situation hotel comfort service nice and reactive people breakfast and bar in evening
264322,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room service was so bad no service if you ask for something they never bring it or very late they never frequently place what you need in the room like suger coffee cups, Liked the hotel because it was near to Oxford street
264323,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, Beautiful breakfast make sure you book this at time of booking Well worth it Bed very comfortable and staff very attentive Location spot on 5 minutes from Oxford street 
264324,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We booked into sister hotel I had requested non smoking rooms but all they had was smoking rooms We accepted it but when we got to the rooms the smell was disgusting We went to reception and they very kindly upgraded us to the sister hotel with two new rooms which were amazing I can t understand why smoking rooms are even allowed in hotels , Very good position for theatres
264325,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, the bedroom had a door to get to another bedroom and the people were very noisy could hear every conversation till 1 am not really good should have a soundproof door , the room was really cosy everything needed was there all very clean 
264326,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The 24hr room service menu wasn t actually available when calling the front desk many of the options were not available It also seemed the person at front desk was making the sandwich and not dedicated kitchen staff It took him 20 mins to go to the kitchen to check supplies and then another 20 mins to ring me to tell me what he didn t have I was pretty disappointed at that , The hotel is located in a very nice convienent location to many tourist attractions transport links including a main popular shopping spot Oxford St 
264327,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Room was very small just got a double bed and en suite in Breakfast was chaotic was a buffet but had to wait for everything plates food drinks etc so took a lot longer than it should have, Good location
264328,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Sadly the traffic kept us awake until around 2am Located on a seemingly busy junction vehicles were sounding their horns at each other when becoming impatient resulting in a chorus conversation of drivers through their car horns at each other , Overall a well appointed and comfortable hotel in a great geographical location
264329,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Only had a small window tucjed away in the corner if the room which looked out onto the roof ventilation system, We didnt get the double room that we had booked so management upgraded our stay in their sister hotel adjacent which was great
264330,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Breakfast on Sunday morning was an absolute shambles Breakfast was included in our room rate so I had already paid for it If I was paying at the hotel I would not have paid at all , Staff at reception were really good

264332,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The bathrooms were very dated will mildew on the marble The room was very noisy and we were woken very early by the cleaning which was persistent The room was opposite the lift so we did not get any sleep, The hotel is very nice downstairs and the staff were very helpful
264333,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We were not advised that there would be building work on our floor and were woken up at 8am with drilling and banging If we had known this we would not have booked the hotel as it didn t make for a relaxing stay Wish we had demanded our money back this was a surprise present for my boyfriend s birthday but unfortunately it was ruined The staff didn t seem bothered that we weren t happy The bathroom and bedroom were very small for the price paid ,No Positive
264334,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Staff left me waiting for almost an hour in reception waiting to check in Other guests were getting rooms straight away Staff not being proactive Charged me more than what I booked on your site No reason and no response when calling Called 10 times No response after going through choices and one time I spoke to someone disconnected call instead of forwarding me on to payments team as promised Air conditioning was not working Hot box , Location That s about it Will leave poor feedback on other social media
264335,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Very expensive bed was rock solid staff very robotic no information on where to go for breakfast mini bar was ridiculously priced cooked breakfast was buffet so not fresh and poorly cooked bacon was burnt shampoo pump didn t work in shower room was very noisy with works going outside window which wasn t informed of lift difficult to use with room key needed to get to work difficult to find way round to next stairs to get downstairs guessing game no bathrobe in room which you expect for price aimed more at business use , Good location
264336,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Small single room Shower tiny Larger frames wouldn t fit Didn t get explanation about card operated lifts before getting into it and i hate lifts Lighting unattractive in room A side lamp would be less harsh , Smart foyer Quality fittings Aircon worked Nice breakfast 
264337,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Bathroom very small noisey closing corridor door outside room key card in lift was awkward to use Gym very small no room to use loose weights Restaurant food very average , Location and proximity to Oxford St staff friendly
264338,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, 1 Staff variable one Nigerian guy particularly rude maybe doesn t know better but otherwise ok 2 They have this bad habit of ringing the room door bell which is very loud at around 9 pm to check on the room I just happened to be snoozing and they rang the bell and immediately opened the door whist i was in my birthday suit They scared the living daylights out of me really a not needed service 3 Expensive even considering location, Location Cleanliness Comfortable bed
264339,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, Everything the staff were helpful I called room service as I ran out of tea and they bought me some up straight away There was lots of free treats in the room which was very nice and the breakfast was delicious I have already booked a room for my trip in January

264341,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Bathroom inappropriate for deluxe room really only a small wet room Room really too small to accommodate a sofa Staff at breakfast ineffective breakfast expensive for the buffet approach adopted Children allowed to run around in dining room, Informal restaurant Staff at Dinner efficient and helpful keen to please
264342,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, Bathroom and bedroom were finished to a beautiful standard Staff were very friendly and helpful Really great location right near all the shops and theatres 
264343,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Had to endure a double bed as 2 single friends and was told we didn t get our request of twins as we had booked with an online company which even if true isn t very professional to say , Friendly staff immaculately clean and a great breakfast included in the price so excellent value
264344,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The addition of an optional service fee to my room service bill which was not pointed out either in my room or at checkout I tipped separately directly to the waiter and was not aware of this being added The blinds they need better screening than blinds up or down I could see into the rooms opposite and they could into my room whenever the blinds were up , Friendly helpful staff
264345,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We booked a wheelchair accessible room and the room we were allocated we could not even get the wheelchair into The concierge realised I think as he showed up with keys to an alternative room This was big enough to accomodate the wheelchair nicely The problem was that the floor in the bathroom was tiled and exceedingly slippy Totally unsuitable for my disabled husband to shower safely and no grab rails I ended up having to put towels on the floor so he could walk to the carpeted area to get dried which was not ideal For accessible rooms these things are essential The lift was also really small and tight to fit a wheelchair and additional person and baggage , The staff in particluar the concierge were excellent Very helpful The restaurant in the hotel was fabulous Bed comfy 
264346,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, Great location Quick access to all shopping on Oxford Street and 15 minute walk to Leister Square and Covent Garden Only 20 min walk to Piccadilly Very safe and well lit neighborhoods 
264347,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, room is small bed is too small , Location perfect near metro station and many buses pass by breakfast is fantastic The staff gave me a London pass voucher for 2 persons 
264348,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room size made it uncormfortable to spend much time in It was tiny and also the bathroom was the same The pillows were uncormfortable also For the price I paid I would have thought a room of adequate size wasn t too much to ask for , The location was good The breakfast selection and quality was excellent It was a nice touch on arrival at reception to receive an iced glass of fruit flavoured water 
264349,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The rate change confirmed to me by Booking com was not communicated to the hotel However the hotel did provide the lower rate on production of the written rate change confirmation , Excellent location breakfast was great 
264350,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, But muddling when checking in not sure if it was slight language barrier but the lady kept saying we were checking out in the morning I was trying to explain wewere booked for 2 nights she kept replying that checkout was in the morning left it at that ,No Positive
264351,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, No double glazing on one window hence excessive noise from 6 00am Bathroom extractor fan not working Room on the smaller size, Location was good staff friendly clean
264352,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The room I was put in was no bigger than a cupboard the bed was uncomfortably hard there was barely room to place your items Ordered room service and it was poor quality yet pricey The steak was fatty and over cooked Overall a horrid place to stay , Walkable distance to central London sights
264353,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth,No Negative, Amazing reception staff In particular we had the best support by Mrs Graziella So scarce to find such welcoming personnel and she went the extra mile for us helping us in every possible way in a dedicate and caring way

264356,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Had to move room 4 times cannot believe they have smoking rooms or rooms that are smoked in and still smell This was a terrible first impression Reception staff did try there hardest to rectify and in the end found an ok room but you cannot always take away the initial feeling And the wasted hour of relocating to room after room , Location was great for being in town minutes from all 
264357,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The only dislike was the restaurant maybe I was unlucky to be there when the chef had a really bad day the food was terrible normally I would have told the waiter to bring me a new plate but I was sure it would have been waste of time , Nice hotel Nice staff placed in the middle of almost
264358,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, That I could not stay more , The staff at the front desk with no exceptions are great and helpful The location is fantastic facing the back of China Town but no smelly cooking and Piccadilly Circus is just a stone throw 
264359,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We had a tiny room on the top floor which was described as a standard double The eaves were so low I had to duck to get to my side if the bed There was tea coffee facilities provided but one milk pot had gone off which suggested it was very old , Great location Lovely atmosphere in hotel Great breakfast 
264360,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I got the deluxe single room which was a tight space but not too unexpected for central London but I shudder to think what a tiny room a normal single room is like The gym and change area was also tiny , Great Wifi delicious breakfast great location 
264361,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Gym was dreadful Only booked the hotel as thought it had a gym It was a box with 4 or 5 machines in Rooms little dated used Needs a freshen up Tiles round bathroom not clean, comfy bed great staff in reception
264362,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We were at first given a terrible room 6ft by 8ft the staff admitted that booking with booking com gets you the worst rooms Hotel very tired and not clean , The staff are trying their best and are very nice people 
264363,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The restaurant attached was not great The food was below average for the money Didn t like the way they charged a 12 5 service charge when the menu said it was optional but the staff insisted it had to be there Our bathroom had had a wet room Not ideal with small children , Our room was a great size especaially as we had to factor in a travel cot Great location Only 2 minutes walk from British museum and Dominion theatre 
264364,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Room was extremely small for a deluxe king room Carpet was dirty Found hair inside the bed which wasn t mine I was extremely disappointed with the size and cleanliness of the room specially when an offer to be upgraded to the deluxe room was sent to me by booking com and I did pay more and get myself upgraded , Location fact that breakfast was included has a small but decent gym They gave me a 15 pound credit on the usage of their bar and restaurant Was happy to get an early check in at 10 AM 
264365,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The bed was terribly uncomfortable and the room layout inconvenient Ridiculous cushions on the bed with no where to put them , The location was fabulous
264366,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The pillows very hard on an extremely comfortable bed , Great location really friendly staff good value for money for a quality hotel small but perfectly equipped room Would definitely stay again

264368,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The breakfast was the same every morning so if you are staying for more than 3 nights it becomes very boring Although there was an english breakfast it was not so tasty we ve had better ones but it was ok The food of the room service wasn t so tasty too The food issue was the Achilles heel of the hotel evereything else was perfect , The location is great 2 minutes walk to Oxford st and the tube 10 minutes to the Soho 5 minutes from the British Museum and 10 15 minutes to Covent garden The room was very clean comfort and spacious Delux king room and the staff was pleasant 
264369,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Limited view in certain rooms Preferred the Deluxe King with street view Thanks Lukasz, Great location on a relatively quiet street 5 minutes walk to Oxford Street Close proximity to theaters shops bars and restaurants Tottenham Court Road underground just round the corner 
264370,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Niggly little things like the basin taps water was a dribble and air con was quite noisy No tea cups in room Etc, The rooms are smallish but ok The air con was a tad noisy so coulldnt have it on at night However that didnt ditract from the stay Value for money Just about
264371,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, The upgraded room seemed to be a smoking room faintly Booking com did not pass on our booking notes 10 Year anniversary which was a shame , Location for Covent Garden and West End was great The staff were very friendly and upgraded us to a larger room as there were no doubles available 
264372,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Only one person on reception and he blanked us there was no one else for him to see and we made it obvious we were waiting A lady walked in several minutes after us and he saw her straight away and completely ignored us Very poor first impression of the hotel , Comfortable bed and well prepared breakfast of variety

264374,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We were in London to celebrate out anniversary and had booked this hotel for its location When we arrived to check in we were told that they had overbooked hoping for cancellations and had no room for us They offered us a smoking room which we said we would look at but as soon as we opened the door the smell of smoke and cigarettes was overwhelming We went back downstairs and were told they had no other rooms for us no upgrades were offered and we were shipped off to another of their hotels up by Euston Station Given that we had planned to walk a lot while there we ended up spending more than we had planned as we were too far away to walk and had to take the tube The room we were given at the Grafton hotel was ok but the window did not shut so there was a lot of boose from the air conditioning on the adjacent building and people shouting late at night and early morning , Location was good for theatre district
264375,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, Air con was very noisy It was either too cold or not cold enough Hair dryer was broken but a replacement was found Staff forgot to bring up ice after calling 3 times so went to the bar to collect it myself , Very comfortable bed friendly staff excellent breakfast and free WiFi

264378,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, We had been given London Pass and was told that the signed document will work where its supposed to work but when we went to Tower Hill they pointed out that we had to get a plastic card from somewhere in Leicester Square which meant it spoilt our 2 hrs and eventually we could not see tower Hill Such uninformed staff Ac wasnt working properly , Good bar 
264379,Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilworth, I was looking forward to staying here but was shocked to be given a box room which was smaller than my bathroom That was all they had left apparently We were moved to the Radisson Hampshire hotel but had to complain there was a strong smell in the room of sewerage it was just awful We were moved again to a room with king size bed which was disappointing as I wanted a twin room The staff were helpful but I wouldn t stay at either of these hotels again We weren t the only guests being moved there were 3 other couples in front of us all having problems ,No Positive
