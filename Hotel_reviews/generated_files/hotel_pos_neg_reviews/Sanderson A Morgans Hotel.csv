204103,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, There was a fire alert during my stay and a call to evacuate the hotel Many of us got up from bed to do so Staff assistance and fire signing was poor and I suspect not to requirements We had no information that we could return to the hotel after what proved a false alert I was offered a discount on food but not accommodation when I pointed this out , Location was good hotel staff friendly 
204104,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Bathrooms were extremely dirty and unclean it seems that the house cleaning staff are not doing their job or the management is not keeping a tab on the flew knees of the rooms The first bedroom on the 5th floor where I stayed first Night was extremely noisy Very poor experience , Location
204105,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Clearer info re NCP car park it was very expensive would ve been cheaper if we had booked ahead but we assumed the hotel would get a reduced rate , The staff were exceptionally helpful welcoming some of the best we have come across in many years of travelling

204107,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Make sure you make the mad hatter s tea an event rather than a quick stop as it is awfully expensive and needs to be enjoyed leisurely , The staff was extremely friendly and helpful The rooms were clean and had all the creature comforts A great place to have a unique and memorable stay with friends 
204108,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, We stayed on Saturday night and the long bar was quite busy with non guests The hustle and bustle couldn t be heard from our room but could from the restaurant , We were checked in by Paris who was absolutely fantastic My wife had just undergone laser eye surgery and we arrived at the hotel 4 hours before we were due to check in Paris not only managed to get us a room straight away but also sent complimentary champagne to the room a few hours later which helped me deal with my wife s symptoms The blackout blinds in the room were fantastic bright lights are a no no after laser eye surgery and more generally the room was of good quality and comfortable We dined at the hotel in the evening and were able to sit in the garden terrace despite hotel being busy The food was good quality tasty and well presented The level of service and general friendliness of the staff was very impressive I d stay here again without question 
204109,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, We arrived 2 hours prior to official check in and were proposed to be allowed in immediately if we agreed to book for an upgraded and more expensive room if our budget allowed it , The atmoshpere of the hotel and its interior decorating was different from classic hotels which made the experience extra special Also the room was decorated in the same style which made it a nice place to be The bed was very good to sleep in Staff was very kind and helpfull 
204110,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, The places is tatty and falling to pieces so 1990 contemporary come on spend some money and refurbish it 3 star with 5 star price , The bar man and the girl Who checked us out were nice 
204111,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, I paid almost 400 GBP for a very small room expecting that I will have a quite sleep as my plane was early in the morning There was a baby crying all night next to my room and I could not sleep at all The walls were so think I could hear all conversation and the crying I complained in the morning to the person in the reception and her answer was I am sorry I know that the walls are thin So why do yo charge so much money then ,No Positive

204113,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Upon arrival mid afternoon I met friends at the long bar for a drink and a snack There were four staff standing around chatting rather than serving us and once the food finally arrived at the bar it was cold and average quality for the price I don t appreciate being charged extra for internet access given the price of the hotel , The staff at the front desk and the doormen was just delightful The Purple Br exclusively for guests is a must 
204114,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Nothing at all , After proposing to my girlfriend we stayed at Sanderson Before and during our stay all the people were of great assistance and support Angelique especially Together we created the perfect stay Besides the extras the hotel is beautiful comfortable unique and has great service The Spa was referred to me as the most beautiful one in London and it was not an exaggerated Thank you all for helping me creating the perfect day for my fiance so she said yes

204118,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, We had planned to stay for 4 nights and left after one night We had two rooms a classic superior This hotel is of a minimalistic design which is very nice except the space is not not used well or functional It is just weird They sell something for using the bath in the room but there was not a bath in the room The picture on booking com shows a bathtub When I asked I was told I didn t pay for a room with one No place to put your luggage they are so worried about design they don t have a coffee maker You can ask for one brought to your room The coffee was awful The walls are paper thin doors slammed shut all evening This was a very noisy hotel which for me is unacceptable Construction all around the hotel up and down the streets Tried the restaurant which was okay but pricey The concierge was a joke He told me there were no tickets left for the dinner cruise and when I went online myself I was able to purchase them , The staff tried to be helpful They were accommodating in bringing us up an appropriate adapter The manager did attempt to call me when she found out I was unhappy there I called back but never heard from her after that The bed was comfortable 
204119,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel,No Negative, Brilliant stay from moment arrived til departure very helpful Luxurious accommodation contemporary style and complimented the show we went to see in London 
204120,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, The general clients were of less prestige and class than when the hotel first opened doors There were some very rude guests at the Purpme room that caused others a lot of disturbance Back in the day the purple room had its ow mn security The Checkin process was slow due to the attendant at reception being new , Same great Ambiance and Class and Staff courtesy as before

204122,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, The only slight issue would be the noise from the bars early sunday morning which made it a little difficult to sleep , I love how I was treated especially as it was my birthday weekend 
204123,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, The hotel and surrounding area is buzzing with activity and there was the faintest of noises coming into the rooms from the lounge music which might be a concern for anyone wanting absolute quiet , Fantastic location Modern rooms with lots of amenities The staff are both incredibly friendly and knowledgeable This was my best experience in a London hotel and I ve had about a dozen of them I will come back here again and again 
204124,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, The picture at booking com for the room of double deluxe I chose was wrong and of the higher loft room That was unfortunate and frustrating The staff would knock and just walk into room so you have to put privacy in the door if you don t want someone to just walk in , The location could not be better as its right of Oxford street The staff is super friendly and nice Yhe spa is absolutely amazing 
204125,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Noise throughout the night lots of unruly children in reception and restaurant rude restaurant front of house and waited over 45 minutes to sit for a pre booked afternoon tea even though we arrived 15 minutes early Over an hour late to check in had to wait until after 4pm Considering the cost of a suite this was terrible offered a complimentary cocktail as the only compensation after we d purchased 3 rounds during our long wait Supposedly booked a Loft Suite but it was only on the first floor overlooking the road and traffic Wouldn t recommend ,No Positive
204126,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Stayed in a superior room and thought the inclusion of a bath in the bathroom would have made it even better, Staff were very friendly and helpful excellent location just off of Oxford Street and the hotel definitely had the wow factor associated with a 5 star hotel it was booked as a surprise for my girlfriend and she loved it
204127,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, The view from my room The high tea offered at the restaurants hotel is over priced and underwhelming, Firm mattress Really helped my dodgy back complaint Room Layout was good Storage in the room was ok They had a complimentary mobile phone including both local and international calls for use throughout the stay allocated to your room at no additional cost The staff and particularly the gentlemen at the door were so welcoming and very helpful that would leave most hotels well behind 
204128,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Only slight drawback was that service in the long bar was just a little slow around tea time but this is the only area I could pick any fault with , Bed was super comfy and room spotless 
204129,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Expensive hotel but that is London Cheap usually means tiny , A quirky hotel with a mix of new age and contemporary decor Rooms where large by london standards but still smallish Staff are excellent and location is a short walking distance to Soho Oxford st tube etc Bar at night is packed so get their early if you want a seat Youngish crowd and therefore quite noisy 
204130,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, The room was too cramped a bit claustrophobic The ceilings were too low The blinds were not easy to use The bed was a bit small , The location was great The staff were helpful The soap Shampoo etc was lovely It s had a nice modern and clean feel

204132,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, too dim along the corridors and rooms can also do with more lights bidet to be installed near WC too many curtains in the room small room, location and pool table to entertain the young staircase to 1st level a nice touch furniture at property were chic
204133,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, There is no preliminary information that the children are not allowed in the SPA They have a real problems with services in restaurant So if you plan to use it check TripAdvisor first Anyway you can find a lot of perfect places around near here that are useful for breakfast lunch and dinner , We stayed here for 7 nights on Christmas week Friendly and helpful staff Big clear rooms with unusual design free WIFI We were traveling with our small son and they upgraded our standard room to bigger for free Thank you guys for perfect Christmas 
204134,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, There wasn t anything we didn t like , We were greeted with a smile and a gentleman called CJ took us to our room and explained how things worked and where everything was He arranged for an ironing board to be delivered and it arrived almost as soon as he left the room He was very helpful and friendly throughout our week long stay The location was perfect and we walked almost everywhere we wanted to get to We had breakfast in the restaurant which was delicious and spent time in the Purple Bar trying cocktails Again the staff in the bar were really friendly Our room was spacious and modern and was kept ultra clean The hotel is very central but we couldn t hear the traffic outside incredibly quiet so got a good nights sleep Loved the pillows as well just right for me We will definitely be staying there again 
204135,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, We did not speak to a single English staff member We had 3 attempts to get English Tea to our room The hotel was quite cold even in the restaurant We were not offered help with our bags to our room As it was our wedding anniversary the gentleman who checked us in said our room would be made special later that afternoon this did not happen We actually checked out a night early due to the coldness of the room and general areas My husband has cancer which makes him feel the cold but I was cold as well ,No Positive
204136,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Some noise from the floor s lobby enters the room at night besides that 100 perfect hotel , The best staff and service you could ask for 100 clean terrific experience would visit again and again Superb location wonderful limo to Heathrow in a very reasonable price great spa uplifting long bar atmosphere As a couple celebrating my wife s birthday we couldn t find a more suitable hotel Lovely 
204137,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, There were numerous lights in the room including dimmer switches but at times I couldn t get the room as bright as I d like , The bed itself along with the linens towels were of a very high quality

204139,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, No coffee making machine in room looks far better in photos than it does in the flesh Felt like we were staying in an old office block that had been decorated on changing rooms in the 90 s , Location was handy 
204140,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, We found the Purple Bar a bit different with the price of some of the drinks on the high side , We thought everything was great thoroughly enjoyed it 
204141,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, The Wifi and On Demand are way below standards of a hotel of this calibre The staff are not very eager to help and respond , The room service food was delicious The amenities are lovely and the bath Our room had a terrace and that was great

204144,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, The staff at breakfast stood around talking between themselves a great deal Didn t remove used dishes Appeared disinterested in what was happening , The breakfast was great Not as vegetarian friendly as some other 5 star hotels The front desk and door men were fantastic
204145,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, The room is very nice but there is no storage area to hang clothes except for a hanger in the bathroom The bed was a bit small although very comfy We tried having lunch at the Sukka hotel restaurant Service was very slow and the food varies from excellent fish to bad chicken They were nice to compensate us with free drinks Lychee martini yum , Excellent location hotel is beautiful and staff members are very polite and helpful

204147,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Way too much noise The rooms are not at all sound insulated the non stop music makes it impossible to rest during the day and until late at night The fact that you have to haul your luggage to your room in a hotel of this category is a scandal No closet to put your clothes into , The bar is very nice the spa also 
204148,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel,No Negative, The pillows on the bed were a little flat The overall experience was absolutely amazing The staff were amazing however I do think staying there you should get free parking we have been charged 56 for parking which I think is disgusting 
204149,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, No coffee facilities in your room When not checking in till 10pm it s not something you would notice till the morning When paying such a premium is that too much to expect This was booked as a special anniversary treat and no acknowledgement not even a congratulation from receptionist on checking in which you do get from hotels of less than half the price of staying here shame really didn t feel special , Clean fresh bright Bar had super atmosphere and the bar staff were happy friendly and welcoming nothing was too much effort for them
204150,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, No bath shower only in standard rooms Sound proofing not the best between rooms doors bang Also despite requesting a quiet room we were on a low floor at the front of the hotel and it was noisy 1 1 30am with people outside leaving the hotel bar , Well equipped and comfortable rooms Location Staff very helpful and friendly

204155,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, 1 They charged us my mistake twice the receptionist kept telling us it s not her fault and after that they apologized with cookies but didn t fix their mistake and our money is still bending 2 the fire alarm rang at 7 a m and we ran downstairs to a false alarm they apologized by saying at least we know that the fire alarm is working 3 rooms are Uncomfortable no tissues in the room nor pins imagine that The bed is too small and the bathroom is the worst The room is totally uncomfortable we thought of changing the hotel so many times, most of the staff were friendly
204156,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, The noise of the club at night The club closed around 12 a m , All the staff are friendly and helpful The location is good and quite It takes approximately 10 minutes walk to oxford circus The rooms are big and the furniture are new They need to improve the breakfast buffet 
204157,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, We had pre paid for 6 night accommodation but unfortunately we had to reschedule our flights and as a result we arrived one day late when we asked for a credit for the first night we were basically told it is too bad as everything was pre paid A Hotel of this quality could have been more accommodating , The location modern funky decoration and good facilities Cleaning Staff were excellent Good Restaurant Bar Don t judge this hotel by its exterior appearance you will be hugely surprised the minute you walk in

204165,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, I expected more bathroom equipment for example make up remover hand cream etc and two tooth glasses as it was a double room which are usually can be found in five stars hotel , The location is excellent in the centre of London West End All the staff were very friendly and polite the receptionists were fast and competent The hotel has very interesting and modern design the bars are amazing but pricey The garden restaurant is beautiful The rooms are comfortable and very clean 
204166,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Somewhat odd sparse bathroom arrangements with very little separation between the toilet and shower The Long Bar not too far from the foyer was incredibly noisy and boisterous in the evening , The bed was superbly comfortable I could laze in it all day and room service impeccable The onsite Purple Bar fantastic service and choice of cocktails and Courtyard Garden 
204167,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Concierge leaves abit early View from room was bad, Modern Hotel Very friendly helpful Staff 24hr gym Very comfy room bed Good cleaning and room service checkout time

204170,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Expensive and no kettle tea service in the room Booking com room photos are not the same I have boomed Dulex room and the photo is for Loft rooms, Staff are amazing Location is perfect
204171,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel,No Negative, Very funky design We told them our trip was a special occasion and they upgraded our room and spread rose petals all over the bed which made us laugh Long bar downstairs is obviously a destination for the beautiful people but restaurant right next to it is welcoming and there were families eating when we went 
204172,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, No coffee machine in the room for a 5 star hotel you would expect to have at least coffee or tea and an electric kettle if coffee machine in the room is too much Not to mention no complimentary coffee in the lobby which these days is a standard in most of the high end US hotels Spending fortune for Philippe Starck s barbells to fit them in the room just to add poshness is a complete nonsense especially when you forget about basic things like coffee or at least some free snacks to nibble Instead you get two bottles of mineral water that you normally get anywhere else in 2 or 3 star hotels as a standard Late check in starts from 3PM which makes things difficult if you arrive in the morning and have to wait until mid afternoon Malin Goetz soap bar in the bathroom that you cannot wash off your hands as it sticks like Nivea Interestingly all other toilets in the hotel are equipped with washable liquid soap Remember to adjust water to the right temperature before you wash your hands as tap has two separate slippery knobs that are impossible to move with wet hands Open plan bathroom and toilet divided by thin curtain so if you are travelling with someone that you don t necessary know well be aware of the smells from the toilet that will most likely be travelling around entire room as toilet ventilation sucks Room entrance door just by your bed without any internal corridor so all sounds travel easily both ways in and out Especially if your room is by the lifts No wardrobe instead you get few coat hangers in the bathroom separated by the curtain No idea why this hotel gets so many good scores Its not always about design but functionality too Did not take a chance to try their breakfast to avoid further disappointment Paying over 400GBP for one night excluding breakfast is a laugh unless you are an avid fun of a Beetle Juice design Salvador Dali Lips sofa Philippe Starck barbells and nothing else , Good quality bed linen Helpful staff

204174,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Sometimes you can have too much of a good thing If you got up to go to the bathroom at night you would wake up your S O because the wall between the bathroom and the room is made of you guessed it glass So don t go drinking 4 pints of cider before bedtime , This was an incredibly spiffy hotel I m a big fan of glass and well the room sure had plenty of that The room was large bright and sparkling clean The staff were friendly and prompt 
204175,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, The service at breakfast was the worst I have ever experienced in a quality hotel there were sloppy untrained staff it was not busy staff were hanging around chatting to one an other I twice had to send my eggs back as they were not what I had asked for I asked to speak to the manager and was told he was busy eventually I when to the desk where you check in for breakfast and complained and eventually the manager came over he did take the cost of breakfast of the bill but it was the worst experience I have ever had at breakfast I think there needs to be a lot more training , The room was amazing and reception check in and out were both extent
204176,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Breakfast isn t include price No working windows only air condition I don t like it because of no fresh air and it causes headache , Nice staff Atypical design in hotel

204197,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, The pillows were a little soft and the room appears a little bland after coming up from the lobby and in the lift , I liked the picture on trje ceiling The room was qwerky The staff were extra helpful A lovely sized and comfortable bed 
204198,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, too dark in the corridors in the rooms and in all the hotel very low standard of bathrooms the hotel looks dated and should be renovated, staff is nice especially at the door locations is ok
204199,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Movie selection did not work the night we wanted it, we upgraded to a loft room without balcony for an extra 100 a night on arrival and it was well worth it a massive room with everything you could want
204200,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, No coffee machine or coffee in the room This hotel is more ideal for solo travellers and couples rather than people with families and young children , The staff were extremely friendly and very welcoming The rooms are lovely The rooms are always kept very clean and when I used to get back to my room in the evening I would find the bed covers turned and candles lit which is a lovely touch Check in and check out were both very quick and easy They also allowed me to check in early at 7am which is something I highly appreciated 
204201,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, I could hear the other guests next to me whenever they were leaving or entering their room I also had a room towards the back and I could hear every sound made when things were being off loaded from vans Need to look into up grading sound proofing , The staff were very friendly and extremely polite I enjoyed my stay and will come back 
204202,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, My sisters car was broken into in the NCP car park underneath the hotel which the valet took our car to The pillows were very uncomfortable, The location was ideal
204203,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, That we couldn t stay longer , Smelt incredible everywhere loads of room in bathroom area even for a standard room Staff where amazing picked up the phone as I needed a iron and within 30seconds it was there 
204204,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Had a superior room no access to playing music whatsoever no iPod docking or any device at all TV had restricted choice and no proper music channels as an alternative Obscenely expensive TV films and poor choice Once I had a balcony room and it had a Harmon Karden speaker Nothing to play music through is very odd at these prices, Most things
204205,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, The hangover from the too excellent bar No smoking on the interior bars is not good It s a shame that their security guards do not understand guests needs and instead insist on behaving like the rude and thuggish ex nightclub bouncers that they seem to be They need firing or customer training in how to talk to people who are paying these prices This place would be much better if the very pretty interior gardens allowed smoking , Concierge and Reception were brilliant and welcoming 
204206,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, The bar is very popular on weekends you may have trouble finding a seat , The location of this hotel couldn t have been better We walked to shows shopping restaurants bars galleries I am not the best walker but it was all in walking distance for me The staff is very friendly and helpful The room service food and service late night is amazing The hotel is very very clean
204207,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Dark black out hallways No place for a towel to hang near the shower First room was next to maid staff quarters and door slammed continually Staff accommodated move to quieter location I thought it was a chance to up customer satisfaction through better room but not how this was handled Door staff and room service were tremendous , Funky chic atmosphere in lobby Rooms are fine but nothing too special Location is really good for central London 
204208,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, It was all fabulous , I have travelled the world extensively and the Sanderson London remains one of my favourite hotels in the world The staff are always friendly and helpful The atmosphere and vibe is that of an oasis in another world We visited for a surprise birthday for a best friend and the experience was faultless J J was extremely helpful with all of our needs upon check in offering upgrade options and even sent a bottle of Champagne up for us to help celebrate in the evening The wonderful concierge Biken recommended the BEST place to eat that was totally suited to our taste and requirements We enjoyed the signature Mad Hatters Tea party as well and as usual the favourite part of our trip was our time in the Purple Bar with our favourite bartenders of all time Karol and the lovely Marta who gave us impeccable service Karol is a one of kind mixologist with the presence and production of a magician The whole experience was magical Definitely recommended for a special occasion or anytime for that matter Thank you Sanderson London for a truly enjoyable experience and memories that will last forever We will be back 
204209,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Our room which was meant to be the quietest was anything but Windows reverberating due to the outside industrial fans were the cause which was out of their control It meant a relaxing lay in was not possible which for the cost of a room per night is not acceptable The staff handled it with consideration and were understanding , Loved location atmosphere and facilities 
204210,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Though compatible with its style and original maybe the outlook of the hotel and the lobby are a bit too hidden and unconventional , Everything was taken care of during my stay with my girl friend and the staff was very attentive and gentle The deluxe room was great

204213,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, We found the design to be a triumph of form over function Even down to simple things like the towel rail being out of reach of the shower and the mirror over the sink jutting out over the shower entrance and not being adjustable and there being no tea and coffee making facilities in the room they are provided on request Also having to sit on the bed to watch TV because the fixed bench seat was behind a column Also the blinds were very irritating so that you couldn t prevent people opposite seeing in to the room without it being totally blacked out because they have removed the facility to adjust the blade angle, The location was great and it all looked very nice
204214,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel,No Negative, Excellent service Paris is a star and really made us feel special for my wifes 50th Birthday celebration Also the rest of the staff were attentive but not too attentive efficient and looked like the enjoyed their jobs 
204215,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, They don t put sheets on the bed over the fitted sheet I had to ask every night and they just sent one didn t put it on the bed or anything No coffee machine or kettle or ironing board in the room you have to ask The gym spa are pretty underwhelming It s all cutesy artsy if that s your scene but it s just not even close to being worth the money Nothing terrible but it felt like an okay hotel not a nice one , The location was pretty nice just north of Oxford Street in Fitzrovia And it s a pretty cool hotel with art everywhere 
204216,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, The daily already had been paid and even so they required a bail over full amount of the daily , Close Oxford St The room is comfortable bed is suitable shower works offering warming Water Tv offers many channels Suitable reception Good bar

204220,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Drinks are stupidly expensive and they automatically add 15 service charge which is fine but then you are asked to leave a gratuity which is a bit off 32 for two drinks , One of my favourite hotels in London Great location and very nice feel to it 
204221,Sanderson A Morgans Hotel, Nothing bad but might be nice to do a bed and breakfast inclusive rate , The ambience was perfect The staff whilst young had just the right professionalism and friendliness Loved the spa loved the food loved my brandy Alexanda most bars look at me blankly this barman never batted an eyelid and it was perfect
