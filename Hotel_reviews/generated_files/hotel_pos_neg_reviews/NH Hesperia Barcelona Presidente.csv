277579,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, You can t open the windows They do not provide disposable slippers Toothbrush would be nice to have , Breakfast It s not noisy at the night time at all Location is beautiful It s a joy to walk to the metro and back to the hotel 
277580,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, TV was in the corner practically behind a wall in the bedroom that served no purpose at all Spent two nights One before a cruse and one after The staff on the first day was not pro active at all to assist regarding whether we had booked any excursions or not and when asked how to get to certain places were very short and did not really care On the second day the accommodation was a lot better and so were the staff ,No Positive
277581,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, When we were at the hotel for our first booking 10 June 2017 the room was very strange with a wall in it behind which was the TV Had to move it in order to see the whole screen Very strange The hotel maybe more for business travellers and not tourists as nothing was available in the way of advice as to what to see and staff did not come across as very willing to assist Staff however on our return from our cruise was more friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome ,No Positive
277582,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, No kettle coffee or tea in the rooms Carpet need attention dirty carpet spoils the whole atmosphere and cleanliness of the room , The facilities where very good king size bed big shower 
277583,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, We requested a double bed and did not get one we also requested a quiet room and we ended up in a room right at the front of the hotel over the main roads and adjacent to the stairs and lift So not much point making requests,No Positive
277584,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, It needs a small renovation for a 4 star hotel wallpaper and details like toilet and shower door has to be removed , Hotel room is quite big nice hall and staff Very good connected to the city center Big and very comfortable bed 
277585,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, No free water for a 4 star hotel and no coffee facilities in room Stingy with toiletries One small bar of soap a couple a day and on other days no shower gels Stayed a week so not an isolated incident , Staff were very friendly professional and superb in answering all questions Breakfast was amazing On bus route 
277586,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente,No Negative, First class hotel and staff Very friendly 20 min by taxi which is 30 euro 40 min by bus Bus stop out side hotel is 2 euro and takes you straight to Aero bus stop in Catalunya Plaza A 5 90 euro ride to airport The location was amazing 
277587,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, The room was excellent but some really small things were missing like a bar of soap and an extra bath towel which for a four star should have been checked I m sure the staff would have rectified this had we said but we were only staying for one night so we weren t too fussed , We had booked a normal double room but got upgraded to a junior suite which was lovely The hotel bar was very comfortable and the drinks were good The location was excellent for us reasonably near the Sagrada Familia and excellently located for shopping The staff were very helpful 
277588,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, They don t have an electric kettle so you can t make coffee or tea During our stay it rained on and off so we asked for an umbrella from the hotel You have to leave a deposit of 10 euros per umbrella They give it back and all but for a 4 star hotel i find it kind of a cheap move I didn t like the fact that they don t have a free shuttle bus to and from the airport The hotel doesn t offer complimentary bathrobes and slippers , We had a very nice side view to Avenida Diagonal The room was very clean and on one day i left a note with a request for the maid and she was very nice and left me 2 products We were in walking distance to El Corte Ingles so we could go to their supermarket and bring back what we bought easily The bus station was 5 min away When we booked we made a request and the hotel actually took it in consideration others just tell you that you can ask for things AT the hotel and of course most of the times they can t meet your demands as all the rooms are already booked Great quality TV 
277589,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, Some might not like the see through sort of shower that looked onto the bedroom I believe you can ask for rooms without that perk and the double glazing didn t quite fit so that noise from the street was audible although not terribly so , Friendly staff clean comfortable stylish and within easy reach of metro stops 
277590,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, Breakfast Ok but only 2 slow coffeemachines keeps you waiting same company NH at Milano last year with exactly the same problem WIFI is there but extremely slow 62 Mbit per second So you we actually could not use it Whatsapp mailaccount etc Only after I seriously complaint they offered a Premium WIFI for 9 99 per day , Comfortable hotel and nice location No noise Taxi easy to get or 12 minutes nice walk to Metro 
277591,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, It nothing major but it s also worth to mention that the hotel took care of these minor issues 1 The AC was not working so it was sometimes too warm during the night Next morning I reported the problem and the hotel staff took care of it 2 We had one night the door locked but surprisingly the housekeeping managed to enter She couldn t really communicate in English but she apologized sincerely As said nothing too serious , The hotel lies in a central area where one gets an easy and quick access to different facilities public transportation shops and restaurants etc I traveled with my wife for 3 nights for leisure and we both believe this hotel was a good choice We definitely recommend this hotel to couples and families 
277592,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente,No Negative, We liked staying outside of the center of the city This was in a beautiful area with many good restaurants nearby We had a nice room with a view over the city Great shower strong wifi 
277593,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, the wallpaper came off at some parts in our room Parking situation difficult, Quick check in and out Nice helpful staff 10 mins walk to the next metro Good nightlife and shopping around the hotel
277594,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, Oldish furniture in the room, New and modern bathroom great location even though quite far from the main attractions Nice restaurants around away from the touristic crowd and fair priced food Well connected by bus
277595,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, This is just a minor quibble The nearest metro station Diagonal is a 10 15 minute walk from the hotel However many bus lines that go into the heart of tourist Barcelona pass by the hotel I think it is excessive to charge 23 euros for a breakfastt buffet no matter how good it may be The price discouraged my wife and me from taking the breakfast option Cheaper and quite satisfactory breakfasts available in nearby cafes and restaurants , The hotel is well located in an upscale section of the Eixample near good restaurants The room was spacious and comfortable with a large and very comfortable bed and modern shower Toilet sink and shower in separate areas of the bathroom assuring privacy and simultaneous use Reception personnel very helpful and knowledgeable Free breakfast in lobby for very early risers who are leaving for the airport 
277596,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, N A, The hotel is very clean and updated Staff spoke English which is great for someone that speaks poquito Espanol The hotel is on a main road and is close to all the attractions Definitely would stay again 
277597,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, A boiler with tee and instant coffee in the room would be a , The staff was fantastic always available for any questions or advises Comfortable room there is a little terrace on the 9th floor with sun in the morning perfect for a yoga morning session before strolling through the city And they made an Easter treats trolley in the lobby this was unexpected funny and very appreciated D Finally the geographic location is perfect for nice dinners and a little walk back at night 
277598,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente,No Negative, The hotel close to the bus stop several lines come through 10 15 minutes walking distance to the metro station Very good breakfast Comfortable beds Friendly stuff Good place to visit the city Medium speed free WiFi 
277599,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, I didn t like that the room has almost no soundproof Like if someone is cleaning the room next to you or above ypu you would hear that someone is trowing things ,No Positive
277600,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, Gym needs to be improved The machine especially the pull down one is not in a good condition and a better selection of dumb bells would be preferred i e there should be a dumb bell which is at least 20kg , Reasonable price per night comfortable and clean room friendly staff very good location 
277601,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, The view from our room of the backyards of the adjoining street and the breakfast which I had thought was included cost 20 Euros per head rather excessive , Very helpful reception staff and everything clean and stylish in terms of the room 
277602,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, Reception always busy though staff helpful when you got to them Room too hot and noise from street , Room pleasant Shower very good Gave us late check out until 4 pm
277603,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, We found no slippers in the room but later we asked them from the housekeeper The bathroom area is a bit weird Some couples would not feel comfortable in it I would prefer to be isolated in bathroom Not close to the city center if you prefer walking , Best part of the hotel is the breakfast There s a plenty of choices It s located on a busy avenue Lots of shops and restaurants around Decent sized clean rooms 
277604,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, Breakfast is not very good especially compared to other Hesperia s in the city but there are plenty of places nearby to eat out as you are in the heart of the shopping area , Been here many times and always consistent quality great location friendly staff and very nice modern rooms 
277605,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente,No Negative, The breakfast is really delicious Staff is friendly and helpful The metro station is about 10 min walk but there is a bus stop just outside the hotel For those who like wifi it works in the whole hotel The hotel is clean I stayed 3 night in this hotel and loved it Next time I m in Barcelona I will definitely come back 
277606,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, The shower is too dark and needs more light inside The bed was a little hard as were the pillows but it was very clean , Room was big very comfortable and clean The breakfast was splendid and plenty The location is ideal for the centre
277607,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente,No Negative, Delicious breakfast Easy access to restaurants bars and all the facilities Metro stop at walking distance and bus stop just across the street The hotel is clean and modern Big room and wonderful shower Good value for money I recommend it
277608,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, Not to recommend if you like a quiet room as the windows don t close properly one can hear the traffic quite well, Very comfortable beds and very friendly and helpful staff at the reception and in the bar
277609,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, The beds are extremely uncomfortable or at least the one in the room I got allocated 508 I got a terrible back pain after sleeping in that bed for 2 nights the 3rd night was excruciating and I had to have a deep tissue massage to release the pain , The location of the hotel is great Nice breakfast Wifi connection
277610,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, Shower in the room did not function at all I could not take a shower during my stay two nights , Nice room Good service Clean Nice area in Barcelona 
277611,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, Website said breakfast was included but it was not Not a huge deal but the info should be more clearly stated on the site , Room was really comfy Extra attention in the bathroom design and use of space Bed was a true King and comfy The staff was friendly and helpful and the location was superb 
277612,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, Staff were rude and not helpful Location isnt the greatest its a good 25 min walk to placa catalunya, Very clean modern hotel with all the expected amenities Big room and big bathroom Large screen tv Fast wifi Amazing buffet breakfast
277613,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente,No Negative, Room was spacious and luxurious All the facilities in the hotel were very good the staff were very helpful Would like to stay at this hotel again in the future Will recommend to all my friends family 
277614,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, Its a 4 star hotel at 1995 everything seems to be already out of date wall papers lifts linens windows like a hotel that must be renovated 5 years ago old old old And the best part is bathrooms new trend to make them out of glass so when you are in the room you can clearly see and hear everything I mean everything So if you like to watch somebody taking a toilet our to be in shower and make sure another person sees you usually they make glass mate so you dont see details but here no they decided it would be cool to make it from clear glass in front of the beds So if you are that such a pervert welcome to the hotel , Location at its best If you are experienced traveller and want proper local top districs choose this region but not this hotel as it is super old with 100 clear glass toilet and shower to make sure you see and hear 
277615,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, I have no complaints about the hotel About the only thing I would suggest about this location is if you are a light sleeper and you plan to regularly sleep late at all do not get a room on the lower floors because of the road noise We were on the 10th floor and it was acceptable but I think the lower floors would start to get loud Avenue Diagonal is a major thoroughfare and the road noise starts to pick up around 6 AM But that said Avenue Diagonal runs through the heart of the city and is very walkable lined with scenic palms and other trees with many excellent restaurants and caf s in the surrounding areas , Location is excellent in a vibrant older sector of the city Wandering around the area s neighborhoods for hours on end made for a wonderful vacation We walked over 80km around the city in the first three days and it was always something interesting around the next corner such wondering into a 1940s swing dance on a Sunday evening in nearby neighborhood plaza In addition there are many famous sites to see in the city The location has immediate access to a number of bus routes that will rapidly and comfortably get you anywhere in the city It was a great value a clean tastefully decorated large comfortable room with courteous and helpful staff The beds were comfortable while the 10th floor offered a great view 
277616,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, The bathrooms are large but a lot of wasted space no doors in the bathrooms No tea coffee making arrangements in the rooms , Excellent and lavish breakfast Helpful and friendly staff Room and bed size is comfortable 
277617,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, price was really expensive at the time I went to the hotel But it was a nice stay overall actually thanks to the location I would say mainly, Perfect location
277618,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, The room had open bathroom with not even bathroom curtain so it a bit odd , The rooms were clean comfortable The breakfast was great specially when you can order custom breakfast The service of staff was excellent The staff were friendly and helped a lot with bus routes and suggestions
277619,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, Arrived late and mentioned it during booking but when I arrived I was told that my booking was canceled I was then given a smaller room than the one I booked WiFi isn t working well I was told to re connect each time I need to go online , Friendly staffs the location of the hotel clean room
277620,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, We did nt mind walking over a mile to the overcrowded center of town to get on the tour busses We liked returning from a day trip and getting back to a quiet more residential area to spend our evenings Some people may want the convenience of being in town , Good area to walk around Good restaurants nearby Fortunately a staff member from our Princes cruise ship was in the lobby to help us make arrangements for sightseeing tours and transfered us to the ship at the end of our stay

277624,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, they did not provide kettle to warm water , location is superb Its understated on booking com Excellent connectivity to each and every attraction in the city The area is quite upmarket Hotel is well maintained Good and helpful staff 
277625,NH Hesperia Barcelona Presidente, Not possible to open the window in the room Very hot in the room when the sun was out The air con in the room did not help at all I was lacking a bathrobe and slippers The staff was unable to provide a map over the bus transportation and to tell how to go by bus tram metro to Fira Gran Via where a major congress was going on Very unconfortable having to constantly press the switch to keep the hairdryer on resulting in cramp in my hand every morning The hotel would need new carpeting both in corridors and in rooms Add hair balsam hand cream and toothbrush toothpaste in the bathroom Change to a shower soap that is neutral so both males and females would like to use it , Breakfast selection is very good Location is OK some nice restaurants in the near close to shopping mall The shower was very good and having the toilet shower zink in separate rooms is very nice Confortable bed
