130183,H10 London Waterloo, The air con broke they took a long time to process my personal request and then forgot about entirely The room service took AGES to cook spaghetti Mini bar was expensive 140 for a room for one night just to look at a skyline is ridiculous , Bed was comfortable view was perfect room service food was lovely
130184,H10 London Waterloo, Gym literally three pieces equipment and terrible No free water 2 50 in mini bad Curtains not blackout and wakes u up early , Clean bright friendly welcome and staff foyer smells incredible sky bar though wish was open daytime great location 
130185,H10 London Waterloo, Unfriendly welcome on reception the roof top sky bar that was a really nice feature that made me book the hotel was closed at 8pm The double bed was two single beds clamped together which you can feel I ve stayed in far nicer hotels in London for less money Breakfast nobody asked us for tea coffee or said what to do in regards to getting your own breakfast where things were ect Found most staff with the exception of bar staff uninterested and unfriendly , Clean modern
130186,H10 London Waterloo, NOTHING Its the perfect hotel Amazing views even with a slightly higher level Street view Staff were amazing I ve become a member of H10 Club and have already booked to go back at the end of the month , EVERYTHING 
130187,H10 London Waterloo, Staff just did the bare minimum to when booking in no detail about rooftop bar breakfast etc I had to go back to ask about them, Bed was very comfy rooms very clean and bright with nice large doors that opened giving a great view of London our room was 11th floor 
130188,H10 London Waterloo, Roof top bar opening hours very limited so I was unable to see which is a shame, Nice Breakfast although buffet trays were sparsely filled so could not fill you plate
130189,H10 London Waterloo,No Negative, The hotel is central about 15 minutes walk to london eye There are subway stations in 5 10 minutes walking distance Waterloo station about 10 minutes walk from the hotel has both subway and train stations So seeing the city center and going all around was pretty easy Our room was having a little view of london eye from the windows nice surprise We didnt have EU UK converter for the plugs hotel personnel provided us one and they helped us about all we asked Wifi was good Pub at hotel was really lovely also having london eye view We loved staying here 
130190,H10 London Waterloo, We were advised on arrival that the restaurant would be closed during our visit As my husband has mobility issues this mattered to us and we should have been clearly advised of this before booking We walked out to the nearest restaurant a very plain looking Indian restaurant Chillies which was well reviewed on TripAdvisor and the food was great so it was a fun evening but not the wedding anniversary surroundings we had anticipated Returned to the hotel with our friends family for a drink on the roof terrace which closes at 9 p m We got there at 8 45 and were immediately told it would be closing shortly The interior bar has great views but very hard d cor our guests decided to call it a night We returned to our room to have a cup of tea and watch telly but the telly didn t work it repeatedly threw up a message saying weak signal We called reception to ask if it could be fixed and a young man arrived who looked at the TV and said it has a weak signal A bit Monty Pythonish at that point so we gave up and read a book Found the bed hard when we finally tried to sleep and the air con kept shutting off Didn t call reception for fear they would send a young man who would give us as much help as he had done with the TV which is to say advise us that the air con keeps shutting off Had intended to try the spa the next morning but based on our evenings experience we didn t bother , For us the transport links were the best thing about this property We like to travel by city bus and were easily able to do so 
130191,H10 London Waterloo, The staff checked us in to a floor where the air conditioning was broken and the hotel was aware of the ptrblem on check in and still put us on that floor We had to relocate to another floor 3 hours later which could have been avoided The restaurant was closed for a private booking The sky view lounge closed at 9 30 pm even though 3 staff were there to wait on the bar service for no one to serve , The front security staff were helpful 
130192,H10 London Waterloo, Fitness room is quite minimalist though enough for basic cardio or weight training , Clean quiet room with a great view Rooftop terrace has even more amazing views and good cocktails highly recommended Breakfast was delicious though ordered it from the menu 
130193,H10 London Waterloo, We were unable to get a drink on our return from evening out we returned at 3 minutes past midnight bar staff said bar was closed although she was serving other people all that was available was room service which neeed to be ordered at reception,No Positive
130194,H10 London Waterloo, Didn t managed to get more photos from the roof terrace due to maintenance We booked the double room with city view Room was smaller than I thought but this was a minor issue , We loved the beds It was like sleeping on clouds Staff was very helpful in booking our shuttle to the airport Tube station was a few mins walk from the property so it was very convenient 
130195,H10 London Waterloo, N A, Asked for roses to make room extra special for a birthday was done fantastically couldn t have asked for better 10 10 would recommend 
130196,H10 London Waterloo, In enjoyed everything about London even the public transport was busy but Was easy to get from A to B And I never catch trains , It was close to train station and local area
130197,H10 London Waterloo, Nothing much, Would like highly recommend anyone near the area at this hotel Hotel amenitites were on point Location good and overall excellent The receptionist was very friendly always smiling 
130198,H10 London Waterloo, Nothing comes to mind everything was great for a quick weekend away , Lovely welcoming staff Fantastic room with great views of the city Would definitely stay here again 
130199,H10 London Waterloo, All good , Bed bathroom very good Clean like the d cor Outside rooftop garden lovely Appreciated the chilled glass or bubbles on arrival 
130200,H10 London Waterloo, Was very disappointed that sky bar was closed for a few days due to some maintenance issue but hotel upgraded our room to one on 11th floor for no extra cost,No Positive
130201,H10 London Waterloo, Air conditioning did not work Faulty plug on hair drier Mini fridge not working so drinks all warm IT panel not working TV had fuzzy picture All minor points but added up to fairly poor experience ,No Positive
130202,H10 London Waterloo, Pillows on the bed were extremely uncomfortable much too hard Sky bar has a 10 people limit on the outside area imposed by the council which spoilt the experience as it was some time before we could go out there and inside the bar was very hot , The Tapas meal was fantastic Very authentic Spanish food
130203,H10 London Waterloo, No problems to report All fine , I had a great stay in this modern spacious hotel The room was excellent the staff helpful the free drink on arrival much appreciated It is a good hotel that feels contemporary and is a quick walk from Waterloo station 
130204,H10 London Waterloo, Was disappointed with roof terrace seating area after enquiring of open times we were not informed you had to make a reservation to use the terrace so when we went it was closed with a rope across entrance Other bar had no staff there at 23 50 was open until midnight when we enquired at reception about getting a drink we were told by staff it closed at midnight Another guest told us the bar tender would not be happy as was grumpy with them at 23 30 We pointed out to the receptionist it was 23 50 so a staff member came to the bar to serve us , Comfortable spotless room glad of the air con would have been too hot without Staff pleasant helpful on lending me an iron ironing board 
130205,H10 London Waterloo, I paid extra for a city view room and the room I was given wasn t great It was sub par The food was poor Microwaved nacho s and what tasted like frozen steak The spa facilities weren t on tried to use the sauna and it wasn t on the reception staff seemed woefully uninformed and the spa was just such a let down If I had known how bad the spa was I would have stayed elsewhere in honesty as that was 90 of the reason I went there, Cleaning and waiting staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly Reception staff were not
130206,H10 London Waterloo, could be a bit noisy NHS ambulance service round the corner On the crossing of 2 very busy roads of which 1 is Waterloo Road Request to match Personal preference for a shower instead of a bath was ignored Housekeeping way to early wanting to check the minibar no Sockets to charge phone next to the bed, closeness of transportation Waterloo station is in walking distance North Lambeth tube station is also nearby A bus stop day and night busses is just right in front of the main entrance Despite being outside the real center Southbank and all the highlights of Westminster are easy to reach by foot House of Parliament Buckingham Palace St Paul s Covent Garden West End Bond Oxford street Piccadilly Circus Trafalgar Square Rooftop bar with great view Very Friendly staff Clean rooms
130207,H10 London Waterloo, Being woken at 6am by the cleaning staff parking their trolleys outside the room When mentioned at reception it was greeted with a very unsincere sorry about that With no indication of what they were going to do with this information , Within walking distance of Waterloo Station and Westminster Bridge 
130208,H10 London Waterloo, One of the reasons we decided to try the H10 was the advertised roof bar which we informed could no be accessed due to local council regulations this facility was slightly misleading in the marketing information , Modern and comfortable hotel with an excellent restaurant where we experienced a good range of choice for both breakfast and the dinner menu 
130209,H10 London Waterloo, Could have been a bit cleaner floor in room was a bit grubby Bathroom clean though so can t complain too much , Requested a birthday cake for my husband and it was gorgeous and delicious Beds comfy and rooms good temp Breakfast was fabulous too

130212,H10 London Waterloo,No Negative, The staff was wonderful and when I had an issue with my initial room went out of their way to get me a new room and make they stay great The girls at the rooftop patio were great 
130213,H10 London Waterloo, They charged me twice without any notice me in the beginning and fortunately then cancelled the second transaction until I found out that twice the amount was reserved at my account Therefore I wasn t able to use my other money and wait for the reservation to be cancelled I asked them in advance to provide me with a room option that had a big single bed and a shower but instead they just gave me a room with a bath tub and twin bed The room needs a renovation and to be more tidy Overall I wouldn t recommend anyone to stay at this hotel and use services of H10 chain ,No Positive
130214,H10 London Waterloo, Beds to low I booked a double room went to sit on bed and they split apart Unlike most hotels who put a single sheet so the bed stays together You could feel the springs as well There was no one to help with luggage to and from taxi Which I d expect of a 4 Star hotel I prepaid breakfast only I got sick on the first night with a bad cold or flu when I rang reception to see what could be done was advised I d have to pay again for room service If you don t like traffic noise stay elsewhere If I had not been sick I would have gone elsewhere,No Positive

130219,H10 London Waterloo, Room too small for price not enough amenities in the room just for one person and we were two poor maintenance in general Funy smell in corridors trolley with dirty clothes next to our door till late evening , Amazing views in the rooms and very good breakfast
130220,H10 London Waterloo, Only stayed for 1 night would have liked time for spa, Helpful staff complementary drink on arrival robes in the room homemade lemonade with mint Decor of room comfy bed lovely and clen great view of city and quiet shower fantastic
130221,H10 London Waterloo, Unfortunately my room was very very dusty to the point of sneezing and hands feeling chalky and unclean after touching everything Sockets above desk are faulty and coming away from wall a little Room a bit tatty and worn overall lots of chips and damage to furniture marks on walls A shame for a room which is quite expensive and so well placed I expected a better experience for the price and hotel brand Also small note I ordered some toast and ham for breakfast and while lovely when it arrived it took a long time so don t order if you re in a rush to get anywhere Additionally guy in the restaurant needed to be told that toast toasted bread , Location and views from room amazing staff friendly shower incredible breakfast tasty 
130222,H10 London Waterloo, It s often beyond my company s budget unless I get an offer through booking dot com , Very efficient and friendly staff modern and clean accommodation and a really good location Late checkout always a bonus allowed me to use the room as an office for a few hours Nice location for a walk run down the river down Blackfriars rd to the bridge and then a nice loop back

130227,H10 London Waterloo, I didn t like at night someone tried to enter my room but his key didn t work And in the morning I ve put don t disturb but also someone tried to open the door, I like the size of the bed the view although I paid extra

130229,H10 London Waterloo, Quite expensive as you would expect in London Nearby restaurants are terrible , Excellent location Walking distance to public transport BFI Southbank and National Theatre 
130230,H10 London Waterloo, The ONLY hotel I have ever stayed in where they tried to charge me for extra tea bags I spoke to three members of staff including managers who insisted it was company policy The experience totally spoilt my stay There were four capsules of coffee in the room for the coffee makers but only two tea bags Is this prejudice against tea drinkers ,No Positive
130231,H10 London Waterloo, Street noise in the middle of the nights sirens mostly a couple of times triple glazing would cut that down not hotels fault, The room was great on 11th floor fantastic view very comfortable room 
130232,H10 London Waterloo, The electrical wall plugs did not work properly It took two days to get a plug for the sink which negated the environmental save water request , The staff were very pleasant and welcoming The room was extremely good and the cleanliness of everything was most acceptable The bed was very comfortable The hotel was in an excellent position for the theatre and Houses of Parliament visits 
130233,H10 London Waterloo, Just a little thing but theft proof coat hangers Really , Paid extra for a city view on an upper floor and was well worth it Comfy bed very short walk to the Old Vic theatre and Waterloo station Nice bar and lovely to have a welcome glass of fizz in arrival Plus a proper hairdryer 
130234,H10 London Waterloo, The staff werent the most helpful The hotel looked like it needed a lick of paint as the walls were marked the shower screen did not fit properly so water went everywhere when we showered A male member if staff knocked the door and walked in about 2 seconds after doing so i was changing at the time I shouted and he left straight away not a plesent experience , The location was brilliant for what we wanted The decor was modern
130235,H10 London Waterloo, We requested a double bed and again they asked on check in but we had two single beds pushed together which was annoying Plus the room was very warm despite the air con The sky bar was closed on arrival and also before we checked out would of liked to have seen the view , The room decor was very nice

130239,H10 London Waterloo, The breakfast arrangements were a little chaotic Seated at table but then waitress left us taking no order for tea or coffee Hence numerous requests from ourselves and others nearby Restaurant Manager seemed overwhelmed However the breakfast food and the variety was very good indeed , The hotel was a short walk from Waterloo Station with friendly welcome Request for earlier check had been attended to which was very helpful Everything was very new The bedroom was immaculate and the views of London fantastic Good breakfast food Will be back 
130240,H10 London Waterloo, Eco policy on towels you say leave your towels on the towel rail if you are happy to use them again and then you change them anyway So effectively you do not have an eco policy on towels , location ability to leave a bag at the hotel for 2 weeks between our two visits friendliness and responsiveness of the staff
130241,H10 London Waterloo,No Negative, The lady working reception at about 7 30 8 00pm on the 3rd of February was so lovely when i arrived we had a chat about my tattoo and she made me feel so welcome I wish I d caught her name Also the staff working the sky bar the same night were so friendly and helpful and couldn t of done any more for us Even letting us borrow glasses for our wine Top service x
130242,H10 London Waterloo, There was a horrible smell in the hotel And the photo frame of some weird person in the room looked scary my boyfriend couldn t sleep, The bed was very comfy
130243,H10 London Waterloo,No Negative, Welcoming drinks when arriving staff was really helpful as well as friendly and the location was great walking distance to London eye and Big Ben Hotel was a piece of luxury loved it 
130244,H10 London Waterloo, Our room was at the front of the hotel and unfortunately we were kept awake most of the night by the noice on th street and sirons from nearby ambulance base , Really enjoyed the modern design of the hotel It really appeals to a younger couple The rooftop bar was fantastic we loved it 
130245,H10 London Waterloo,No Negative, Loved the room it was absolutely gorgeous with a fantastic view Myself and my boyfriend both agreed we would definitely stay again and use the h10 hotels when we travel overseas 
130246,H10 London Waterloo, Found the Hotel over heated and stuffy Needed to sleep with the window open despite the cold outside , The location near Waterloo is perfect for us and we will stay again The breakfast was also excellent a great way to start the day especially if you have the time to do so 
130247,H10 London Waterloo, The menu was excellent but I found the pigeon quite sinewy Sound insulation to outside not good wind noise and traffic even though I was on the 9th floor The gym was a joke , The location was excellent for Waterloo Staff were very efficient Great value 
130248,H10 London Waterloo, No kettle in room when I asked if I could order room service on check in they said I had to call down I got to the room then there was no menu Food was not great for the cost either , Location Late check in
130249,H10 London Waterloo, This stay wasn t as good as the last few we had ripped wallpaper in the room above the bed the toilet was leaking badly and had to be repaired the room service was received without covers on top of them which made the food cold There was also a charge on my card after we reached 500 and instead of taking just the little extra that was spent I was charged a full amount twice taking over 1000 out of my account which is highly frustrating as i now can t use those funds and have to wait 5 7 days for it to be released This policy should be stated to you on check in or all members of staff should be aware of this which they weren t and it should be dealt with correctly instead of being charged double the amount , The bed was very comfy and staff very pleasant The location was great and easy to get around Stayed in H10 Waterloo 3 times now 
130250,H10 London Waterloo, NOISE In spite of my asking repeatedly for a quiet room my room was at the front which is on quite the noisiest road junction in London Why can t they triple glaze the windows like other hotels in this area , Location

130252,H10 London Waterloo, Check in service rude unprofessional staff need more training in the basics of customer service I am surprised by the lack of basic customer service from a hotel, Location
130253,H10 London Waterloo, Late checkout was 10 GBP per hour after 13 00h even though the hotel did not seem fully booked the next day in the shower the water went everywhere so needed all towels to get it dry Little space in the closet I was unlucky as there was a fire alarm test just when i was talking on the phone with clients It s faster to stop a taxi in the street than ask the reception to call you one I found it a bit expensive but so are all hotels in central London , I had a room at the 10th floor on the corner with spectacular view of the city Location is great If you take the Jubilee line take the stop Southwack rather than Waterloo it s the same walking distance but less hectic Great breakfast Ask for a freshly made omelet Loved the bed and the pillows But why 6 pillows in a single room 
130254,H10 London Waterloo, Level 8 bar to go outside was shut power in the shower was extremely poor Very dissapointed we arrived late due to work8ng wanted a lay in Even though the sign was on outside of the door at 9am housekeeping tried to enter the room i can only assume that because housekeeping wanted us out they very loudly were using the hoover up and againt the room door So frustrating when we choose a hotel with a midday checkout for a reason , The welcome was lovely 
130255,H10 London Waterloo, Restaurant staff slow and rude Food mediocre Tv in room did not work no one answered phone at reception to help Room toiletries were shampoo and shower gel but no conditioner I would have expected more for what I paid which was a lot , Location convenient

130258,H10 London Waterloo,No Negative, Requested a specific room three times but didn t get it However after speaking directly to the reception staff and manager was given a free upgrade to a suite Very happy about that Wonderful stay usual 
130259,H10 London Waterloo, Nothing really , The H10 was very convenient for my meeting and about half the price of the main stream hotels in the area It is modern and clean The rooms are a little smaller than the apartments that the other hotels offer but that is absolutely no problem to me 
130260,H10 London Waterloo,No Negative, I liked the view from the room and the convenience of location It was great to be 6 min walk from the Old Vic and close to tubes The glass of sparkling wine on arrival was most welcome

130262,H10 London Waterloo, Two single beds pushed together which was not what i would have expected from a double room Bar staff at the rooftop bar were bickering Got food poisoning from what i think was the scrambled egg this was the only thing me and my boyfriend ate different the whole weekend and didn t share and he was fine but i was not , The complimentary champagne was lovely and set the weekend off to a good start Nice bathroom and room Room service was nice 
130263,H10 London Waterloo, Would have liked a feather pillow but understand why hotels use synthetic , Very nice contemporary room on 11th floor bit different to the standard hotel decor Corner room with lots of light from dual aspect windows but good curtains for light blocking at night Not huge room but very good size for London Didn t have the feel of a big hotel in a good way felt calm but busy enough Comfy bed No noise from outside or hotel at night Looked like a lovely roof terrace but didn t have time to try it Didn t use restaurant but looked very nice too 
130264,H10 London Waterloo, The cost of drinks in the hotel could have a little less expensive Sky bar could open a later and there should be a residents bar , Loved the sky bar Room was good 
130265,H10 London Waterloo, We stayed at H10 Waterloo twice recently and on each occasion there was no answer when calling for room service It took three calls to various locations in hotel before we could place an order , Breakfast buffet is excellent especially the Churros delicious 
130266,H10 London Waterloo, At check out they tried to over charge me They said that booking com prices were indicative quotes not an agreed contract price and tried to charge me significantly more When they finally agreed to charge the booking com amount they still got it wrong but only by a small amount They seemed surprised that I asked for this to be refunded and suggested that I should be more flexible with the bill It all took about 20 minutes to sort out I was late for my business meeting as a result After their various explanations about the vague nature of their pricing and charges nothing specific and understandable such as a tourist tax or something I did not trust them enough to leave them to charge an amount to my credit card in my absence which is what they suggested they d do to sort it out I hope it was just poor training but ,No Positive
130267,H10 London Waterloo, The room and bathroom were a lot smaller that we had anticipated Some of the furniture was chipped The toiletries that were free some of them looked like they ve been opened before I ve been in other 4 star hotels and they were better in value for money than this one Is not bad but I definitely experienced better , I liked the stuff they were very friendly and it was quite and close to the places we wanted to visit 
130268,H10 London Waterloo, The room was boiling hot when we arrived and the TV remote only worked when you were stood right next to the TV but other than that I cannot fault my stay , The view from the room was really nice and it was so nice to have so much natural light in the room All of the staff were friendly and funny The bed was also really comfortable 
130269,H10 London Waterloo, Maintenance issues attention to detail Two light bulbs out TV remote didn t work bathroom scales didn t work Air Conditioning had issues they were very quick to put these issues right but these should have been checked and functional before the room was made available , Staff were friendly excellent location good level of facilities in room cleanliness was good
130270,H10 London Waterloo, The receptionists need training or improvement They couldn t find my booking and then said I hadn t paid when I paid earlier on in the day over the phone they then said I booked two rooms when I only booked a double room we went to our room to find two single beds at opposite sides of the room The room thy changed us to was lovely but what an inconvenience at midnight in the morning they thought we didn t have Breakfast included and tried to charge me However this was also paid prior to us going to the hotel To add to this I wrote of my resivation notes that the hotel was a surprise for my partner and that the booking was through me only when we went to check in the receptionist said the price of the room out loud so he could hear This made both of us feel very uncomfortable The views priceless and some of the staff are a real credit however the customer service at reception and the price for the rooms are too much , Location and th views were beautiful a gentleman in a suit working in the restaurant on 1st floor was amazing he showed us to the sky bar and gave us a tour of the building He is a real credit to the hotel 
130271,H10 London Waterloo, Facilities was not working or up to standards Called before making booking and was advised was working Staff and management has Miss lead customer to make booking and was not able to help me ,No Positive
130272,H10 London Waterloo, The receptionist was so rude One was okay but the lady who served us was vile , The modern room It was very bright spacious and clean Especially for London 
130273,H10 London Waterloo, The hotel looks seams relatively new but small knocks and scratches in the bedroom corridor on walls and doors could be avoided it just took the smart looking edge of the overall hotel , the hotel was extremely comfortable simple laid out and designsd very well All the staff I engaged with very well mannered and friendly 
130274,H10 London Waterloo, The bar staff on the roof wouldn t let us outside as there were no seats We would have been happy to stand for a quick drink , The location is great Very central easy to travel from there with train and tube stations close by The roof top bar is fab Room was clean and comfortable 
130275,H10 London Waterloo, Unfortunately the hotel were very inflexible My friends mother had to have an emergency operation which effected our plans due to childcare this preventing our stay The hotel refused to move the date of our booking or waver the cancellation fee It was bank holiday Sunday and all rooms were fully booked I am more than certain this room could have been resold Very disappointing ,No Positive
130276,H10 London Waterloo,No Negative, the hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff were very friendly Complimentary drink at check in which was welcomed as it must have been pushing 30 degrees Great location close to most attractions but not in an overly busy location Only thing i would question is if they could keep the outside sky bar open later as the views are spectacular and its a very enjoyable place to sit 
130277,H10 London Waterloo, The day before we arrived I recieved an email to say there had been a mix up and our 1st night was not going to be in the H10 Our first night was going to be in the Bermondsey Square Hotel This was extremely inconvient as I picked the H10 for Location only Despite being advised that we would recieve an upgrade on our room and some extra amenities this didn t happen No real apology from the hotel for the mix up despite me making the booking 4 months in advance Nor were componsated for the extra we had to spend getting to and from a hotel miles away from where we needed to be ,No Positive
130278,H10 London Waterloo, room service menu over priced poor quality variety which was disappointing as a solo traveller who didn t wish to use restaurant, Good city view
130279,H10 London Waterloo, Had to change rooms after first night as barely slept as given twin beds pushed together Change of room was efficient and staff were on point Second room significantly better , excellent location and friendly staff 
130280,H10 London Waterloo, The room furniture had seen better days and the bathroom was not very clean Very overpriced for what I got I would describe it as fur coat and no knickers The air conditioning didn t work properly , Nice welcome and courteous reception staff 
130281,H10 London Waterloo, Noisy location Arrived in morning to secure quiet room which was sort of promised but when I arrived at midnight tired and grotty the only room available was on the front and very noisy , Cava at reception and wonderful staff 
130282,H10 London Waterloo, We had to request the VIP items for our Deluxe room three times After three visits we are still waiting for our Loyalty card Two visits to H10 Waterloo and on both occasions nobody asked if our stay was ok , Restaurant staff friendly and food very good
130283,H10 London Waterloo, nothing stands out The service can come a little on the cold side I had pizza on two occasions , Bed superbly comfortable The inclusion of the sky bar was certainly a nice touch The corner rooms have amazing views 
130284,H10 London Waterloo, I had been given a room for a disabled traveller and so the shower was not a my height and difficult to use as there was a stool No kettle in the room and when I called them around 10pm when I noticed they said they would come They came upstairs to look and agreed but it never appeared The next morning I asked again and they said they were short of staff in the evenings and couldn t do it now Also no printer was working and so no printed VAT receipt Still no email from them as was promised , Modern and stylish lobby area On arrival staff were helpful 
130285,H10 London Waterloo, Nothing , Everything was crisp and clean The staff was terrific and very helpful and friendly This hotel is in a good part of London too Because of our experience my husband and I would stay at a H10 hotel again 
130286,H10 London Waterloo, We booked a double room with city view The view was great but on booking I had asked if a deluxe room with city view was possible I never received a reply to my enquiry This was a shame as it was for our wedding anniversary so wanted something a little special was happy to pay more too The room we had 1105 has a window which wouldn t close even on 11th floor the noise from traffic was disturbing throughout the night which impacted our comfort so the scores reflect this , The sky bar was lovely on a sunny evening Perfect location to relax Glass of something bubbly on arrival was nice touch We were able to check in early as room was ready which was also a positive 
130287,H10 London Waterloo, The atmosphere was zero in the bar and the terrace closed at 9pm and the bar at 11pm which I thought for central London was extremely early , The roof top bar and the comfortable bed 
130288,H10 London Waterloo, Pen marks all over the walls Room door didn t seal properly at the bottom noise came in through it Air conditioning wouldn t cool the room down Bathroom doors are the glass sliding type with no real privacy One key card didn t work for room , Great view of central london from our room 7th floor and up Bed comfy enough Staff were very willing to help Short walk to tube station 
130289,H10 London Waterloo, The hotel was a bit further from Waterloo than its website led me to believe , Lots of nice little touches like drink on check in making it feel a proper hotel check in experience The Juliet balcony with a proper opening door was lovely compared to so many hotel rooms that rely on aircon only Great views of London

130292,H10 London Waterloo, Air con didn t work and the room was very hot and to have the window open was too noisy with the traffic, Check in with a drink was good after a very long day Restaurant service was good 
130293,H10 London Waterloo, The SPA was NOT a spa we went down to a COLD room with 2 wooden beds in the only noise was the sound of people huffing and puffing in the gym no tranquil music The sauna was NOT on and not a sole about to ask We had to go out in our bathing costumes to find a member of staff who told us we had to go reception to ask them to turn it on Majority of staff were rude one shouting across bar are you paying for your drinks when i was actually on my way for another drink i didnt order another as i was very annoyed When we told the receptionist the following day these concerns another receptionist started laughing For 338 a night i expect much better service THE WHOLE BOOKING WAS SPOILT 2 WEEKS BEFORE WHEN H10 ASKED FOR PAYMENT THIS WAS MEANT TO BE A SURPRISE FOR MY DAUGHTER BUT I HAD TO TELL HER SO SHE COULD GO IN AND SORT OUT THE PAYMENT I WILL NOT BE BOOKING THERE AGAIN AND WILL STRONGLY RECOMMEND OTHER PEOPLE NOT TO , The location was lovely so was the sky bar Breakfast was plentiful and nice Beds and bedding was extremly comfortable

130297,H10 London Waterloo, 20 each for breakfast seemed a little steep but we didn t try it so shouldn t really comment, our room on the 7th floor had lovely city views as does the terrace bar on the 8th pop up and look
130298,H10 London Waterloo, Breakfasts could be improved Hot dishes set out for earlier diners A little dried up if you had breakfast say 9am, A little pricey and not a central location but bus services are excellent
130299,H10 London Waterloo, I paid by cash at my arrival and the day I was living different people of the staff came to ask me the same question when I brought the room key if I already paid because no record of paiement The man who took the money never recorded I have to tell them to find this person like they don t know there job Waste my time missed my bus etc , Hotel close to the stations serve by several buses From the hall to the bedroom everything was perfect cosy We can find a bar at the 8th floor gym room in the basement this hotel very comfortable
130300,H10 London Waterloo, For some reason some random guy managed to get into our room in the early hours of the morning and I couldn t sleep properly after that knowing his key card worked for our room, The bed was comfy and the room itself was set out perfectly with a lovely view
130301,H10 London Waterloo, I had booked a double room with a double bed On check in we again requested a double bed What we actually got was two single beds pushed together I do not see this as an except able double bed as there is a gap in the middle This was the only disappointment of a lovely hotel in a great location , Location was perfect The breakfast was delicious and the dining room was a lovely space Hotel was very clean and modern 
130302,H10 London Waterloo, Although breakfast was incredible there was music playing quite loudly sometimes with sad songs which I could not turn off or move away from It was very intrusive Hence I hurried my breakfast just to get out of there which was a shame I really don t see the point of that My advice cut the music Quiet breakfast chatter is much more pleasant Bear in mind as well that business travellers may well want to be preparing for their day ahead and may not appreciate that sort of disturbance , Lovely comfortable clean room Amazing breakfast with a super range 
130303,H10 London Waterloo, Nothing , The staff were excellent and couldn t do enough for you The breakfast was a perfect spread and actually did gluten free rolls which was great The location is good too Quick walk from Waterloo Will definitely be staying here again

130305,H10 London Waterloo, The bed wasn t that comfy with pillows strangely hard didn t sleep all that well although the size of the bed was generous The bathroom had a sliding door which was semi transparent and therefore really felt there was no privacy to be had , The rooftop bar was great with a great selection of drinks especially gin which is their specialty There was a massive choice of breakfast goodies both hot and cold the location is fantastic just what we were after to access The Old Vic The room had a good coffee maker although no instructions nice view and a clean and well stocked bathroom Friendly staff good facilities and reasonably priced 
130306,H10 London Waterloo, I didnt book breakfast as at 20 a little expensive for me as i probably would have just had cereal and toast However had a very nice coffee in the room so not a major problem, Beautiful hotel very modern and spotless clean great shower and air conditioning very useful Great polite staff very helpful Would highly recommend this hotel
130307,H10 London Waterloo, Lack of a face flannel in the bathroom and a press down bath plug that didn t really work, Modern hotel with delicious peach smoothie for breakfast The welcome glass of sparkling wine was welcome Tremendous views north to the city from my room and from the Skybar
130308,H10 London Waterloo, Booked a double room so expected a double bed got two singles pushed together which moved apart if you moved into the middle of the bed Room temperature too warm with no air con Room also smelt of fried food when I return Saturday night which wasn t very pleasant Not sure if room was located above a kitchen , Good location for my needs
130309,H10 London Waterloo, my room 203 was too cold I couldnt get it warm Had to sleep with a sweater on The floors are too cold and need some carpeting, Espresso maker in the room
130310,H10 London Waterloo, The Skylounge staff were not as friendly and attentive as the reception staff and felt a little disorganised With this in mind I did not appreciate the added service charge to my bar bill as it was only 95p I did not object but given the choice I would not have paid any extra for the service received, Excellent welcome beautiful rooms
130311,H10 London Waterloo, Location is not really Next to Waterloo Station but a 0 5km walk along a busy road in the opposite direction to the South Bank and in an area with few restaurants or bars , Restaurants and bars excellent Views from high floors and from delightful rooftop bar are v good Bedroom a bit small but OK
130312,H10 London Waterloo, Didn t book breakfast so I called in the morning for room service but no one answered the phone after ringing 3 times I guess breakfast service was very busy , The bed was very comfortable we got upgraded and the room was very light quiet and spacious 
130313,H10 London Waterloo, Given a room with two single beds that were pushed together when we booked a double Went back down to reception and luckily they made the change Hairdryer randomly stopped working but was brought a new one after phoning reception Room could have been a bit cleaner Also no idea how to work the coffee machine and there were no instructions , The bed was amazing Good view even if it was a second floor room Close location to several tube stations Lambeth North Waterloo Elephant Castle Friendly about storing bags before we were able to check in and after we checked out 
130314,H10 London Waterloo, room was really noisy because of the street and when a door shut from another room everything was shaking every time Plus breakfast was way too expensive , clean cosy rooms excellent view out of the window and the location of the hotel is just great 
130315,H10 London Waterloo, London is expensive but 20 for breakfast is too steep Small gym could do with an upgrade , Good location for anyone wanting to be close to Waterloo Modern room comfortable bed

130317,H10 London Waterloo, Nothing it was all perfect , We loved the views across London at night from our room on the 10th floor Staff were great we even got a complimentary glass of Cava on arrival The Sky Bar is fabulous great views Excellent WIFI throughout We will be returning 
130318,H10 London Waterloo, We would have liked to have breakfast really but were offered it at 20 each which seems ridiculous It was probably possible to have just coffee and croissant for less but we didn t feel like finding out , The bed was marvellously large and comfortable The bathroom was sparkling and efficient We liked having a view over London rooftops and famous sights We have stayed twice in order to attend concerts at the Festival hall which is 10 minutes walk away ideal It would not be very convenient for the West End however It is possible to find up to a dozen reasonable and varies places to eat within the same 10 15 minute walk we didn t try the hotel restaurant feeling it was likely to be pricey 
130319,H10 London Waterloo, The staff who was cleaning my room forgot to remove some dust and stains from the nightstand found at checkin on 26 January The staff writing my invoice slowly with 2 fingers was able to spell the name and VAT id of my company only after the 3rd try I wasted 25 minutes for this invoice and lost my temper too at checkout on 28 January in Reception should be the best staff not the clumsiest , Rooms are cozy warm adjustable up to 26 C and nicely furnished and maily they are large enough to allow you to move around The hotel has a gym at 1 and the Sky Bar upstairs with awesome view and program until 11 p m don t miss this the staff at this Sky Bar is extremely nice too WiFi is good and phone signal is very good including data roaming Sleep quality was rather good even if sometimes I could hear the trafic through the window if you are sensitive ask for a room facing the back street In few meters from hotel there is a bus station where you can catch a bus to Trafalgar or other directions but you should expect bus delays there Also the Metro is in 7 minutes walking distance 
130320,H10 London Waterloo, I was put in room 717 and had the most terrible night with the noise of the emergency services and got just 2 3 hours sleep ahead of a very important meeting so was extremely upset and unhappy, I often stay at your hotel and like it but

130322,H10 London Waterloo, The staff were polite enough but couple instances where staff were arguing with each other infront of us another where we were queuing for drinks and 2 extra staff members were at the bar and didnt help or even acknowledge us and when asked about a tour bus i was told to go into the centre even though i later found out that there was a stop right outside the hotel, Good location just 15 min walk to the London Eye clean comfortable and perfect for a short break

130328,H10 London Waterloo, I think the rooms needed some attention there were scuffs to the walls and the windows were dirty I wouldn t have been happy staying here for full price with these issues The view was of a car park and a road this is after requesting a room on a higher level I was on level 3 , Great modern and stylish hotel with s good location
130329,H10 London Waterloo, The only disappointment is that a double room was booked and two twin beds had been pushed together However it didn t really bother us considering my side of the bed is a small slither of matress so never asked to change room If we had I m sure the staff would accommodate , The sky bar was lovely restaurant was good and the room was great Service was brilliant including complimentary sparkling wine 
130330,H10 London Waterloo, The in room heating was not working I was woken up to a freezing room in which it took the staff around 10 15 minutes to re room me but this should not of been the case at 2am this room should not of been rented out , They served Rmey Martin at the bar not many hotels did

130335,H10 London Waterloo, No welcome drink Room keys did not work No mention of hot buffet at breakfast Food cold in the bar Receptionist did not even ask if we had an enjoyable stay when we checked out NOT a patch on H10 Port Well in Barcelona a far better experience , The bar overlooking the wheel

130339,H10 London Waterloo, Felt a bit cheated Booked this hotel for a special occasion but it is not special apart from the price Room was small and the floor to ceiling window was a small french door that only opened an inch It was quite a long walk to the center much further than I had anticipated It was also a much smaller hotel than I had expected , The view from our room and the sky bar was amazing Sky bar is very nice and the staff there were lovely can t say the same for breakfast staff

130342,H10 London Waterloo, Found communication of staff poor due to lack of English in every department reception restaurant which affected service Wanted to charge me twice for room on checkout even though had paid in advance Food mediocre Room tired looking and in need of refurbishment , Location was good Walking distance to Waterloo Southbank and city and near underground and main train station Good shower Good value overall but just lacking something in every area of service
130343,H10 London Waterloo, Bookings never seem to be visible from booking com and both stays I ve had here I have had long complicated check ins and had to email the booking confirmation to their reservations team Booked an upgraded room this time but had to phone and request the extras from reception as they weren t in the room Room service provided a strange selection and although OK the quality of the produce was not great and did not live up to the overall standard of the hotel , Love this hotel and the welcome drink This time just a few admin food and housekeeping issues but this didn t detract too much from the overall experience 
130344,H10 London Waterloo, There were road works throughout most of the night really loud and persistent road works Kept me awake most of the night Room was not warm and the air conditioning was difficult to get to grips with even by the staff Minibar wasn t restocked and previous customer had left other alcohol in the fridge , Nice hotel good location comfortable room and bed

130348,H10 London Waterloo, Complicated check in firstly the room did not match the booked category After requesting a different room the receptionist was searching for almost 15 min and ended up with a room next to the entrance to the bar This was not the nicest experience and quiet time consuming , Very nice breakfast

130354,H10 London Waterloo, The CV is horrable loud The room Service and the Food we got was the worst 11pm Never ate such a Bad Ham and Toast Sandwich in my life cold and not Fresh The stuff from the Room Service Could t speak english asked Kindly to Pay in Cash and he forgot , You need 20 min to walk to Big Ben and 15 min to the next Underground Station The reception stuff was nice But no maps or explaination where somthing to find

130360,H10 London Waterloo, I was disappointed that it took the hotel two days to repair the faulty light bulb in my bathroom and that the instructions for the coffee machine in the restaurant was not immediately clealy visible , By far most the location and the fact that I was able to leave my cases for the whole of the last day after checking out
130361,H10 London Waterloo, The staff at the breakfast room isn t really friendly and warm The person who welcomes you at the breafast room is at the wrong place I asked for a quiet room at an higher level the hotel has at least 10 stores and I got a room at the 2 floor on the street no phonique isolation It s the worse hotel I have ever been for the noise I let you check all the I have booked through booking com When you arrive at the room you find a customer survey on your bed but there is no pen in the room to fill it Every time the doors room are closed it makes such a nois When you re sleeping it wakes you up , The kettle in the room
