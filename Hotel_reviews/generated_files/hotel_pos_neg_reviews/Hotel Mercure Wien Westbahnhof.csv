323215,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, The room was quite warm admittedly it was 35 degrees C outside but the fan was useless I also disliked that you had to pay extra for quick internet and the bottle of water in the room is over 3 5 Euros The rooms were slightly dated but well do able Also I overheard the staff arguing with a group of tourists and it sounded rude on both sides , The room was very comfortable I often have back issues after sleeping in hotels but the bed was great and I had no issues Also the bath in the room was great to relax and recover the muscles from walking around the city The rooms were nice and clean as well I was on transit for a day in Vienna so the location near the metro and train station was superb I was able to visit a couple of sights easily and travel in relative comfort 
323216,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, Because of a mild physical impairment I found the bed and the toilet far too low and some of the lounge area seating is also much too low , The location just across from the Westbahnhof is just perfect 
323217,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, I booked very late so the price was really high Apart from this a great place to spend your holiday in Vienna , Nicely located very close to the train station Warm helpful staff Clean rooms Nice restaurant bar Very much recommended 
323218,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, There are small things that pile broken tiles in the bathroom windows that don t properly close I could always feel a draft and noise Be aware of everyting you have to pay like overnight parking tax , Breakfast was good and varied enough Hotel location is great
323219,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, I paid by cash for this poor 4 stars and they reserved the whole amount on my credit card for over 1 month I wrote an email to them and I didn t receive any answer Something like this is unacceptable ,No Positive
323220,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, The rooms are rather small and the price of the room seems a bit to hight , The hotel is very well situated next to Westbahnhof train and underground station 
323221,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, There was a strange sound from the heating pipes i couldn t sleep well from that noise Also the breakfast wasn t that much good and not much choices Next day I had my breakfast outside in very nice restorant with less price , I like the welcoming from the stuff clean and location 
323222,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, Nothing special Rooms may be bigger , Location garage internet Normal hotel like Mercure hotels everywhere Value for money no surprises everything is Ok for short stay I trust this hotel brand 
323223,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, I paid for twin room that was the deal back in April when arrived on my own was told I would have to pay another 10euro I said no on principle so ended up in box room on 7th floor Not to happy on that one , Location was good Have stayed before I e 9yrs ago shop no longer also bar changed but still nice 
323224,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, wifi slow or not working room looking to the roof of the building inside the sound of the compressor for the climate during the night expensive parking, clean
323225,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, The airconditioner struggled to cool the room , The room was comfortable and just what we needed It is close to the West Bahnhof and to Mariahilferstrasse Can walk to the museum district Plenty of accessible public transportation 
323226,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, There was no iron in the room and wasnt allowed to iron in your room for safety reasons as they said although there are many hotels provide you with the ironing services in your room going every time to the ironing room wasnt comfortable , The location helpful and friendly staff 
323227,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, There was a leakage in the AC The mattress was bad The manager was too rude The management was too bad The manager threatened us because we told him we re going to put a bad review here They asked for 1 night fees due to late check out 47 minutes They refused to release the blocked amount although the payment was made by my credit card , Simply Nothing 
323228,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, The chairs textile is torn The air conditioning was poor It was too hot in bedroom whereas too cool in the livingroom The entrance of the hotel wasn t easy to find , The location especially the distance from the station was very good 
323229,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, I booked thinking it was close to main train station It was the west train station so had to take taxi to get to it , Room was comfortable Staff was friendly
323230,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, The bed surrounds were worn and tatty the TV didn t work there were no items in the mini bar not even soft drinks or water no air con only a fan so room was very hot considering it was 28 29 degrees and too noisy to have the window open all night as it was right next to a busy main road This certainly wasn t a four star hotel if you re looking for an excellent hotel to stay at in Vienna then go to the Best Western Kaiserhof now that is a four star quality hotel and you will not be disappointed ,No Positive
323231,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, The toiletries where missing or not something that I would use The toilet was small even smaller than the Japanese standard The pillow thin Ended up using the stairs because the elevator was not really good Shower lower than the height of a normal person , The staff was neither helpful but also not rude They where just right The room was clean and tidy 
323232,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, We didn t like the lack of lighting in the room and the bathroom made it very hard to see to do anything The toilet was behind the bathroom door and we kept kicking our toes on the stopper as it was in the middle of the floor to stop the door banging against the wall The hotel was a long way from the main station and the old town , We liked the spacious room and the breakfast was good too 
323233,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, I paid for a Superior room but they gave me a room that was superior in the 80 s and the Manger said ironic i cant change the furniture for you , Nothing

323236,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, We reserved the room with a credit card and the hotel blocked 800from our account This was unsettling as I had the funds to pay for the room account with me and would have payed up front had I been asked Also our total room cost was 699 so why did they block the extra money without my permission , Good selection at breakfast and close to the Westbahnhof for trams trains and buses Also had carparking

323244,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, For a superior room we thought it was quite small we felt there could have been more toiletries ie shower caps provided tv seemed to require payment to watch , Breakfast was good nice selection of food efficient friendly staff great location 
323245,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, The walls within the room were dirty furniture was scratched and bashed horrible smelling smokers room and we are both smokers but we couldn t stand the smell no hair cleaning shampoo accessories like shue shine hand cleaners etc are missing Unnaceptable , The personel very polite and helpful and free drinks
323246,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, I don t like water the hotel offers It is soda water not still water , The location of the hotel It is in area of many kinds of public transportation 
323247,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof, I don t like the fact that you cannot control your own room temperature The rooms were a bit hot One member of the staff of the bar wasn t pleasant but my daughter dealt with the manager over it , It was very handy to the train tram stations The breakfast was excellent even treated us special on a birthday The rooms were comfortable
