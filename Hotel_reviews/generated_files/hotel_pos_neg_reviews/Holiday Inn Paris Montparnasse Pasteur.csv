22189,Holiday Inn Paris Montparnasse Pasteur, The hotel needs an upgrade as bathroom was very dated and not clean Beds are very uncomfortable and the sofa bed is just terrible All theee of us had backache after only one night sleep there 4star for this hotel is definitely overrating Definitely not worth the money paid , Staff were very pleasant to deal with 
22190,Holiday Inn Paris Montparnasse Pasteur, The staff was inconsistent we had a problem with our a c and heard different stories The manager was helpful and apologized for the inconvenience The girl at the breakfast buffet was rude and seemed inconvenienced when you asked for something Another customer asked for ice and she replied Pourquoi why , The location and the attitude of managers
22191,Holiday Inn Paris Montparnasse Pasteur, Location wasn t terribly far but if you are bad with directions you may get turned around a bit , If using the metro it s great If you are walking be good with directions street names weren t obviously visible The staff that checked us in were incredible Checking in was a tad slow but we were told it s because they extended bookings for people from London who didn t feel safe returning to their country because of the London Bridge attack I like that the hotel was so accommodating for them it shows they had a heart Breakfast was a nice selection 
22192,Holiday Inn Paris Montparnasse Pasteur, When I booked it said free cancellation and no pre payment needed A day or two later the Holiday Inn tried debiting my account 5 times Naturally it was declined as I had not authorised the debit I now incur those bank charges and bad debt reflection Upon booking I specifically requested bath tubs in both the rooms I did not receive any response on this What I did receive was an email saying that if I didn t update the banking details with another card that could be debited then I would loose the booking I felt bullied by this and not wanting to loose the accommodation I authorised the debit When we reached the property we were told that the rooms did not have bath tubs and only had showers and that the rooms with the bath tubs were already allocated It is false advertising on your booking com website as the facility specifically showed a shower and a bath tub I would have cancelled the booking had I known this and believe this was very misleading by the hotel On a separate note breakfast was chaos There was only one poor woman running around and we had to wait for milk bread eggs juices etc for a while on both days We don t eat pork and aside from pastries and toast with eggs there wasn t much for us to eat There should at least be consideration and have either turkey or chicken sausages without containing pork in them As for the shower it had rotted at the bottom and we had to use towels to prevent the water from travelling into the bedroom I wasn t expecting to be housekeeping during my holiday There were also lots of ants in the room It was 33 degrees and the air con didn t work We were exhausted from the day and didn t bother to call maintenance Overall we felt like we had been deceived and ripped off I would really appreciate a response from one of the booking com consultants , They made an effort to give us a small view of the Eiffel Tower Staff were extremely friendly and helpful 
22193,Holiday Inn Paris Montparnasse Pasteur, Anything positive got overshadowed by the BEDBUGS Unacceptable that this type of hotel has bedbugs We have bedbug bites I had one small bite in my hand I thought maybe a mosquito or something the second night When I got home I had a lot more I didn t know what it was and the doctor confirmed bedbugs And explained the bites can show a day after or so My sister and I got it since we slept on the bed My other sisters that slept on the sofa didn t get bitten This is just unacceptable we tried to reach the hotel and they hang up on us very unprofessional , Breakfast was good
22194,Holiday Inn Paris Montparnasse Pasteur, the room temperature it was freezing , The breakfast was very good and the room was cosy its located in the middle of a very quaint location and the facilities were just about right for a easter vacation
22195,Holiday Inn Paris Montparnasse Pasteur, Me and my sister stayed at Holiday Inn Paris Montparnasse Pasteur Unfortunately the experience was not as nice as planned On Saturday the 8th of April we noticed that someone at the hotel used a master key and entered our room and stole 500 Euro and 50 Pounds on Friday night while we were out to the city We addressed the issue to the front desk as soon as we noticed that a crime was committed but the rudeness and lack of respect for a customer just shocked us So incompetent rude and arrogant staff I have never seen in my life Instead of trying to help us girl at front desk was just showing attitude and was not even feeling sorry She just told us that the hotel is not taking responsibility for things like that When we asked to call the manager she said it is Saturday and he is not at work and we should talk to him on Monday when she knew that our stay is until Sunday Later she called him but the response from the manager was the same with the same rudeness and attitude A global company as big as the holiday inn can t even offer me money back from my room or a voucher to say sorry Please don t stay here They are not safe not in control and don t care about customer s feelings or satisfaction Our room was entered without us knowing that There is no care for safely I am just glad that I wasn t in the room by myself as I dread to think what would have happened Customer service is below 0 hotel management below 0 Never again staying at Holiday Inn ,No Positive
22196,Holiday Inn Paris Montparnasse Pasteur, No air conditioning during first night because they didn t switch ventilation system from heating to cooling Can you believe this from Holiday Inn We had to keep windows open and couldn t sleep until 5 am because of mosquitoes They could have offered some meal voucher or something else as compensation but they didn t The attitude was as if No AC not our fault Room carpet was old and had marks same with bathroom washbasin However housekeeping was good Overall very disappointed , Wifi english news channels in the room Carrefour just steps away a lot of eating places nearby 
22197,Holiday Inn Paris Montparnasse Pasteur, I didn t like the entrance sign view from the street It needs to be bigger and brighter I couldn t find it when walking back from the Eiffel Tower I walked around looking for it for a very long time , Both the bed and pillows were perfect The bathroom was pretty Clean And simple We walked to just about everything Long walk but worth it 
22198,Holiday Inn Paris Montparnasse Pasteur, It took 45 minutes to check out as three couples were ahead of us in the queue Location of garage car park was poorly explained and not obvious A minor irritation after a long journey , Well priced for a fairly central location not far from Invalides and the Eiffel Tower Reasonable quality but lacking character throughout as one would expect from Holiday Inn Restaurant maitre d deserves a mention for his help and enthusiasm
