387085,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, The price Definitely overpriced for the type of rooms The rooms has basic plain amenities nothing to make you feel wow , Location Walking distance to Central Station and local transportation eateries reachable within 5 minutes walking
387086,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, NOTHING, The breakfast was excellent with a good varied selection We were very impressed by the fact that the bathroom mirror had a section that never steamed up so when you had a shower you could still use the mirror without having to clear a section to shave or put make on PS whats the secret Toiletries restocked all the time tea coffee restocked all the time 
387087,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, It is a little expensive and no breakfast included it is a good breakfast and it is in keeping with how much breakfast outside the hotel costs For the price you would expect it to be included We were charged not only for an extra bed but also for our daughter staying in our room and the obligatory country tax so it was a little more expensive than we had originally anticipated The staff was very helpful and booked a lot of tickets for us at the front desk which was very convenient and saved us time Well run hotel , GREAT location Comfortable beds and really clean rooms 
387088,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, The rooms are TINY much smaller than they look on the photos When I asked the stuff to change for additional price they agreed and then refused then agreed again and finally refused Stuff has no one clear information on rooms availability The bathroom wasn t clean The elevator was not working , Location is good 
387089,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, The hotel seemed to be two buildings which were connected by a walkway at first floor level The narrow lane between the buildings which I have no idea where it led to was very noisy at times with people passing along it sometimes in the early hours who were shouting and yelling One night it seemed as if large wheelie bins were being moved to be emptied but the noise of them going along the narrow lane was awful when you are trying to sleep There appeared to be no air conditioning that I was aware of which meant having the window open which did not help with the comings and goings in the lane , Hotel lifts were good and quick Breakfast offered nice crispy bacon and the usual continental type food with a good choice of bread and pastries There was a decent sized mini bar where you could insert your own bottles of water etc and kept things cold 
387090,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, Even though the room was bigger compared to Amsterdam standards it felt small for two people With all the amenities provided felt crammed with our suitcases open , Location location location Even though it s right in the centre of action and walking distance from the Amsterdam Central station it was quiet inside the rooms for grabbing some shut eye Clean room with good amenities such as comfortable bed closet space and mirror Bathroom was clean and spacious Good breakfast spread 
387091,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, Was difficult getting to the room entailed two separate lifts and long walk along corridor The safe didn t work properly and took a v long time to sort it out not user friendly instructions, Great location and clean rooms
387092,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, Room tiny We booked through booking com and they didn t mention city tax anywhere clearly visible so bill was more than expected We stayed in the crown plaza before it was taken over in a far far superior room for a lot less than the 480 510 with city tax we paid for this hotel and it was only 100yrs away , Location was excellent staff helpful room clean
387093,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, Expensive hotel due to location Quite dated rooms weren t really 4 star by appearance Pillows are super soft European when asked for other options there weren t any Overall we left disappointed ,No Positive
387094,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, The hairdryer take your own or maybe they will provide a more modern powerful one soon , Location was excellent with a tramstop just outside allowing easy access to all the major sites and close to Central Station 
387095,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, The excessive charges holds at check in Pre hold hold at check in extra security hold and then another check out hold don t use your bank card locks up money for an undisclosed amount of time , Mimosas with breakfasts 
387096,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, 585 for two nights plus 18 per day for breakfast is expensive for a fairly and generic basic hotel with no additional facilities Other boutique hotels offer better value for money More pillows required Noisy old air conditioning unit , nice hotel clean and comfortable Decent location luckily no noise from the rowdy bar downstairs
387097,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, Rooms are on the small side but perfectly adequate for a city break where you don t spend much time in the room , The location was the best aspect of staying at the hotel as it was right in the centre and so convenient for bars and restaurants We walked everywhere 
387098,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, Expensive even with the location Other hotels near by are just as nice but not so pricey, Breakfast very nice Food excellent Location prime Staff helpful Would stay again if I could not find a hotel nearby available Room very quiet
387099,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, Concierge lost a letter for me and I had to insist on him looking for it he said it wasn t there and he didn t want to call the other concierge Of course it turned out he didn t search well enough for it it was in his pile of papers , Great location in the middle of the city center and not far from the Central Station 
387100,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The location is amazing the staff is very accommodating and the breakfasts are very complete and offer a good variety If you wish to be in the centre of the city this is a great place 
387101,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, The only thing that I did not like is there are two elevators that goes different floors and we had to change elevator to reach our room Except this everything was perfect , The room was small but very comfortable Breakfast was quite good and enough I left the hotel earlier than the breakfast start time for two days and requested my breakfast package They prepared my breakfast on time The location is quite good you can easily reach every major places by walk Amsterdam central station just 5 minutes walking distance There is also a tram station that is very close to the hotel 
387102,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Absolutely loved this hotel I have nothing bad to say about this place Wonderful staff extremely clean spacious rooms and close to all tourist attractions 
387103,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, the carpet in the room was not the cleanest you may find especially taking into account the rate they have for the rooms, 5 mins walking from the central station decent breakfast lacking of fruit selection
387104,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, We were charged 50 deposit when we got to their hotel I asked for them to empty the fridge rather than pay as it did not state on my receipt or email Even after speaking to the manager they refused to take the 50 off I ve been to many hotels and if you do not wish to pay they just remove the contents of the fridge Because of this we were unable to go out on the last night of my birthday weekend It ruined it as they didn t care that it was not stated anywhere in my email or app confirmation I would have prepared if it was stated before , The room was lovely and the location was amazing really good value for money 
387105,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, Nothing , A perfect hotel in the heart of Amsterdam It was the perfect base for our weekend away The bed was huge and really comfy The shower had very very good pressure and held the temperature well The hotel is about ten minute walk from the train station and 5 minutes from the shops So close to everything I couldn t of asked for better The staff were very friendly and helpful We didn t eat here so can t comment on that side of things 
387106,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, Lobby is too small and gloomy if ur planning on relaxing there forget it Nothing is free in the Hotel even Esspresso and bottle of water in the room are charged This is not acceptable for a 250 Euro Night Hotel excluding breakfast , The hotel location is top The room is well equipped and very clean but tiny with almost no closet space The reception staff is quite friendly and helpful I would recommend this city hotel but only to crash in at night P S the internet was super fast
387107,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Regrettably our trip was cut short due to a problem at home the staff at the hotel could not have been more helpful in arranging our travel arrangements back home During our short visit we were made very welcome by all the staff and the hotel was centrally located and ideal for central station 
387108,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, My second times stayed in it has been 5 months since first time When my partner and I arrived we were told that we were accidently booked single bed room I was very worring because it was a long holiday weekend and we might not have any room to stay but the reception had solve it out I had to pay more 50 per night we stay 3 nights so it a fair price in this point We got a bigger room than last time The hotel was still make me feel like home Clean and smell good Staffs always very helpful I definately come back again if i was come to Amsterdam 
387109,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, The room was rather small and didn t easily collate with rooms shown on the hotel web site Reception staff recommended 2 restaurants on different evenings the first was an Italian restaurant and was excellent but the second which was adjacent to the hotel was poor because of poor service and an over cooked meal Finally whilst we enjoyed the breakfast and its range of food as a vegetarian I would have appreciated vegetarian sausages and other vegetarian options , Staff were consistently helpful all were proficient English speakers The restaurant provided a diverse range of breakfast food which was interesting and tasty Restaurant staff were thoughtful and interested in talking to guests 
387110,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, Central locations but because the windows are not noise proofed you can hear all what it s happening outside during the night there is lots of screams singing shouting not good for sleeping there is no air con on the room Internet it s free but very slow almost impossible to browser the breakfast very basic better to go to the many cafes around hotel on the arrival we were ask to pay deposit of 50eur for minibar which I was very surprised of I never have been asked to pay deposit for minibar in different hotels, Great location walking distance to many places of interest
387111,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, Abrupt reception company policy more than my jobs worth attitude gave me a wrong key to start off with Insisted on 50 deposit for room bar at 12 45am when I got there Breakfast not available when I left just before 6am and it was pricey No receipt of cancellation of 50 deposit for room bar some rooms quite a walk away expensive for what it was when you are tired after a full days and nights work this is not what, comfy bed convenient 5 min walk to the station
387112,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, The only thing was being charged 50 euro for added extras but not being told what it was for otherwise I would of declined as we didn t want anything from it I also didn t like that I didn t get a receipt for my overall total, Friendly staff and so close to everything we needed 
387113,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, Unbelievably overpriced as most Amsterdam City Centre hotels comparing to the services provided The bed literally disintegrated while sleeping on it Automatic heat control of shower tap didn t work properly and gave an intermittent scalding quenching experience , Superb location central station and most tourist attractions nearby Kind and polite staff Perfect cleanliness Daily refill of courtesy tray 
387114,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, Room service took almost 1h prices of mini bar are really expensive, Comfortable room lot of foreign tv channel friendly staff and very well located room was really quiet
387115,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, This will sound picky whilst I certainly appreciate the provision of a kettle in the room I really think a 4 star hotel should provide proper spoons not just those wooden stirrer sick things that is so not 4 star provision , Comfy bed good sized bathroom and I always enjoy my stay more when there is a choice of bath or shower I particularly sought out hotels that provide a kettle because not all hotels do so I was pleased to have tea making facilities and a fridge in the room The location if superb to minutes on a tram from central station tram stop very close to the hotel with trams to all the main sights in the city and the hotel is about 2 min walk from the canal network The hotel is in a very busy location with ample shops bars and eateries in the immediate area I did appreciate the provision of a computer for guests to use in the hotel lounge great for searching out places to go and I did appreciate the free printing for printing off my airline boarding pass at the end of my stay Decent choice at breakfast 
387116,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, No view Faced hotel rooms , Came with all the little extras Comfy bed nice chair to sit in lovely washroom with toiletries kettle along with tea and coffee supplies
387117,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, The price doesn t include breakfast The reception deduct 50 euro for deposit after swiping my card for full amount of room charge This is unbelievable Even after I checked out for a day I still didn t get any text message from the bank that the deposit has been returned , The location is very convenient near to Centraal Dam and shopping center
387118,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The staff was very accommodating and friendly The hotel was in a great location and close to everything Amsterdam has to offer The rooms were decent in size and the beds were extremely comfortable I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to visit Amsterdam

387120,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, View was of dingy roof tops drapes and the sheer curtains closed for privacy which made the room less bright during the day , Very convenient in the city center and close to everything There are many very good restaurants within 30 seconds to 30 minute walking times We enjoyed the breakfast buffet fresh squeezed orange juice was excellent A variety of cold meats as well as cooked the wonderful flakey buttery croissants and fresh fruits and coffee machine NICE Staff was very helpful and friendly They made nearby restaurant recommendations which we enjoyed Tour arrangements can be made easily at the front desk Nice warm fire in the bar lounge on cold nights

387123,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, The daytime concierge is incompetent Anything he says is wrong and contradicts published guide books And attitude is an issue Thankfully the front desk staff particularly Kenny and Roy are interested in customer service informed helpful and generous with their time , The best hot chocolate ever

387129,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, After I opened the door of the room I had to go down the stairs It was an inconvenience to carry my bags but exercise The ceiling was high and I could see the piIlars and the roof on the bed It was somewhat cold at night I thought the insulation was not good A heater and warm water in the bathtub were helpful , Just 1 tram stop distance from the central station or walk Just opposite the police station Good place to begin the tour Taxi fare from Schiphol airport about 50 55 euro my case I arrived in the late evening Nice breakfast Kind staff Quiet atmosphere Good fast WiFi open

387134,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, The d cor of the hotel is uninspiring very bland with little character The corridors are very utilitarian with a strange brick pattern carpet which is not very inviting and warm The lighting in the bedroom was very poor very difficult to read at night , The hotel is well located for ease of access and exploring Amsterdam The staff were all very helpful and friendly Our double room was adequate but not luxurious in any way The bed was comfortable The bathroom small but adequate 
387135,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, The hotel pre authorised over 1 600 from my bank account by reserving 9 first night stays against a booking for 6 rooms Explain that one But they couldn t So imagine being in the most expensive city in euro and not having access to what is basically your spending money There was no reversal of the deposit No apology for their mix up No attempt to help No managers available Waited for over 20 minutes to talk to someone who basically could not help Passed me onto someone else who would definitely Email me and help No Email Phoned to complain No manager available to talk to Asked to ring back Now back home and still awaiting the reversal of the secured payments three days later I have travelled the world on business and never experienced such incompetence in a hotel A promising weekend in Dam ruined by the hotels mistake that they did nothing to resolve , Nothing The complete non committal to help when we had a problem was quite frankly disgusting 
387136,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, Our Amsterdam experience was ruined by the ridiculous booking policy of taking secured pre payment Having booked 6 rooms for three nights the hotel actually secured 9 first night costs one week before the stay 9 x 180 Why 9 for 6 rooms When asking the manager the answer was no idea However it got worse On check in they then secured the full three nights cost from my accounts not just the remaining 2 So effectively they secured 4 night stay for 3 nights just over 5 000 from my account against a stay that cost 3800 That 1 200 was our spending money So imagine being in the most expensive European city with a chunk of our own money that we cannot access We ask the hotel to remove and they just paid lip service to us Several times they were asled yo sort out Even the duty manager was asked but we got no help Unfortunately even now back from the holiday the secured money is still not cleared I would suggest avoiding this hotel like the plague Ive travelled the world and never experienced such incompetence , Nothing
387137,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, Down side is staff I lost my friend and asked to reception for help to call him Nobody even the front desk helped me I offered to pay for it and let me call him for 20 seconds It does not hurt to help customer with little issue In the end welcoming guy helped me with his personal mobile phone thanks a lot again , Good to stay for short trips Not so good in case of value for money but still comfortable and safe hotel Parking is no problem you can use public parking near to hotel special discount offered for hotel customers ask reception for discount

387144,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, Staying on my own I might have preferred a hotel closer to the museums This hotel is close to the station the Red Light District and the northern more downmarket end of the pedestrian shopping streets It s easy to get around but I ended up spending all my time on the southern end of the old city It just depends on what you re looking for , Nice self serve breakfast buffet

387150,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, I paid extra for a superior room and there was nothing different about it for it to be called a superior room I have stayed in travelodges with more space in them felt like what I paid for was the name of the room Plus there was no iron or ironing board in the room and the view was terrible as it was facing more windows I paid nearly 300 for 2 nights in superior and got basic , I loved that there was free wifi and i forgot to bring a European plug and the staff were helpful and gave me one while I stayed The location was perfect you could walk everywhere

387303,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, This time I was given a tiny tiny room far away in an aisle freezing cold and with a ridiculous space for moving compared to the price Not speaking of the so called desk which would hardly be useful to a baby, Location is good and lobby looks quite nice I have been in this hotel a few times before and was pretty satisfied

387310,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, That we had to ring the morning of checking out to find out if we could get a late one or not and after paying that amount I thought it was quite unfair that we could not get one Should be allowed to check the night before instead of the morning of as we wanted to get a good night sleep before travelling again Sadly once we woke to see if we could get one we could not get back to sleep and were exhausted on arrival home , That we were able to although late check out wasn t available we were still able to check out at 1pm 
387311,Inntel Hotels Amsterdam Centre, Just make sure you don t get a room near the elevator specially on the second floor Breakfast area It happened to me once and I asked to change room as soon as I notice where it was located A great staff accommodated my request very well and gave me an other room , I always stay in that hotel on my trip to Amsterdam Location is perfect Rooms are very clean Staff very friendly I supposed thats what you pay for
