407177,Hotel Mozart, The barman was not polite at all when I asked for two glasses made from glass The room is equiped with plastic glasses The room was very small half of meter on every bed edge even if it was an superior room and the view from the window was too ugly to be watched We stayed 4 nights and in one morning after breakfast I was food poisoned most probably from the meat There are no espresso and capucino available at breakfast unless you ask from waiters and they are not happy when asked and they don t even struggle to fake it ,No Positive
407178,Hotel Mozart, No place to leave towels to dry just one hook in the bathroom the same with luggage just one narrow luggage shelf Only plastic little cups supplied for hot drinks in the room Breakfast was very traditional being vegan I found I only had some fruits and tomatoes to eat , Very close to P Gerusalemme Metro station which made out travelling easy Quiet place nice big bed stylish A shoe polishing machine with brushes run by pressing a button positioned by he lifts very handy to use on your way out 
407179,Hotel Mozart, There is a park between Metro and the hotel where many teenagers 7 10 people were having a party drinking alcohol at night , Facilities are good Staffs are friendly and helpful Not too far from Metro 
407180,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, The staff were very helpful and replied immediately to my email asking for assistance with travel information from the airport Location was good as easy to access the Metro to all areas Hotel is clean and comfortable 
407181,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, The hotel was ideally situated near the metro for easy access into the centre of Milan Staff were very helpful in the best way to use public transport The local area had a variety of restaurants for dinner 
407182,Hotel Mozart, I booked 6 days there but when I was there how come My room was overbooked Then I had to move to another hotel for 1 night at 1 am I m not saying much about this cos it s your booking system issue and it has passed somehow but some of the receptionists have to know what is good service Try to smile more It s a service industry , location is good cleanness is good breakfast is good 
407183,Hotel Mozart, The bed was 2 singles pushed together when we wanted a double bed It isn t a nice experience falling down the middle of the bed during the night , Facilities and staff were all good
407184,Hotel Mozart, The air conditioning wasn t very strong , The staff was quick to accommodate us when we had an issue with the first room provided She was very nice 
407185,Hotel Mozart, The staff is rude They could not get money from my credit card while I was checking out and rudely told me that there is something wrong with my card I talked to my bank there was nothing wrong It was clear that there was something wrong with their connection But they rudely insisted I kindly asked them to call their POS help center they did not Just did nothing to solve the problem So I went to the nearest ATM and get some cash to pay using the same card Then while I was waiting in the lobby for my taxi I happened to hear that they were doing the same to another customer So I intervened and told the customer that there is nothing wrong with their card But they sent him to the ATM as well And the staff did not even care to apologize They might be doing this because they needed cash right away I do not know The hotel itself is definitely not 4 star in the UK US standards 2 star it is Beds are like wooden hard pillows are 2cm high the shower handle is fixed and half of the water goes outside WiFi keeps disconnecting and very slow staff throwing garbage at 2am making noises no chair in the room to sit on the desk just an ottoman no toothpaste old shower curtain with stains on it no TV channels in English apart from a couple of news channels like CNN and BBC smelly towels etc ,No Positive
407186,Hotel Mozart, Staff was unfriendly Location was not as described Room was small and bed was very uncomfortable , Air conditioning worked well Breakfast was very good 
407187,Hotel Mozart, We chose this hotel as a way to splash out in Milan but we were left a bit disappointed The room was incredibly small for the price we were paying there was no bath either especially for what was meant to be a 4 star we got the booking at half price 207 inc city tax for two nights and even then if we considered the full price there is no way we d spend it here It just didn t feel like a 4 star at all No one offered to carry our bag to our room when we arrived we weren t offered a map until we asked or offered any tips no lowdown on the hotel like an info booklet in the room apart from a free magazine either These things aren t huge but for a 4 star you d expect a certain level of class , The location was great right next to the metro the hotel was quiet Air con worked perfectly good selection at breakfast 
407188,Hotel Mozart, Hotel parking is always full They will direct to near by parking which is expensive Air conditioning is acient and the room was very hot, Not far from metro station

407190,Hotel Mozart, I expected a little bit more choices for brakfast The garage is really narrow but I suppose that s the case when you book something near the center of the city , The location is really great Metro station almost just in front of the Hotel The staff is very frendly 
407191,Hotel Mozart, Having stayed in the centre of Milan previously we did miss not being able to walk to the sights such as the Galleria and the Duomo , The breakfast and the staff in the breakfast room were very good The hotel staff were very helpful in resolving difficulties in our original room and then moved us to a better room The metro was close and made access into the centre of Milan very manageable 
407192,Hotel Mozart, Car parking is another company little far and I didnt like that I had to leave the car key , Excellent value Nice neighborhood You can see that they value their customers My best stay in Milano
407193,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Old but very confortable hotel in a very nice location of Milan There s a Metro station right in front of the entrance Nice staff good breakfast good room good bathroom Nice restaurants around Would stay again for sure 
407194,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Good proximity and easy to walk into centre even easier to get metro if feeling lazy Recommend getting airport shuttle bus into town which Easyjet sold tickets for on the plane 
407195,Hotel Mozart, Room is below average a bit old and very small Shower is very unpractical Parking is tiny , Breakfast was good Connection to the city center by metro is very practical 
407196,Hotel Mozart, The breakfast was the same each day for 3 days of stay not so many varieties to choose from Surprisingly for Italy the coffee and juice were poor , The staff is perfect very friendly polite and helpful The room was not so big but it was clean and everything has been there The neighborhood is quiet and green Metro station and supermarket are very close 
407197,Hotel Mozart, Perfect for us as we enjoyed the walking and variety of restaurants and bars The public transport is good fun Cannot find any down sides , Next to metro so perfect Two day transport card at 8 25 euros was excellent Local restaurants much cheaper than centre so had the benefit of choice Walk into town is quite long but plenty of bars cafes and pick up a tram at any point along the way Super park to walk through Sempione and then you are at the centre The hotel staff were wonderful and printed my train ticket for me as I was travelling on The breakfasts are amazing and the staff wonderful 
407198,Hotel Mozart, Personnel was so so Breakfast for this value wasn t to good Small parking which was full so had to park outside of hotel I wouldn t chose this hotel again , Close to metro station

407200,Hotel Mozart, Croissants were so so not fresh not so tasty Cappucino was also not great Overall breakfast was very basic with not much choices , The room was very nice Small but clean quiet and comfortable And location is very good 
407201,Hotel Mozart, The web site should say how close the hotel is to Gerusaleme Metro station as it makes it very easy when you know that We were using brochures which had old metro maps and we did not realise that we could have used Gerusaleme until we were leaving , The staff were friendly and very helpful The breakfast was very good with a great choice of menu 
407202,Hotel Mozart, Needs some renovation or improvements Old style dirty used up carpets Hard uncomfortable bed Bathroom uncomfortable placement design Not possible to sit straight on the toilet , Staff friendly and helpful Makes the best out of it 
407203,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Good breakfast for Italy with fresh fruit The rooms are medium sized and the bathrooms small but the bed was comfortable and the shower pressure good Quiet Quite a few restaurants nearby and the metro is just a few steps 
407204,Hotel Mozart, I didn t find during one night staying, location it was good to get it easy after we arrive by train to the city and then we take subway keetle in the room bath tea and coffe nice and clean place 
407205,Hotel Mozart, Breakfast was underwhelming The room was very poorly lit and the paint job on the walls was really bad There is no cupboard or drawer space to put our clothing so we had to live out of a case during our stay Rooms were very stuffy , Hotel location was great for getting into the centre of Milan and the staff were friendly 
407206,Hotel Mozart, The bathroom was extremely smelly and the pillows were way to thin The croissants at breakfast tasted bad and cheap No English channels on the TV , The bed was big and comfortable The room itself was ok it was very much like described on the booking site Everything was kept nice and clean Breakfast was ok Nice and polite staff 
407207,Hotel Mozart, I have stayed there a few times and it shouldn t be too hard to keep track of people who have been there more than once and get you to feel special with for example a small upgrade or generally a little attention Last time I got a single room on the first floor smaller than a medium car internals and on the same height as the roof next door so when it rains it is impossible to sleep because of the noise I did highlight this to the reception but didn t really get any answer nor a simple I am sorry let me see what I can do It is a no stay next time in Milan , The location is good and overall it s an average hotel where most of the times you get good deals on the rate Breakfast and Wi FI are always included 
407208,Hotel Mozart, Nothing to note apart from the parking onsite is small only available options is private parking next door or free parking on the roads if you can find a space , Beds were comfortable staff were very helpful Breakfast was tasty Rooms were a little small for a triple room but served us perfectly for the one night we stay there I have no complaints about this hotel it s very nice 
407209,Hotel Mozart, The breakfast was rather modest The shower cabine was really small , The location is excellent There are a lot of cafeterias and restaurants around this place in walk distance Supermarket is in 2 min Local market works twice a week Tue and Sat Metro 200 meters 
407210,Hotel Mozart, The room was bit small , Nice comfortable hotel in friendly neighborhood Just 2 mins walking from gerusalemme metro station The metros are very well connected and hence you can travel all across the city easily The breakfast spread was also good too Friendly helpful staff 
407211,Hotel Mozart, They advertise air conditioner on they facilities and we had an air conditioner in our room but they turn it off and make up every possible excuse to not turn it on We came back one afternoon from a very long walk and our room was extremely hot since the sun hits our window the whole day It was 20 degrees that day but in the room it felt like 30 So I called down to reception to ask why our air conditioner wasn t working and the lady told me that they have shut down the power because many gest were complaining that their rooms were too cold Which I found it was weird since you could turn the air conditioner off from the rooms they have a remote So I explained to the receptionist that our room was too hot and she got super upset because they have turned of the power for the air conditioning in the whole hotel and she would have to turn it on just for us She yelled at me on the phone and hung up two minutes later the air conditioning was working but it went off half an hour later That was our firs day in Milan and we stayed for three nights and the air conditioning never works despite me calling and asking for it They response was always it s on you just have to wait for it They claim to be a 4 star hotel when it does not deserve even 1 star , I liked it was super close to the subway just 50 meters and you could reach every attraction between 30 minutes walk 
407212,Hotel Mozart, There are 3 or 4 steps to the entrance A ramp would be very nice when you come or go with a heavy bag , A very nice and quiet place close to a wonderful Sempione park 30 minutes walk most of it thru the park to Castello Sforzesco and 10 minutes more to the city center Duomo La Scala etc A great breakfest nice clean rooms very helpful personnel free Wi fi and high speed Internet access in the entire hotel An excellent gelateria Il massimo del gelato and a very good osteria within 100 m from the door Reasonable prices in both places and also in the hotel itself Highly recommended 
407213,Hotel Mozart, The maid threw away my lotion cap The toilet was leaky on the first day It got fixed later One of the receptionists a lady was extremely cold and unfriendly , The breakfast was really great and the bed was pretty big 
407214,Hotel Mozart, Adjoining Rooms Make sure you dont have a room with interconnecting doors all these adjoining rooms are very noisy you can hear your neighbors talking We had to change our room after 1st night but 2nd night was even worse since people in upper floor arrived at 4 35 a m and continued their party till 6 30 I had to go to the reception but it did not help Honestly I expected some better rooms if you are staying at 4 star hotel in the downtown No vegetables for breakfast only fruit pastry and common meal , Friendly Staff Location
407215,Hotel Mozart, The room was very small , The hotel is very cosy and the staff are so nice and polite they are also very helpful just ask for anything and they will help if they can The location of the hotel is perfect and very near to the metro station The breakfast is something 
407216,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, A great Hotel if you are going to San Siro Opposite the new metro station that takes you direct to the Stadium 5 minutes walk away are the Offside sports bar the 442 sports bar and Mulligans Irish pub A very safe area with good local restaurants The hotel staff are all very friendly and happy to help I look forward to my next visit 
407217,Hotel Mozart, Noise from the road and the other rooms but disapeared after 10 pm so it hasn t disturbed me during my sleep , Stylish clean and well furnished room the bed was super comfortable Great breakfast with a lot of choice Kind staff 
407218,Hotel Mozart, No complaints, Delicious breakfast buffet which was kept well supplied by friendly helpful staff Room very comfortable clean with excellent small showerroom Hotel situated in a very nice untouristy quarter of Milan with excellent transport links to it s many attractions 
407219,Hotel Mozart, There is nothing to dislike it is a good hotel with good staff and god food and we have stayed there at least 6 times , Its always good here the location is ok but a little far out from the city centre but the metro is close by so very good overall breakfast is good also 
407220,Hotel Mozart, There was no problems with my break to Milan everything went even better than I expected Having never been there before I was a bit apprehensive but it really was fantastic Great Hotel Lovely staff beautiful weather and an amazing City , The hotel was based in a residential district only 1 5mls from Milan centre there was public transport right outside property if required but the weather was beautiful during our stay so my wife and I enjoyed the exceptional walk through semipone park and Sforzesco castle into the centre every day All staff at the hotel were very helpful and polite I expected only croissants and coffee for breakfast but to my surprise there was meats cheeses lovely cake and fruit all available there was also bacon and scrambled eggs cooked to perfection I did book a suite in the hotel for my stay as it was very reasonably priced and had a massive King size bed the room overlooked the streets below and a small childrens play park There are plenty of restaurants and bars in the vicinity of the hotel which were very good China town is about 0 5 mls away When booking this break I originally searched for hotels in the centre but so glad I changed my mind and picked The Mozart Hotel It was my first trip to Milan and what a beautiful city it is If I do decide to return and there are vacancies at The Mozart I will definitely be staying there 
407221,Hotel Mozart, We couldn t switch on the AC and it was really hot during the night We contacted their FO on our first night and told us that the ACs had some problems and a technician would fix it soon 4 nights into our trip the AC still didn t work , Breakfast was a typical Italian one super delicious with fresh pastries everyday Rooms where spacious and clean The location is great and there is metro stop just a couple of metres away 
407222,Hotel Mozart, front desk people s attitudes and the cleaning smell of the room it smells like somethings chemicals When you need the front desk people to book a restaurant for you they didn t like to help you at all I saw the staff was smoking in front of the entrance , breakfast is good F B service staff is friendly 
407223,Hotel Mozart, Our room and hotel in general was extremely hot temperature wise when we asked reception about this at the hotel they told us it was due to them having warm weather the week before ,No Positive
407224,Hotel Mozart, 1 The smell from the sewage in our room 2 As a late breakfast eater I was at the restaurant during breakfast for coffee one of the waitresses wouldn t allow a tiny peace of a breadroll taken with me for later , Super friendly reception desk staff Proximity to the metro tram and bus Super cool neighbourhood Lots of cafes restaurants nearby 
407225,Hotel Mozart, Rooms not massive even from the perspective of a Superior , Small friendly hotel Excellent staff with good English Clean and well managed generally Adequate facilities without the bells and whistles Breakfast only which makes perfect sense Not in the greatest area but still OK Convenient for Chinatown and easy access to central Milan
407226,Hotel Mozart, A pity coffee at breakfast was instant we d have expected real coffee in Italy Also some of the breakfast staff need to smile more and make better eye contact with guests One other minor negative rooms overlooking the square can be quite noisy especially if hot with windows open it would be good if such rooms could have a fan , An excellent value for money stay in a conveniently located next to a Metro station hotel where most of the staff really cared and made us feel welcome 
407227,Hotel Mozart, The staff was professional but maybe a bit more distant and rigid that what it should be , The room was extremely comfortable and luxurious very good wifi and continental breakfast Quiet location tube station 50 m away around 25 mins commute to the Duomo attraction Other attractions 15 mins away Would recommend this one and return definitely 
407228,Hotel Mozart, Breakfast served coffee tasted like filter coffee not at all Italian , Perfect location to fly in close to underground and very close to city center Easy access to Sempione park and the party area adjacent to Arco de la Pace close to china town for very good meals and overall a very good pick in regards to facilities Extra plus for a good breakfast with a large variety of products 
407229,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, The location is safe and near the subway you can arrive in the center of the city in less than 30 min The breakfast is delicious and you have lots of options to choose from The personal is friendly and ready to help you any time I recommend this hotel Also is sutable if you travel with your kids because you have a park in front of the hotel 
407230,Hotel Mozart, The hotel tried to charge an extra 150 on check out They tried to make us believe that was the price Thankfully I took a copy of the reservation Due to this we missed out malpensa express train to the airport We then had to wait another half an hour for the next train and just about made our flight Probability best not to pay at the hotel and just to pay online at least that way there are no issues with price on check out, Location quite far from all the attractions However the metro was opposite the hotel which made things ok 
407231,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Value for Money Just a minute away from subway Breakfast was good staff was friendly and very helpful room was good enough to sleep washroom Bathroom was good and clean the only thing is you need to change metro for Duomo as well as for Feira Rho which i was attending 
407232,Hotel Mozart, Rooms were very small Final price in Euro at a significantly higher than the booked AED price and current bank conversion rate Would make it easier if priced in Euro , Location is by metro and an easy walk into the centre of town WiFi in hotel was very useful 
407233,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Room was ready and very clean Staff were always there to help Good breakfast Accessibly and close to the Metro line Really good restaurants in the vicinity 
407234,Hotel Mozart, Wi fi could be a little stronger and hot water and water pressure in shower has some room for improvement, Excellent service and location metro is right across the road Very comfortable and spacious room Very wide selection of breakfast foods and good value for money Highly recommended

407236,Hotel Mozart, Liked it all, Great location very clean rooms updated facilities staff very helpful great neighborhood We didn t take advantage of breakfast but we did have a breakfast bag made to go very generous amount of food in bag
407237,Hotel Mozart, The air conditioning does not work and the heater runs even if you shut it off The windows open only to find a metal shutter that you cannot lift but there is a tiny Crack for air So airflow is very minimal Shower head was broken which made bathing hard When I asked the front desk about the issues they just laughed Bed was not comfortable staff was extremely rude The photos showed a nice room our room was dark and looked like it was from the 70s I don t understand how this is a 4 Star hotel , The breakfast was ok 
407238,Hotel Mozart, A bit outdated but well enough kept Air ventilation in room fairly poor not automated however there seemed to be a cooling unit not used in winter Breakfast coffee was bitter juices had very artificial flavor breakfast mostly on the sweet side Overall ok breakfast though with fair assortment incl breads cereals scrambled eggs and sausage etc Noise goes through walls but luckily we had very quiet neighbors Fairly small standard room , Location 100 m from subway entrance bed was big 2m wide mattress was hard as in South Europe often pillow good linen and towels clean Nice football bar 4 4 2 500 meters away 
407239,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Breakfast is excellent location 20min walk from the city center metro station is 150m from the hotel Staff pleasant all recommendations for hotels

407243,Hotel Mozart, Rooms are not as shown on internet We were forced to move from our initial room as the carpet was very dirty and the room itself had a strong smoke smell, Breakfast was very good
407244,Hotel Mozart, Service so rude rooms very loud, The guy checking us in was so rude the other guests waiting were so shocked we all kinda looked amongst ourselves and giggled bell was friendly
407245,Hotel Mozart, Breakfast had variety but no quality Thin walls our room was right next to the two elevators and we could hear it all of the time , Great location right outside the Gerusalemme subway station Very clean place 
407246,Hotel Mozart, the Room was a little bit dark , This is an old four stars hotel that is perfect for a quick stay in terms of value for money The single room was comfy small but with all the needed amenities Good breakfast in a nice room 
407247,Hotel Mozart, the staff is not really friendly but helpful when you need them, very comfy and clean the location is not in the city center but just in front of a metro station
407248,Hotel Mozart, shower was tiny and door was broken, comfy beds great breakfast buffet lovely and very helpful Staff great and quiet Location Metro just round the corner quick ride to Milan centre 1change great Market and Ice Cream Parlour very close by Will come back
407249,Hotel Mozart, Breakfast coffee was a great disappointment, Great breakfast selection No restaurant for lunch or dinner but many good outlets of all price ranges in easy walking distance New Metro station within 70m
407250,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Good alternative for not staying in the centre of Milan Metro and tram next door and only 15 minute ride to central Milan Breakfast is much better than average Rooms are spatious 
407251,Hotel Mozart, Not applicable, William on the reception was extremely helpful and friendly Gave us a lot of information on tourist sites and where to visit based on the time of the day etc 
407252,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Everything was perfect Staff was very nice friendly and helpful and they accommodate all our requests Breakfast was excellent Room was cozy VERY CLEAN silent and pleasant Metro station 2 minutes waking distance from the hotel Tip the upper floor rooms seem to be better as view and silence

407254,Hotel Mozart, Rooms are old style and small You will nor enjoy your breakfast I will never stay in this hotel again , Actually nothing It was unexpected surprise 
407255,Hotel Mozart, powered milk for tea and coffee in the room Was quite expensive although i presume that is the going rate in a city, Chocolate filled croissants were delicious Good range of food choices fro breakfast The room was a generous size 
407256,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, My only bad two bad points were the lighting in the room it was very dull and the wait for hot coffee at breakfast was excessive However neither of those points brought my stay down it s a lovely place 
407257,Hotel Mozart, The hotel could do with some renovations but that would probably drive up the price , The location just a minute from the metro The staff we encountered were all very helpful 
407258,Hotel Mozart, Cab ride from Linete was about 30 euros including baggage fees , Nice rooms quiet and a very good breakfast Close enough to walk to many of the main attractions in Milan about 1 2 hour and next to the underground subway 
407259,Hotel Mozart, No air con Bathroom wasn t refilled toilet roll etc Easy access to underground and Milan centre , Modern room Good breakfast selection Good mini bar
407260,Hotel Mozart, the notice by the coffee machine advises it is coffee chicory etc its terrible but doesnt say importantly that you can get a proper and excellent coffee by asking the staff for an expresso , close to metro friendly good bar clean 
407261,Hotel Mozart, we travelled in October and found the hotel to be very warm considering it was over 20c outside and the the air conditioning was turned off so all you could do was open a window which meant being disturbed at nice whilst trying to sleep and also you could here people in other rooms when they flushed the toilet or emptied the sink Although a nice hotel I would not stay here again because I didn t get much sleep , A nice comfortable hotel in a good location right near a Metro station which made it easy to get around the rooms were nice and well furnished although the room and bathroom were small but the bed was large 
407262,Hotel Mozart, The neighbourhood is very quiet and you have to change metrolines to reach the city center Or walk to a tram line In the evening the empty metro corridoors are a bit scary for a traveller who travels alone even though they are brightly lightened , Old fashioned hotel in a quite good sense Not too big minibar in the room some extras in the bathroom Quiet place to sleep Breakfast was average for my liking but one can order any coffee from the polite waiter and waitress Hotel is next to a brand new metro M5 station Gerusalemme and it is easy to buy a single or one day ticket from the machine Great I had a single room for 80 euros which I consider a good deal 
407263,Hotel Mozart, Nothing But would advise to not driving in Milan A nightmare , The bed was comfortable considering it was two singles put together The buffet breakfast is and was AMAZING Not too far to walk to the sites a good 40 minutes 
407264,Hotel Mozart, Too small room as a superior single room breakfast was great but scambled egg needs some improvement as it was the only food i eat because hotels in Europe don t servce Halal food for muslims no soundproof i can hear people in next room or in corridor no heating or aircondition working , Good Price about 20 meters from Metro Station very clean comfortable bed internet connection is great 
407265,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, The staff in the breakfast room was brilliant and more than kind Rooms were clean spacious and comfortable Photos about the hotel and facts that we realized they matched 
407266,Hotel Mozart, The room was very dark and cold The shutters were broken I asked to fix them and after 2 days I was told that additional maintenance was needed and it was not possible to repair it The shutters were then pushed down leaving me completely in the dark with no view The food was running out very quickly and every morning I had to wait at least 10 minutes to have food again ,No Positive
407267,Hotel Mozart, There is no sound proof in the room You can easily understand what people are talking in the room next to yours Air in the room is extremely dry , Hotel is very close to metro station Rooms are clean and staff is extremely friendly 
407268,Hotel Mozart, The lighting in the room was poor but I was only there to sleep so wasn t a big issue , The staff on front desk were very helpful I asked a few questions and they sent me in the right direction When I came back they check to make sure I found everything ok 
407269,Hotel Mozart, Not clean especially towels Breakfast not good Same every day not good for the mone You have to ask for cups and glasses every time you need in the room, Location to my conference
407270,Hotel Mozart, Location is a bit of An in betweener For walking to the center of Milan it s still quite a walk , The Rooms were ok although small Breakfast was very good 
407271,Hotel Mozart, Parking issues road works Contacted hotel to ensure parking was available to be informed on arrival we couldn t park there Road work at hotel meant there was no where to stop to drop off luggage Had to move 4 x large cases 200m along the road from a private car park Shower cubicle small with leaking shower head that sprayed water everywhere , Room reasonable size quiet
407272,Hotel Mozart, Room d cor a little tired but perfectly clean, Good location close to metro station and a 10 min walk from centro Very helpful desk staff Comfortable room Good breakfast

407281,Hotel Mozart, Staff could be friendlier but when you ask something you ll get an answer Maybe short one but yo get it , Location was good Not in the crowed area Little boutiques and restaurants near Clean room 
407282,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, The hotel is well located right next to a subway station Staff is friendly and facilities are well cleaned Room are spacious and nicely decorated Good price quality
407283,Hotel Mozart, All really good most impressed, Location great just next to Metro spotlessly clean good sized comfy rooms well equipped really helpful staff and excellent value Really was a first class stay 
407284,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Lovely hotel A little out of the city but it is a really beautiful walk through sempione park into Milan Staff were friendly and helpful and breakfast delicious 
407285,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Found the hotel as a secret deal and what a deal it was Short walk to the metro giving easy access to the main parts of the city comfy beds and a nice bathroom The fact breakfast was included meant that we could enjoy more of Milan during our short stay 
407286,Hotel Mozart, Room was a little small and lighting was dark Breakfast buffet was basic, Right next to train station and restaurant district Staff very friendly and helpful
407287,Hotel Mozart, It is a bit far away from the center but there are shops and restaurants nearby Tram line is not far away , Really nice rooms and lobby Good breakfast 
407288,Hotel Mozart, There was a bad smell of sewer in the bathroom The coffee in the breakfast buffet was bad but the breakfast buffet was overall good , Great clean and Comfortable room with lots of space for 3 Adults Nice with a safe in the room for personal items and valuables Being on the 6th floor we had great views of the City 
407289,Hotel Mozart, breakfast could be a little bit more various especially when it comes to vegetables what s more important scrambled eggs were made from powder and it was actually disgusting breakfast definitely not recommended, good location very close to the metro station super nice and helpful staff very clean and comfortable rooms with hairdryer tea set dressing gown slippers and everything you may need for a short stay 
407290,Hotel Mozart, Extreme inflexibility of staff with nearly every aspect Although I am in the regi n every month definetely this facility will be avoided if possible,No Positive
407291,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Staff were extremely friendly and helpful Spoke good English Upgraded our room swiftly when air con stopped working Fabulous breakfast buffet Only a short walk to Semplione lots of local restaurants bars and cafes Underground station close by and street market twice a week across the road 
407292,Hotel Mozart, The bed was quite hard , Great location for walking and easy to get around using local and Red buses Very clean and tidy The breakfast was good although placement of the food condiments was confusing Very helpful staff at the front foyer Markets on a Saturday were located in the next street 
407293,Hotel Mozart, The pillows were so so so so so hard that sleeping with my sweater as a pillow was better The hotel was very noisy and sometimes at night the vacuum cleaner would be left in the middle of the corridor which was very weird , The location was very good 
407294,Hotel Mozart, Milan needs to promote its tourist icons we shouldnt have to question what is for visitos to see Even Big Bus needs to have more detail on its commentary , Close to transport tourist Big Bus gave great overview restaurants the terrace of the duomo was brilliant 
407295,Hotel Mozart, Breakfast is same everyday staffs eho are working to prepare breakfast seem they been swearing never to have smile face hard to communicate with them specially if you spoke only english Housekeeping know only hoe to arrange the room but if they saw rubbish in room they leave it as its without moving , Near to metro station 
407296,Hotel Mozart, THE SERVICE MY ROOM STILL HAD NOT BEEN MADE UP BY 2PM ALTHOUGH I HAD BEEN OUT OF IT SINCE 8AM WITH A SIGN TO SAY PLEASE MAKE UP WHEN IT WAS IT WAS HURRIED THERE WAS NO NEW BATHROOM TUMBLER I HAD TO FIT THE BULB FOR MY BEDSIDE LIGHT, GREAT BREAKFAST IN A NICE DINING FOOM
407297,Hotel Mozart, The charwoman once almost entered our room without realising we re still inside She did knock but I suppose she didn t hear us and decided she could proceed Another thing that pops into mind is that our king size bed was created by two big mattresses This caused some inconvenience for me and my gf while in active use iYKwIM , Breakfast was great imho a good selection of food 
407298,Hotel Mozart, If you are on business trip I don t recommend as Internet connection there is really bad Rooms are rather dark and unpleasant Breakfasts are really poor , Personnel at the reception was rather nice and location of the hotel is just next to the metro station which is perfect 
407299,Hotel Mozart, The AC was slightly questionable I m not sure if it was working properly as it wasn t as cold as I d have liked Apart from that all was good, Hotel staff extremely friendly We arrived at 12pm the room was ready early so we were able to check in before time We stayed in a superior double room Very clean lovely big bathroom nice comfortable bed 
407300,Hotel Mozart, but the scrumbled eggs was awful The worst i have ever tasted Even if the room was nice the bathroom wasn t There was a mold in the shower which was disgusting There is basicaly NO WIFI connection because the it s sooo slow that it s just useless , Location is right next to the metro station and it takes around 20 30 minutes to get to the city centre The room was nice and comfy Great breakfast with a lots of options also you can get an espresso or cappuccino on demand 
407301,Hotel Mozart, The breakfast quality was low in my opinion There were many kinds of bread and cheese but all looked the same somehow We were three but the single bed was separated from the double bed with a wall , The room was super clean and enjoyed the mini bar 
407302,Hotel Mozart, The room was small and quite dark especially as the aircon didn t work very well so we had to keep the shutters closed , The breakfast was very good and the hotel had an overall pleasant feel 
407303,Hotel Mozart, Nothing, The rooms were clean and spacious The breakfast was amazing and the staff were lovely and very helpful particularly as the airline lost our luggage for 3 days The reception staff told us the best places to find clothes to keep us going and the different places to eat Couldn t have been more helpful 
407304,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Helpful staff Location quiet half an hour walk from city centre which allowed us to discover a large park en route to the Duomo Cathedral La Scala and an excellent reasonably priced restaurant in Sempione on way back and close to the hotel Also good to have tea making facilities in our room which isn t common in Italy 
407305,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, The room was very comfortable The was a lot of options for breakfast It was a good distance from the center of milan The staff was also kind enough to let us check in early 
407306,Hotel Mozart, Room and hotel is much older than in the photo in booking com we were there on a summer hot day and air con in the room is not strong enough , Outside city but close to metro Many restaurants around for your choice 
407307,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, The Hotel has a luxury feel Our room was small but beautiful and comfortable Hotel is 2mins walk from metro stop All sites therefore is easy to access The staff at this hotel are all very nice Would highly recommend this hotel 
407308,Hotel Mozart, I think it cost slightly more than was advertised but that not withstanding was a very good experience I would recommend the hotel and would stay there again , Very welcoming and helpful staff Very good experience 
407309,Hotel Mozart, slow wifi very small underground garage 4 cars max little old style could use a renovation breakfast is medium quality no vegetables expensive,No Positive
407310,Hotel Mozart, Reception staff brilliant but other staff need some slight pointers Bellboy a bit over keen staring which was a little intimidating for a solo female traveller to be honest Probably well intentioned but worth mentioning it went beyond seeking to help or for a tip was too much At 11 30am maid unlocked my door and walked straight into my room despite the sign being on the door She didn t knock as precaution either luckily I was dressed and packing Neither are major things but it s always good to get feedback I guess , 12pm check out is really handy the extra 2 hours make the world of difference Beautiful high standard of room with a great shower and high quality luxury bed Great choice at breakfast too and very polite and helpful reception staff 
407311,Hotel Mozart, I was given an old room type and the explanation was that these classic rooms were advertised at booking com with lower rates I knew that the hotel had renovated nicer rooms due to my previous stay at this hotel I called the reception and they were very kind to change my room It would be good to check this before booking with the hotel It s not very close to the center It takes some time by tram when there is some traffic Note that there are lot of traffic lights and crossroads at Milano Ironing services are provided in 3 to 4 hours time I was offered the ironing set to my room Shower handle was leaking water I think technical controls are weak Very poor lighting in the bathroom, Quality vs price ratio was all right Good breakfast Clean and new towels 
407312,Hotel Mozart, Hotel quite difficult to find Poor evening dining , Visiting to sites of Milan Staff helpful about trams into middle of town Hotel restaurant poor for evening meal but good for breakfast Plenty of good eating nearby 
407313,Hotel Mozart, Bathrooms are clean but need renovation The amenities are not sufficient for two people please improve the quality of the hand soap which dries up drastically the skin after use The TV in our room had only 5 channels most of which Italian I don t mind but I hardly understand Italian The option to switch on and off the air conditionning should not depend on the season This is a client s right Best Western Hotels chain should care more about the quality of the hotels bearing its name I booked this hotel because of the good brand but now I will think twice before I book another Best Western hotel , The location of the hotel is quite good well connected to the city centre metro the new Purple line Relatively close to main points like Central Station and Porta Garibaldi trains Staff is polite and helpful but depending on what you ask I was denied switching on the central heating or air conditioning because we were not in the right season so the heating season was over in April but it was still cold in the hotel The breakfast is quite well organized all the products are fresh and the hygiene is at high level 
407314,Hotel Mozart, A bit small , Location was great 20 30min walk from Duomo Facilities were great room is a little small probably wouldn t want to stay for more than 1 or 2 nights Great Restaurant around the corner La Foglia 10 10 
407315,Hotel Mozart, Walls of Hotel room could do with more sound proofing as we could hear the neighbours quite clearly though they did seem noisier than usual , Good breakfast lovely dining room 25 min stroll to the castle and Milan Old town Metro station adjacent to Hotel Hotel in a pleasant residential area close to several good restaurants 
407316,Hotel Mozart, there are no complaints , The staff were amazing So helpful and friendly the breakfast was sensational Perfect location and also recommendations on the restaurants close by I especially loved Arrows and most fabulously Ristorante Controvento which was so lovely beautiful setting and we went there both nights superb meal fantastic staff I would definately go there again Thank you so much Tania 
407317,Hotel Mozart, Mattress was two firm would have liked a mattress topper , The helpful desk staff location being close to public transport and the sites The buffet breakfast was good The room clean and tidy 
407318,Hotel Mozart, Nothing everything was great, Staff was very helpful and polite and all spoke very good English Location although not central it is right next to a subway station so you can easily reach the central part of Milano Breakfast was excellent lots of variety to chose from
407319,Hotel Mozart, There is some variety on the breakfast buffet but poor quality for a 4 star hotel If you go for breakfast in the second or third wave half of the products are missing No Orange juice Not even artificial some other weird flavours yes The rest of the hotel is good,No Positive
407320,Hotel Mozart, The only thing that I can mention was the shower was a little small and awkward Nothing major just could have been better with a flexible shower hose rather than a fixed one , 2 mins walk from the metro station and easy connections to the Fieromilanocity expo centre and the centre of Milan Everything was very nice friendly staff good choice for breakfast and a nice bar area for drinks Wifi was also good 
407321,Hotel Mozart, Nothing negative to say, Location close to a metro station giving easy access to Milan centre and a bonus of excellent restaurants at a fraction of the price in the centre 
407322,Hotel Mozart, Decor is a bit dark, Underground safe parking Fabulous restaurant across the road Arrows Easy to use the trams The area from Corso Sempione right through to the Duomo is interesting 
407323,Hotel Mozart, A little bit pricy especially parking At the beginning they gave us a smoking room we had asked non smoking but then they changed us kindly Room was a little bit cold , Great breakfast Reception guys all very kind and helpgul They kept us the parking space and gave baby crib wich was very good Also allowed us to keep the luggage for free until evening All very clean and modern Good and quiet location just in front of a metro station but not certainly easy to get to Doumo and attractions area 
407324,Hotel Mozart, Restaurant would have been nice for dinner but not really a problem Also maid kept changing the towels despite the environmental notice saying to leave them in the shower if you wanted them washed which I didn t No good having an environmental policy if you don t adhere to it , Really good choice of breakfast items in a lovely light and attractive breakfast room Bar lounge area was comfortable with good free snacks at the bar reception staff were very helpful Everywhere was spotlessly clean and room was comfortable and quiet Metro just across the road 
407325,Hotel Mozart, I didn t like the noise from outside The refrigerator was very small , I liked having control of the Air Conditioning Unit I liked the convenience of the breakfast 
407326,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, staff were very helpful bed was really comfy and big it was a trip for me and my mom and we stayed in the superior double and there was loads of room breakfast was also really nice 
407327,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, The Hotel has a good position close to Gerusalemme Metro station close to caffe bars and restaurants One day we had a walk from the Dome to the Hotel and it took us like 30 minutes trought the Sempione Park It was very pleasent The breakfast is fantastic Various and tasty I realy recomand this Hotel and I recomand to book a superior room not the classic room 
407328,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Extra comfy bed room full of light large buffet every morning The hotel is located on the border of China town which offer originallity By the other side it is quiet and next to the parc of Sempone
407329,Hotel Mozart, Room had the worst bed It was hard as a rock Also unable to control room temp Very warm during our April stay Only way to cool off room was to open the window However street was very noisy Did NOT sleep well on any of our 4 nights , Fair price with full breakfast included Really liked the neighborhood Good restaurant recommendation from the front desk staff Close metro station made trip to city center easy 
407330,Hotel Mozart, Shower pretty much didn t work very weak flow cold and hot water were inverted , Very nice breakfast Very competent and professional staff Very clean and comfortable rooms Good WiFi 
407331,Hotel Mozart, The only thing what I ve missed for a 4 star hotel was a water boiler Don t forget that you have to pay 5 EUR each per night for tax reasons really annoying Our room was very hot also if we turned down the heat , The breakfast was really good and we had everything we needed You dont have to think that everything will be gone from the buffet if you are waking up late The city center is around 30 40 min away if you decide to walk You could also take the metro but I would suggest to walk as you will cross the beautiful park and old buildings etc Many little restaurants and places you could sit at night The hotel from outside doesn t look so nice but the inside is clean comfortable and staff is nice too 
407332,Hotel Mozart, They advertise with an early bird breakfast but do not have it I asked for an early bird breakfast in the evening before my departure The receptionist told me that this is no problem The next day I was told that there is no staff to prepare this and that I was not eligible for having such an early breakfast However I had to pay for it Bathroom is in need of renovation ,No Positive
407333,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Great location all attractions easily reachable by metro which is just a view meters away from the hotel Friendly staff everything clean good breakfast 
407334,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Breakfast was diversified the room was clean the hotel staff was ok The hotel is close to the subway Gerusalemme station From this station is simple to go to the Porta Garibaldi FS and Milano Centrale Also the hotel is close to Sforza Castle and Milan Cathedral 30 minutes walk It s in a very safe area of the city 
407335,Hotel Mozart, First of all I reserved this hotel as a 4 stars one But nothing was in that level The room was too hot and it was not possible to adjust the temperature The toilet smelled awfully All of the facilities were old There were stains on the bed , The location of the hotel is very good The breakfast was perfect 
407336,Hotel Mozart, I had a bad quarrel with one of the receptionist due to an invoice I needed and was issued on a wrong name The guy didn t want to listen what I need and what I expect and just repeating we have it that way and that s it Also permitted himself to comment me in Italian considering that I am not understanding It was absolutely unrespectful situtation and I think that a hotel that pretends to be 4 can t afford to begave like this with its guests , The biggest highlight of the hotel is the location next to the Metro station that connects you easily to the city centre and Rho Fiera 
407337,Hotel Mozart, Small room there is no difference in size between normal and superior room Superior rooms are renovated while the norma roomsl not There is no lobby bar at the hotel everything is served in the restaurant which is at level 1 , Clean and comfortable hotel just 30 metres from the Gerusalemme metro station on Line M5 Reasonable breakfast 
407338,Hotel Mozart, I could suggest not too much sweets for breakfast and some other foods But definitely the breakfast was very good , The hotel in his exterior seems old but the interior is very beautiful and the rooms are perfect The metro was 15 m far from the hotel and the neighborhood was very classy A lot of restaurants and some boutique There was a very hugh and beautiful park maybe 800 m far from the hotel Love this hotel Love Milano 
407339,Hotel Mozart, The room was a bit too small for my liking I felt as if the bath shower room was bigger than the room , Extremely friendly staff very cordial and very cooperative 
407340,Hotel Mozart, At breakfast the staff wouldn t let me move a small table so I could sit with my colleagues Fresh fruit salad would have been nice instead of tinned fruit , The staff were wonderfully friendly and helpful particularly the bar tender who gets 10 10 for being so nice and the reception staff 
407341,Hotel Mozart, Staff were not welcoming They were Not very keen to accomodate or help out with basic necessaries ie providing tea bags mil etc This made the stay quite unpleasant, Room was comfortable Decent breakfast
407342,Hotel Mozart, Close to subway but not TO THE Center Cab Ride about 20 Euro Room was small but Clean Bathroom ok but terrible shower NO view, The staff was helpfull and nice Nice Safe neighbourhood Breakfast was quite nice
407343,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Nice breakfast included Plenty on offer which set us up for the day Easy location right outside a metro station and only 5 or 6 stops from the San Siro Slippers and dressing gowns in the room Nice touch Room cleaned daily to a good standard 
407344,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Comfortable Friendly and helpful staff Great hotel as the name suggests Very close to Gerusalemme station making it easy to get around Also close to trams and train station Enjoyed my stay a lot and would definitely come back 
407345,Hotel Mozart, Nothing to complain about The location is not very central but the metro is directly across the road and the 30 40mknutes walk into town is through a beautiful park and castle , Very comfortable and clean 
407346,Hotel Mozart, No view No iron in the room had to ask for it , Nice safe location near the metro The shower was great Nice Robes nice bedding Great breakfast Best pastries ever Friendly staff 
407347,Hotel Mozart, Reception Stuff wasnt so helpfull they look at me like what a uck did you come here and seemed like been waited til I get out from the hotel But with Italians custumers they been so helpfull and nicely That you can see it in their eyes , I think the best part of that hotel was my comfortable bed and breakfest Thank you for that 
407348,Hotel Mozart, Drinks were significantly more expensive than anywhere else we visited , Loved the location lots of restaurants nearby and nice walk through park to the centre Excellent family room with separate sleeping areas 
407349,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, The actitude I was in trouble after midnight because of documentation of my flight and i found real help to work it out Without it i would have been in a very bad situation Breakfast was delicious 
407350,Hotel Mozart, We were family of 4 One room on level one basic room the other level 5 better quality room We asked if it was possible to be on the same level the manager told us the hotel was fully booked He did not want to help Very blunt and arrogant When we went to check out the lady at reception was the same No smile or anything Very rude , Breakfast was enjoyable 
407351,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Photos in page shows it all Soft feel carpet floor Spacious room bathroom Free WiFi safe cabinet included Excellent cleaning service Supportive and kind staff Impressive breakfast with anything one could ask for served in a wonderful environment Very quite location Just 150 metres from the metro station taking you everywhere 
407352,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, We stayed in this hotel for one week during Christmas The hotel is not exactly in the centre of milan and there are like two train changes to arrive near the duomo but for the price we paid it was quite a nice hotel and the metro is only 3 mins away In the room we had a nice shower tea coffee making facilities that were given for free when we asked i also forgot my toothbrush and they gave me a new one immediatly Also one day we had to catch a train early in the morning and since we had to skip breakfast they prepared for us a small breakfast to take on the trip with us In summery all our requests were always met so thumbs up to the staff Few mins away from the hotel there is a hairdresser and also a very very big supermarket were you can buy almost anything Across the street there is also an amazing restaurant which specialaize in fish called Arrow s which is worth a try Almost all the staff was helpful and friendly except one of the breakfast womans with black hair and glasses who was always so pissed off unfortunatley The breakfast had a large variaty of sweets a bit less choice of food The scrambled egg was something we didnt like so much as it had a funny sweet taste Also if you want to have a drink at the bar they offer also free nibbles after 5pm which we thought was a nice gesture I did not give 5 star only because the location is far away from the centre otherwise the hotel is very value for money Thankyou for making our holiday a little more perfect 
407353,Hotel Mozart, Nothing Everything was great , Room was big the bed was huge and comfortable Breakfast was rich and great The hotel is near the newly opened Gerusaleme metro station from there it s a 15 minute ride to the Duomo 
407354,Hotel Mozart, It was really noisy You could hear almost everything from the other rooms If your purpose is to relax you might not achieve that , The breakfast and location Good access to the metro
407355,Hotel Mozart, An off location it will take you 40 minutes with subway to reach the dom square The photos in the website are so different than the dirty small and shady rooms Zero facilities ,No Positive
407356,Hotel Mozart, The soundproofing is really weak you can easily hear what is going on at your neighbours , The hotel is close to the metro station and it is easy to get to the center of the city Nice personal Good breakfast 
407357,Hotel Mozart, Shower without the possibility to take in in hands so every time I was forced to wash hair as well which was quite uncomfortable, Nice location nice hotel fair price for Milan
407358,Hotel Mozart, Maybe it is a little bit outside of the city center however it does not really matter as subway is close , The location of the hotel is nice The subway station is 2min by walk Staff was very nice and helpful Also the room was clean and nice 
407359,Hotel Mozart, Room front desk staff First room that i got was not tide up Had to ask for the second one Tv channels did not work had to restup channels by myself, Location is not bad 
407360,Hotel Mozart, Room not properly cleaned room needs a makeover Bath room a disaster shower nor adequate shower curtain a disaster time to move on now from shower curtains, Location was good staff good 
407361,Hotel Mozart, I ve experienced a very irresponsible incident on Sunday night I have asked your reception whether I can park my car on the side street or not as there were very few cars which is quite unusual The answer was people might be away for the weekend and probably that is why there are few cars The next morning when I walked out I saw that the car was towed When I asked your morning shift receptionist about where the car could be his answer was there is a street market and that I should have not ced the sign I have told him that I have already asked the question and I was never informed about it despite the fact that I asked the night before The attitude and the way that I received the response should not be the way that a customer should be treated Your receptionist told me that I should have known this As a visitor can not know this detail on top of all Due to the car tow I lost half a day of my business meetings which also resulted with a financial loss ,No Positive
407362,Hotel Mozart, Breakfast was a bit grim in a crowded and stuffy hot room , Check in was easy and friendly I think I was lucky to get parking on street outside Room bed and shower were all good Free wireless internet through hotel with no silly logins or passwords was great 
407363,Hotel Mozart, The hotel get money from my bank account without notification to me while my reservation was said to have been cancelled they said they were trying to see if i have money in my account rooms too small for 180 Euro,No Positive
407364,Hotel Mozart, The room was a lttle tight to circulate The room was relatively hot as AC was not operational A strange noise was a nuisance during sleep perhaps since the room was situated at level 1 and overlooked the parking area Of, The proximity of the hotel to the Metro Gerusalemme purple line A 100 meter walk to the station takes you every where in Milan Very clean room and an excellent breakfast 
407365,Hotel Mozart, They had problems with WiFi during our stay so we had limited or no access to internet , Staff Cleanliness and Location very close to new Metro station in Piazza Gerusalemme 
407366,Hotel Mozart, Arrived at the hotel after a very long plane flight over 20 hours to find that all they had was a single room available and would not let my husband stay even if I agreed to pay more money This was fashion week so there were no hotels available We were not aware of the rules in Italy not allowing for guest to stay in single rooms The hotel desk person was very rude and said there was nothing he could do and walked away The worst part was they would not refund my payment so I had to pay for 2 nights and couldn t stay at the hotel Spent another 2 hours searching for a room and had to go 30 minutes outside of town to find one ,No Positive
407367,Hotel Mozart, A little expensive due to world expo , Staff were friendly and helpful location was within walking distance to Duomo centre say 20 mins but through park and fab streets 
407368,Hotel Mozart, The fotos of the hotel on the website are really good the reality is a bit more modest in general good place however no complaints , Nice hotel the location is quite secure and close to the metro stations and big street with some shops supermarkets tasty restaurants and nice park Parco Sempione at the end of the street with many bars and cute locations for some evening aperitivo The stuff was patiened while we have problems with our credit card and managed to have it charged only at the end of our one week stay 
407369,Hotel Mozart, There is an older woman staff at the reception who did not smile when we approach her She is snappy and sarcastic I did not like her I decided to avoid her because I do not want her to ruin my good mood and my enjoyable stay there Take note the two asian ladies at the reception are warm and very accommodating , For me the hotel is a perfect location to go to the city center of Milan as well as to go to the EXPO especially by underground 
407370,Hotel Mozart, Very hard bed matrass A lot of noise coming from someplace close to room either laundryroom or ventilators , Very nice room facilities Excellent breakfast 
407371,Hotel Mozart, No bad experiences it was just a hotel Whilst very clean the rooms are small with no facilities Only English tv channel was bbc world news , Located in suburbs which we liked as you mix with the locals It s not in a tourist area again which we liked
407372,Hotel Mozart, 1 The staff are not friendly and they are not updated about the transportations Always they are asking us to walk to Domosola underground station and we discoverd their is new station across the road 2 The room is not well clean aafter the complain they started cleanig the rooms 3 Still they are usuing the old room key 4 OVer all the facilities below the standard ,No Positive
407373,Hotel Mozart, Unbelievable that this hotel does not serve a coffee at 3 PM in the lobby The minibar was not refilled Unpleasant smell in the bath room , The very nice ladies taking care of the breakfast 
407374,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, Very unfriendly and arrogant hotel Do not book here I could not come because of a medical condition didnt matter to them They just want your money Stay away from here 
407375,Hotel Mozart, Staff attitude V unhelpful location is V far from city Center 12 Euro for one way to city Center no gym facility room size is very small outdated lobby Furnuture nothing close to this hotel no Resturant no shops nothing attracted picture in booking com not refracting the reality of this hotel No adaptor to charge your iPhone but if you need you have to go down to lobby charge it in the reception area no iron facility in the room lift is very small for only 2 pepople and very slow , Bed 
407376,Hotel Mozart, Nothing, The staff are very helpful Location has improved with the new Metro and Overground Station Direct to the San Siro Excellent location just 3 minutes to the great 442 sports bar and 5 minutes to the Offside sports bar 
407377,Hotel Mozart, Breakfast items were not replaced very quickly when they ran out on the Sunday e g bread for toast water for tea was cold suggesting urn wasn t refilled quick enough etc A little chaotic but the staff were helpful when asked for things , The helpfulness of the staff nothing was too much trouble 
407378,Hotel Mozart, Being a 4 stars hotel belonging to a big chain I would expect more maintenance , Breakfast and staff was good but the rooms are old and not well kept The glass shower box was heavy and dangerous Toiletries provided were very limited there was no body lotion 
407379,Hotel Mozart, It would be nice if you had a scale available for guests to be able to weigh luggage before flying It gives peace of mind if you are afraid that you might be over the limit We had to pay 6 euros at the airport to weigh our luggage , The bed was huge and firm just the way I like it The staff was helpful and nice except the night shift concierge which gave us a little attitude 
407380,Hotel Mozart, Wifi doesn t always work as expected , Good value for money Easy to reach places of interest like the Duomo using the tram Station is just 5 minutes away Breakfast is very generous and the rooms are very clean Highly recommendable 
407381,Hotel Mozart, The hotel is quite common the situation not really at the center of Milano 3 metro needed to go to the Center The room was standard nothing special but the cleanings was not OK We have been weak up at the 2 AM of the morning by the noise of broken glasses maid for a part by the staff of the hotel Plus the noise continue until the 6 AM We highlight this point to the staff of the hotel on the morning and they didn t care The staff customer orienting mind was really poor Breakfast level was poor , nothing special
407382,Hotel Mozart,No Negative, The Staff were excellent very helpful Our room was lovely and very comfortable Bathroom was quiet spacious with a very good power shower The variety of the food was excellent for breakfast I would highly recommend this Hotel 
407383,Hotel Mozart, Far away from city center We don t safe at nights in this neighborhood Breakfast is above Italy average but not so good anyway , Clean calm helpful staff
407384,Hotel Mozart, I was there at the height of August vacation so a lot of local places were closed I assume it s a semi lively neighborhood the rest of the year The tram and metro stop which also has suburban train lines to places like Lake Como is a 10 minute walk Breakfast is fine not great , Solid practical hotel in a quiet but not empty neighborhood
