8301,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room to small which was difficult to navigate with 2 large suitcases Our room wasn t made up till about 4 30 in the afternoon even though we had been out for at least four hours earlier in the day , Close to Kensington Palace which is the reason I stayed there Georgeous lobby and sitting room full of history Helpful staff 
8302,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, In relation to the view from the room was originally given a room in the basement window faced a wall Asked to move which they kindly facilitated and got a slightly smaller room on the 4th floor so I could see the sky but was looking out on a flat roof As they said the hotel was busy there wasn t much choice so I was happy that they moved us , Location and staff
8303,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Very small single room and an even smaller shower 2ft x 2ft square difficult to get in and out at my age 75 I am glad I was not obese To get to my room was by lift and stairs Not easy with a suitcase Staff helped, Staff were very helpfull Hotel was clean Location close to 2 underground stations Bayswater and Queensway Close to shops and Hyde Park 
8304,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The rooms were quite small even though we had a club room In particular the bathroom it was really small and the sink you couldn t even get your head near to brush your teeth and the tap that was on the sink was huge , I booked this hotel because of the architecture of the actual building and the price was ok The building was beautiful 
8305,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing not to like, The room single though small was very comfortable The breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice The staff polite helpful and efficient 
8306,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We were not happy with the room it very small fortwo people it was difficult moving around each other as well has having our things in the way , The bed was very comfortable
8307,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, There was an issue with pre payment authorizations however we did contact the hotel directly and they resolved the problem promptly, The breakfast was amazing so much to choose from there s something for everyone
8308,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, None of the windows in the hotel open which can be a little stuffy in the rooms This isn t down the the hotel though as the building is listed and they can not change the windows , Breakfast was very good Style of the hotel suited what we like 
8309,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We were booked into a Superior room but the bathroom was accessed down steep stairs and that small that it was in my opinion dangerous , The property was historically interesting and the staff were excellent 
8310,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The furniture needs a bit of renovation Wanted to have their breakfast but the kitchen smell was all over the dining room So went to out , The loacation is very good 
8311,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Views from windows Always ask for rooms with the view on Main Street Otherwise will get noisy neighbors and some kind of warehouse that starts business 6 00 in the morning , Typical London hotel in historical building Friendly staff Good location Value for money Pictures of the hotel on web site are real 
8312,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I m glad that I booked this room for 55 instead of close to 200 on the hotel s website , The room was smaller than expected but furnished in a way that made it very comfortable and usable I also liked the electricity saving device that turns off all the lights once you leave the room 
8313,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Old hotel was grand once no doubt Reminded me of genteel poverty Our room looked onto back of other buildings and dumpsters which were unloaded early in the morning Very small rooms Busy street on other side of the square with shops lots of tourist tat chemists and eateries 
8314,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The only thing that bothered me was the size of the room With 2 people you couldn t pass each other That said all the good things and especially the location compensated this , Staff was friendly the hotel was clean and the breakfast really good 
8315,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was TINY for the price The room was only big enough room for a single bed and someone to stand next to the bed The window wasn t much bigger than a computer monitor and was in the top corner of the room similar to what I d imagine a prison to have I was on the very top floor it felt a bit like an attic room Great staff but just wouldn t stay again as I wasn t comfortable in the room , The breakfast was fantastic and the staff were brilliant They were really friendly and always keen to help Very close to Queensway tube and on the doorstep to Hyde Park 
8316,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was so small and bathroom was even smaller Showering resulted in everything in sight being drenched no workable shower screen and pathetic shower headlike , Hotel was relying on its location undeniably good but the room and bathroom sizes will eventually be it s undoing People expect more these days and are prepared to pay more
8317,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, The staff and Management were top class and very helpful nothing was too much trouble for them The breakfast was excellent with a good choice of food The rooms were smallish but the service compensated for that Thumbs up for this hotel Good location just off Bayswater Road close to Queensway and Bayswater tube stations 
8318,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The reception are not polite and some of them don t know what to do when they meet up with any kind of problems Definitely I ll never ever stay there again even still water is not available in this hotel When you ask reception that can I have a bottle of water You will got right away this answer We have got glass in the room and you can drink tab water believe me never try tab water Tasty like stream water honestly it was terrible staying Even if you want to leave one day early they will never refund your money back You have to pay exactly how many days you think at beginning ,No Positive
8319,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, could not get the TV to work not overly concerned Room small but I guess that was to be expected and sufficient these are only minor items, room clean and smart 
8320,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bathroom was tiny you could sit on the loo clean your teeth and enjoy a shower all at the same time not enough room to swing a cat I had to use the public toilets on returning to the hotel to collect my luggage and unfortunately it was down a flight of stairs and wasn t clean it smelled of stale urine not good , I asked for a quiet room and I only heard one siren but the outlook over the dumpsters wasn t spectacular It was a surprise to receive half a bottle of wine don t like Merlot so my friend enjoyed it but the thought was nice 
8321,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was tiny which was a surprise since it is not a cheap hotel We were told we were given an upgrade I cannot imagine what we were supposed to have Also the shower screen was ridiculously skinny which defeated its purpose The bathroom mirror has a function whereby a part of it does not steam up The demisted part was too high up the mirror for me to see myself thus defeating the object once again There was very little thought put into these issues On the whole I feel we would have got more for our money at premier inn , Breakfast was excellent
8322,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, liked everything , I had to wait at reception for check in for 20 minutes and I was annoyed the kind Italian gentlemen at the reception added FREE breakfast for me and kept trying to crack jokes until I had a smile and accepted the apology The free breakfast was very good and I would definitely of paid for it Variety of things to have I checked out but my meeting was at 4pm they let me wait at the lovely waiting room downstairs until I was ready to leave The staff definitely cared about their customer being happy Thank You I d definitely come again
8323,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I paid for Club rate and the size of the room was tiny couldn t properly fit 2 suitcases in it Additionally there was only a really narrow small window A friend who paid for the same rate got a basement room with a terrible smell The room bathroom was not well cleaned and necessities such as shampoos soaps etc were not re filled added during our stay I am pretty sure that sheets were not changed either during our 4 day stay The carpet was poorly laid on top of an older one in a very obvious way Staff was not consistent with clients for example the same request book a room for an extra night had 2 different responses from 2 different staff members we cannot please book through the website and yes sure , The only positive is the location of this hotel 
8324,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room doors don t have any padding to slow them down so during the evening everyone coming and going sounded like they were slamming their doors , Great old building that s kept in good shape Immediate access to Hyde Park and a nearby London Underground station were both very nice The staff were busy but alert nice and efficient 
8325,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Hot sandwich from room service was cold Tiny room but this is typical for London especially a single room , Very welcoming staff Requested a room with a bath I received it Gorgeous character and reception lounge area with fresh flowers Excellent price 
8326,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Service from reception entered my room without announcing and knocked on my door at 11 15 at night and cost of breakfast , Location near two tube lines and Hyde park Public areas were beautiful vintage 
8327,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was very small and it was an upgrade I am a tiny person and I felt a little clausterphobic in the room The bathroom was incredibly small I would not recommend this hotel to someone who is on the larger side , The staff was really friendly and they upgraded us to a coach room 
8328,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, sizes of room and toilets , the rooms were not in good shape The 1st room was so small we could just about get 2 suitcases into the room and then there was no floor space for an ironing board We requested a change The next room was better though in a semi basement but the toilet was so small and the wash basin smaller about 14inchX 14inches the tap looked enormous since the basin could not have been any smaller the pictures of the rooms should be made accurate 
8329,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room had no windows which I know the hotel had no choice on but still did feel a bit suffocating Small issue though not a deal breaker And if they could only find a way to fit a mini bar in the room , Awesome location very close to Queensway Tube and Bayswater tube shops restaurants convenience stores Hyde Park Bus Stop Excellent reception and staff Although my room was small which is normal by central London standards it was extremely well appointed Had everything one would need Breakfast was excellent too good spread freshly prepared 
8330,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, All the staff were polite and welcoming and arranged taxis do my destination as required You never felt second best Excellent hotel and staff
8331,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was the smallest room i had ever seen It was a struggle to manage to clamber around the bed and not at all like the advertised photos The was a chair in the room pushed under the table but as the end of the bed was behind the chair it was not possible to pull the chair out to sit on It was then a hinderance makibg it more difficult to get around the other side of the bed , The staff were very helpful and polite 
8332,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Our room was small as was the bathroomBut it was clean and comfortable The location of the hotel is excellent walking distance to Restaurants and shopping Kensington Gardens is right on the doorstep perfect for an early morning run It s an easy walk to many attractions including the Portobello markets The hotel is charming with comfortable lounge areas 
8333,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The rooms were tiny This was a deal breaker I do not recall seeing sizes when I booked but I acknowledge they may have been listed at that time I know they are listed now because I looked it up If we could have pivoted and stayed somewhere else we would have but it was not practical From what I can see all the hotels in this area had similarly but slightly larger rooms The single induced claustrophobia We usually all meet in a room to discuss plans etc That was impossible in this hotel , The hotel was very clean Breakfast and tea were great Service was great at the meals as well Common areas were beautiful Each room had its own temperature control including AC Location was great 
8334,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Location was very close to the Queensway tube easy to find friendly check in and check out Bathroom was very clean and recently refurbished I will look at staying here again as it is ideal for my business trips 
8335,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, They tried to move us to another hotel citing maintenance issues We refused and a room suddenly became available The rooms were not as grand as the reception area , Near to Hyde Park which is what we wanted
8336,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Being double booked and asked to leave being rebooked into someone else s room and receiving no compensation for time lost and stress and inconvenience , Location
8337,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, the shower sprayed water everywhere , good breakfast selection and quality complimentary water and teas were great A wonderful last minute stay in a hotel that felt part of the history of London yet was beautifully up to date in facilities
8338,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms a little small but to be expected for the location and price otherwise fantastic , Staff were friendly and great location especially for the price 
8339,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Noisy both out on the street and in the hotel Double bed was two single beds together , Lovely old building pleasant staff Very handy for Hyde Park Concerts Lancaster Gate Tube Station about 5 mins walk 
8340,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Deluxe twin booked A big deal made on checking in that we were getting upgraded to superior A bit insulting when we saw the tiny room with the twin beds with no gap between them If that was superior I d hate to see deluxe What on earth is standard like , Good location
8341,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing to fault, Staff were amazing and attentive from the moment I arrived at reception desk The guy at reception was checking 3 separate groups in at once so nobody had to wait Got me a room with a bath as I asked for Gave me late check out the next day I have stayed in lots of hotels all over the world for alot more money and the service here was one of the best I have ever experienced 
8342,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Our room it was the smallest room I have ever stayed in it was not suitable for two people or fit for purpose I booked a Superior Double Room it was not a double and definitely not superior I had to lay on the bed if my husband wanted use the bathroom I have stayed in many hotels including in Paris and this is the smallest by far When we arrived at the hotel approx 9 30pm there were people in front of us at the desk who where been called taxis in order for them to be moved to a sister hotel due to maintenance issues which can only be construed as an overbooking issue Also we had to wait for our room to be fixed cleaned as it was not ready when we arrived so late in the day although we did receive a free drink in the bar for our inconvenience For the price we paid it was not value for money , The building history edwardian design in the public areas 
8343,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was very small and quite shabby and tired looking The actual building itself is beautiful but the decor is very tired looking and scruffy in places Our tiny room looked over the back of the hotel and was of rubbish skips that had overflowed onto the path so not very pleasant to look at In view of all this we felt it was very overpriced , Good breakfast A beautiful old building full of character Comfy bed Quiet 
8344,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was on the 7th floor tucked away at the end of a corridor by the staircase therefore quite noisy until late at night The room was the tiniest room that I have ever stayed in and I travel a lot to London and abroad The regular size double bed filled the entire room with hardly any space around it to manoeuvre I literally had to shimmy down the side of the bed to get into it and also in order to reach the bathroom The room was advertised as a superior double but in my experience it was only standard and due to the small capacity and lack of space would be better utilised for single occupancy The photographs within the booking details are misleading , The location was perfect for an event we were attending in Hyde Park The room was clean Helpful staff who responded to my concern about the comfort of the room politely 
8345,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, When I landed in London I received a call from Grande Royale Hyde Park booked via your website They informed me that they had maintenance issues and that they transferred me to another hotel with the same rating After visiting another hotel Paddington Hotel which was more distant from the Hyde park and looked like it should have 2 3 star rating I went back to the Grand Royal and demanded the room Magically the room was available About 30 smaller in size than the one I booked Towels with hair on Sorry its far from 4 star Disaster , Location 
8346,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The only problem i felt was the double room was more like a single room so when i asked 2 be moved they were helpful 2 accomodete us with another room , It was central for 2 get where you wanted 2 be it was nice clean staff were helpful polite 
8347,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, By room could have been a little cleaner There were stains on the walls and on the lampshades , It s in a beautiful location I love the old English feel the lobby has And the staff is very nice 
8348,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room wasn t ready when we arrived fair play we were given complimentary drinks while we waited it s just a bit irritating paying all that money I wouldn t then expect to wait plus my friend is heavily pregnant so that made it more annoying and difficult for her after a long journey , Good location easy enough to get to by tube from Kings Cross and lovely that the history has been preserved Great choice at breakfast I ve stayed twice with different friends and they both agreed it was lovely 
8349,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Hotel was overbooked due to multiple people booking same day on booking com Hotel went above and beyond to accommodate us so all ended well , Great restaurant wonderful atmosphere and excellent location 
8350,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Our stay at The Grand Royale marked the start of our honeymoon we arrived to a bottle of wine chocolates a selection of fruit and a handwritten card in our room The staff were attentive and pleasant and we were allowed a late check out at no extra cost Breakfast was superb with a huge choice of cooked or continental options We loved the building with its extensive wood panelling and beautiful friezes on walls and ceilings the history of the building made for interesting reading too We were delighted with our choice of hotel and will return when we next visit London we highly recommend The Grand Royale 
8351,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Hotel is a little tired in some public areas that need re painting , Very comfortable bed in a double room on the 6th floor so it was nice and quiet Good location within a few hundred yards of Bayswater Road and only four minute walk from Bayswater Tube station 
8352,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Some of the back stairs to the rooms could do with a bit of sprusing up Bar area also needs some touching up , Staff very friendly and helpful hotel rooms and lobby spotlessly clean Rooms are small but perfectly formed with all mod cons 
8353,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Double room was a little cramped and would have preferred a bit more room but we had all the facilities we needed for a short 2 night stay , A really good location close to Hyde Park and Central London Staff were polite attentive extremely friendly and helpful We will definitely stay here again when visiting London Good value 
8354,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Our room was incredibly small The hotel rooms look lovely in the photographs but in reality seem a little tired and run down We paid a very reasonable rate for the room through Booking Com which was reserved several months in advance but we noticed that the general prices closer to the date were hugely inflated at prices that could not be justified for what you actually get Also the communal toilets in basement Not great when group of rowdy young men burst in when wife alone , The location of the hotel as we were visiting Hyde Park The history ambience of the original Edwardian house hotel although not all confirmed Would love to be a fly on wall back in the day Some very beautiful ornate decor on the ground and upper ground floor We wondered about the history as part of write up states you can very much feel the presence of Lillie Langtry especially in the Theatre Bar where she allegedly put on shows A very interesting property 
8355,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We had booked one night in a twin room but were told on arrival that they only had doubles Staff offered a discounted second night as compensation but we were unable to take them up on this so still ended up paying the not insignificant full cost of the room for an uncomfortable night s sleep sharing a bed, Friendly staff
8356,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Tiny room and bathroom so small that the door couldn t open properly due to toilet behind it Lots of noise coming from outside and view of bins and rubbish from room window ,No Positive
8357,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms are very small Could barely move around We weren t in it all that much but make sure you pay attention to the size of the room you are booking , Staff was wonderful Location was perfect 
8358,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Couch pull out bed The mattress was so old it sank to the middle and I had to hang on to the furniture beside the bed to pull myself out Also slept for the week with the bars under the mattress poking me in the back and leg Asked for different mattress but wasn t available Needed to just buy a new mattress and throw that one away The main bed was wonderful but I wasn t the one sleeping there unfortunately , The front desk staff was phenomenal Super courteous wonderfully helpful finding directions arranging transportation giving information The bell hops were so professional too We didn t have to lug another suitcase once we arrived at the hotel Felt very safe and well taken care of except for the horrible pull out bed mattress 
8359,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing really I was very happy with it , The manager of the restaurant was excellent had eyes everywhere The room was small but it was a single room and for central London I was very happy with it really The bathroom was lovely Easy walk to Paddington Station Comfortable hotel 
8360,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, The location and price was great Rooms in London are generally small so make sure you pay attention to which size room you pick If you book the smallest square footage room you will probably be disappointed with the size Don t pre pay breakfast during check in for the first morning if you might be jet lagged It ends at 10 AM and you probably will oversleep 
8361,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We booked as it was stated that they had parking available which they didn t When we got to the property they had no twin rooms despite this being what we booked , The hotel was in a great location
8362,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, My room had an insect problem but that was quickly resolved It s other things such as the drapes hanging off the rod and the dirty wallpaper and carpeting that were concerning The shower sprayed the whole bathroom impossible to contain without a bigger glass panel or shower curtain It is a lovely building but needs some upkeep inside , Service for breakfast was excellent Manuela especially Staff was very responsive and that is becoming rare 
8363,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I paid for a superior room and the room was the size of a small walk in wardrobe The shower didnt have a curtain soo the floor gets completely soaked Their large towels are big enough to dry a young child It was ridiculous, The hotel was very old fashioned which you don t see alot these days it was designed nicely
8364,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was on the small size as well as the en suite Did not see a tip box for the staff as I would have most definitely liked to have given the staff something they were absolutely wonderful which made up for the room being on the small size , the bed was comfy the breakfast had a wide range to suite peoples taste The location could not have been better with bayswater tube station and queensway within easy walking distance Most of all the staff were so kind and friendly nothing was to much trouble for them 
8365,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Good location with easy access to Queensway underground station Although our room had been recently refurbished and comfortable it was referred to as a Club Room but was very small Friendly and helpful staff but the property could do with a major makeover ,No Positive
8366,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bedroom and bathroom where on the small side but we didn t really need any more space as it was only a short stay, Very comfy bed and fantastic breakfast
8367,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Twin room is tiny with very little natural light No hotel parking available , Great Location easy to get to using public transport and round the corner from Hyde Park 
8368,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The size of the bedroom Super small bathroom shower far too small No possibility to open windows for fresh air What happened in case of fire Looks obvious they have been maximising the profit by reduced rooms size , Price location staff
8369,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Small rooms Noisy air con units Little sleep due to noisy neighbouring buildings Room at the back of hotel overlooking the bins, Well presented entrance
8370,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Do not test the fire alarms without informing arriving new guests that are jet lagged and sleeping This was extremely upsetting , The location was convenient to buses and metro Hyde Park and Kennsington Gardens are right there The staff made up for a major inconvenience 
8371,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Towels were small room was a bit on the tight side Provided shampoo and body wash smelled good but left odd feeling on hands , Large bathroom quiet air con it was a heat wave when we travelled free WiFi handy phone to take with us with internet access USB and international adapters provided in convenient location Staff were lovely 
8372,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Tiny room Bathroom very small Shower size the smallest I have every been in Fridge not cold Iron and Ironing Board cheap and barely worked Complimentary water 2 x small bottles not complimentary No notification of such , Good Air conditioning and Comfortable bed 
8373,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Staff friendly very Clean and a walk back in time to style of the communal areas , It was reasonably good lovely old building Albeit the superior room is there standard room so a confusing play with words So it was a squeeze to walk around the bed We didn t have breakfast there at London hotel prices 
8374,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I noticed the lack of a face cloth in the bathroom I guess this is not a British convention , The breakfast buffet was excellent staff attentive The staff overall were friendly and helpful 
8375,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, To be honest I was disgusted with the hotel My friend was too big for bed ad he s 6 1 and the bathroom was a joke Tempted to ask for my money back , To be honest I was disgusted with the hotel My friend was too big for bed ad he s 6 1 and the bathroom was a joke Tempted to ask for my money back 
8376,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The shower cubicle was very slippery and no hand rail , We were upgraded to another hotel as grand Royale was having plumbing problems We were given transport and breakfast for each day of our stay 
8377,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Toilet was too close to wall almost had to sit sideways Shower cubicle was too small I m not large but it was all too close for comfort , The hotel was in great location next to Hyde Park Excellent reception lounge and bar area full of character and even a claim to have been bought for Lily Langtree to perform for her King Immaculately clean Room very comfortable and modern albeit rather small Breakfast was included and was very good served in a beautiful dining room

8379,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Convenient location near two tube station Very close to the city and all main attractions The hotel is situated in a historical building that is well kept I stayed in delux single room for 6 nights The room is small but it has everything you need Wifi is available in the room and is free of charge good value for money 
8380,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The exceptionally small bedrooms A double room can nearly fit two people and two suitcases 2 people cannot walk around the room at the same time , Old world decoration very friendly and helpful staff Good breakfast Good location for central line and Hyde park 
8381,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Loved the afternoon tea Every afternoon a staff would come bring chocolate to the room the Underground was right across the street staff was nice and helpful with suggestions and I slept on a cot because there were 3 of us in a room and the cot was actually very comfy 
8382,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bedrooms a little small, I travelled with my wife On arrival we were not given the room that we had booked First night was not very comfortable but the management were very apologetic and very helpful thereafter 
8383,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Tony rooms , Location is very good near 2 tube stops however rooms are super small Tiny in fact and I was a single traveller in a normal room and have no idea how 2 people could fit 
8384,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, On this occasion I had a decent sized quiet room on the top floor The public rooms are very atmospheric with dark panelling stained glass and comfortable chairs 
8385,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The toilet flush did not work properly The sink could not be reached as it was so small Cold tap could not be opened without excessive force, Price per square meter foot has been in top three of places I have stayed Room was 1 8m by 2 9m plus bathroom of the 1 2x1 8 Total surface 8M 
8386,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Very but I mean very small rooms Tiny bathrooms In my room the window was stuck and not open even a little, Great breakfast good staff especially Razavan at reception Magnificant Edwaridian common rooms and loby 
8387,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Noisy neighbours and banging doors but the staff handled the problem beautifully once I d rung through to reception and also the Manager spotted the notes when I was checking out and asked if the problem had been dealt with , The building is beautiful with so many wonderful period features the staff friendly and efficient and once the tubes had closed for the night it was wonderfully quiet on the lower ground floor Super convenient for Queensway tube station too I d definitely go back

8391,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Small bathroom but was enough for the stay , Hotel in great location for public transport and shopping Staff was very friendly Great standard bed was very comfortable and the room was clean 
8392,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Poor room facilities Says on their website you have an iron in the room but you have to request it Rooms are TINY For a 4 star to not have any room service is poor Has a fridge which was empty No guest service book had to guess how to even call reception I travel a lot for work and would not go to this hotel again , Comfortable bed

8395,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The first room allocated was a lower ground room which was dark and very small We relocated to room 508 which was the same size as the first ie very small We hardly had room to move around in what was advertised as a super delux room Both rooms were smaller than you get in a modern budget hotel at twice the cost Room 508 did not have a ventilation system in the toilet this was corrected after I mentioned it Also the complete sink tap system had come away from the wall I guess it did work , Beds comfy
8396,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Wifi is too bad I was at room 602 club room most of the time I could not go through This is quite important for me traveling for business otherwise I have to use my local carrier which cost me a lot as it is international , The location is perfect friendly staff and good value for money 
8397,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, There was nothing to dislike , What an absolutely lovely time we had at the Grand Royale From the upgraded room to the fabulous breakfast and very attentive staff Nothing was too much trouble I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone Faded Victorian maybe but absolutely beautiful Thanks to all who made us so welcome 
8398,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, It is obviously not the hotel s fault but there are major building works adjoining and opposite which could be going on for some time Some of the rooms are small and a bit claustrophobic , Excellent location Hyde Park just across the road restaurants of Queensway round the corner The lounges and bars are very atmospheric in a Jacobean sort of way panelled and dark but very relaxing The staff are pleasant and generally helpful The price is reasonable given the location 
8399,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, For a superior 4 star room it was small with a microscopic en suite Acceptable but disappointing For the price breakfast should have been included Better value breakfast was found close by Try the Italian gardens in Hyde Park , Location was good and room was clean and comfortable Staff polite and welcoming 
8400,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The rooms were very small just a bed and enough room to walk around it Good thing we didn t need to spend a lot of time inside our hotel rooms other than to sleep , The location was wonderful Near public transportation as well as within walking distance to several important tourist sites The public spaces inside the building registration lobby etc were absolutely fabulous just as beautiful as the pictures on their website That s why I picked this hotel In my price range ALL the hotel rooms in London were extremely small but the Grand Royale London Hyde Park had the gorgeous common areas that set it apart from the rest The rooms were clean the staff very nice and the breakfast was delicious 
8401,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The only down side was the room size It was certainly adequate for one person travelling light and staying for one night For two people staying two nights there was very little storage and hanging space for clothes It was clean and it was comfortable , The hotel was conveniently close to Hyde Park where we liked to walk It was close to two tube stations bus route and taxi services A convenience store was close by The hotel is a lovely old London town house style and the reception hall and public areas I would describe as Baronial The staff were attentive and polite and the lady on duty at reception was particularly thoughtful and kindly Our room was very clean and tidy though rather small for two people that said we were quite comfortable 
8402,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, My sister will soon be having hip surgery and getting up the steps to enter the hotel was difficult for her as there was no handicapped access , Staff was very friendly and helpful and responded quickly to requests and questions The English breakfast was well stocked and a good value for the cost The history behind the hotel was interesting The lobby library and theater bar were beautifully decorated and took us back in time 
8403,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, i need to cancel my last day booking due to schedule change but was rejected by booking com and hotel disappointed with the poor flexibility , good location and average price breakfast is nice 
8404,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms very small Bathroom tiny but very clean and modern Hotel is very old and needs new carpets Wonderful wood decor but needs refinished It could be a beauty I probably would not go back , Park across street Bus and Tube very close The hotel has a nice welcoming fruit basket with chocolates and wine Coffee and tea supplied 
8405,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The size of the room could be greater but our criticism on this point is minor You could arrange for a common pot for tips The staff was excellent but we were told that one only pays tips to a given person for services rendered e g porter I wanted my tip to be placed for the benefit of all the staff , The room was tastefully decorated and well appointed The facilities such as lighting and bathroom were excellent However it was slightly too small
8406,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was so tiny we could hardly believe it even after an upgrade to a bigger room It was smaller than our bedroom at home The view from our room overlooked a backstreet loading bay for a nearby restaurant takeaway which instantly took the edge off having a room upgrade I couldn t help thinking what view we would have had from the smaller room The pictures online of the reception lounge area are bang on it looks lovely however the rooms are nowhere near what is shown The advertised rooms must cost an absolute fortune I ve spent over 100 less per night in London for bigger rooms better views and the same facilities The overall experience nowhere near justifies the cost , As it was my girlfriend s 30th birthday the reception staff very kindly gave us a free room upgrade to a shoebox sized room I can only assume our original room was the size of a matchbox A plus point was the free to use smart phone in the room although we didn t use it for fear of the cost involved if it was lost broken stolen while we were out and about 
8407,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, All good, We stayed at the only magnificent suite in the hotel We loved the overdone heritage feel and big space both in the suite and bathroom We were 3 adults and one toddler in this suite Breakfast was great as well and the location right next to Hyde park and Kensington gardens is perfect for kids Mommies can go shopping on the Westbourne grove 
8408,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, 1 Close from the tube station but a little bit hard to find out the location surrounding by houses 2 Window cannot be opened so hot , 1 Welcome service for honeymoon was so touched 2 Luxurious atmosphere at reception area 3 Close from the tube station 
8409,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms on floor 8 a little small but adequate , A lovely Victorian hotel with original features and very friendly staff Very clean did the business for a short stay in London Excellent nights sleep 
8410,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We had two rooms and we would have preferred they be on the same floor However this was a last minute reservation and it was not possible This was completely understandable , The entire staff was exceptional location ideal and rooms comfortable The staff went above and beyond to provide us with every comfort and kindness during our stay In particular Razvon at the front desk was top notch in every way imaginable The accommodations were excellent but Razvon s warm hospitality took the experience to the next level I highly recommend this beautiful historic and gracious hotel

8412,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I feel the breakfast should be included in the room rate its an expensive hotel to start with , The ambiance of the hotel was fantastic the breakfast was superb
8413,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We had a Superior Queen room and to say it was a tight fit for two people would be an understatement The room was so small you could not actually turn around on one side of the bed I have a bruise on my arm from whacking it a few times on the handle of the closet as it was so narrow going into the bathroom and out the door , The location and price were great the staff was really friendly and helpful and the hotel is spotless 
8414,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The hotel was a total disgrace in all aspects my bag in the luggage cart was stolen right under their nose when I was checking in What s more disappointing is the hotel s response regarding the incident I had little to no help from them even after complaining about their poor service The hotel only helped call a cab but then abandoned us at a police station far away around midnight Before leaving the hotel told us that they will provide roundtrip service Even after requesting for pickup from hotel twice no one came to get us After the incident no employees or mangers reached out to us as if nothing occurred We had to insist managers to meet us when they did they were neither condolence with our loss nor try to help us in anyway They were utterly rude and did nothing but wasted our precious vacation time As guests of the hotel the hotel has responsibility to ensure our safety including our belongings Even if hotel can t replace my stuff at least could offer help in any way rather than being immature and heartless ,No Positive
8415,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Not sure about shower screen it wasn t big enough to stop the floor from getting wet, Great location and the staff were excellent Nothing was too much trouble and they were really friendly and helpful
8416,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We booked a twin room only to arrive and find out that there were no twin rooms available At the end the receptionist could find a room in a sister Hotel nearby which apparently was bigger than the one we booked Thus they wanted us to move again the next day which we refused since we had unpacked everything We booked a Club room with club Lounge Access from booking com However we found out that the Club Lounge was open to the guest only upon availibility At least one of the days the Lounge was busy all day and not on use for the guests ,No Positive

8432,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms were smaller than expected and from about 6am there was banging coming from above my room I was told this was the restaurant so I cannot recommend this hotel They did offer a 20 refund but this didn t make up for the unwanted alarm call of banging chairs ,No Positive

8438,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Maybe not understanding why booking breakfast at Reception attracted a 3 discount Why make paying guests jump through a hoop Fair enough for non guest But the hotel has already collected 130 So not a customer friendly policy does the hotel need the 3 difference that much , Staff friendly
8439,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, It was located further out than we expected Had to take taxis to get to places Not a lot of restaurants to chose from And did not like the idea of our room in THE BASEMENT , staff was helpful Breakfast at hotel is nice Hotel is old and we liked that

8458,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Just by chance I hit upon a hotel with a history It appears to be a small hotel with an amazing story The lower floors have wonderful wood panelling and scultured wood over the doors and stained glass leaded windows The breakfast rooms have beautiful moulded ceilings however my single bedroom was ultra modern Apparently Edward 7th bought this house for his mistress Lilly Langtry and had a small theatre and bar installed which are very ornate and intimate The hotel is in an excellent position being near Queensway Tube Station on the Bayswater Road and right opposite Kensington Gardens and about 6 minutes walk from the Palace It took me 45 minutes to walk through the Gardens and across Hyde Park passing the Serpentine and Rotten Row to reach Marble Arch 
8459,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, even though there was a minor inconvenience on our arrival the staff went above and beyond in trying to accommodate us Compliments to all staff they were courteous always willing to help with a smile on their faces And Alston at the front desk deserves a thumbs up for his professional treatment and kindness I will recommend this hotel to family and friends I felt like I was in old London which was very special Thanks to all the staff

8471,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was one of the tiniest I ve ever seen There was mold on the bathroom ceiling and you can hear noise from the hallways and nearby rooms On one occasion our fresh towels smelled like feet , The lobby is very nice and the proximity to both the Queensway and Bayswater tube stations cannot be beat

8553,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Unfortunately there was roadworks just outside our window so we were woken up rather early Saturday morning by construction machines but once we shut the window we couldn t hear them Room was also on the small side it was more cosy as opposed to spacious and luxury , Great location superbly helpful staff they provide a computer and printer so I was able to print off my boarding passes easily Room was very clean and bed comfortable didn t dine at the hotel but the afternoon tea looked amazing will try it next time Just opposite Hyde park and next to the tube station however we walked as weather was nice and it only took us 35 minutes to walk to Victoria Apollo theatre to watch the show I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be central but also in a nice and peaceful location Saturday morning walking through Hyde park was picturesque Also staff offer city maps and guides or any personal recommendations for those who don t know London very well The foyer is beautiful very exquisite and grand In my opinion a very good value for money hotel would ve paid twice that I paid for our stay was a great place to show my partner what London has to offer

8615,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms are tiny i think you should be v clear on that Charging for a bottle of water on our second and third night is not good as it cost us one thousand euro to stay there the least i would expect is fresh water every day , Bed was v comfortable staff v helpful 
8616,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The rooms were very small advertised as a superior double room but it s more like an average bedroom And for the amount paid you would definitely expect a little more the room was so cramped and I felt as though the bed was too big for the room there wasn t enough space to pull the stool out from the vanity mirror draws as the bed was in the way and there was only one side upon could access the bed from Honestly I was very disappointed with this hotel and probably won t be returning to London for a short stay again and if the other hotels are like this I definitely won t it s awful that hotels can charge that much for a room and it be that small Not sure if I may have looked wrong however the photos on the website showed a 4 poster bed which when I purchased the superior double room I expected to get and if what I got was a superior double room I would like to see how big a suite is Another point would be the view I wasn t expecting a lot from the view because obviously it s not up high it s you average house size however The view was very poor however it s understandable that they can t change this but again for the money you pay you would expect a little better One rude female member of staff at reception See first paragraph you don t get what you pay for at this hotel not sure if this is the case throughout London however it is here I am almost 100 sure that I booked the hotel room and I received free breakfast for both myself and my partner however we did not receive one and the female member of staff I previously mentioned was quite rude about it and told me that we had to pay 15 each if we wanted it also of your thinking of site seeing I wouldn t recommend this hotel as it s quite far from the main attractions like the London eye or Houses of Parliament and the Thames but there is a tube station round the corner which was helpful , The bathroom was very nice and well kept The male staff were very helpful at front desk at night and so were the general staff that helped carry your luggage they were very kind and helpful however there was a down side to the staff as they were let down by one female member of staff who I thought was quite rude in her mannerisms and the way she spoke and definitely needs to either try and enjoy her job or find a new one honestly working can be crap and boring but get over it we all have to work However not to discourage the other female receptionist who checked us out as she was very helpful and friendly 
8617,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The photos are enhanced on the Internet as in reality the hotel is very very dark inside and if I m honest a bit dreary From outside it looks really poor and needs a paint and clean of Windows It needs sensitively being freshened up throughout The decor is not consistent so a bit hit and miss Bedrooms modern but not comfy beds or pillows sadly Perhaps we had the smaller type room and should have upgraded We had very little space in ours that a glass fell from the bedside table and smashed as you could not move freely I wouldnt stay again , Location was very good as we could walk from Paddington station with our overnight bag The staff are very good and friendly and efficient Nothing too much trouble Did not eat there so can t comment on this sorry Tea and coffee and extras in the room were very good Nice big tv and enough towels provided Controllable heat for room was good too 
8618,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Unfortunately the hotel had boiler problems and we were move to another in their group The Grand Park Paddington 1 2 Devonshire Place Which was not where we wanted to be ,No Positive
8619,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was very very small so a couple with 2 medium suitcases is not very easy to move around in the room The breakfast is a basic typical hotel breakfast I would expect a little a bit more than that , The hotel is in a fantastic location Both by Tube bus as well as walking from the heart of the city The room was clean and the stuff friendly The best thing about this hotel is that it is quite and in a fantastic location Value for money for sure 
8620,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was a club double but a little small The issue with the room was that the hotel had no hot water on the morning of our departure so I endured a cold shower and my daughter did not have one , Service and location both excellent Hotel was a beautiful building we did not eat at hotel but bar and dining room looked very inviting We had an issue with the room and it was not possible to resolve it in time but we were offered and accepted a complimentary taxi to our train station 
8621,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, club rooms slightly small especially shower toilet smaller than expected, very friendly staff liked the premises and location very clean enjoyed the quaint bar
8622,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing , The rooms are compact which is not unusual for London They were however well kept clean and modern with everything you need It s perfectly placed for exploring London s tourist attractions 
8623,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, One thing we found strange is that you had to reserve the time you will go to take the breakfast from the day before or you might not find a table and will have to wait , 2 minutes walk from Kensignton park and Hyde park About 40 minutes walk from the main shops at Oxford street Staff all very friendly Different restaurants and shops in the street behind the hotel 
8624,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Hotel is dated Hallways are marred and marked with luggage collisions Construction in progress on the entrance side of the building , Room was neat and clean Beds were comfortable TV with lots of channels Tea with percolator provided and some snacks BEST is the location Lots of different type of restaurants close by Favorite for Breakfast was La Roma a small boutique Restaurant located just around the corner GREAT Breakfast and Lunch VERY easy access to UnderGround 
8625,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bedrooms very small but ok Also when renovations complete I would think the hotel will be even better , Fantastic location beautiful hotel breakfast excellent 
8626,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was tiny Designation of double superior suggests at least adequate size but it was easily the smallest we have ever stayed in Little more than 12 inches either side of the bed and not being able to open the wardrobe door is ridiculous , 4G loan phone provided with the room was really useful 
8627,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Had amended booking but they didn t have the amendment had to wait for reservations to confirm even though I had proof restaurant far too small had sittings for breakfast so had to book time but they still couldn t accommodate us at the time and there was no room to pass tables Walls thin could hear all toilets flushing and showers running from above below and either side , lovely hotel great to look out on to hyde park and walk through to the centre of London staff are polite but don t have authority to rectify things just explain politely that is policy
8628,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The layout of the bedroom through the door and immediately down five steps to the bed not good if ur unsteady on your feet Also the floor boards in our room and the one above squeaked quite badly , The location was ideal being very close to a tube station Also being close to Hyde park if you like walking The staff were friendly and helpful We had the chocolate and prosecco afternoon tea which was very tasty 
8629,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, They were renovating at Xmas time scaffolding out front and fireplaces not being used and lounges pushed together We had booked many months beforehand and were not advised of this Should have been offered discount and given opportunity of going elsewhere Also toilet hard to use as it was too close to basin and shower I was very disappointed, The old England style of the hotel
8630,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I was transferred from the original hotel I booked They couldn t provide a twin bed and I asked for a room with windows instead I was given a basement room They complementary phone didn t work , Good location
8631,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Dont go here if you like to spend time on your room go here if you sleep in the hotel and you re out the whole day , A lot on walking distance if you re a walker otherwise two underground stations within 2 minutes walk 
8632,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing in particular Room a little on the cool side but not uncomfortably so Some of the decorations a little on the tired side but this is an old traditional property Would recommend and have no hesitation in staying again , Quirky hotel full of character from the past Loved the bar especially the memories of Lily Langtree Friendly and helpful staff Great location opposite Hyde Park and a couple of minutes from nearest tube station 
8633,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Great location Close to two tube stations Tasty and fresh breakfast Good service Only the bathroom and shower was too small to feel super comfortable Other than that Perfect Hotel for a stay in London
8634,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, THE OVERALL LOOK OF THE HOTEL WAS A BIT NEGLECTED THE PICTURE ON THE WEB DID NOT REFLECT THE IMAGE THE STAFF TRIED TO HELP BUT SOME FEEL SHORT WHERE AS SOME WENT BEYOND SAY WHAT YOU MEAN DO AS YOU SAY , THE ROOM WAS OKAY THE STAFF WAS HELPFUL THE FRONT DESK WAS OKAY
8635,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Ordered a taxi from reception and they they did not know where they were going abd had not hear of the Ritz Do not order Uber cabs for guests , Friendly man on reception
8636,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The reception staff mundane lethargic not welcoming they need customer service skills they are the only thing that i found wrong with this hotel With the exception of an Asian male receptionist who smiled welcomed people , The location Extremely cheap in comparison for the level of comfort location
8637,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room is rather cosy but perfect for a short stay comfortable and reasonably priced, Good location very close to Hyde Park underground cafes and shops 
8638,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, What they call a double bed could even fit 2 27 year old adults in Dent in middle of matress Fire alarm went off Both rooms we had were so cold and drafty The whole room was so small when going to the toilet you could hardly sit down The hotel it s self is lovely but the rooms are far to small and beds for what we paid I have never ever left a review but feel in this instance it is necessary ,No Positive
8639,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was not upto standard carpets stained and the walls room door would not lock radiator was not working and lose We only got told the radiator was not working till after we complained as well as the door told to put the chain on we raised our concerns health and safety as the radiator could come off to be told its acceptable thermostat not working set on one temperature Hairs all over the bed that was not mine partners I asked to change rooms which they did at no extra cost the new room was alot better but still Hairs on the bed So had to shake it off Went out for a meal and heard a conversation with another guest with the house keeper saying they had no room service that day it did not give us a good impression of the hotel Will not be going back to this hotel , Free WIFI and honest when I miss laid my watch when I moved from our hotel room The hotel moved me partner with no problems into another room Staff was polite and friendly on check in and out 
8640,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I didn t like not knowing about scaffolding and non working fireplaces Also the printer was out of ink the entire time we were there and impeded our printing tickets etc , Location staff was very nice and helpful bar was nice but wished they had a restaurant beyond breakfast
8641,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was very small thi s made it difficult to walk around the bed without catching your leg on the bedroom furniture, Staff were very good breakfast good the hotel environment was excellent and once the refurbishment is complete it will be Evan better
8642,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, There was mould around the bath The bath wasn t clean there was someone else s hair all around it, The breakfast was amazing and the bed was very comfortable The staff was very polite Getting to the hotel was very easy 
8643,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, They are renovating also a good thing ofcourse But the staff did everything to please us , Location at the parc Staff and bell boys are really friendly Nice old typical English building 
8644,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room Size We were upgraded to Club Room which was one of the larger room sizes This room was still very small incl the bathroom Exercise care when selecting room size , Good location for Hyde Park and Central Line tube station to West End less than 5 mins walk 
8645,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms are very tight especially the front door couldn t swing open bigger and was a step down from the corridor floor some more Difficult to pull my luggage in , Staff was accommodating esp when I had super late check in without informing them beforehand Beautiful lobby and dining hall 
8646,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, sink in bathroom too small and plug let the water out because it didn t fit properly Bathroom could have been a bit bigger , The old fashioned interior and the helpfulness of the staff
8647,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, No need to change towels daily but no way of saying please don t Having fair trade branded tea coffee sugar in room would be a great plus for me , Warm comfortable room Very polite and helpful staff Near tube bus QUIET 
8648,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, It was quite a small room clean and quiet but with not a lot of space Overnight it was very cold We asked for and received an extra blanket and a heater on the second night but shouldn t have needed to ask for it ,No Positive
8649,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The London weather , The staff were exceptionally attentive and genuinly friendly looking after us in a fantastic way The hotel is very centrally locatef to all the main attractions having 2 tube stations witjin 4 min walking distance There are plenty of shops and tasty restaurants all around the hotel 
8650,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was tiny It was so disappointing considering I booked a superior room As soon as you opened the door there was 6 steps leading up to the room There is approx A foot and a half distance between the edge end of the bed and the steps Lots of renovations going on the front and inside the hotel , Location was good right around the corner to two different tube stations about 2 3 minutes walk with access to the central district and circle lines Across the road from Hyde park Kensington gardens Staff were friendly and helpful Bed was comfortable and good bathroom facilities 
8651,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, It was exquisite beautiful Room was a little small and shower room tiny I think you might have problems with it if you re any bigger than a size 18 Overall though fabulous location for birthday celebrations 
8652,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was small but manageable we weren t visiting to spend time in a hotel room so it wasn t much of a drawback , Beautiful hotel with great late 19th century decor Helpful staff Recently renovated comfortable bed roomy bathroom Great location Tube stop just a block away Nearby commercial street with plenty of restaurants
8653,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room we were in was small compared to other Hotels we have stayed in Also mentioned to reception as I left fingerprint marks were on the bathroom door and the door jamb maybe needed wiping down as part of the room cleaning process , Bed comfortable only used the room no other facilities Location good bus nearby straight to Oxford Street and elsewhere 
8654,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The hotel rooms are quite small They were clean but in need of decoration The entrance foyer and dining rooms are tired and somewhat dated and the breakfast while okay is expensive if not included in your rate We didn t like the fact that upon arrival we were told we couldn t have the rooms we booked and they were on 2 different floors We booked these rooms over 2 months in advance We were given a complimentary breakfast in compensation but our stay was spoiled by not having the rooms we requested meaning my daughters had to share a double bed I would not rate this hotel as a 4 star it s a 3 in my opinion ,No Positive
8655,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Felt very deceived by this hotel booked a room at the grand royal to be contacted to be told we would have to move hotel we were being moved away from the original location that we booked the hotel did provide a taxi to take us to the new hotel but the room in this hotel grand Paddington court was a lot smaller and very cramped I would not of paid the price we did for the room if I had seen it before hand I feel this hotel is intentionally deceiving customers by allowing them to book the grand royal knowing that they will be moved on arrival would not recommend at all Bathroom was ridiculously small and the room was not suitable for a family of 3 Would never use this chain of hotels again, Hotel was clean and complementary breakfast was given due to the inconvenience of having to move hotel
8656,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bed was too small and the property was loud This was the only property I used a debit card in and on return to the US someone in the UK area cloned my card and used it to withdraw cash Not recommended ,No Positive
8657,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, View from room was of a wall wasn t made aware of construction of building and change of room before arrival which was disappointing, Bar area is excellent barman looked lonely though hire him a friend staff on desk very helpful
8658,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Lady rang asked if we wanted room cleaned we said yes but she never cleaned that s ok we asked at reception they said she must have picked me up wrong but yes means yes at the end of the day so we said just leave clean towels for morning but they didn t arrive unhappy about that , Very close to subway friendly staff
8659,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was tiny really small it barely fitted the bed in it really The window was not very secure or soundproof heatproof was old and breezy But my main gripe is that on arriving I was told I have to provide a credit card I didn t have the same card on me as I booked with so embarrassingly had to use my partners however despite the hotel being paid for in full they then charged my partners card without telling us for the full amount When I got home I noticed that I had been charged twice and I phoned them up which took over an hour of being kept waiting on hold to be then told that yes there is a mistake and it will take 6 days for the money to be returned to my account It would have been a nice stay but it was marred by these issues , The bath was lovely great having a decent bath with central tap The room was clean and the hotel was in a good location 
8660,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Very basic and ungenerous place without feeling Having a drink in the bar and reading newspaper Staff member dimmed lighting at 11 35 pm Really rude Towels grey instead of white Bedding low quality You just feel like a package being pushed through a system on the cheap , Location
8661,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Shower involved high step up and over which was cumbersome for this older traveler , Extremely friendly knowledgeable and helpful staff from restaurant recommendations to booking cabs a big plus 
8662,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was absolutely tiny the smallest I ve ever stayed in My boyfriend is 6 3 and they put us in a room in under the eaves The night staff and staff who checked us out seemed so disinterested MTV was playing in the lobby which did not suit the decor or 4 star status We were also not informed of the renovation works being done The whole facade is covered in scaffolding and the fireplaces in the foyer are covered over with big sheets of a plastic and one is completely blocked off with sofas The building work outside woke us up at about 8 30am this may have been acceptable if we had been warned prior to our stay or even when we checked in but it was not mentioned at all and this is really good enough Our stay was not that of a four star hotel , We liked the cleanliness of the room and Valeria who checked us in 
8663,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Scaffolding outside the building due to renovations and fires in reception were not lit , Beautiful hotel clean tidy Breakfast although extra was outstanding Complimentary extras were a lovely touch 
8664,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, we weren t advised of the renovations taking place at the time of booking the facade was covered by scaffolding and sheets which made the reception and rooms dark The rooms are very small and claustrophobic the rooms we were upgraded to on 2nd floor had flimsy paper blinds that failed to open and those that did provided an unpleasant view of the backyard of neighbouring flats and bins However the rooms we moved to in the basement 003 and 004 were much more spacious , All the staff were fantastic courteous polite and extremely helpful They offered us complimentary breakfast and upgraded us to Club rooms then upgraded us again to larger rooms They went out of their way to ensure we had a pleasant stay for mum s 70th birthday The building is beautiful and full of character The location is great A stones throw from Kensington Gardens Palace and Hyde Park 
8665,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, When we arrive the hotel we 3 rooms for 7 nights were asked to move to stay at another hotel because water warmer in our bathrooms don t work Without prior notice and without any other option even the booking has been done about 1 2 months in advance we were very disappointed It was unprofessional and unacceptable even the new hotel was not bad but we were inconvenience with its location far from tube station , None 
8666,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, No tea or coffee replaced on our second day but that was soon rectified by the front of house staff, The Hotel staff made our stay very very good My Wife I were celebrating my 65th Birthday The Hotel gave us chocolates and wine to help us celebrate A very nice touch Thank you all
8667,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We were first shown Room 624 which was so small It should only be listed as a single CERTAINLY not as a double But we asked to be moved and they showed us a couple of rooms and one was much better So I cannot fault the service The bathrooms are fabulous best I have ever seen However the pictures on the web site give a very different impression of what the hotel is actually like Very clever photography gives a very false idea of the size of the main areas The bar and lounge areas are tiny and not big enough to accommodate the amount of people that could potentially be staying there We came back in at around 10 30 pm and there was only one space left for us to sit at in the bar area Others came in later and had to stand Unfortunately for us the hotel is being refurbished at the moment so wasn t looking at its best with scaffolding covering the whole building and many features inside were covered up with settees and flower stands removed Which is a shame as it is a beautiful building All in all a nice stay but not a great one , Room was very acceptable with nice touches
8668,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Although the breakfast was lovely due to the size we were asked to state a time for which we wanted to take it This was a little difficult but it didn t affect our stay we would use the hotel again , The Staff were extremely polite and helpful the single rooms although small were very well equipped modern and clean 
8669,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I had the best experience ever Thank you , I was standing near Bond Street Station by the traffic lights contemplating whether to travel back home to Luton or stay a night as I only had to travel back the next day for training The booking was easy and within half hour of me booking I was in my room It was the best process ever for me that day I was very comfortable the staff were great because they interacted with me and noticed that I had stayed there before with that I was given an upgrade as you could imagine in my head bonus my day is getting better It s a great location for leisure of business 
8670,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Small rooms Confusion at my check in could not arrange me a room due to maintenance problems Offered me to stay at a hotel nearby After 30 mins they manage to sort me a room at their hotel , Excellent Location Clean 
8671,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The only issue was that the duvet was too light and too small for a double bed So we had to keep the heating quite high to compensate The bathroom was small but had a bath The room was clean when we checked in but the quality of housekeeping in the subsequent days was not the best They never cleaned the spot of toothpaste that fell on the sink counter The check in process was a pain We arrived at 1 30 so 30 minutes early than the check in time so the room was not ready That was ok and we decided to wait in the hall No one ever came to tell us the room was ready and after 45 minutes I had to enquire and the person at the check in desk did not know and had to go and ask someone else When we finally got the key 5 minutes later we had to wait another 5 minutes to get our luggage which they insisted to put away instead of leaving it with us in the hall Overall the experience was ok and the price quality good for London , The hotel is located 2 minutes away from 2 underground stations so it s very convenient It s perfect for a stroll in Hyde Park as well as you just need to cross the road The hotel hall is very beautiful the building is a period building and the hall and staircase seem to belong in an old period movie We had a club room and it was quite small It had a nice alcove where the wardrobe and desk were but the bed area was quite narrow The bed was small but very comfortable 
8672,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Small room very unkept in the decorating side pealing paint and at the back of the hotel so very noisy, The staff are amazing very attentive and very knowledgable
8673,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The fact that the room we had booked was out of service and we were sent to a smaller Grand Royale hotel , The breakfast that we had to make up for being sent somewhere else
8674,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room very old wallpaper coming off wall and covered in marks carpet coming away from wall and where joined together Bed very hard and uncomfortable bathroom very small but has been updated Terrible smell coming into room through air con vent we phoned reception who said they knew about it and were trying to fix it but we never heard anything disappointing This hotel is not for us , Great location to Hyde park and tube stations Beautiful reception areas and staff welcoming Shower was great and large wardrobe space 
8675,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Wouldn t stay here again after all the trouble we had got to the grande royal hotel about half 10 at night in which they said to us oh did u not get a phone call because aparently half of the rooms didn t have hot water in which they offered us a drink and taxi to a sister hotel On arrival here the hotel was no where near as nice and we felt we had been fobbed off a little bit totallly dissapointed we went to our room which was nice and comfortable the only problem was after the first night we wanted room service in bed for our second morning and to watch tv turns out this hotel couldn t even provide us with the basics as the wifi had gone off all the phones had been cut off and the TVs were shut down with no signal on the screen Totally dissapointed I made sure staff where aware on our last morning I took it upon myself when I got to the sister hotel to trip advisor the grand royal as my partner had booked it as a surprise for part of my Christmas present on reviewing these it seamed the hotel since September had been selling the same scam story about hot water issues and plumbing Avoid , Breakfast was nice
8676,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Booked in October for a better deal and found that on the night of staying in January it was around 20 cheaper Staff unhelpful when informed basically couldnt care less Rooms were far too small as was the bathroom which had rusty nuts on light fittings and hairs on cups and in bathroom Back of bathroom door was very dirty Very disappointed so went elsewhere for breakfast Definitely won t be staying again in this very tired hotel , Location
8677,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, see above window looking out on the rough side , Room was very clean comfortable although a little on the small side The only negative would be that the outside was off putting with scaffolding Close to all the shops and travel stations Would stay again 
8678,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, There was no fridge within the room we stayed in and the room was quite small Also we found the breakfast room way to small we felt we were sitting on top of each other whilst eating our breakfast temperature was far too hot , The location of the hotel was just right for us 
8679,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Building work under way but was not informed when we booked For food only breakfast and snacks no lunch or dinner in the restaurant Floor boards in room all loose and very noisey and shower screen to small so all water went on the floor , location and the staff are very good Breakfast ok
8680,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Initially we stayed in room 235 We couldn t sleep all night due to the extremely loud noise from the pipes It seems that there is a problem with certain rooms this noise However to credit the hotel when I complained the next morning we were moved to another room which was perfect , Excellent central location very professional courteous staff breakfast buffet was great 
8681,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was tiny and not enough storage for 2 suitcases and clothes in wardrobe more like a single room with a bed for a double room Reception was ALWAYS busy so always a que building works affected aesthetic and breakfast room use yet but price still the same snacks limited etc in bar and served in packets not expected for star rating , Its proximity to central line was exceptional
8682,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was not cleaned properly The tables were soiled and food on the floor after the room was cleaned Not very thorough , The bed comfy and staff pleasant and friendly We were upgraded to a bigger room for free 
8683,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The attitude of the staff during the check in The assumption that I wanted two single beds even though I booked a double room How the attitude of the staff changed when they found out we were a gay couple So called technical problem with the room I wouldn t recommend staying here ,No Positive
8684,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Even though Im a genius and booking com said no deposit would be taken and no prepayment was required the hotel still took out a deposit from my credit card prior to arriving , As this is our honeymoon and we had advised when we booked we were pleasantly surprised to have a gift basket of fruit and a box of chocolates on the bed when we arived
8685,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room not very big limited space between bed and wall Small wardrobe Front of the building covered because of repair, Great breakfast Excellent location Nice building Free smartphone with internet available which is super convenient for foreigner Great bathroom
8686,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Probably the smallest double I have ever stayed in If this was a superior double I would hate to see a standard room I couldn t use the safe as there wasn t enough room to open it , Location was good
8687,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We arrived at 2 15 and our room was still not ready so we waited in the bar for 40 minutes until our room was ready which delayed what we were doing that day by over an hour ,No Positive
8688,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, The location is good Near hyde park and Quinsway and Bayswater metro stations The hotel is good but could have been better You can find a lot of restaurants and coffee shops around within 5 min walk 
8689,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was super small Very very loud you could hear everything outside the hotel and inside Very uncomfortable bed , Decent location but not for us as we thought we would be closer to winter wonderland 
8690,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, When we arrived they told as that they didn t have any room available and they asked as if we wanted to stay in another hotel they had We said no we had booked this room 2 months ago At the end they found a room available in the basement with no window etc we didn t accept and then by miracle they found one available on the 6th floor The rooms are very small, The hotel was near the metro Renovated bathroom Very clean Coffee machine in the room Comfortable bed
8691,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms were too warm at times The bedding only included a duvet and no top sheet Shower was extremely small with very low water pressure , Close to shops and 2 tube stations
8692,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The first room the gave which it was on the 6th floor its was like a grave and not even a room it was really shocking then they moved me to the basement which it was a bit better room it was no 016 but the 1st room I didn t recall what number was it , The rooms are very very small so I can t eve walk in the room
8693,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bathroom was tiny , The d cor was good staff were friendly and the room was comfortable The stay consisted of myself and a friend just for one night We didn t have breakfast at the hotel so I wouldn t be able to comment on the food quality The hotel was perfectly located to get to Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park A short cab ride or 35 minute walk 
8694,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was so small for 2 people We had to take turns putting our suitcase on the bed to get things out and hanging our coats on the one chair made it so tight getting to and from the bathroom Our room had a horrible smell of damp which was very unappealing unable to get any fresh air in the room so it was very uncomfortable , The property was beautiful we stayed right before Christmas and it was just so cosy warm and beautiful inside Really close to the tube so very convinient 
8695,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I don t see how any improvements could be made to the quality of the room cleaning services and position of the hotel I would definitely return , The room was tastefully furnished and very quiet I particularly appreciated the deep pile carpets and the individually controlled central heating in my room during the cold Christmas period The windows were well insulated too not something to be taken for granted in England With Kensington Gardens literally 1 minute s walk away it was lovely to unwind after a busy day sightseeing with a walk in the park 
8696,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Really straggled with the pushchair as there s no disabled access ramp at the entrance and our room was at the ground floor so we had to lift it again , Location is excellent
8697,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Surly unhelpful staff and no room available Reception staff economical with the truth regarding reason for unavailability Frankly told lies most unhelpful Would never go near the place again,No Positive
8698,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The hotel was clean our room was small for a club room and it was on the lower ground so no view Had I been Informed about the scaffolding and work being done in the main dining room I would of looked for an alternative property for our stay This was disappointing as it was a special evening I booked for my wife as a surprise , Breakfast was good quality and fresh 
8699,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Property is not quite a 4 since it needs some renovation No mini bar in the room , Great wifi Good breakfast Nice friendly staff Great restaurants nearby 
8700,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms are rather small still one has everything he she needs , Staff was extremely polite welcoming and friendly English breakfast was really good Excellent location in between Queensway and Bayswater metro station 
8701,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, My room was tiny had to shuffle sideways around the bed the bath bathroom were tiny felt I d paid to stay in a cupboard we will NEVER go back there , Didn t eat there 
8702,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, No water at all when needed even to flush loo due boilerwork No offer of compensation or change of accommodation Found nibbled biscuit on floor Delux double very basic with view of scaffolding No response from hotel despite 2 emails to manager Very disappointing experience , Entrance hall and bar attractive 
8703,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Some rooms are tiny no room for big luggage or movement or without a window Towels could have been bigger and there are no robes or sleepers No ventilation in the bathroom and the waters were running out from the bath , 100m from Queensway Station and 250m from Bayswater Station Renovated rooms with new WC and shower bath Very comfortable beds Very friendly and helpful staff 
8704,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was tiny we had an upgrade to a club room at check in as it was bigger which was very nice of them the superior double room must have been like a cupboard if this was the case Feel like 160 odd was a bit steep for a small room Shame about the scaffolding on the outside but that couldn t be helped , The hotel staff were excellent and the bed was very comfortable like the idea of the portable handy phone Very homely place WOULD DEFO COME BACK if slightly cheaper 
8705,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The double room is rather tight and there is no space for large luggage or movement in the room Rather disappointed no robes or slipper or shower cap Complimentary bottled water is given on 1st day but not on subsequent days as compared to other hotels that I have stayed , The plus point of this hotel is its location which is between two stations bays water and Queensway There are lots of eateries and we are spoiled for choice 
8706,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, The beds very comfy but not enough room to move round kept hitting my toes on the bottom of the bed The staff were very helpful especially at breakfast as the big restaurant was closed and there was not enough room for everyone so we had to have our breakfast in the bar and it was not very warm overall we would go back again 
8707,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, the room aren t that great the pipes makes a lot of noise during the night which didn t make us sleep really well, The staff was excellent from the reception to the restaurant really rich breakfast
8708,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was very cold the radiator did not work The TVs channels didn t work The front door did not lock A lot of the switches in the room didn t work I asked for an extra blanket calling room service twice as they forgot and they brought it an hour later , Leaving
8709,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, My boyfriend and I wanted to spend a special Christmas in London and decided to splurge on what was advertised in pictures a lavish London hotel The room we received was nothing like the pictures advertised It was very small and very plain the decor was very outdated and looked like it was from the 70 s or something The breakfast was 15 pounds per person which is ridiculous The staff messed up my room payment which made the check in a nightmare The bar staff did not know how to properly make drinks Overall I was thoroughly disappointed with the hotel Our room looked straight out of a Motel 5 and was so small we could barely move around not exaggerating we could barely move This was not a supposedly a 4 star grand royale hotel I will never go back here and do not recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a lush place to stay in London For the amount we paid we expected a lot more Its not as advertised , The lobby was beautiful 
8710,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Our room was in the attic I think It was very small indeed However we didn t explore other options and it was cheap so we don t take it personally Room a little tired and should really be sold as a single , Typical old London hotel looking a bit tired from former glory days First floor reception area has a nice homely feel and staff were pleasant and efficient The price was right and we didn t look much further you don t mess around in London over Christmas 
8711,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The superior double room was small There were no bedroom slippers n toothbrushes The cloak cabinet were tiny like a budget hotel There is no space for large luggages There is no fridge as compared to the twin which has a fridge Complimentary bottled water given during check in but not for subsequent days of stay , The location is nearby 2 train stations queensway and bays water There were lots of eateries nearby 
8712,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The place was nothing like the picture on the website We requested a crib for our baby and they gave us a baby playard and a blanket After they put it together we didn t fit The room was underground no view the heat didn t work and the bed uncomfortable I didn t even bother complaining since it was only one night but I regret not spending 20 more Ando going to a better place , The location especially the proximity to the park
8713,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room is extremely small and the double bed barely fit Ultra small wardrobe combined with compact space made living from large suitcases quite uncomfortable , Excellent location near Hyde Park Queensway little shops and restaurants rail stations Hotel itself nice and quaint 
8714,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Tiny rooms old and smelly having work done inside and on the front which wasn t aware of when booked so appearance wasn t great Didn t like the stay , The staff are so lovely and friendly 
8715,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Restaurant to serve meals rather than just sandwiches Ice creams were advertised as Ben and Jerrys but were a different less well known make , Value for money friendly staff and location The free fruit wine and soft drinks in room especially the fruit 
8716,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Upon arrival we couldn t see hotel only scaffolding very disappointing nobody told us about renovations Reception staff very helpful but overall hotel is very tired rooms not at all like pictures paint flaking duvet cover didn t fit bed net curtains dirty I would say a rating of 2 3 at most such a shame as staff were so nice ,No Positive
8717,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I didn t feel safe within the hotel and unfortunately had problems on the night of my boyfriends birthday as a man who wasn t staying at the hotel was very drunk We he to get staff to come redo the bed sheets which was really embarrassing finding pubic hair on our sheets The hotel did do us a upgrade as we was scared the man that was very drunk threatened us The police was called sadly it did ruined our night and the upgraded room wasn t special enough to save our trip personally I wouldn t recommend the hotel I had saved to take my boyfriend to London , The location was very good and was the best part of staying there was able to get my boyfriend to the winterwonderland
8718,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing negative to say, Everything was beyond expectations Have stayed there before and will definitely make it my first choice again Highly recommend
8719,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We didn t get a room on our first night apparently there was a problem with the boiler so we had to go to a sister hotel called the Metropolitan hotel This was very inconveniant given that we lost a lot of time getting there and returning the next day In addition we didn t even know where they would bring us to even though we had to pay for the whole duration of our stay upon arrival at the Grand Royale The sister hotel did not meet our expectations either When we returned to the Grand Royale the following day we had to wait again in order to get our room All in all we lost a lot of time waiting around which was quite annoying given that we only stayed in London for two nights , We were compensated for the inconvenience caused by the defective boiler on the second day of our stay by getting a room upgrade 
8720,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was very small bed was small and bathroom was to small to get in couldn t move in there Also hairdryer wouldn t come out of drawer so couldn t dry hair well Not good value for money False advertising Expensive for what you get ,No Positive
8721,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The staff where so unhelpful telly broken complimentary drinks half drunk staff couldn t have cared less Very disappointed and I m not normally one to complain ,No Positive
8722,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was fairly cramped The shower screen was far too small water kept going all over the floor and the water wasn t actually on for the first few hours we were there, The location was really good so close to the tube if we needed it but lovely walk through hype park if we weren t in a rush Loved the handy phone really came in handy 
8723,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Couldn t get a sit down breakfast in the resteraunt in the morning We had to perch on the small double in our room Single glazing and noise from the street made for an uncomfortable night Internet was intermittent the mobile phone inoperable , Receptionist the bellhop 
8724,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, room was small and they gave me an upgrade , Bed comfy staff friendly nice bathroom nice area near Hyde Park I like hearing about the history of the hotel especially about how it was built for Lily Langtry the King s Mistress and well known actress 
8725,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing, The staff were very friendly and as we were celebrating our Silver Wedding Anniversary the hotel made us feel very special The location was also very good as it was 2 minutes walk from a tube station and to the park 
8726,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, There are two truths to this property s description Yes it s in London Yes it s on Hyde Park This is where it ends The Grand Royale is no hotel It is a hoStel Whether it s the mouse hole rooms lonely soaring lobby or the other fooled tourists making life miserable for the teenage staff you will regret staying here The room wasn t clean the double bed accommodates two half people and the toilet shower and sink are located together in a phone booth Spend a few quid and upgrade your stay somewhere else , Staff was barely accommodating 
8727,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, They state superior double room But not kidding it s a box size The 1st room had no space on one side of bed a day was 1ft space between foot of bed and wall We requested change they did but then 2nd room smelt of damp So 3rd time lucky , Staff were very helpful and nice 
8728,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Would have been nice to have a ramp for our buggy and we had to leave our buggy at reception as it would not fit but that was OK , The feel of the hotel the friendless of the staff and the location also the in room gifts unexpected and nice 
8729,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Sold as a family hotel when clearly it is not Steps to hotel no access for disabled or pram users Dining g area only had 1 high chair which we had to wait for, Breakfast was nice
8730,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Not being informed of scaffolding outside and fireplaces blocked up with polythene There was even a delivery of toilet rolls heaped outside Poor impression really , Bed was comfortable bathroom clean and refreshment facilities good 
8731,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bed was too small we are used to kingsize and concequently we don t sleep too well , It was a great location clean and friendly staff breakfast was good value too 
8732,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Lifts rated as for 6 persons which could only accommodate 2 people with luggage before the overloaded alarm sounded But as the hotel was undergoing a major facelift this may have been a factor , The times gone by grandeur of the reception area and other public rooms This coupled with the ultra modern interiors of the bedroom to which we were upgraded as it was my wife s special birthday All the staff we encountered were pleasant and most helpful from the moment we arrived Secure car parking available within a few hundred yards as was the London Underground 
8733,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, They had our rooms mixed up and gave our key to someone else after we d checked in Another couple walked in when we were having a nap Not great Room are tiny however I appreciate that goes with the territory in London , Location was good 
8734,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Quite expensive from last time we stayed brother in laws room was cheaper that our by 40 00 and we had same room and staff could not tell us why, Nice hotel need a nice part of town
8735,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room is a bit small you could hear people walking on the floor from the top room all the time Staff however claimed that they would look into the matter , Excellet location close to pblic transportation staff was very polite and helpful 
8736,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Hotel changed from the one booked meant a much longer walk to the nearest tube station I cannot accept that it was not known earlier that work was underway at the booked site , Complimentary breakfast as hotel changed 
8737,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Expensive breakfast Small room and small bathroom Our room was on the ground floor but we had to climb some stairs with our luggage and no elevator, Very good location Extremely friendly staff Old classic building but when we traveled it was in renovations so we could not see much of it Quiet and friendly hotel
8738,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, the filthy sheer curtains in my room and the tiny night stands My view was pretty bad too Also there was scaffolding on the building which couldn t be helped but destroyed the atmosphere , The responses of the staff
8739,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bathroom was quite small , The room was spacious The decor of the hotel outside the room was lovely particularly the carved staircase The bed was lovely and comfy 
8740,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The smallest room and bed i have ever stayed in I tried to request a change but the internet was down and they d get back to me which never happened ,No Positive
8741,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Upgraded to a deluxe double from superior or were we as it was extremely small unable to upgrade further which was disappointing Bathroom was a tiny en suite which was a joke Stairs inside room to the bed Room was unbearably hot air conditioning didnt work Staff arguing in the bar fire alarm set off staff unsure what to do Would not recommend this hotel , Hyde park location tube station proximity and good water pressure in shower 
8742,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bar area was musty smelling and the Sauvignon Blanc Chilean no choice was suitable for your fish and chips Rammed into the tiny breakfast restaurant admittedly due to current hotel restorations but just not great even after having to book a time to make sure it wasn t to busy , Two minute walk from tube small but perfectly formed bathroom plenty of fresh clean towels and ironing board arrived in a matter of minutes after being requested I could just about set the board up and Iron my shirt without the need to kneel on my bed just 
8743,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, For the price the room was a little small but it was only to sleep in so it didn t really matter , The decoration of the hotel foyer was lovely and the paintings on the ceilings were fabulous 
8744,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Being woken by housekeeping staff talking for ages and very loudly right outside our door even though do not disturb was on display, Beautiful old world charm of hotel
8745,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Club Bar coffee good but such a strange room to call a bar Its an internal room with no outside light , Old world charm friendly staff
8746,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, not told restaurant was being renovated or we had to book a table for breakfast so no room for us in the morning room very small and draughty no nice lobby lounge as on website as restaurant now there got charged for breakfast even though couldnt get in ,No Positive
8747,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Staff failed to warn about building work and we were disturbed by banging above The fruit platter contained a mouldy plum and unripe pear , Comfy bed nice shower
8748,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms very tiny and lower ground a bit like a rabbit warren , Staff very friendly and helpful Location to Hyde Park brilliant and very close to 2 tube options 
8749,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room is too smaller than which we see on the website Especially in the bathroom I cannot even turn around , The lobby s design and The staff there were really nice and quite warm hearted Some gifts have been prepared for free like wine chocolates and fruits 
8750,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Work was being carried out which we weren t aware of the rooms were TINY very little space to get around the bed and the beds were small our feet hung over the edge despite having booked a deluxe room There was no decent public space to relax in either the theatre was freezing and the lobby was unappealing despite the lovely photos The cleanliness of the room was poor very dusty lots of marks on the walls and floor and the sheets had not been changed since the last guests The staff did try their best including moving rooms as the heater was making a noise in the first room but the move itself was very shambolic They did apologise and gave us complementary chocolates and wine but we shall not stay here again when there are lots of other lovely hotels in the same area for the same price , The location was fantastic
8751,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bar could have stayed open a little later, Staff really friendly and professional breakfast fantastic standard room a little small but clean modern and had everything you need
8752,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was of poor quality asked to be moved the did to a room that was just as poor the area where the put me up bed was damp the wallpaper stained had not been cleaned throuher it was a mess waiting for the manager to contact me with no effect had to pay for breakfast when I booked with you breakfast was included I can go on an on, The breakfast was nice just as well
8753,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The first room we were giving was a basement room which was tiny and freezing as the window wasn t properly sealed which in December isn t great They did however move us to a slightly larger room which was nice and warm I thought overall it was very expensive for what it was , Best thing about this hotel is definitely the location 2 minutes from the tube and right on Kensington Gardens which was fab The staff were friendly and when we did have a problem fixed it right away 
8754,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The value for place is absolutely ridiculous The price we paid was totally high compare to the standard received I would give this hotel 3stars minus just for the location The hotel charged mi 150 pounds before my arrival without saying what it is for I have of course paid fully for my stay at the time of check in so in my opinion this is overusing my credit card details, I like the location and probably the staff was trying to assist to accommodate mi in the hotel when three floor was out of order
8755,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bedroom was the smallest I ve ever stayed in and apparently we were given a free upgrade to a Club Room God knows what the standard room size is like They accidentally booked someone else into our room and blocked our key card but apologized and gave us a free bottle of wine , Reception Area has character but has scaffolding over the front of hotel at moment Staff were friendly and attentive 
8756,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Staff attempted to relocate due to maintenance issue but weren t prepared to pay for taxis Staff were unhelpful Waited 20 minutes for bags at departure and when asked they hadn t even given the ticket to the attendant Scaffolding outside Poor, Room was clean Bed was comfortable 
8757,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We didn t appreciate the hotel trying a bait and switch on us They tried to get us to move to their sister hotel using the same spurious maintenance excuse they ve been using all year it seems After making a loud fuss at reception a room was miraculously available for us after all , Handy for Hyde Park 
8758,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Grand Royale is extremely tired and run down for a hotel charging these rates Decor was extremely shabby and facilities were of a poor standard We had to ask to switch rooms as the TV didn t even work and we were told it couldn t be fixed Walls were marked in corridor and our room and stains on the divan bed This hotel is in need of either a huge refurb or needs to drastically drop its rates , Not much at all really 
8759,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, The hotel is quaint the room tiny location is good overall satisfactory but pricey especially as no breakfast is included a continental breakfast would do 
8760,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, It was the worst experience I reached there 12 am as scheduled but the reception staff informed us that there is no room available due to boiler problem They have waited till we reached the hotel to inform us that there is no room They never contacted us or phoned to say anything Moreover they have send us with a taxi to a horrible hotel with nasty smell and noisy AC which we couldn t use to heat the room so It ended up with a tiny electric heater beside the bed ,No Positive
8761,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We booked a superior double expecting something double and superior our room 711 was just a bit bigger than a large cupboard my wife and I had to squeeze against the wall for one another to pass we are not heavy weights we were not informed that the hotel is under refurbishment at the time of booking therefore not expecting the facilities to be severely limited and certainly not expecting the breakfast to be served in the downstairs lounge where tables are closer than Macdonalds restaurant There were many people complaining and the atmosphere for staff was not good and despite this they were cheerful and trying to please guests , Friendly and helpful staff I imagine it is a nice hotel if you could access it all During our stay it was covered in scaffold and the whole first floor was out of bounds which includes the dining breakfast room
8762,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, My reservation was double bed deluxe however room given maximum I could say single superior and when I complain to the receptions they says hotel are full And no compensation was offered , location good
8763,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room small and smelt like drains stained bedding yuck Room 001 right by a staff door that banged every few mins from dawn Def not worth then money , Beautiful reception area and dining room Friendly and helpful staff Breakfast extra but nice with enough staff to keep on top of the tea coffee demand 
8764,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I had a sleepless night at this hotel the room 807 must have the air conditioning system outside it There was a hum of noise from this system all night the equivalent of an idling car which was impossible to sleep through I won t be staying again , Location is the only thing this hotel has going for it 
8765,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The front of the property was covered in scaffolding we were not made aware of this We were in the basement although nice rooms no view or phone signal , The building has great charm the entrance and history along with the location The bed was very comfortable and the room was well stocked the staff were always happy to say hello and there were plenty of staff to offer assistance 
8766,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Renovation works in parts of the hotel were perhaps an eyesore but this didn t stop us enjoying our stay , The staff in reception were excellent helpful polite and went out of their way to make sure my husband and I had a wonderful overnight stay on our anniversary 
8767,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was small but the character of the hotel made up for it in a large modern hotel you could wake up anywhere in the world and it would look the same not here you are in London , We booked for a 50th birthday weekend and had a great stay very friendly staff kind and generous gifts left in the room thank you Spotless room with a very modern bathroom 
8768,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Everything but the most shocking was the room I paid 150 for a room that didn t had nothing to do with what showed in the pic disappointed , Nothing
8769,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The building was a under construction arrived to find hotel covered in scaffolding staff then lied and said it weren t there s even though it was blatantly surrounding their building ,No Positive
8770,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Single rooms too many stairs items towel holders safes mirrors when foggy too high 5 6 people Wardrobe unstable no headboard 1 4 loo roll need sliding door to ensuite not enough space dangerous at night, Location showers breakfast
8771,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Breakfast not being included within the fee shown st the time of booking , The hotel suited our needs and met with our expectations The staff were very welcoming efficient and of a pleasant demeanour The hotel was clean and tidy and facilities in the room all worked
8772,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms were a little small and the bathroom could have done with a bit of a clean , Very warm welcome from staff with an offer of an upgrade given Email received from manager the day after we checked out which was a lovely touch 
8773,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was tiny extremely small and not well laid out at all There was no fridge for us to keep anything in and we only had water on the first night Not worth 411 for 3 nights at all and definitely not 4 , We ended up staying at the Paddington hotel as there were issues with the hot water here 
8774,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I ordered a bottle of Prosecco for my arrival we were delayed a check in by 15 minutes whilst this was organised then when I got to my room there was no bottle I had to call reception and wait 10 more minutes The pictures online make the rooms look MUCH bigger than they are to the point of being unbelievable , A wonderful reception staff very helpful the room was clean and kept well stocked The location was great and the cost was in keeping with the amenities and locale The bathrooms were well stocked with everything you could need and the bed was comfy and getting was powerful 
8775,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was a little cold responsive heating but had to get out of bed to switch on Room 215 window blinds did not move so could not see outside felt like in room without a window altho view was not good from the room nets or voile would have been better with working blind ,No Positive
8776,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, the room was a little to small but we manged fine, shower was perfect bed was cozy and each day all sheets were changed along with towels we were well looked after thank you if your looking for a place to rest after your long day this it 
8777,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing to comment that s right nothing at all very friendly staff beautiful hotel very accommodating will definitely stay again , All round perfect stay Had a slight problem with air conditioning but quick thinking staff came through with an electric fan was overwhelmed with the fruit basket delivered next morning Couldn t ask for more 
8778,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The fact we got separated as a family we booked 2 double rooms and a triple room so we could all be together but rooms were split across 3 levels and a mother and 2 kids meant for the family room had to be split up due to maintenance in the family room that nobody notified us about so caused some upset for the kids could of been a bit more efficient as waited at least an hour of our time to sort this out overall,No Positive
8779,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I didn t like being asked to move hotels as they had a boiler problem I was also disappointed that the large lounge area with open fire which I had enjoyed on a previous stay was closed off and we couldn t use it , I like the location and the great restaurants nearby 
8780,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I read the reviews about how small the rooms are but did not believe how TINY it is until I saw it You literally cannot have 2 people walking around at the same time The staff are not fully informed about London and transport which was unhelpful for me as a tourist , The room was clean with modern clean bathroom Friendly staff Great location
8781,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bedroom and ensuite were very small but well modernised Renovation work was progressing so the main dining room was out of action making the smaller breakfast room very crowded , Loved the breakfast the quiet yet convenient location and the fascinating history of the place which is said to have been refurbished by Edward VII as Prince of Wales for his actress mistress Lille Langtry The ornate public rooms are lovely as is the pocket sized theatre 
8782,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, My room was cancelled They offered me to move to another hotel i didn t agree so one night we spent in a small room in basemen The next day we moved on the first floor in a standard room ,No Positive
8783,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, as i booked online well in advance the cost of the room was held on my debit card i paid by credit card but am still waiting for the amount stopped on my debit card to be unblocked iwas told it would be credit straight away dont think this should happen as i am not rich and need every penny so i am without funds at this time because of this, staff really helpful clean and tidy
8784,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, There were building works on the outside of the building which we were not told about and found this very disappointing however having said that they did not affect our stay at all , Location is excellent Staff are lovely Rooms are small but very cosy and adequate Decor in main lobby is very Victorian 
8785,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room service was only sandwiches although plenty of places to eat nearby, The ambience and the rather quirky decor The rooms however are bright and modern
8786,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, bathroom was TINY shower was the size of a small phone booth you could barely turn around The room was so small there wasn t room for a chair for the small desk , Location was great staff was very helpful
8787,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Unlike every other hotel I have ever had to book for colleagues this one refused to take payment in advance over the phone which put me in an awful position they should say they don t take payment other than face to face on the website Awful customer service I was waiting on the phone for 40 minutes and then instead of even trying to help they said just come in ,No Positive
8788,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The building is under construction the rooms are small old a bit dirty Very than the pictures and various prices in different websites, The location was great
8789,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Lock on bedroom door was broken Exterior bedroom doors were filthy and everywhere looked like it was in need of a good clean redecoration and some tlc At checkin we were told we d been upgraded to a family suite The room was depressing and when we asked reception tif we could see the room we d booked we were advised that there weren t any available The upgrade was clearly a con We d have been much more understanding if we d been told the truth from the outset The family suite was a major disappointment dingy with dirty marked walls and carpet that looked grubby and threadbare around the edges Hotel was run down inside and not at all like the internet photos The bar was unfriendly and uninviting as was the furniture It lacked atmosphere and the carpet was filthy especially around the Windows The beds were comfortable but not sure why we had two single beds when we d requested a double When we mentioned the door lock to reception to be fair they removed my 5 00 beer tab from the bill My wife did not drink her unchilled glass of white wine and the rather surly barman reluctantly didn t charge for it which was appreciated No restaurant or room service We were very disappointed as nothing about this hotel felt or looked 4 Staff were pleasant enough ,No Positive
8790,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The first room I was given was 801 which is right at the top of the building in what feels like the attic and the water heater in was bubbling all night and I could not sleep , The staff were really helpful and when I asked for a change of room the staff did this instantly and I have a much better room in the basement section 
8791,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, It wasn t the hotel I oringinally booked we were moved to this hotel Then I find out there wasn t enough beds so they wanted to move me a third time again but i refused They had a pullout bed which was only big enough for a child wasn t happy especially being there 1 nite stay and had excursions booked in , The staff were ver good and friendly
8792,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, At arrival I was assigned to a room that looked more as a closet or pantry than a guest room It had a step right at the entrace and it was so small that two persons were not able to stand around the room at the same time Then we asked for a room change then we were transferred to a larger room not big with a bed barely capable to fit a couple of a standard size The lobby is depressing it seems to be from the Queen Victoria era , The staff is very courteous and offer great attention 
8793,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We got upgraded to a Club Room Lord knows what standard is like Room 222 almost behind a cupboard door next to a fire exit it looked like Room very small with the tiniest of windows which was frosted and when opened looked out onto a passageway full of air conditioning vents and old cars Bed has broken springs so every time one of you moves the other rides the wave Bathroom clean and shower ok but really poor value Bar closed at 11 and breakfast was a whopping 15 each we didn t have it , Reception staff helpful 
8794,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I had a Superior room which was probably a single in a past life very small Not great value for 168 per night Bar service was very slow as the barman kept disappearing , Very little other than the location 
8795,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was a little small but that is to be expected in inner London To compensate we were within 1 minute walk to Hyde Park , Staff were great and when they realized we were celebrating our Golden Anniversary they prepared a surprise for us in our room which was lovely The hotel is Grade 1 listed and has all the original features in the main rooms and the hotel has an interesting history 
8796,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms small difficult to actually sit down at the desk air con didn t work properly , Staff were really friendly Location was great for morning runs in the park
8797,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bed was one of the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in and very small for a double Good job only 5ft 4 The bathroom was very small The shower was adequate but you could not turn in it , The hotel was situated exactly where we wanted so an ideal location We didn t use any facilities and it was just a base However the staff were really friendly and professional The hotel was clean 
8798,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, overall appearance of the hotel requires a little attention love the original character shame its not used to a better advantage Bedding very poor and room very small even in the Club rooms Decor bland and dated , The staff are very attentive extremely keen to ensure your stay is pleasant and enjoyable Their interest appears very genuine and without exception the staff are this hotels greatest asset location adjacent to Hyde park was lovely in the Autumn 
8799,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room size was small and the bathroom was extra small but we made it work out OK , Location was excellent near Hyde Park the train underground and bus routes Food was superb Atmosphere was old English just as we d hoped 
8800,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bed linen wasn t changed we were there for 2 nights also want that happy that on our little balcony we had a sex toy , We were a 2 minute walking distance from the tube station and Hyde park
8801,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The rooms themselves were far below average Extremely small with almost no room to move , The lobby area and restaurant has beautiful old world decor The staff at check in were calm and helpful despite the huge line
8802,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Decor and condition of rooms dated and tired Very small room but I guess it is London , Hotel bar very nice place to have a pre drink Very friendly and helpful staff
8803,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Arrived to find beautiful building in scaffolding Queues at reception and some guests being moved to other hotels Never did find out what the problem was but the chaos was not handled well by staff and there were sections taped off with no entry signs Had requested to check in one hour early but room not ready OK so they had a problem Won t hold that against them Asked to see room anyway as it was a very special occasion and I had upgraded to a so called club room Taken first to a tiny twin and was told the beds could be pushed together Asked for a proper double room and was eventually shown one but it was still absolutely tiny Frankly if I hadn t been on a time limit to get to the theatre I would have found somewhere else The bathroom as mentioned modern and clean was little more than a cupboard The room was VERY small and there was no natural light Windows were covered in permanent papery blinds to disguise outside bin store area We were told that it was one of the best rooms in the hotel but I don t see how it could be or how you could get smaller Just labelling the door Club Room is meaningless My basic beef is that I paid extra for what I considered was a very basic room Didn t have breakfast there After checkout manager emailed me to ask for feedback and assuring me he was there to help in any way he could I gave him feedback and two weeks later he hasn t replied Sadly would not stay again Booked it as was such a beautiful old building but what a disappointing experience , Very clean though tiniest bathroom ever Comfy bed SOME staff porters very friendly 
8804,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bedroom was very small a foot between bed and wall window It was also very uncomfortable Everything was small shower area towels etc On arrival they tried to get me to move to a sister hotel , They left us alone
8805,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms were very small and the noise from outside was clearly heard What sounded like fireworks at midnight a police car at 3am , Excellent wi fi The bed was comfortable The lobby is lovely but who sits in a lobby for long 
8806,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, A huge disappointment for me was the hotel is going through extensive restoration I booked this hotel after a great deal of research on the basis of staying in a historic building with British charm and character What I discovered when I arrived was the fact that the hotel s lovely exterior was covered in scaffolding the gorgeous public areas you see on their site were closed including the dining room This was not disclosed when I booked and I wouldn t have reserved if I had known in advance They requested full payment on my credit card when I checked in and I regret agreeing to that as I should have cancelled the booking and looked elsewhere So if you are expecting to experience what you see on their website you will be most disappointed , I liked the location as it is very easy access to Central London I have friends in the area so that made it convenient for us to get together Tube stop is a minute away hotel is close to Paddington Station if you are coming in from Heathrow and there are plenty of shops and services in the area 
8807,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, As an old building it s a bit of a maze walking around the hallways, They had a very comfortable bar lounge where I was able to have business meetings They were one tube stop from Paddington Station where the Heathrow Express terminates in London
8808,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The staff in the kitchen lost it at one stage waiting for a time for coffee and taost, The staff and the room was fantastic I would like to stay again soon thanks
8809,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Avoid G Floor I was in room 023 and got terribly disturbed by the smell of the food I guess it was from either the breakfast room or the kitchen Not good for resting , Good location It is closed to Queensway Station and Hyde Park 15 mins to Bond Street and Oxford Circus Indeed ideal for those who enjoy running either in the morning or afternoon 
8810,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Small room couldn t open the window shower is small and when you take a shower it floods the entire bathroom no bed side lamp so either you re in extreme light or darkness bed is small there are cracks on the walls and they re falling apart Oh yes and no coat hangers,No Positive
8811,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We couldn t buy the breakfast we had been told they are to busy to supply all guest with breakfast it is rediculouse The bed linen was stinked Rooms are very tiny and toilet bathroom are so small you can t dry yourself after the shower no room for it The four stars on the website of this hotel is fake it is hardly three stars by UK standards I will give it two stars , Location Bathroom was very clean
8812,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Our room did have a window but we were not able to open it no daylight and blin glass Very small room and very small bed considering that 2 people should slep in there ,No Positive
8813,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was absolutely tiny Never stayed in a room so small and to think it cost almost 500 Euro is awful First night bed was so hard we woke up with pains moved room to a smaller didn t think it was possible to go smaller room we couldn t walk into the room together it was so small Couldn t walk around the bed without hitting the radiator and could touch the bathroom sink from the bed Awful size to call it a bedroom definitely would not return caravan would be bigger, Location only
8814,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, scaffolding outside the whole building I paid for a surprise visit for my father and was shocked to see the exterior without even being told Booked a twin deluxe room wasn t even suitable for a deluxe single room bathroom couldn t move bath toilet washbasin all squashed into a tiny room when the door opened it hit the bed Couldnt even sit at dressing table to dry hair Had to go to reception to ask for more coffee and milk sachets really poor Going to book breakfast but room was being refurbished although another area available The Hotel had a bit of history but sadly my visit will remain history it was really poor, nothing
8815,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, See above, They gave us complimentary wine and chops for husbands birthday but hotel dark dreary and building works at front of building and bar shuts at 23 00 hours
8816,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bed was too soft, Location staff friendliness beautiful architecture of building inside Room a little bit small not that we spent too much time in there 
8817,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Price is bit high for the size of the room per say BUT considering its located in only 10 minutes from Oxford Street and its right next to Hyde park its quite nice pricing They should have resupplied water on the second day as well No fridge available in the room No slippers provided Breakfast had to be booked and paid separately and rather pricey for a regular hotel buffet and does not offer an omelet they do offer fried eggs Breakfast was bit salty but that is just typical English style and it is rather subjective matter , The location is exceptionally good You can rule out every cons just with the location Only 10 15 minutes away from Oxford Street which is the main shopping area in London The place is very nice and calm The hotel provide with Here mobile device that you can carry it around the city with you in which it provides unlimited data and local calls with many information about I could take it around the city and search the web including the map Very clean traditional style hotel Very warm nice staffs that speaks different languages We could keep our luggage behind the desk for free of charge until we get back to take off to airport 
8818,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Tried to have a bath one of the evenings I m pregnant and would have loved a hot bath after a long day but no hot water pretty disappointing , Room was compact but very comfortable and quiet Staff friendly and close to great transport into centre 
8819,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room while clean and updated was very small I know that is not unusual in London but we were disappointed at that price point It was difficult to get out of the bed on one side as it was almost to the wall and no room for luggage to be left out and open That s really our only complaint Hotel has an interesting history and was fine for our needs , Good location especially for access to Paddington Station for the Heathrow Express Also a short walk to Notting Hill and Portobello Road The night staff are lots of fun and provide great service Angels overnight Julian Carlos Claudio Agnelo It being close to Halloween Count Dracula was roaming the lobby and bar Our initial room smelled of cigarette smoke in spite of it being a non smoking hotel Thankfully they changed our room with no issue We had reserved a club room and were pleased to find a box of chocolates in addition to the wine and fruit bowl 
8820,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The stairs the poky room with more steps immediately inside to the sleeping area making entry with bags very difficult Small bathroom and lack of ventilation and a rock hard bed , The old world look of the interior and the Opera Bar 
8821,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, EXTREMELY small rooms Look nothing like the picture If you take the lowest category you won t have any space left for your luggages Some of the staff were rude Other really nice No standards , Convenient location 
8822,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Big queues so took a long time to check in Room was on the sub level so couldn t get a phone signal , Central clean good shower and bathroom comfy bed and just what I needed 
8823,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms are tiny with little space to move or place luggage Bathroom was the tiniest I have ever seen , Hotel staff are very professional but nothing is too much trouble Very attentive 
8824,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Hotel has a number of sister sites nearby they tried to get me to move to a cheaper hotel because there was an issue When I said I reserved the right to come back and cancel without penalty if I did not like the new one They remarkably found a room for me in the original hotel ,No Positive
8825,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The location was not 1 2miles from the venue I was attending There was scaffolding covering the front entrance The road was shared with several hostel type buildings They let a colleague check into my room without ID and no reference to her name on my booking good job she wasn t a stalker , The room was clean and the bathroom was quite new
8826,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Some interesting characters at the adjacent hotels and apartments hanging outside in the evening Perhaps that s our fault for being outdoors after dark , Rich old wooden floors and moldings but fresh cleanly decorated rooms Tiny of course Delightful breakfast for just 12 pounds Just a block to Kensington gardens and Hyde Park Restaurants all up and down within walking distance A 5 10 cab fare to most anywhere but we used the tube over two days and got around just fine 
8827,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, we stayed when renovation work going on so shrouded in scaffold shame because it s a wonderful building Drawing room as in brochure being used as dining room so sitting area is in the entrance hall or bar , wonderful building great location excellent staff 
8828,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The twin room we shared was extremely small Would have been suitable for single room There was no way the room temperature could be controlled in the evening when the central heating was turned on The staff provided a fan to cool the room until morning when the room air con was activated, The Hotel was extremely interesting The d cor was beautiful with decorative stained glass windows and beautiful timber interiors The staff were helpful and friendly
8829,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Can t think of anything to complain about , Staff were really helpful and friendly Ever such good value for money Top tip would be book direct as same price only breakfast is included although they upgraded us to free breakfast Rooms small but clean and comfortable 
8830,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The 1st room we booked was nothing like the picture despite ringing booking com and confirming that also upgrading the room through them Also getting to the hotel we paid a extra 100 for a family room upgrade which was ok so on the whole the room costed us 460 for a family room which was absolutely ridiculous as we could ve stayed in Mayfair for that price plus it was our anniversary weekend and wasn t pleasant at all will not be going back there again or booking with booking Com and either , The fact that the manger gave some money back as a good will gesture
8831,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Disabled access really needs improving , Great location and such a beautiful interior The historic connection added to the glamour too Fabulous restaurants nearby and excellent transport links 
8832,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The building work outside our room was quite noisy which disrupted our mornings The rooms slightly too small, Location of the hotel was Central The staff were very friendly and helpful Hotel is clean and comfortable Very welcoming atmosphere 
8833,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I had booked online and was informed I could pay at the property The hotel debited my account on the Friday prior to my stay on the Sunday which I wasn t overly concerned with as I had no plans to cancel On checking in they asked for the balance of the room I explained that the money had already been debited from account and I was told that it was just to hold the room and I would need to pay again So in theory I have paid twice for the room I have been assured that the holding amount will be credited back to my account within 7 days But this not very good practice and would put me off booking an overnight break with this hotel again , The rooms were nice and clean but very small 
8834,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, 6 stairs straighr down into the room from the door If you have stair issues be sure to mention this when you book , Beautiful building and charming staff Excellent breakfast 
8835,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms are very old fashioned and small Bathroom is small too with an old and not a particularly practical layout i e glass shower screen was too small and as a result the floor was covered in water after using the shower , The location
8836,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We got stuck in the lift twice which was quite frightening The bed we had needed replacing as the springs had collapsed The power points lost power one morning therefore unable to use hairdryer or recharge devices I think it should noted on the website that scaffolding across the front of the building could raise concerns of noise and inconvenience, Location and proximity to tube and park
8837,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The account of my colleague who reported that there was a rat in one of the rooms The lift didn t work properly There was building work going on everywhere The place was dusty ,No Positive
8838,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The rooms could have been bigger The first room I was offered was very small more like a storage room insulting and really disappointing, Breakfast and toilet were very good Housekeeping staff could do better job
8839,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Fridge and air con didn t work We only realised as we were leaving so it s possibly fixed now No good coffee shops close, The service was faultless 
8840,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Staff extremely helpful friendly and professional Facilities very good Rooms somewhat small but modern and very clean Photos a little misleading all looks larger in the photos Very good value for money 
8841,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room is extremly small and i found insects in the room and the reception , I liked the reception and the location The stuff were nice and the house keeping was very good 
8842,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was way too hot and couldn t adjust temperature because window fused shut , Location was excellent Close to the Undrground easy walking to shopping district Great bar and snack facilities Staff excellent 
8843,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms were really small which was fine for one person but I would find sharing a deluxe with another person really difficult There s no restaurant for dinner and after getting off a long haul flight it would have been nice to sit inside the hotel instead of wondering queensway , The location was amazing and super central to everything The cleanliness was fab and the staff were really nice 
8844,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, They claimed they had a boiler problem and hence could not honour the booking They said they will provide rooms at another hotel which was their sister concern also called Grand Royale and equally good but sent us off to Shaftesbury Hotel where we were asked to share one room for three persons for the first night The second night we were transferred to two rooms but they were so tiny we could not even open our suitcases plus there were awkward steps to get in and out of the room That hotel did not even have a restaurant except for breakfast After much complaining we were given a better room but nowhere near the rooms shown for the Grand Royale It appears that the Grand Royale London Hyde Park is used to attract bookings on booking sites and then people are sent off to a much lower standard hotel In my opinion they are confidence tricksters One guest had evened called the police when we were there in the lobby for the same reason The hotel was not shut as other guests were given and stayed in rooms Since I was with family and had a lot of luggage we had to lump it as it was already night They killed the joy and ruined our holiday ,No Positive
8845,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, It is a beautiful hotel full of old charm and character Beds comfortable showers hot wifi works well plus you receive a complimentary Handy phone to use during your stay This can be taken with you around London and can be used for Internet and local calls for free Hotel vey close to underground stations and plenty of restaurants and shops around the corner on Queensway to grab a bite to eat Would highly recommend this Hotel

8847,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Being from australia we wanted a nineteenth century experience in a beautiful authentic olde world hotel It was all that The Lily Langtry theatre bar was outstandingly beautiful We had many gorgeous cocktails there amid the gilt and finery Loved it Although single rooms are small they are just enough and very comfortable The deep British bath was fabulous too 
8848,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We were given a tiny room where we could hardly move and tiny bed for two pearls we asked to be changed and we were given one slightly bigger but next to the breakfast room very noisy even at 6am besides the door of the bathrooom was sticky and I told them but never cleaned it The bathroom was like a box where one could hardly move inside and the shower as well they wouldn t make reservations for the opera and if you call a taxi there they send you cars with their own prices which were a rip off , Free bottle of water and coffee and tea Location and reception
8849,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room very small Hotel overcharged significantly on sterling exchange rate and booking site kept giving diffetent excuses but never solved it , Hotel was very modern and clean Staff very polite and helpful Great location 
8850,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The rooms are smaler then photos but is a National Trust Old Building so it s worth it, The location is great You have acces to Hyde Park within 2 minutes and you can find anything you need at the local shops The beds are very comfortable
8851,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, My requirements were ignored leaving my travel companion staying in the room I booked but given the light respiratory health issues allergies the bathroom smelling of cigarettes and the room being cramped left me with the an option not to stay at this hotel Did not want to go through the frustrating conversations at reception but would not stay again Definitely not value for money paid given the room on a ground floor where you can barely move around in and a smell of cigarettes in the bathroom ,No Positive
8852,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Staff disorganised Trainee on front desk who was unsupported and unable to check us in Rooms very small and some basement level smelt of stale cigarette smoke , Member of my team asked to change rooms due to room door not locking Member Of staff who assisted was very helpful

8854,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The door into the room would not open fully because of the wardrobe The bedrooms were tiny one side of the bed was only 25cm away from the wall and a radiator was stuck out from that leaving 16cm up the side of the bed We had asked for larger rooms and they tried to charge us extra for this I refused to pay any extra as I couldn t beleive there were any smaller rooms ,No Positive
8855,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bed was very uncomfortable fridge didnt get cold Wasn t really worth the money spent Would stay somewhere else next time , Very close to the bayswater and queenbridge underground 
8856,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The staff was RUDE The air blew cool the first night but warm the second night The temperature outside was not low enough for heat When my wife called the front desk the gentleman was rude and condescending to her when she asked if the air conditioning was switched to heat or was there something wrong with our unit I didnt appreciate his attitude especially for the amount of money I paid The staff needs more training Don t plan to stay there again and definitely don t recommend this place, The location was close to eating places and public transportation

8860,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We waited 35 minutes to start the checking in process while the two out of their depth receptionists struggled with a handful of guests Despite the fact that we arrived late in the afternoon owing to a broken down train our room wasn t ready The guests lounge seemed to be permanently closed The employment of a concierge would have improved matters greatly , Excellent location next to Kensington Gardens and a beautiful old building Buffet breakfast was good and staff efficient When we had a problem with our room they upgraded us without our even having to ask The room and bathroom were very pleasant and all the staff were nice 
8861,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Was building works and scaffolding one floor below us We really should have been informed when booking or checking in especially as the workmen started at 7 30 , Excellent location Friendly staff 
8862,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, the room was super small and the bed was not comfortable the manager was nice enough to give us an upgrade to a bigger room but even that was too small to fit 2 adults and a one year old, staff were super nice and the location was very close to the station and hyde park
8863,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room service menu doesn t offer much and luggage took forever to be located after I had stored it on check out since I had an evening flight Otherwise a great hotel more like home because of the warm reception , Location is great 
8864,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, When we arrive after a long day we were told that I had booked two rooms which was incorrect there was only myself and me sister in law so we only needed one room We informed we would have to pay for both rooms until I spoke with an operator at your office and the hotel finally decided to cancel the extra room but for about an hour we were very worried that we had to pay for two rooms But got sorted in the end Also no airport shuttle so should say so on ads , Hotel was absolutely beautiful comfy bed and very pleased to have a bath in room Service was fantastic Location was amazing just near Kensington Palace and tube station 2 minutes away Very happy with location and service will certainly book again Luxury at the end of our trip before heading home

8866,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, book the club room which didn t feel like one The first room they gave us was on the second floor behind another random door which held 2 separate rooms The room was not well furnished despite the price paid One side of the mattress has collapsed I called the front desk several times and it was always un answered i went to the reception where they are awfully understaff and waited for a good long 15mins before I could address the change of my room I was told that it was the last room and I can t make any changes I was told to go for my dinner and come back again to see if they could do a swap When I came back they offered me another club room down in the basement with a window facing a neon bright light shinning right into the room every single night Thank god for the curtains The room was much smaller than the previous and reek of a mixture of dampness and new paint I was too tired and upset to even request for another room change , the staff which helped us changed our room and offered water when he saw that we were worn out from the change of room and the extreme long wait at the reception 
8867,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Cozy Botique Hotel Clean Rooms Excellent location with easy access to Tube Queensway station and Bayswater District Line Also very close to Kensington Park which is worth a visit Exceptional service levels Very helpful staff with smile on their faces Helped me in booking a luxury cab till airport at very reasonable price The team has accommodated my request for an early check in by couple of hours Super speed WiFi I will surely stay back in this hotel and would strongly recommend for a comfortabl stay and pocket friendly prices Booked a club size room and I must say it was a very decent size considering London room size standards Loved overall experience Keep up the good work team

8871,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, As previous reviewers have said the rooms are very small but for London this is probably typical Upgrading to a Club room provides access to the Club Lounge which has seating areas computers and a coffee tea station Breakfast is a bit pricey as we were able to walk around the corner to a great little cafe and have a wonderful breakfast for half the price , We found this hotel literally at the last minute having arrived in London in the early evening to find that the original guest house that we had booked 7 months earlier had given away our room to someone else and the room we were being given would not have twin beds Upgrading to a Club room provided us with a lounge area on the 5th floor which was very nice as the rooms are small The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean The location is excellent the hotel is within a 5 minute walk to two tube stations numerous restaurants and grocery stores The staff was very friendly and helpful

8875,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Such a luxurious hotel with comfortable and stylish rooms that has it all The staff are amazing making you feel very special I really enjoyed my experience there again as it was my second time Fantastic location too as it s next to Hyde park and one street away from loads of eateries and superstores all huddled together in one place 
8876,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I had late check out and the staff came to the room asking to go out because was late And I dont know why start the fire alarm and only in my floor the rest of the hotel was without fire alarm, The hotel is really nice and the location is perfect The staff was not as good and quick that I would have desired
8877,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The breakfast was pretty good I wish the eggs were cooked a little longer It seems people in UK like their eggs runny Due to construction we were moved to sister property so we missed out on the character of the older property, The staff was amazing They helped us with everything and anything The rooms were clean and the property was centeraly located

8895,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, On arrival we were able to leave our bag and told our room would be available from 2pm Great we thought that all fits with our plans However this relaxed feeling was short lived When we returned to check in later that day we were met with a long queue that took 40 minutes to process before we made it to the front Only to be told the hotel was fully booked How we wondered could this be we d booked 2 3 months prior to our check in date and received confirmation our reservation had been confirmed We were informed that our booking would be honoured at a neighbouring hotel and a free taxi transfer would be arranged for us within 5 minutes 30 minutes later our taxi had not arrived and we noticed ours wasn t the only one that hadn t turned up So far we had been well over an hour A further 20 minutes later a taxi finally arrived and we were taken to a hotel only a few minutes away Needless to say the other hotel dealt with us promptly on arrival but all the drama at check could if been avoided if only we had been told upfront ,No Positive
8896,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I didn t have an opportunity to sample this hotel as they had a mix up as they put it and sent us to another hotel The staff there were rude as they spoke in a foreign language whilst resolving the issue so I didn t know what was going on,No Positive
8897,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bathroom was fairly compact although useable The view from our window was of the windows of another part of the hotel but you can t have everything , Really friendly and helpful staff Delicious sandwiches that we ordered from room service Bed was comfy complimentary toiletries bathrobes slippers soft drinks bottle of wine and chocolates all made our stay feel more special We intend on coming back again very soon it was lovely 
8898,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was very small when I booked the room it was a deluxe single room but actually I could not move inside it , The historical design of the hotel It was clean The service staff was excellent 
8899,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, On arrival we were Met with a long que to reception when we did get served we were told they didn t have a room available for us due to maintenance work They said to go to the bar for a complementary drink and they would have a taxi pick us up and take us in 10 mins An hour and half later we were still waiting I asked them to get me a room in there hotel as other people were checking in They agreed and we ended up in a basement room which was very small Tv didn t have a remote to operate it either It definatley was not a four star room or experience We had to que 30 mins to get into the breakfast room When we did get in they had no cerial bowls so we had to use dinner plates to eat fruit and yogurt They clearly were struggling to cope as the beans sausage bacon etc was all depleted at different times Worst hotel experience for us for a long time Shame as we were there for my wife s birthday ,No Positive
8900,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The breakfast was too busy and we had to sit separately subsequently you were asking for coffee and items that were running out on the buffet , The room 419 was excellent and all staff great in what was a busy weekend
8901,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room exceptionally small and could be construed as dangerous Room was in a very confined space with 10 steep steps down to a miniscule bathroom with only just enough to squeeze in and I am of reasonably small build , Comfortable bed Great shower Decent breakfast extra Nice personable staff Very atmospheric impressive reception bar dining areas 
8902,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The pictures of the hotel rooms bore little resemblance to the actual room in particular the size of the room they were exceptionally small to the point of being claustrophobic , The hotel was very good in most respects and the staff tried to help as best they could Breakfast was very good and there was plenty of choice 
8903,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, It is our honey moon and we requested specials to our room nothing was being done for us Extra small room for us while it says deluxe double room, location very good lobby area very classic which we like
8904,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, There were problems on arrival with our rooms we were asked if we could move hotels we selected the location to walk into Hyde Park the next day then the rooms were confirmed but only one out of the two rooms was made available by 6pm , The staff were incredibly helpful and respectful The inconvenience was fully recompensed The breakfast was worth the money considering the convenience and the general cost to eat out in London 
8905,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, we missed out on High Tea on our last day we left it too late the night before but it was booked out by then so book it early , location is great close to 2 tube stations lobby public areas lovely old world feel but rooms spacious very clean all requests followed up quickly with smiles beds very comfortable with a choice of pillows 
8906,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, A four star hotel I don t think so Just overpriced There was nothing special about it Just four very thin walls and a bed Lack of ambiance Super small shower cabine My neighbor called home after midnight could hear his entire conversation Glad we didn t stay for breakfast , Friendly staff 
8907,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms very small having to pay in advance made you feel like they didn t trust you also the fact that no one told us at check in that we had to pay in advance resulted in an embarrassing position when we were locked out of our room On asking reception why we could not get in our room we were told in front of a busy reception area that it was because we hadn t paid I would expect to pay in a YHA but not in a hotel of this standard Ii have stayed in many hotels around the world and never have I had to pay in advance , The building
8908,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We were phoned during the day of our arrival to be told that they had room issues and we were being moved to another hotel After explaining we had a car in a nearby car park and that we had all been enjoying the festival we were at in Hyde Park so could not drive we were told there would be rooms in the grand royal When we did check in we were asked to pay for the room despite the fact the hotel had already pre authorised the full amount which had already been deducted from my card This meant that I was now 600 down for a 300 bill Next came the rooms having booked a deluxe double room we were given a twin club room which was so small that two people moving around the room were constantly having to get on the bed or go into the bathroom to let the other past All through this staff were not very helpful and seemed to be basically clueless Having listened to other people checking in and out and all the other complaints at reception I can safely say I do not believe anyone had a good stay this weekend Very disappointing for a such a wonderful building in the main ,No Positive
8909,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The rooms were a bit small , It is a beautiful place and in an excellent location If you like to walk you can easily get to many of London s main attractions The tube is also conveniently close and easy to use 
8910,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Fantastic property Great location The rooms are clean and comfortable The staff is extremely helpful especially Julian who was nice enough to upgrade my room I would definitely recommend this property to any business or leisure travellers 
8911,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Only issue we has was on check in We didn t have the credit card that we used to make the booking as the card had been cancelled Make sure you take the credit card that you use to make the booking This was sorted but frustrating Bed in our room had broken springs but this was quickly resolved and we were given a new room straight away , Nice hotel with a lot of character and history Nice staff especially Razvann who sorted our issue with the credit card with lots of patience and a friendly manner Breakfast was nice and plentiful Great location just a walk to lots of restarants 5min walk to bus stops and train stations Staff were helpful and provided good information for tourists 
8912,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We booked a superior double room which on the whole was fine however if we had been staying for more than 2 days it would have been very difficult to store suitcases ect as room was a tad on the small side,No Positive
8913,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Trade off is the room is a bit cramped and the design leans to efficiency rather than comfort The finishes are starting to feel their age in the rooms themselves , I often stay here when visiting london The location is great and breakfast is very good Staff are excellent 
8914,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, When I arrived after 2 days of travelling I was told that my room would only be ready in 24 hours and that I should take a cab to one of their other hotels stay there for a day them repack and move back to the grand royale The rooms are all dirty dust on the skirting boards Rooms are painfully small bathrooms are so small you battle to even dry yourself after a shower Front office staff were abrupt unfriendly and seemed barely willing to assist with calling the manager One of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had in London , the breakfast was about average but over priced Manager was helpful Porters were friendly
8915,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Very noisy area and noisy hotel Very small double rooms staff unable to help or call back regarding complaints no door man and no help with luggage upon arrival The room wasn t cleaned as well as expected , Good transport links 
8916,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bedroom was of reasonable size and bed comfortable but the shower was minuscule and the toilet difficult to access a larger person might have found it impossible to use There are steps at the front of the building and to some of the public areas handrails absent , Comfortable bed and the hotel worked with me to ensure I had a shower and ease of access to my room Staff were helpful Room service prompt and food adequate but not exciting 
8917,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The only thing I could think of was that its a bit pricy for what it was We booked this hotel because it was on offer through booking com at 53 off usual price otherwise we wouldnt have been able to afford it , We booked a Superior Double room for my mum and I wouldnt have described it as superior but it was a beautiful room bed was comfy bathroom was spotless and old building itself was just stunning Breakfast was superb and well worth 12 prebooked a selection of hot food including boiled eggs pastries and toast fresh fruit yoghurt salmon cheese and ham Location is just around the corner from Queensway situated on the Central line tube station which had a lift great for luggage 
8918,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was so small and dark it was unpleasant The shower was soooo small you couldn t move and I am not fat The worst hotel room we ve ever stayed ,No Positive
8919,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, There is nothing I don t like about this hotel, I love this hotel we have stayed 4 times now and have enjoyed every stay the staff are welcoming and friendly and it is good value for money very central I have stayed in many London hotels in the past and this is my favourite
8920,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Poor single glazed sash windows let in draughts I would definitely avoid during cold weather and noise The neighbours on the opposite side of the street decided to party outdoors until 00 30 we could hear everything clearly from the 7th floor with the window closed Narrow corridors Difficult with pushchair due to steps doors although staff will help if asked Many steps including at the entrance in the corridors and even in the bedroom Expensive breakfast so many good cafes in 3 10 min walking distance , Good water pressure and temperature Less than 5 mins walk to Queensway Bayswater tube 
8921,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Mattress uncomfortable like it was old I could hear the tube till late view from Window was a concrete courtyard room very small and no parking even though booking com said there was Shower drenched the bathroom , Complimentary wine chocolates and bathroom products
8922,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, room could have been bigger the bed was a little hard for my taste although it seemed good quality the 8th floor is not directly accessible by lift you have to go to the 7th and then up a couple of flights of stairs no minibar or fridge we stayed in a deluxe room , location was good staff very professional lobby was lovely 
8923,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Unfortunately I saw the mattress when the cleaners were changing the room and there was a large blood stain on it put me off a little , Great location close to the underground Staff were very helpful and lovely to deal with
8924,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, A little faster check in , Staff were very helpful and efficient The location is excellent with both underground and buses just around the corner The room was ample and comfortable We enjoyed our three days here 
8925,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I had read several bad reviews about overbooking and sending people to different hotel but I took a chance I had requested and early check in and we arrived very early 8am Upon arrival I was told that a representative had tried to call me to tell me their was a problem with the hot water in my room and they had no room for me I quickly went into defense mode and told them that I had read this bad review about them and couldn t believe it was happening to me Desk manager told clerk to call reservation and let them deal with it She called and told them I had read a bad review and they found a room for me but it wasn t ready They kept our luggage while we went to breakfast and said I was high priority to get in our room We returned about noon and it wasn t ready so we sat in the sitting room and waited and waited While waiting I heard various stories to incoming guests about the water and high priority to get in Different rooms were offered as was free breakfast to other guests I kept checking on room progress and was finally told that the guests had just checked out and we would once again be high priority to get in We did get in our room at check in time and we had a nice room Club room was what it was called It was in the basement but clean and nice We had a few drinks in fridge and basket of fruit Tea and hot chocolate Upon checkout Two of us left early and one remained I stopped at desk and said that one person remained and I wanted to make sure nothing was owed as it shouldn t have anything Assured we were paid up When last guest left they tried to charge her for breakfasts every morning She replied that she was told that all was paid and assured them we had not eaten breakfast We weren t charged The hotel made things right by my reservation but I am not sure i would stay again Most of the staff was very nice and helpful , The hotel was close to tube station and the area was safe 
8926,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, We were allowed to check in an hour early with no fuss We just used the hotel as a base for somewhere to read charge on the evening The stay was pleasant and would not think twice about returning 
8927,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bathroom was like a coffin and not a clean one at that The entrance of the hotel was lovely but the rest was awful you could have been in a Travel lodge and saved some pennies Very noisy at the front of the hotel , The bed was comfy and it was right next to Hyde Park and Queensway tube 
8928,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, As the no disturbe ight was on at the room door they STILL called me in the middle of the morning to offer room cleaning EVERY MONDAY MORNING or so they said the hotel has a FIRE DRILL Advanced warning could have been great so guests are not scared to death when it happens and nobody answers the phone at the reception , Staff and location The lobby looks great The hotel has elevator and air conditioning 
8929,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was modern but very small for 2 people 2 lrg suitcase only 1 would fit lying down There was no lift very narrow staircase no porter also no fridge , Good location close to train station easy walk to Oxford Street Bathroom was great very modern 
8930,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room could have been a bit bigger but it was enough for us for a short break, Great Location We stayed here for the Notting Hill Carnival which was walking distance Very close to the tube Staff were all very helpful Let us leave our bags in the luggage room come back to get things out of them later Staff couldn t do enough Nice clean bathroom 
8931,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Some of the staff is not fluent in English but they do try to be professional , For the money I thought the room could ve been a little bit bigger there was barely enough space to walk around the bed the bathroom was great the breakfast buffet was good but I got food poisoning from the room service food late one night The bedroom walls were all dirty and the trim needed a paint job Needs new wallpaper quite badly and the woodwork throughout the whole body of the place is long overdue for a full restoration I read that it was last done in 1972 so it has a bit of a tired feel The location was OK except for trying to get out to a good club but to be fair there was one in the area that just happened to be closed for an event it s colourful there and it was nice to enjoy the park
8932,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bedrooms are very small and the staff are too courteous LoL , The bed was clean very comfortable and a big king size the bathroom was clean perfect I ve stayed many times in different Hotels in London some are bloody noisy in the morning with rubbish trucks or noisy kitchens below this Hotel was OK Great location for the City busses and the Tube Remember if you are over 65 bring your bus pass from home I m from Liverpool we could use ours for free bus trips after 9 30am
8933,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Service on arrival felt that the staff member on reception was rude we arrived after 2pm and the room wasn t ready so we has to wait , Location was great
8934,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Long narrow maze of hallways and repeating corners to access rooms , Beautifully crafted historic structure elegant sitting room and bar Carved stairway leaded glass windows with window seats cocktail bar and high tea available a fresh bowl of apples at reception every day And bathtubs 
8935,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Booking through booking com did not give a breakfast option at 15 pounds per person times three people times three days this was quite significant booking directley through the hotel would have had breakfast included at the same rate, Public rooms were very impressive and comfortable the location was great Kensington gardens across the road and two underground stations within minutes staff helpful in arranging theatre tickets
8936,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Clean an tidy but rooms walls are dirty and scratched room were small check in was late and hotel stuff didn t feel brothered about it so at end of oure trip I m not happy about place were I stayed in But location is really good , Good but not value for money 
8937,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I did not like being at the front of the hotel We stayed for a few days at the back of the hotel and returned from a trip to be put at the front Nicer view but no sleep as you can really hear the drunks shouting in the street, The service was excellent and staff very professional and very accommodating when we had to move hotels because of a burst boiler
8938,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The fruit bowl was limited There was only an orange banana and an apple , Loved the comfy bed Had a great night sleep The staff were very friendly 
8939,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, The location was excellent staff very friendly the bed was very nice the bathroom was extremely tiny and room considering that we were given an upgrade was very small 
8940,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing, Last minute deal that made staying here affordable for an overnight trip and the hotel lived up to its marketing as an executive environment Very plush with great staff 
8941,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, A tiny noisy room VERY deceptively photographed , The breakfast booked the preceding night but forgotten was good when it finally arrived Comfy bed 
8942,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Size of the rooms is small and I don t think management can now do anything about it , Location of the hotel and the attitude response of the staff Simply marvelous 
8943,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I didn t like the fact that the sink and bath wouldn t drain properly and would fill up and you would have to wait half an hour for the sink to drain , Friendly staff very helpful Rooms were very nice and tidy 
8944,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was a bit small the bathtub did not have a door or shower curtain so the whole bathroom got all wet from a shower also no fan in the bathroom the wifi was fine but not the greatest the USB port the room came with did not even work, The hotel was very close to Hyde Park and a lot of restaurants with 2 tube stations one street over excellent location the staff was nice
8945,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Big room Big bathroom, The room not same on booking Very small Bathroom very small Supreiuer room not comfort and very small and not occupied couple Internet good
8946,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We were given the broken boiler story too and they tried to move us to another hotel until I asked for the price difference to be refunded we paid 158 and the sister hotel was advertised at 107 we were suddenly found an available room at the current hotel Also the room smelt of drains sewage, Breakfast was great as was the history of the hotel
8947,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Tiny bathroom to be honest not suitable for the price of offer also very odd window blinds in our room meant there was never any daylight which i didn t like, Great location quiet yet very central Good staff on reception clean and comfortable rooms and a nice character hotel with the lily Langtry history
8948,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The presentation of the hotel is quite dark and dower the family rooms leave a lot to be desired saying it is small is a little bit of an understatement and also the room was very tired and needs total redecoration , The hotel was conveniently located close to a main tube and good car park so we were able to avoid the congestion charge and not have too far to walk for the hotel 
8949,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I was sorry to leave but God willing I ll be able to swing by The Grand Royale before I leave , I like cozy places so I was right at home The staff was helpfull and very kind it was my birthday when I arrived and they brought me a complimentary box of chocolates and a bottle of Merlot 
8950,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, It took them almost half a hour to check me in and in that time 3 people complained who were not in front of me but were still served first I was ignored until I complained,No Positive
8951,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was very small There was hardly any room to stand between the bed and the window For the price we paid I would have expected breakfast to be included , The staff were attentive friendly and helpful It was in a good location ideal for the tube The facilities in the room were good 
8952,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Checking out , Excellent location 20 mins from st Pancras Lovely clean and comfortable rooms A great choice for breakfast hot or cold Staff lovely kind and helpful A brilliant last minute find and we will be coming back here again and again Special thanks to Ankur for looking after us 
8953,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bathroom was too small I m small and struggled but my 6 2 partner found it far too cramped The staff gave an arriving guest the wrong key our room number so we had someone opening our door in the morning when when we were getting ready and didn t really appreciate that , The bed and pillows were very comfortable Great location 
8954,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The shower screen in our room was not big enough had to point the shower head at the bathroom wall and be careful moving so that water did not splash off me STill ended up with a pool of water on the floor and the toilet Had a bath the next day to avoid the hassle , The history of the building and original features in the public rooms were fantastic 
8955,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We ll typical of London hotels Small rooms though it s a 4 star Bathroom dilemma no shower curtain the glass division was soo small thats why when u take a shower the whole bathroom is wet There s a smell stink but tolerable this matter was brought to the attention of the management They offer us to transfer to other room we we re at the basement then , Location wise very accessible to public transport near hyde park kensington park The Staff were all accommodating The hotel itself tells a lot of History Breakfast buffet is excellent 
8956,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, When we arrived for a late night check in we were told that we were being moved to one of its sister hotels 15 minutes away The boiler had broken in the hotel They did not call us in advance and advise us of this problem They also had us sign a paper committing us to full 4 night reservation prior to disclosing the facility s maintenance issues and being required to move We were then transported at 11 p m to the other hotel where we were told we had to pay for the full 4 night stay without inspection of the room or area At that hour we had no choice but to make the payment We were then stuck in a basement apartment and all of the attractions we planned to visit were a 20 minute rail ride away We asked to be moved to a higher level family room and they were unable to support the request We called booking com to express our concern but were only told that we were committed to the reservation and had to stay at one of these two hotels We then agreed to be moved back to original one with the preferred location Around 1 p m the next day we were moved back to the original hotel Although I was told by the hotel s management that the room was located on the 2nd level and was lovely and would comfortably hold a couple with an 11 year old child the room was tiny Much much smaller than most small European rooms Worse yet it was filthy dirty The carpet walls windowsills and pullout couch were obviously soiled The courtyard area where the room looked out on was filthy also with garbage laying outside We have pictures to support this description It was shocking that we were not released from the reservation We have used booking com in the past but NEVER AGAIN They should have helped us to find an appropriate hotel even if it cost us an additional investment , The location and buffet breakfast were OK The staff seemed to care that we were incredibly disappointed about how we were treated and the poor condition of the tiny room we were required to stay in But they did nothing to release us from the reservation 
8957,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Beautiful hotel great staff the Manager himself made sure all my requests were in place the staff was so helpful and mannered The location is great close to everything 
8958,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, No comment , WOW The main lobby and reception area looks Gergian Victorian and Edwardian style Good location for everything very close to the Bayswater Queens Underground Train Station and walking distance to Paddington Train Station Lots of restaurants to choose very near also close to Hyde Park that you can relate with the nature and get some fresh air The place is quiete and peaceful and very relax at Room 115 The staffs are friendly and helpful The buffet breakfast was excellent I had a healthy breakfast option This four star hotel is highly recommended Well done keep it up the excellent service folks 
8959,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms are little small , Beautiful lobby kind personal comfortable bed Breakfast is good served at glamourous interior Location is very close to Hyde Park with a lot of small restaurants around 
8960,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We arrived after a long journey only to be told they were going to transfer us to one of their sister hotels in Paddington When we objected they miraculously found a room for us , The foyer is beautiful early 1900 s with wooden panelling and stained glass windows This was why I selected this hotel as it has character 
8961,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We were in a lower ground floor room with a window looking out to steps that go up to street level which was fine but the steps area had some building materials pallets etc lying there which could have been moved out of view Shower was a bit small but fine to use , Free coffee on arrival was a very nice touch Lovely wood panelled public rooms giving a nice comfortable old fashioned club atmosphere Our room was cosy but contemporary and very comfortable Being lower ground floor this was expected and reflected in the price 
8962,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Not happy with bookings com my reservation was excepted got to hotel and we had to stay somewhere else didn t have a choice in the matter as we had already travelled to London so there was no going back This wasn t the hotels fault ,No Positive
8963,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms were very small and they only service the room for your arrival then after your departure Though in saying this i actually asked them to service it while we were out and they did Only other negative wos that they gave us keys to a room already occupied so we walked in on another couple , Beautiful old world style building and very curtious staff accces to the main attractions of london wos very easy and pleanty of bars and Caff just around the corner 
8964,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bathroom coiuld have been cleaned a little better each day , The welcome the nice gestures the friendly helpful staff the wonderful breakfast the location the beautiful building The room was very adequate for my granddaughter and me The bathroom is small but very modern 
8965,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was like a box literally no windows couldn t swing a kitten Very claustrophobic would not consider staying here again , Dining room and reception areas
8966,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The area isn t as nice as the hotel but beyond the hotels control, Lovley place great helpful staff went out of their way to make us comfortable The room was superb I wouldnt think twice on booking again
8967,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bathroom was VERY tiny Not even a proper sink No breakfast included , Location is good just outside Hyde Park Walking distance 30 min from the city centre Very accomodating staff members 
8968,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, They overbooked the hotel when we arrived there was a large gap under the door which made us feel the room was lacking in privacy the bathroom was actually caked in dust under the sink I saw this because I dropped a soap The shower didn t have a curtain or screen so water gushed everywhere the shower head also didn t stay in place everything about the place felt cheap and budget the rooms are tiny and it felt unclean I would have rather stayed in a holiday inn or premier inn worst hotel I ve ever stayed at , Beds were soft breakfast selection and variety was good
8969,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Not all single rooms have a bathtub showers in some singles are very small by US standards normal for UK though , Walking distance to many good restaurants Hyde Park 3 minute walk to Underground Rooms were very very clean both times I stayed Felt pretty safe walking alone at night in this area felt that premises room were secure And it s pretty 
8970,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bathroom was clean The 4 shower screen not a joke was hilarious and pointless and meant your shower contributed to a flooded floor each morning , Room was a shoe box So small couldn t use the dressing table as was up against the bed and was a struggle to open dresser drawer to get hairdryer Carpet wasn t the cleanest One key for room with 2 guests Bar closed at 11pm Main sitting area closed off for magic show you had to pay to go to 
8971,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was very small Also we would have loved to have dined in the restaurant but it is only open fur breakfast This is a real shame as I m sure it would be a lovely place to eat , This is a beautiful hotel with some amazing features and a superb bar 
8972,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms far too small booked a superior room but nothing superior about it Bed was hard pillows were hard no sheets only a duvet that had seen better days Shower leaked all over the bathroom due to inadequate screen , Staff friendly Breakfast was nice but felt should have been included for the room price Also weren t told by reception if you pre booked the day before it was 10 instead of 15 
8973,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I couldn t actually like anything as my partner checked in and was told we had been moved to a sister hotel down the road The entrance was more like a budget hostel the room was so tiny the bed was against the wall so we had to climb over each other to get out After a sleepless night we selected the table in the basement breakfast room with the least damp coming through the wall Absolutely disgusted at our treatment ,No Positive
8974,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We were moved hotels due to an electrical fault I understand this was out of the hotels control but the alternative accommodation was not in such a good location I d been looking forward to a drink in the grand looking reception area and a short walk to Hyde park , The alternative accommodation was sorted fast
8975,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was not very clean and was extremely hot couldn t open a window We were upgraded but it was a tiny room with a small bed There were cracks in the tiles it was in desperate need of a refurbishment, They provided what I had requested which was a nice gesture 
8976,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, A very small room but it was clean , Very friendly and helpful receptionists Specially one guy who worked in the evening I forgot his name He knows how to take care of the customers 
8977,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, On arrival I was sent to another hotel down the road by the girl on reception as there was a problem with the boiler and my room was not available Although I asked for another room I was told there wasn t one that I would have to go to another hotel down the street for the first night that was of an equivalent standard When I got to the other hotel it was nothing like the one I d paid for and was 90AUD cheaper per night I asked to be transferred back to the hotel I d paid for they did have another room the gentleman on the desk was very apologetic This all could have been avoided was very upsetting at the time Fridge would be handy , I like the beautiful old world feel of this hotel respect for the character of the building The service at breakfast was excellent The staff were generally friendly and professional My room was lovely and very comfortable The location is very good 
8978,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room very tight to work around the bed and bathroom tight Was expecting an iron in the room , Location was good and close to central landmarks Staff at reception pleasant and helpful Facilities good in the room
8979,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Basement room disappointing not represented in the advertised pictures , Great location nice little bar Welcoming staff with good service skills 
8980,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Difficult to move around the room as the area around the bed was a bit tight , The building is beautiful old style with lots of carved wood and leaded glass Natural light in the bathroom which was modern and super clean No dinner available in the restaurant but there are loads of places for dinner and breakfast also if you want just a minute s walk away The hotel is on a really quiet street with a busy one around the corner Not just one but two tube stations a minute or two away 
8981,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The new hotel was in an area where we did not want to be The hotel was fine apart from its location , We were transferred to another hotel by free taxi Given free drinks in the bar whilst we waited for taxi 
8982,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, No TV remote in room Single room so tiny Maybe I am naive but I still think 100 is a lot for a single basement room with no breakfast , Bathroom was the nicest I have seen in a while Good breakfast Too many tables crammed in though Nice quiet area Round the corner from two underground stations and two lines Jubilee and Central Would definitely book again 
8983,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Very small room eapecially as it was a club deluxe Very small bathroom could hardly move and staff customer service was not particularly friendly The reception area looked tired , Tidy clean room Comfortable bed good air conditioning and nice bedding Nice touch of complimentary chocolates fruit and wine 
8984,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room size and access wasn t the best small with steep steps but it didn t detract from the positives I would still stay again, The Hotel is a grand old building and this quirkyness has been retained The staff were very helpful The rooms clean and beds comfortable
8985,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Fortunately we are not big people other wise the bedroom would have been hopeless about 12incs around either side so my husband just managed it The receptionist suggested we mention this in future , Excellent location with 2 tubes handy Lovely breakfast very helpful staff who for us went the extra mile where our son was concerned as he had ridden the London race and his bike got taken care of and fruit provided Very willingly 
8986,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, To be honest our stay was a nightmare from start to finish We arrived at the hotel to be told that someone had been trying to contact us they hadn t and that we were being moved to a cheaper different hotel when we had picked this one due to its beauty My husband had to complain that we were still being charged the original price and being moved to a cheaper room so we were upgraded but the staff kept changing their mind about where we were going to be staying first telling us to move then that we were staying then again that we were moving We had to complain to get upgraded to a suitable room in the other hotel and the staff were disorganised and slow I am hugely disappointed as this was our wedding anniversary , The building is very beautiful 
8987,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room and en suite were very small for two adults I lay on the bed with the suitcase to give floor space to my wife Standing in a bath on a non slip mat to shower is not acceptable nowadays Booking com not the hotel website lists parking beware this hotel does not have parking however I was directed by reception to a nearby underground carpark , Comfy bed great choice and quality at the buffet breakfast AC and shower work well en suite bathroom is cramped Reception staff were friendly and courteous Great location 
8988,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was smaller than appeared in pictures and there were steps inside the room entry way which are a tripping hazard Interior of hotel is beautiful but worn in places , Two best things about this hotel is that it is extremely near 3 Underground stations and that it was immediately across from Hyde Park 
8989,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was very small and cramped although en suite was adequate Housekeeping staff slam doors constantly during the afternoon , Air conditioning in the room was fantastic Comfy bed and good pillows Breakfast was splendid 
8990,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The single room although they said they had upgraded it to their largest single for my birthday was still but rather small and claustrophobic very hot You would not want to linger too long in that confined space, I loved the hotels history and its sumptuously embellished original features especially the theatre bar where I met my three guests who had also booked suites with you for champagne to celebrate my birthday and your amazing staircase It was good value for money and Its location was central close to the tube station and perfect for exploring Kensington Gardens and palace and the Royal Albert Hall The staff were very friendly and accommodating and had left me chocolates and a fruit basket for my birthday and did not make a charge for breakfast 
8991,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, There was a slightly bad smell in the second room We didn t say anything as we were not in the room very much and were so glad to have the bigger room , Staff was friendly When my sister in law and I found our twin room too tiny to move around in they accommodated us and gave us a bigger room after the first night Our favorite part was the hot chocolate in the room and this electric tea pot that boiled water amazingly fast Loved the free wifi too The hotel s location was close to subway stations too which was very nice 
8992,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Incredibly small room So much so that we were a a couple with two medium size suitcases between us and it was too tight to have both on a stand each and the two of us bending over repacking without bumping into one another Can t swing a cat Or pack a suitcase, Lovely decor downstairs The theatre bar was quaint to 
8993,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, the lock on room door was broken window latch broken, exceptionally polite friendly helpful staff beautiful historic building with many original features very good breakfast comfortable bed and pillows Ideal location for events in Hyde Park

8996,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Asked for upgrade twin club got a double and at 11 pm had to try to split the twins and reset the room it was in the basement they offered to move us but after unpacking it was too much of a hassle they did give an apology note water and fruit in our room the next day, Near queens way tube
8997,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Needs a smartening up of its appearance But then it s in Bayswater not Mayfair , The photos in booking com give the impression of a delightful old hotel It isn t It s a bit down at heel in need of refurbishment The dark wood panelling in the reception area is a little gloomy and depressing Not a bright start The room was tiny although clean and comfortable Small but immaculately clean bathroom with a low pressure shower You don t really get a lot for your money here 
8998,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Pillow and bed too hard and room too confined especially bathroom However upon request they gave me a soft pillow Nice if sports had been shown on TV but available at nearby pubs, Hotel and room very clean and well maintained staff very helpful and pleasant Staff very service oriented Very convenient location
8999,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Small room with a small bed But slept well with extra comforter , The Grand Royale is very handy to transportation It was nicely updated and had lovely period decor in the common areas Air conditioned 
9000,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Slightly small bedroom but I guess that is London , The location next to underground and Hyde Park was ideal for us The staff were very helpful and polite We had just got engaged and so they kindly had a card fruit wine and chocolates in our bedroom as a gift Been many places and could not fault it Wonderful air conditioning in room Beautiful historical hotel 
9001,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms average size but had all facilities , The reception staff were amazing Some of the best customer service have received as an extensive traveller Conceige also extremely helpful at all times Lovely bar and loung area Location cannot be beaten for being close to Hyde park and shopping Excellent overall experience and value for money 
9002,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Price is on the expensive side but you get what you pay for which is a fantastic hotel , Breakfast was great but a tad expensive Staff were very friendly and helpful despite how busy the hotel was at that time The room was amazing extremely comfortable and modern The hotel is in a great location as it is very close to buses on Bayswater Road close to Bayswater and Queensway underground and easy to walk across Hyde Park 
9003,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Despite paying for an upgrade the room was extremely small There was only a narrow staircase leading to the first floor and corridors leading to the room were a tight squeeze , Bed very comfy room was clean and location was good 
9004,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms a bit cramped no fridge marked walls furniture in the room interfering works yard below the window, Grandeur of the entrance lounge bar
9005,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Our room was tiny i found some difficulties moving around inside the room but I guess it was the value for money condition , Located by Hyde Park Very touristy area AROUND 25 minutes walk from 3 major museums and at least 3 major attractions like palaces and stuff tube station 2 minutes walk lots of shops Beautiful interiors of lobby and restaurant areas carved wooden stairs big luxurious chimneys leather seats and sofas in common lobby rooms 
9006,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, There was some issue at the hotel and on our first night we had to sleep in a partner hotel of theirs Though the quality was good the atmosphere of the room and breakfast area were not on par and we did not enjoy it that much We did return to our original hotel for the second night and were happier there , The rooms were clean Breakfast was a great variety and staff were very friendly 
9007,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I tried to ask the reception staff for restaurant recommendations in London which they seemed to know little about , Beautiful interiors even better than the photos provided The rooms are clean and comfortable with all amenities requested provided 
9008,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, They stuck us in the basement For 1 444 for 5 nights they could not give us at least first floor The wifi did not work in the basement very well so for a week I could not comfortably contact friends and family in the states after a long day The desk people were very snooty and the tickets they booked for shows and attractions we could have bought cheaper anywhere else Do not book anything with them or believe their advice on anything I had to figure everything out on my own very hard to do with no wifi They advertised an airport shuttle but no they do not have one false advertising Cost 45 00 pounds to get to the airport All they offer is a bed a bathroom and a pretty lobby The women at the desk seemed to not have a clue about anything in their city and seemed quite content to just stand there and give bad advice Maybe if you looked like their next suger daddy they would fawn all over you but if you are a woman from the USA Forgetaboutit , Bed was comfy Room was very clean Nice it was close to two tube stations 
9009,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Interesting hotel with a history of it having being a wealthy occupancy over the past decades The lovely unaltered appearance of Victorian era as approaching the entrance and within to the reception area door staff to welcome you in politely and with its own mini private theatre now a small busy and comfortable bar but retaining the unchanged decor of that period We had a small bedroom but clean and as we were only sleeping it was adequate Staff were very polite helpful and as we observed very patient Good position with tube station very close Queensway Hyde Park opposite which is always a lovely walk through for Landmarks ie Kensington Palace Serpentine Diana memorial water feature Nearby restaurants with many tastes catered for Good choice in London 
9010,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I was extremely annoyed that the bill did NOT add up yo the number of days times the rate displayed by booking com The rate changes as the week progresses WARNING, The staff were wonderful and like all hotels sometimes too busy but service was excellent 
9011,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was supposed to be a Superior Double room it wasn t at all The window wouldn t open properly and we complained they wanted to give us another romm but as we had so Little time there we didn t want to move as our days were planned You could hardly walk next to hat ebed to get to the window or get into bed For this price not including breakfast the Hotel was very unsatisfactory A terrible cheek I would definitely want some money back I would never go to this Hotel again they are cheats , The breafast was very good and the personal there were also very good They cater for people eating gluten free So that was good I wrote and asked them about this per e mail but got NO Reply 
9012,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Sunday morning breakfast manic busy Staff were great but other guests who could see people waiting just sat and enjoyed their 3rd helping of food guys it s not an all you can eat Other rude quests who think they are too important to queue at check out desk, Nice little extras wine chocolates and fruit Friendly staff mostly 
9013,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, There were steps in our room right after you enter it Do request for another room if this is of inconvenience to you Otherwise this is a great hotel to stay , The room was of decent size The bed was very comfortable and the staff accommodated to our requests 
9014,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Standard rooms are so small that two people need to carefully choreograph their moves to get dressed or go to the restroom , Excellent location Staff was very helpful For example we booked a tour through the hotel There was a miscommunication between the vendor and the hotel on where we would be picked up for the tour We had to take a taxi to catch up with the tour and the hotel compensated us for the taxi fare Breakfast at the hotel was excellent

9019,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I didn t like that I got a flower delivery that was never delivered to my room and that when my friend called to inquire no staff member thought to check delivery room flowers were found after I went home money lost for my friend who sent them, I loved location and decor of lobby and downstairs rooms
9020,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I stayed 2 nights all was fine Left to go to Peaks region When returned was notified my 2 night reservation was cancelled Was told by staff my credit card was rejected It was same card that was used 2 nights for earlier stay Had a hassle getting rebooked at different hotel Found out later from another guest that hotel had water leak and needed to move customers to different hotel Did not appreciate being told my credit card was the problem when clearly it was not ,No Positive
9021,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was too small and the linen had several pubic hairs stuck to the sheets which made feel very sick I am not sure if the sheets had been changed from the previous guest , Staff
9022,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The fact they took the money from my bank account several days prior to our arrival Especially when it was said we can pay at the hotel upon arrival And then having to wait days for any refunds to be put back into our bank account , Easy access to Hyde Park and the tube stations 
9023,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, For the price of 168 for one night to be told that this did not include breakfast was shocking although when I complained the manager did allow us to have breakfast Also the photos of a Superior double room on the website did not live up to the reality of a very small drab room where there was barely enough room to walk around the bed There is more room and comfort in a budget hotel than this and as it was a birthday treat for my daughter we were very disappointed We won t ever come here again and it was not worth the money I will go with the budget option next time ,No Positive
9024,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Sent to Park Grand Paddington Hotel Room was very small No cupboard space No fridge No iron Bed made in the am but bathroom not cleaned or towels changed No mini bar Very very disappointed Not given a discount considering we paid almost double to stay at the Grand Royale Hype Park compared to the hotel we were sent too for 2 nights , Really were looking forward to staying at this hotel told boiler had broken and sent to another hotel Park Grand Paddington Hote no character or history 
9025,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Be careful when booking the total I paid by far exceeded the sum of the days times booking com s price it went up and up each day quite unfair to a trusting soul who did not add up my own bill before clicking Warning to others , All the staff were very lovely and helpful and polite This place is a historic gem 
9026,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, The staff and in particular Louanne were utterly accommodating in every way We were there to celebrate both a special birthday and anniversary and we were treated like royalty The little extras included a bottle of wine and basket of fruit and free upgrade Lovely touches which were greatly appreciated 
9027,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room very small and we had to wait almost an hour for sandwiches when we ordered room service the manager did say sorry for this in the morning to be fair but no good to us as we were very hungry the night before we also went to the bar for a night cap and they had no bailys cream so we went to our room very disappointed , location

9030,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bar closed at 11 and the barman did not ask anyone if they would like more drinks the bar was full he proceeded to close the shutter and walk out Would of liked notice more revenue for the hotel as most of the residents would of purchased another drink , Reception staff excellent My partner and I were celebrating an anniversary and the reception put a fruit basket wine in the room and rose petals on the bed Excellent service throughout our stay

9032,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The so called Superior Double Room that was booked turned out to be the smallest room we have ever stayed in for a hotel which was not satisfactory for the price we paid although on the door it stated Club Room and not a superior room Also we checked in at 11 00 hr and returned at 23 15 hr to be told that there was a minimum of a 1 hour wait for our baggage to be taken to our room when they had all day to do this knowing what our room number was once cleaned and available We also once in the room and the hour was up had to call reception twice to find out when our bags would be delivered , Nothing to shout out about 
9033,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was tiny No where near what I would expect from a superior room Been in London premier Inn s that were literally twice the size , Character and style of the hotel was really nice 
9034,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Paid for a double superior room but it certainly did not feel like a superior Had to walk down a flight of stairs to get to the bedroom and there was hardly any space to move around The price of the room was too much for what we had ,No Positive

9036,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was tiny Very disappointed Completely different from the pictures, Hotel was lovely from the outside and reception Friendly staff Great location
9037,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Price View from bedroom Over a noisy and untidy back yard , Very expensive for a tiny room You get a bigger room in a Travelodge for a quarter of the price Over rated and over priced 
9038,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The staff never smiled and only ever said 3 words to me the whole time I was there I also got a poor view of their ventilation system For the money I paid I did not deserve a view of their ventilation , It was a very pretty place and just right around the corner from a beautiful park and easy to hop on the Underground to get to places 
9039,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room is way too small including the bathroom Lighting was also poor , Lovely soft bed and the buffet breakfast in the restaurant The theatre bar also looked great but was not open when we where there

9041,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, A little tired needs an up grade But must retain character Our superior room had little floor space no chairs to sit on no space by the bed You had to get on the bed from the front Surely you can t call this superior But still liked the overhaul character , Beautiful building and great location 
9042,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room is small and there s no elevator to the 8th floor , Very good location Comfort bed Nice and kind staff Quiet and well designed Just a few walk to Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace 
9043,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, They left us outside of the room one day before check out because we have been told that we hadn t paid at the check in when they forgot to Ask us for the entire payment and asked for the first night After many discussions with the hotel manager we have been allowed access to the room They said they tryed to reach us via phone many Times and this is absolutelly false, Location very close to two tube station

9046,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room 704 was very small for a double The bed was barely a double and there was hardly any space around the bed There was a very shallow single wardrobe which was of little use The bathroom sink was so impractical that water went everywhere when you tried to use it This should not be classed as a 4 star hotel in my opinion The Reception staff seemed more interested in having a good time than in helping guests , The Reception area was quite attractive 
9047,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I think we were downgraded to the basement even though booking was for a deluxe double The receptionist mumbled something about it when we checked in The room and en suite were tiny but clean , The reception area was stunning Lily Langtry vibe was lovely 
9048,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was far too small even for London standards You could not leave the case stand up as there was no where physically to put it a few feet more in the rooms would be less greedy this was a superior room , Good location staff were very friendly and helpful God breakfast quality 
9049,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Had to change rooms due to being put in what almost seemed like a cupboard with no window and no room for our luggage being six months pregnant this wasn t acceptable as the room was very stuffy so we asked to change rooms new room was more spacious with a window but did have dirty marks on wall and very hard bed which was uncomfortable , Staff very friendly and attentive bathroom lovely Tea and coffee facilities topped up every day and fruit provided Good location just round the corner from the tube 
9050,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bed was uncomfy Room was very small even though I booked a deluxe Certain areas in need of decoration No extractor fan in bathroom and it floods when in shower due to small screen , Hotel was very clean and it was an ideal location for Hyde Park also it is closer to Kensington Gardens

9054,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was very small despite being upgraded We did move to a similar grade room with a different layout but still short on space But never mind we were there to attend a concert and sightseeing London is amazing The black cab drivers were so friendly and chatty made us laugh , The decor was very impressive throughout Staff were helpful and friendly All was clean 
9055,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, On the day we were to check in I missed a call at 11am letting me know that due to a boiler issue our booking would be transferred to a sister hotel in Paddington for our entire stay Having googled this boiler issue I found that many other previous guests had the same experience noting that in their experience this was in fact an overbooking issue rather than any boiler Upon arrival at the hotel I was told that a taxi would be called for us and we could check in at the sister hotel I asked if there was a member of management I could speak to about this matter I expressed my dissatisfaction and how the substitute hotel was not somewhere that I had chosen to stay I also cited the many booking com reviews about this boiler that I had found I was told that this was just something that happened to the 2 hotel boilers please note that guests were both checking in and out during this time After causing quite a fuss at reception the hotel found us a room in the hotel one would imagine that this would have been done in the first instance rather than relocating a guest However I was happy that my original booking had then been honoured , Location was great with easy transport links

9085,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Very small cosy bedroom bathroom , Beautiful building Friendly reception staff and barman We didn t have breakfast so cant comment on restaurant The location is super near tube stations 
9086,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Everything Did not enjoy my 2 nights stay and wouldn t recommend to anyone I was on business so my company was paying if I had to use my own money I woukd give it a rating of minus 10 Not a happy customer,No Positive
9087,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Did not have any evening service in restaurant also the menue for room service was very limited, The barman victor always made you feel welcome in the lounge bar
9088,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I don t think guests should be offered a discount just to pre book breakfast anyone paying to stay should be offered breakfast at the same price , Location and access to Tube
9089,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Small rooms I mean very smell we couldn t even walk around the bed and that s all the space we had Impossible to get undressed or move about Bathroom was even worse We did get a refund on our breakfast due to complaining about our room , Great staff Great Breakfast 
9090,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, There was no changing room or area in the toilets for guests who had already booked out and had baggage stored for the day , The decor wood panels and bar area were superb The bedroom was a little on the small size but it modern and comfy Very good breakfast 
9091,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Don t be disillusioned by the pretty pictures Staff was rather rude to us and lacked complete understanding of english language None of the staff appeared to be native speakers Room was extremely small and we had to use a stairs to get from bathroom to sleeping area which also makes the space advertised as larger than it really is Even being a very slim person myself I couldn t reach the other side of the bed without moving the furniture Window could not be opened as it was half covered by the balcony wall and floor The air conditioning was very dusty , the location was good with an easy underground connection to major landmarks also the lobby was impressive Bathroom facilities were okay but very small 
9092,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The superior room which we were supposed to have was a little small and the 6 or 7 steps down to the bathroom were a little inconvenient but not so bad as to spoil our stay , This hotel was a surprise from the moment we walked through the door The staff were very friendly and helpful and the Theatre Bar has to be seen to be believed Breakfast was fine and the location near Queensway station was excellent for all areas of central London We shall consider this hotel again when looking to stay in London 
9093,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The mattress was ok but not as comfortable as it could be I cannot recommend this hotel for those with ambulatory issues because there is no access other than stairs at the entrance There were also stairs to enter my room but I understand there are other rooms without Otherwise a hidden gem , Staff service was excellent Very helpful with restaurant recommendations directions and use of umbrella Location was great around the corner from the Central Line Tube stop Very quiet 
9094,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The price we paid for our stay we were disappointed with the room we thought it was on the small side and the bathroom was compact Also for the price I think breakfast should have been included , The bed was comfortable there was a free safe very clean room not far from the tube station local shops and restaurants 
9095,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I cannot fault this hotel at all , Everything was amazing from the welcoming attitude of the staff to the breakfast in bed and the room My best stay in London so far and I m regularly travelling to London for leisure with friends family A fantastic first experience in London for my partner too especially being in the suite with the 4 poster bed Even asked for some rose petals and a bottle of prosecco to be in the room on arrival soppy I know and everything was a fantastic surprise for my partner Fantastic location right next to the tube station in central London great restaurants and small shops cash point in the neighbouring street and all for an amazing price 100 recommend and would definitely stay again 
9096,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was on the lower level and was very small and the bathroom was tiny The shower stall was 2 x 2 My 6 3 husband could barely stand up in it and it would have been impossible for him to raise his arms to wash his hair So ridiculous Not worth over 200 a night , The hotel lobby and sitting areas are very impressive but the room was a major disappointment 
9097,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was tiny and had to enter up staircase immediately inside room door and shower sprayed all over bathroom due to tiny shower screen, Very ornate interior but not as grand as it looks online
9098,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was very small and the green security light over the door was much too bright I could not sleep because of this , The bed was comfortable and the room was very quiet The staff were helpful and courteous The hotel was located in a quiet street and close to the tube station 
9099,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Very friendly staff nice room but very small bathroom Stayed in for one night only but would recommended to anyone Very good location very close to underground station Quensway and Kensigton Gardens

9102,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bathroom was really small hate small bathrooms but then we only really slept in the room so weren t there really as we were out all day , Loved my bed very comfortable just didn t like it being in the basement breakfast was really brilliant everything you could want to eat either hot or continental 
9103,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I expected to get body lotion and had to purchase some at a nearby store Only shower gel and shampoo was provided , Location setting and decor as well as a clean and comfortable room View when requested Coffee and tea making facilites in the room 
9104,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Friendly staff comfortable room sparkling clean bathroom Stayed for one night on business and feel this is great value for money not the lap of luxury but had everything you need 
9105,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room we stayed in was in need of a bit of a refurb The wallpaper looked tatty and blinds were broken this was a little disappointing and I did contemplate asking to be moved However we were on a tight schedule for the day so didn t want to get upset over it Rooms are very small , The staff were all SO helpful and very nice They all made us feel extremely welcome and were very attentive They also put a card with some chocolates and fruit in our room as it was my partners birthday something I had only mentioned over email beforehand when trying to find a restaurant for the evening of our stay this was a lovely touch The hotel its self is beautiful and in a great location right next to Hyde Park A short 3 minute walk to Queensway Tube Station and a 6 or 7 minute walk to Bayswater Tube Station So very easily accessible It also only takes around 10 15 minutes to get to the hotel from Euston bonus The value for money is great 
9106,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, the lavatory is incredibly small I was living in the room 114 which is a so called club room If you are a big guy and right handed you will absolutely find it difficult cleaning yourself after using the toilet,No Positive

9109,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, On arrival had to wait to check in and was then asked to move to another hotel I firmly refused and was promptly allocated a room I asked staff to confirm my booking of a superior double would be honoured I was told it would be Room so small I had to climb over bed to get into it It was however comfortable and I will no doubt use the hotel again even though I am still not sure if the room I got was a superior double How small must a standard double be , Location
9110,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I found the room a bit cold and the thermostat did not seem to be controlled from the room , Nice and Quiet and yet close to the trains and Heyd park Very Clean 
9111,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The only negative is that the restaurant is not open in the evening but there are plenty of eateries nearby, Having stayed at the hotel many times I like the attentiveness of the staff cleanliness of the rooms central location breakfast choice and valu for money
9112,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Towels were so rough they exfoliate with every use Sheets could use some fabric softener too , Great location Walked in Hyde Park every evening after dining at numerous restaurants nearby All varieties of food Indian Chinese Italian Malaysian Starbucks too 
9113,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Noise from fellow guests unhappy baby next door , Comfortable stay in a very central location Nice clean environment well maintained by staff who are very helpful Room certainly compact although it provides all the space required Wonderful central location for access to attractions and good food 
9114,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing, The staff were excellent in this busy hotel which clearly has a Scottish family history Breakfast was excellent plenty of staff available to bring tea coffee and a great choice aswell My stay was booked last minute and it will not be my last The location was just round the corncer form Queensway tube great London hotel
9115,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We were very disappointed in the size of the room even though we chose a superior double room also very disappointed in view from our window which was a very scruffy block of flats, Wonderful choice of breakfast beautiful frontage and reception area 
9116,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, A room that was a matchbox for my money Superior room NOT Dirty nets Curtains dated Decor untidy paintwork shabby and marked scuff marks No water in room for a 4star hotel Website very misleading have you seen the rooms on the 7 th floor wouldn t put my pet up there Would not recommended this hotel even with my last breath I felt I wasted my money and time staying there it was disgusting for a four star hotel The entrance is one big front and not in a good way Shaftsbury Hotels Will not ever be on my list to stay in ever again ,No Positive
9117,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, only a little point the shower screen in our room could of been a little bigger to avoid wetting the floor so much, this hotel was full of history and wonderful decor and original fixtures staff were very helpful and made us feel very welcome
9118,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We had to wait around half hour for our room to be prepared even though we could check in after 2 we still had to wait Although the staff we re apologetic and offered us tea and coffee it was still a nuisance to wait longer The bed was comofortable unfortunately there was holes in walls and black marks on the wall that was a little disappointing , I enjoyed breakfast and the bed was comfortable the location of the room was quiet Nice location and general appearance of the hotel was nice right next to Hyde park and staff were really nice 
9119,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room size and consequently the double bed were really small and somewhat restricting on movement so much so I could not pass my wife in any part of the room without one of us having to our move aside for the other The view out of the window was none existent as it was directly onto a wall less than 2m away, The location is great for access to the tube and walking distance to Hyde Park The breakfast was very good value with a help yourself buffet offering a good choice The rooms despite their size were very clean and our tiny bathroom has at some point recently been completely refurbished 
9120,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The fact because we booked threw you and ndt the hotel direct we had to pay 12 each for breakfast even though the hotel says breakfast is free for all our guesrs, The bed was comfy and clean
9121,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Sheets were not changed even when we put in a request with the receptionist who said she would have it seen to We had spilled coffee and would have appreciated our sheets changed but they were not its the only things that was not perfect , EVERYHTING 
9122,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, aost perfect just a warning they re isn t a huge vegetarian cooked breakfast options no vegi sausages but there is lots if choice for other breakfast things so it s not a problem, The building is gorgeous the staff are super helpful and it is excellent value for money Especially in London it s around the same price as a generic chain hotel but so much nicer They even took our bags to the room for us The bathroom was so nice and clean and bright I was staying with my boyfriend and even though we re only 20 they treated us as well as anyone else which isn t the case at every place Also breakfast was great everything you expect from a buffet 
9123,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room not as spacious as would have liked , Location was great managed to get to see everything we wanted to see within our two day stay Staff at the hotel were very helpful and very pleasant 
9124,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, A lot of stairs but the staff upgraded my room to a ground floor room Lifts do not go to all floors, Bed comfy and ax worked great Staff were very helpful
9125,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing to fault, The breakfasts were delicious the beds very comfy and we enjoyed the extras that came with our Club Room The staff was very welcoming and helpful 
9126,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, the rooms are really tiny which does not make it a value for mony hotel , I liked the staff as they are really friendly and professional and didn t like the
9127,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was very small decor rather shabby shower screen too small therefore floor got very wet , Friendly staff prompt efficient check in Good shower good lighting in bathroom 
9128,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Staff that don t speak english well Seems to be the trend in London that the service industry is filled by eastern europeans that cannot convey ideas or understand queries Inconvenient small rooms with even smaller bathrooms Had a room on 8th fl which is reached via elevator to the 7th and then a snakey passage with steps Anyone over average size would not be able to move in these rooms and the hallways are claustrophobic The closet so small that 5 days worth of clothes wouldn t fit shoes had to stay on the floor behind the door which had a great expanse of wall begging for a row of hooks for coats and sundries Those we had to lay on the suitcase rest The desk in the corner was essential to laying things down the kettle and the hairdryer in the drawer however too close to the bed kept hitting my toes and hips on the corner It could have used a mini fridge underneath The last and most important thing for any hotel is a comfortable bed These were 3 4 beds Smaller than a double and HARD as rock I ordered an extra comforter to place on top It helped somewhat , Beautiful opulent old wood victorian interior Restaurant is eye candy a spacious ballroom in two halves and the buffet excellent Same things offered everyday however ordering a la carte is an option High end fixtures in the rooms and high quality furnishings Hotel situated across the street from Hyde Park around the corner from two tube stations a multitude of restaurants and Portebello Road 5 minutes away The room was fitted with a safe and a kettle with coffee tea hot chocolate and biscuits 
9129,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, room size very small bathroom you couldnt physically get in without having to stand over the toilet to close the door Bar very basic poor quality of towels bed sheets etc ,No Positive
9130,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was very small Difficult getting in and out the bed So close to the window View was awful , Staff were friendly Booking in was easy Breakfast was excellent 
9131,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was absolutely tiny you couldn t even really walk The windows couldn t be closed so it was freezing cold and extremely noisy in the room Moreover the air con didn t heat the room either The furniture is old and totally worn down scratches and marks everywhere The Shampoo is a joke it s like it s gluing your hair together so you can t brush it anymore no conditioner has been provided Generally it s a very dark and uninviting hotel I don t understand why people rate it so high I will not come back definitely not 4 stars in my opinion , The location of the hotel is good but that s basically the only good thing about it 
9132,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Creaky floors uncomfortable pillows leaking iron one staff member who delivered my iron when I asked does this not come with a board replied grumpily I was told to only bring iron and walked off in a huff to get an ironing board , Location some staff members reception look grand visually very teak mahogany 
9133,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Basement room so I was disinclined to open window for air Security wise Outlook awful also Noisy fridge buzzing away all night in cupboard beside bed, Clean as a whistle 
9134,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Stuff poor very slow to check in The room very very small not as in the picture looks bigger and the bed very small for two The room was not very clean and towels really old and not clean well I will never come back to this hotel as all , Only location no thing else
9135,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Toilet was positioned so it could not be used for what it was designed for Therefore we had to go elsewhere to use the toilet , great location beautiful hotel
9136,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I don t like to complain but the room was on the small side , From our arrival we were made feel welcome and really enjoyed our stay so much The breakfast each morning was excellent The staff were brilliant nothing was any trouble to them Certainly would come back again and recommend your hotel to others

9138,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bedroom was far too small and the bathroom was so small that you cannot get in without closing the door after you step halfway in Just no space and silly steps right at the bedroom door to get to the bed , Hotel has character and clean with comfortable bed Good location for access to the tube 
9139,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The price should come down by at least 10 15 A little extortionate I thought , Very clean and well kept Luxurious in appearance very stylish Staff looked immaculate and very professional Very good service Location was next to Hyde Park 10 minute walk to Paddington Station and a street away from a variety of food stores takeaways and restaurants 
9140,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Place was a little noisey and the deluxe room was very small for the price The bed was hard , Location was great Close to everything The traditional features were amazing
9141,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, I have stayed in this hotel multiple times in the last few years and always I leave with the intension of returning Very helpful staff great location excellent breakfast nice rooms 
9142,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Well given it wasn t the hotel I booked I can t really say much about it despite having booked 14 days earlier and despite the hotel looking pretty busy I was shifted hotels because of a supposed boiler fault Not being a tourist and staying all too regularly in London hotels I realise this is code for we ve overbooked the nicer hotel and shunt guests to the quieter hotel round the corner after we ve filled all the rooms It happens too often for me just to be an unlucky traveller 180 for the room breakfast on top and a room that to be fair was tidy but certainly not comparable with other similarly rated hotels that I stay in , Well it looked nice in reception but as I saw no more of it I ll have to take your word for how good it was
9143,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Cleaners walking in when I m half naked Fire alarms going off first thing but no one bothered to say it was a mistake The room was awful , Breakfast was nice Julian was great 
9144,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was tiny No bath The access to the room was blocked but staff did not tell me about the correct way to reach my room I was enrolled onto some premium club without explanation , The hotel looks good just from the outside
9145,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Location Excellent Staff very helpful chocolates in the room when the receptionist found out it was my partners birthday Really good experience 
9146,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I arrived late to be told had an upgrade to a room with a king size bed after the worlds slowest check in I opened my room door to find two twin beds I phoned reception to ask to be moved to a room with a double bed that I had booked Reception informed they had no more rooms available however they would make my twin beds into a double The lady on reception and a waiter arrived to make the bed It took them 45 minutes meaning I didn t get into my room until 10 30pm a night Check out was incredibly slow the lady on the desk took around 15 minutes to check people out , Not a lot bathroom was clean friendly barman
9147,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Upon arrival tried to shift our booking across to a sister hotel in Paddington no explanation why but we refused Given our triple deluxe room which was really poor Cramped room was tatty and looked onto a square concrete storage area full of drinking water containers Manager offered concessions in an attempt to satisfy Hotel is grand but room we experienced was 2 star , Lovely looking hotel just a stones throw away from Hyde Park and Queensway tube station Friendly staff excellent breakfast Staff tried hardest to rectify issues see below 
9148,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Told I had been upgraded to a large double from a single not enough room to open wardrobe door and you only had access to one side of the bed , Good location a little quirky
9149,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Julian at the front desk was magnificent in helping me to book for an additional night when I was under pressure A real ambassador for the hotel and the company 
9150,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Perhaps the addition of other spaces like a gym ballroom or other public facilities would make it more appealing to more travelers , The baroque interior design really added on to the atmosphere The bed was comfortable and the cheap buffet style breakfast also made it a very good deal 
9151,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room which is supposed to be their deluxe room slightly bigger than the superior rooms according to this web site was way too small The facilities were not satisfactory no mini bar and no gym , Great location by the park very close to Queensway tube station nice neighborhood in general
9152,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, We loved our stay here We only stayed one night of three in London and I wish we had spent every night here The staff was very friendly and helpful We were able to check in early which was really great after a horrible night at a hostel the night before The hotel also had complimentary umbrellas to use which is very useful for rainy weather in London When we come back to London we will stay here and most definitely recommend it to others 
9153,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Cleanliness a little lacking Dried globs of white stuff on drapes Would not care to guess origin Didn t notice until I pulled them shut Too tired to change rooms , Location Near done darling bars and cafes Beautiful woodwork in lobby 
9154,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was exceptionally small You would not want to share this room with another person The shower didn t have a full screen so the bathroom floor got very wet No towel available to step onto from shower Stairs going down into the room were very dangerous especially as I wasn t warned , Location
9155,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Air con didn t work shower head was loose run out off wine and beer meant to be a double room ended up being to single beds poorly spoken English speaking staff , Nice and clean hotel
9156,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The floors squeezed a lot Because of this we had to move from 5th floor to 6th floor , Staff in reception was very friendly Location great next to a park and the tube 
9157,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Superior Double room over egging the description somewhat the rooms were small and cramped , We liked the style of the hotel opulent and classic in the main areas lovely helpful staff very modern very clean bedrooms

9161,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Could have supplied more toiletries in the room room was small , Beds were comfortable room clean did the job ideal for business travel right next to Hyde park so a real bonus 
9162,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, One of our party was moved to a sister hotel after his room allegedly had no hot water We were not informed of this till check in I paid 115 for him a double delux room and what he actually got was once moved a shoe box They even tried to charge us again for the room on more the one occasion Ordered room service 3 times none of which were correct My partner is dairy intolerant the sandwich she ordered had cheese in it Even though it did not say that on the menu We were assured it would be removed from the bill Howver we were charged on check out Check out is 12noon but was woken at 9 30am by housekeeping wanting to clean our room , Good location
9163,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The building is very old so not very practical for disabled or elderly guests as there are steps into the building and steps on each floor although there is a lift , The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble The location of the hotel is perfect for visiting London s attractions and there are plenty of places to eat nearby 
9164,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We had read some bad recommendations about this hotel usually redirects to their clients to other hotels overbooking for sure This was true As soon as we arrived they tried to do it I needed to confirm my pregnancy in order they took 5 minutes in giving as a room I think this is not very professional My husband also confirmed 2 months before that weekend was my birthday and their hotel was part of my present and nobody had any deference about it We also ask for an additional blanket on Sunday and we needed to call twice to Front Desk in order they brought it we had it after almost 1 hour , Perfect cleaning of the room
9165,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The small chunky cups and saucers Bigger mugs please Now I am being picky , Staff are brilliant I book here several times a year They always remember me

9178,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was very small altough i got a better category and noisy from the floor above The bathroom was extremely small it was hard to close the door with me inside The room was a bit strange with stairs between the bathroom and the actual bedroom The windows also hadn t any view that with the room size it became a bit claustrofobic , Location is perfect 3 minutes from the subway Central Line and less than a block from The Hyde Park 
9179,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The maid tried to just walk into the room in the morning without knocking which I found to be rude and unprofessional , The bed was comfortable and everything was to perfection

9191,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room slightly small but comfortable and well presented , The old colonial style decoure is lovely and the Lounge and bar areas is a lovely place to have a drink Staff were happy to sever drinks when o got back late even though the bar was shut 
9192,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room is very small It is hard to walk if we open just one luggage The bed is also very small and uncomfortable If you live underground it could be so depressive , The location is near to the subway station so it is very convenient for travelers There are also Sainsbury s Tesco Asian supermarket and many restaurants near the hotel 
9193,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The air circulation was pretty bad in our room the small window only opened a tiny bit and this was a cause of discomfort due to lack of fresh air , The staff were very helpful and friendly and the location is great as Hyde park is literally on the doorstep The tube station is 5 mins walk away also many shops and restaurants close by for convenience
9194,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, On arrival they offered an upgrade to what they said was a larger room The room was the size of a shoe box and the bed was described as a double to which it wasn t At one point in the night I woke up with my partners elbow in my mouth as literally no room in the bed Definitely not worth 160 for 1 night and not even breakfast oh and the shaver sockets don t work,No Positive
9195,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Our room was quite small but included bed desk and bathroom with very little space , Really friendly staff that gave excellent service Would recommend to anyone who is looking to stay in London 
9196,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, My room was very small but to be expected for a london hotel , Staff were excellent very friendly and helpful The hotel was 2 mins from the tube station which was excellent
9197,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, This was our second visit after being impressed last year Beautiful building with ornate carved wooden panelling The staff were very helpful rooms very comfortable and breakfast is excellent Close to the underground for the city centre and opposite Hyde Park for a stroll 
9198,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I upgraded from a standard room But what I got was still pathetic A room no bigger than 8x8 with a pretend window that opened into a corridor I shudder to think what i would ve had if I hadn t upgraded , Location is perfect
9199,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Came for an early check in but the room was not ready Staff had told to wait in the front lounge but never came back for any updates , The room was at 6th floor which was great Upgraded the room by 10 to a deluxe sized room which was significantly larger Everything was great toilet was superb Love the hotel alot i would come again for sure 
9200,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was a bit on small side but obviously you don t spend much time in there 4 50 charge for large bottle of water think that s probably normal for room service but tad overpriced in my opinion, Staff very friendly and helpful hotel is beautiful the theatre bar is gorgeous location is on a quiet road but close to tube and other shops and places to eat
9201,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room and bathroom are very tight impossible to walk between the bed and furniture suitcases on the floor Bathroom sink is ridiculously small With pullout bed in this suite there is no room to get around This is not really a hotel no dining room only used for breakfast The lobby sitting room is dark and not our taste Adam s family gothic Not a good sign to see people standing on the doorsteps smoking when we arrived Looking out the window of pullout bedroom window is no joy dirty and stack of empty water bottles , Manager was very helpful to try and make things better for our disappointment with the room and facilities Unfortunately there was nothing better available even in other property they manage 
9202,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Excellent hotel very well managed with a very friendly staff Many thanks to Syn Ann Roberta and all other staff I was particularly impressed with their speed in solving unexpected issues by finding customer friendly solutions Room was clean bed comfortable breakfast was great Very close to public transportation and to Hyde Park I recommend this hotel without any reservation 
9203,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, A great selection for breakfast myself and my son were able to drop our bag in early and our room was ready too the staff were friendly close to Bayswater and Queensway tube stations and a few minutes walk into Hyde park
9204,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Ref Room 109 1 Strong noise specially from bathroom s ceiling spreading into bedroom at night seriously disturbing proper sleep Cause aeration system 2 Poor lightening system , The location
9205,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Poor room location being on the basement and below ground level so didn t have much of a view Difficult to communicate with staff seemed to be due to a lanuage barrier , Comfortable bed and good shower Impressive entrance 
9206,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Despite initial appearance and online room photos room was very small for the price paid and compared to what was shown and expected for this 4 star hotel dissappointing, Beautiful building with stunning lobby
9207,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, NOTHING, The hotel is steeped in history relating to EdwardVII and Lily Langtry and the owners have cleverly merged and preserved the old aspects of the building with a modern hotel eg the entrance dining room bar paintings and staircase The staff on reception were superb polite friendly and very helpful The room was very good clean with plenty of toiletries and tea coffee plus a fridge Breakfast was also very good with plenty of choices The hotel is nicely situated close to Hyde Park and with frequent buses into the Central London 
9208,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Staff were friendlier this time than last but a smile would still make all the difference Just do some basic staff training in courtesy and friendliness , Great bar and residents lounge unique Smart small modern rooms but no smaller than is the norm for this quality of hotel in London It IS London that most expensive of cities in a tiny country where living space is at a premium 
9209,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Needs complete renovation very shabby short beds literally although I m not a tall person 1m68 Blinds were broken even in the superior room , Staff was excellent very friendly This is not 4 star max 3 star 
9210,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was incredibly small So was the bed My husband is over 6ft so half his legs were hanging off the end , Staff were lovely Really friendly and very helpful We were also upgraded on arrival which was lovely 
9211,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, The reception staff and management were simply too amazing They saw to our needs even when it went beyond their policies They made our stay so homey and would definetly return 
9212,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I was greeted with the information there was no accommodation for me that I would have to be accommodated in a sister property There was mild surprise I had not received prior Informatio but that did not ring true I politely but firmly refused alternative premises and guess what a room materialised I needed to be in that area for personal reasons but that is beside the point I had booked in Inverness Terrace because that was where I wanted to be This was poor stuff and I would like your comments as the booking agents You have always served me well in the past Moira Lawson, The breakfast was superb with all the hot food piping but amazingly not over cooked The ambience of the building is amazing and as a history buff I love the historical associations 
9213,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The Club room an upgrade was very small especially the bathroom It took a bit of getting used to but the pros still outweighed the cons We re coming back in June , The staff were very friendly and helpful Cyn Ann even arranged a return booking for a party of 6 3 rooms for 3 nights in June at a nice price The room was very clean and functional despite its size and the price was good for central London 
9214,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Headroom in shower Also two inch gap at bottom of bedroom door had to fill gap with towel to stop light flooding in when we put lights off , Good location close to tube Walked to Kendington Chelsea and Portobello Road market Notting Hill Wifi ok given age of hotel Concierge looked after our bags when we checked out until later on Sunday when we left for home
9215,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The rooms are extremely small as I had booked superior double I was disappointed but didn t let it ruin the trip I suppose this is to be expected in London for the price , The bed was definitely comfortable Hotel itself has a nice old traditional English feel to it Location just opposite Hyde park was fantastic 
9216,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was very very small Upon arrival I was told that I was upgraded to club room this room was extremely small God only know the size of my original room , Lovely setting and decor 
9217,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, It rained on the Monday , On arrival for our 4 day stay there was an issue with room availability this was not a problem as they provided a room at their sister hotel in Kensington for the first night We came back the next day to spend the last 3 days of our London visit here The hotel staff could not have been more helpful or nice And I would like to thank Pranav one of the managers at the hotel who looked after us during our stay I highly recommend this hotel and I look forward to my next visit here A great location excellent breakfast and a unique Theater Bar on the ground floor where the great Lillie Langtry performed Have one of the house cocktails on the stage that Lillie graced with her presence 
9218,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was very very small Didnt have any great expectations but I could almost touch all 4 walls while sitting on the double bed , Handy location next to the underground Clean rooms with comfy beds Breakfast was pretty good as well For London it was fairly good value for money 
9219,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Mattress needs replacing sagging in the middle and could feel a spring Couldn t open blinds , The traditional furnishings Beautiful common areas near reception On the doorstep of Hyde Park and Queensway station 
9220,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Couldn t find a remote control and could not activate the air con , The room was compact but clean and had extra touches in the bathroom which were appreciated 
9221,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, room was very small but the price was good so i guess that reflects the room size, Bed was good no bath towels and it took a couple of phone calls to obtain some 
9222,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Noisy road works quite early in the morning Maintenance came to look at the shower whilst I was in it Room wasn t all that big and we d been upgraded but was fine for what we needed , Decor was lovely Nice clean room Helpful staff good location Really liked the theatre bar for our pre theatre drinks 
9223,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bathroom was small though and a large person would have had very little space in the shower , We stayed for 2 nights at the beginning of the Easter break and the Grand Royale Hotel was in a good location It was easy to jump on the Tube Line and Buses which were a few minutes away We stayed in a Club Room which was comfortable and clean 
9224,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Too much noise around the room Contact the duty manager but never reported back i had to call hik another 2 times to send someone to check it Very noisy at all time in morning ,No Positive
9225,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Ineffective heater in the room Shower cubicle too small and close to the ceiling Very small rooms Being told that the hotel was too full and I would have to move to a hotel close by , Charming building Good location
9226,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing to report, Excellent location next to Queensway Underground Station on the most convenient central line in London Very polite and helpful staff I highly recommend this very historic Hotel 
9227,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We were told that our room had been upgraded I would not have liked to stay in the previous one The room was very small and had no air conditioning making it very hot , Beautiful Edwardian building with an interesting history Breakfast was great value with plenty of choices for both British and continental 
9228,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We did have to move due to not having a double twin as booked But they moved us to a sister hotel in the area included breakfasts and couldn t be more apologetic or helpful , Excellent service Great breakfast Efficient staff clean and modern Room was small but extremely comfortable
9229,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The only thing I would say is the room was very small really not what I expected for a club double Could have have also done with a little decoration in places Might be a good idea to put on the website that the rooms are small One other small thing was that there were complimentary drinks in the fridge but no bottle opener to open them with, The hotel is a beautiful old building and the staff were extremely helpful couldn t do enough for you and very polite The breakfast was fantastic just about anything you could possibly want The room was clean and tidy 
9230,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Tiny rooms and unfortunately I had an unpleasant case with staff on reception My friend left for me a handbag on reception at evening and receptionist promised her to bring it to my number Next day in the morning they ensured me that there was nothing for me left So after spending 20 minutes with all of members on reception they finally found my bag it was directly on the table in front of them I didnt expect that this could happen in London , Very beautiful interior in lobby perfect location for those who love Hyde park Close to 2 tube stations and city center
9231,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Yes rooms are compact lol but very clean and to be fair when you visit London you are only really putting your head down so don t actually spend that much time in the room Well I don t anyways , The location was absolutely fantastic couldn t have got better Rooms were lovely and clean and lots of character within the hotel 
9232,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The location is good the building lay out is very nice most of staff are v nice friendly The room was so basic in facilities like tea coffee shower gel body cream which was none The towels bed sheets smell really bad to the extent that I develop skin rashes the mattress pilows were uncomfortable , The location lay out staff 
9233,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I booked a club room which in itself was fine along with the little extras but the bathroom The sink was so small Why bother When I leant over to try and brush my teeth and rinse my face the stupidly placed glass shelf above stopped me What idiot designed that Love the hotel but paying for a club room and getting a bathroom cupboard is just not acceptable The bathroom could have been made 1 2 metre wider and had a decent wash basin Puts me off staying again, Staff location facilities
9234,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Old style windows were in a fixed position they could not be opened or closed Gaps in the window frames allowed noise from the street to be heard clearly in the room at day and at night Draughts could also be felt coming through the windows The hotel restaurant was only used for breakfast only rather expensive room service was available at other times of the day Handy to have lots of stores and restaurants in the next street so you can pop out and get food for yourself , I liked the charm of the traditional styled reception areas Our room was furnished in a modern style and it was clean The location of the hotel was great for tube stations Bayswater and Queensway are really close by Attractions like Kensington Palace Hyde Park and the Royal Albert Hall were also really close too There is a good selection of restaurants close by for dining out 
9235,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Having a laugh to describe the room as a deluxe double Open door and immediately faced with a flight of stairs up to the bed area which you had to negotiate separately as no room to swing a cat Bathroom equipment ok but pokey for a deluxe , Friendly helpful staff
9236,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Working desk space in room not really usable because to small , Very stylish location and very nice breakfast buffet for the price Rooms fairly small but nicely done and without functional errors 
9237,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, the size of the room of course we re in London and I ve slept even in smaller rooms but still I can t help but find it extremely annoying can t really have space for the suitcase no minibar and the desk is really impossible to use without feeling contrained There was a nasty damp smell in the room The windows are rather old ok so s the building but the draft coming from outside was not pleasant thankfully the heavy curtains helped , great position few minutes walk from the tube good breakfast buffet comfortable bed but I was on my own I guess this was a double bed in which case it guess it can only house a tiny couple 
9238,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, A little cold at night because I did not find the air conditioning regulator until the morning My own fault but the print is small , Spacious suite and ample bath swift repair of faulty TV excellent breakfast
9239,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Breakfast was quite expensive , Location was great queensway underground station was 2 minutes away Staff at the frontdesk was extremly kind and helpfull Rooms were small but has everything you need 
9240,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Instructions to switch on the heating air con could be improved and be made more readily available alongside the other hotel information in the room , The hotel room was clean warm and very comfortable and the breakfast was more than plentiful The room itself wasn t the largest of hotel rooms I have stayed in however the comfort of the room and having a great nights sleep more than made up for the lack of space I found the staff to be exceptionally helpful from the point of my arrival and throughout the stay At checkout time the staff were politely informed that I could leave my luggage in a secure room whilst I went off to do some shopping before my actual departure time from London which was most appreciated Overall I had an enjoyable stay at the Grand Royale London Park Hotel and would certainly consider staying again on future visits to London 
9241,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, 1 No refrigerator in the room had to keep some food I bought with the receptionist 2 The lower ground floor room was noisy because of poor insulation I could hear people who were walking on the pavement 3 No shower curtains 4 Very small room ,No Positive
9242,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was besides the housekeeping store Up from 7 am it was loud and hard to sleep , Clean room Small but fine for one person Nice bathroom Prefect location 
9243,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Better quality toiletries even if it s an additional cost Eg Overnight toiletries from Moulton Brown or another quality make would have saved me the hassle of bringing my own , The staff were extra attentive helpful and professional my room 601 very comfortable The breakfast was exceptional fresh and vast selection Fantastic grand hotel 
9244,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Access to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park was only steps away and was the Underground and trains to Bond Street and Oxford Circus Also it was an easy walk to Notting Hill Gate Quite and comfortable room and bed 
9245,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Tiny room with no view but at least they made an effort at cheerfulness by placing flowers in the windows that you look out at , Smiling staff couldn t do more to help Quirky atmosphere Love the Victorian entrance 
9246,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, There seemed to be huge communication difficulties We asked at booking for two twin rooms or if that was not possible then two single duvets on each double bed Acquiring the single duvets seemed to be the most difficult thing in the world to achieve I lost count of how many attempts it took but it included getting two extra double duvets for each room various doubles and singles and eventually two singles arrived with two duvet covers to put on ourselves not good except they weren t duvet covers they were sheets Two covers were subsequently requested and arrived given to us to put on ourselves except one was a double By this time it was about 12 30am The receptionist was profusely apologetic and offered us complimentary breakfast At breakfast we asked for 1 coffee 2 teas and 1 fruit tea We got 1 coffee and two fruit teas When I pointed out the mistake we were brought 1 more tea At this point we gave up and my daughter and I shared the tea When we were leaving my daughter phoned reception and asked if they could book a taxi to take us to the station but when we arrived downstairs the receptionist said she d forgotten to do it Not good we very nearly missed the train All in all it was quite tiresome , Location was lovely the building was beautiful the staff were very friendly polite and helpful 
9247,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The rooms were small and very tired All needs refurbishment My initial room was so tiny and required going up a few stairs to get to the bed The quilt was too small for the bed and I could hear people talking Asked to change rooms and was given a better room slightly larger which was appreciated Have stayed in better hotels in London for less , A good size bath Close to Hyde Park and train station 
9248,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Very small bed small shower with a light very close above the showerhead toilet stuck around the side of the shower and a small room to boot also the fire alarm going off at 4 30 45 am just finished things off lovely , Great location decent bar
9249,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing could have been better, The attention to detail provided by the staff at all levels The courtesy they offer where nothing is too much trouble for them The comfort of the beds and the provision of slippers and towelling robes denotes real quality The room rates are excellent for such good service in a central London location We always choose this hotel when coming to London because it cannot be bettered 
9250,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bathroom was small so if you are some over 6 foot just be aware there is not much room for you , The location is amazing Next to Hyde park and the tube stop is very easy to get to This is definitely the one of the better hotels for it s price 
9251,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Selected the hotel for the location and the photos but has been re located to a near by hotel from the same group At first disappointed but Grand Roal Paddington turned out to be a perfect one 
9252,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The offers did not include breakfast You would rather buy a full package This was an unexpected surprise , Location Good facilities Good location Near the subway Good neighborhood Located next to a nice park 
9253,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The mattress was hard and you could feel the springs And the cornered handrail in the bath was impractical because you keep on catching your back on it, The Victorian paneling in the public area and public d cor and the service was great
9254,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bedroom very small cupboard in wrong place as left small floor space to bed English Language a problem for some staff to understand , Breakfast very good great selection of food and drink Great breakfast room 
9255,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Absolutely nothing negative to say , Friendly welcoming helpful staff Disabled relative supplied with excellent support throughout visit Room very clean spacious Beds and bedding extremely comfortable All facilities supplied to a high standard Food delicious and plentiful Looking forward to another visit in the future
9256,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Superior double for 2 Couldn t swing a cat Couldn t even get dressed without hitting the wall with an elbow Quilt just reached edge to edge Would have been a fight for two ,No Positive
9257,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I had a lower ground floor and you could hear the underground trains below Not the only hotel to have this though , Good central location and good helpful welcoming staff Nearby restaurants 
9258,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bedroom was really cold and had single glazing Apparently we could ve turned the radiators on using the air conditioning That wasn t explained to us and there was no welcome pack in the room Our room was at the front of the hotel and I had a disturbed night s sleep from a lot of noise in the street Also breakfast was so expensive we didn t choose it Finally we chose the delux room supposed to be the bigger option but it was tiny The bedroom door couldn t even open fully , The location was good the bed was comfortable 
9259,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Size of room was small even when I was upgraded rooms due to maintainence issues Size of bathroom also very small Hotel lobby very dark due to original dark wood walls Requires more lighting , Nice firm mattress Room decor was okay Bathroom was modern 
9260,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Only thing was the room was a little small with no view a brick wall with a picture on it , The location was excellent just around the corner from the tube station Staff were really helpful and the bar even showed the football late Saturday afternoon 
9261,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We were charged too much when checking in and it took us a while before we received the refund back We never received a proper bill to explain what went wrong in the first place even after several times asking for a state of payment , Really nice location located in the center 
9262,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, What they call a superior double room is a BOX room I wouldn t recommend staying there if you want a couple of days Also it seems when you arrive reception fill you with a sob story that 38 rooms are out of order so the booking has to be amended even though no prior warning is given via a courtesy call or email they recommend moving you to a sister hotel down the room We put up a bit of a fight saying we didnt want to move and wanted what we booked which ended up being a box room As we were walking away they seem to use this trick on another couple who arirved shortly after claiming there were no rooms for them seems to me they want you to book that specific hotel and when you arrive give you some sob story about the rooms being out of order How many other people have they tried this on It s value for money if you re not messed around , Nice communal areas Staff pleasant 
9263,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Welcome at Reception wasn t great Room very small would like to know what the standard doubles are like however was ok for 2 nights Bathtube needs bigger screen No mini fridge, Gorgeous Building Great Links with 2 Tube stations on different lines Good Quality Value Breakfast Selection of places to eat nearby Bag hold gave us another full day in London before our Train at 7pm 12pm check out Love a lay in 
9264,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, No opening window or view was probably the only downside but it was a cold few days and to be honest I was staying there while attending a conference so the view wasn t so important , Clean if small room very helpful front of house staff Convenient location and nice feel to the main entrance lounge areas Comfortable bed 
9265,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, the rooms are far too small for a couple I have asked to have a larger room and the staff accomodated me but the improvement was minimal in the new room , staff was extremely kind and the breakfast was good the price of the room was quite below London average special offer 
9266,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The only real issue for us was the mattress which could have been firmer for more comfort , The breakfast choice was wonderful and if you book before the day its only 12 per head The hotel is very close to a tube station on the central line making transport to various locations ideal 
9267,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was upgraded to a basement room that wasn t much larger than bed I d hate to have seen my booked room Later discovered that the original person who was to stay in that room complained and was given OUR room We were tripping over ourselves No room for our cases Room smelled of smoke for over a day Staff was very aloof Hade to ask for the iron board and it didn t come the first day , Location close to tube Paddington Bed was comfortable 
9268,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I found x3 body hairs in my bathroom which were not mine This was really not good , The location was good for my Hyde Park meeting and the employees were mostly friendly and helpful 
9269,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Small room for the money paid more was expected Wouldn t recommend for this reason We were told on arrival that we were being given a free upgrade but I hate to think what our original booking was if this was considered an improvement , Location was good
9270,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, On arrival we were told we were upgraded to a club room which according to the receptionist was one of their largest rooms When we got to our room is was very small We had barely enough room to walk around the bed We had booked a superior room so I d hate to think how small this would have been Having said that it was very clean and comfortable , Location was perfect very close to everything and staff were very friendly Hotel itself is well maintained and clean with a lovely bar however when we were there it was very empty 
9271,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room bathroom quite small which wasn t an issue as we didn t spend much time there Floorboards were very creaky we could hear the guests upstairs moving around Didn t really impact too much on our stay though , Excellent location convenient to busses trains underground Close to Museums Hyde Park comfortable bed very clean Quick Check in great staff 
9272,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, This weekend was booked for a gift for my father in laws 70th birthday I saaid this on the booking I was disapponted to know they had a 2 1 2 hour wait for the room and the room was like a box So the whole point of a special weekend was slightly over shadowed,No Positive
9273,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Was upgraded to a club room but this was still minute Couldn t walk around the bed Paid more for a family room but extra space was not around the bed Don t try to check in early Staff had poor English , Unexpected fresh flowers wine and water robes and slippers in room Beautiful reception rooms Lovely hotel well situated for what we needed lots of attention to detail 
9274,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Our ground floor room was very small , Great hotel location was ideal for our needs faultless friendly staff comfy bed would stay again one of our group said the breakfast was very good 
9275,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Upon arrival we were shifted to a sister hotel because of boiler problems The hotels are rated four star but should be rated two star The tv had bad reception Room service only left body cream and shower gel the first night The room was extremely small and closet space inadequate Breakfast was fair with limited selection ,No Positive

9277,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Check in process was long Could do with extra staff in busy periods to help out Room was small but not much different in size to the standard London hotel room, A clean and modern bedroom A nice bar and excellent helpful staff Great location very near tube stations
9278,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, everything else poor wine in the evening cold room heating wasn t working on a sub zero February night no where to box and a box room you couldn t swing a cat in, proximity to tube station and hyde park good shower
9279,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I hated the bathroom Taking a shower was so hard the room was so tiny we couldn t fit despite it wasnt the smallest room Staff was not very welcoming , Location close to subway station
9280,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Size of the bed and room Reception staff weren t very attentive while trying to check in she served 3 or 4 people while I was trying to pay , Bed and room was very small seemed like a large single sized bed Bar was nice and cozy and open all the time Close to Queensway tube station which was handy Quiet area
9281,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms were small but still everything you need was there Didn t realise how much you could squeeze into the tiniest bathroom I have ever seen , Great location easy reach of places what the description says is exactly what you get 
9282,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The size of the room was a bit tight for 2 adults but yet sufficient for good rest , The Location was great just across from wonderful Hyde Park the Kensington Palace and more We are pretty fast walkers so for us this was an ideal location We accessed so many places from this easy navigable location It is a short distance from the Tube subway the hop on hop off buses restaurants pharmacy health food stores coffee shops grocers and more The hospitality was incredible Robert greeted us and offered help with our luggage as soon as we entered the historical lobby which was quaint with rich woods and great architectural detail Lauren Roberta and others who worked the front desk were there to ensure a great stay for us They were always ready to assist with directions and suggestions regarding what to see and do in London The beautiful and classy and clean dining rooms offered breakfast which was plentiful and varied with hot and cold options that would satisfy most any traveler The servers were very attentive to the diners needs The stairway adjacent to the lobby is full of architectural charm including alfresco paintings on the ceiling Beautiful wood is used throughout the stairwell There s a library or huge drawing room adjacent to the lobby I imagine a great deal of friends have gathered there over the years The bed was very comfortable 
9283,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I don t approve of the staff removing plates from the table when the other person is still eating The British way is both plates are removed at the same time I found this made my experience of my meal very uncomfortable which is a shame because the food was lovely , The hotel was spotless and although the rooms are small they are nicely laid out Breakfast was excellent 
9284,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I didht luke the rooms r very tiny and i didht like the reception girl martha which when i ask her to change room ahe lie to me and she told me is overbooked and dont have other room but when i speak with the manager suddenly she washt overbooked the hotel and i change room , I like a lot the bar in the breakfast it was good 
9285,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms were awful Hotel pulls you in with the nice looking lobby them boom Your trapped in a small box that s barely of 1 quality Also hotel cancelled first reservation so while I was half way to London I had to book another room wish I d booked a different hotel as that should have been a sign Very disappointed, Decor look of reception lobby and bar
9286,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bathroom was not clean enough The windows were not well insulated so cold air kept creeping under them The bathroom smell was musky the ventilation was not working , The front lobby was impressive 
9287,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing to add here , The friendly and helpful staff The fact that when the rate filed and we phone the reception they had someone onto it straight away and the following evening a bowl off fruit was delivered to our room The location ease of a walk in Hyde Park plenty of places to eat or to purchase food It was quiet

9289,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was smaller than expected bathroom was very cramped in particular and shower was rubbish , Good mix of Classic building reception etc with a modern room 
9290,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, On arrival the hotel room was not clean I was very disappointed also it did ruin my evening In saying that the way it was dealt with was brilliant I am extremely grateful for the night manager and some of the staff as they made it right as soon as they could , The hotel staff were great night manager extremely helpful and the breakfast was fantastic 
9291,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room a Deluxe double was just off the main staircase with a potentially injurious lack of space between the door to the room and the door to the staircase The window looked out on the acces ramp of an underground car park and service entrances to restaurants on Queensway making it noisy and insalubrious Deluxe is not a word I would have used , Great hotel in terms of staff food and ambience in the communal areas Fantastically located a few minutes walk to two tube stations seconds from Kensington Gardens and only 10min walk or 3min tube ride to Paddington and trains to Heathrow the West Country and South Wales The Grande Royale is also reasonably priced and comfortable for the area

9295,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I think this may be a London wide problem and I also have good hearing but I could hear the tube from my room on the ground floor throughout the night and morning The room could have been a bit cleaner I think the turn around is very busy There seemed to be a constant flow of guests which must put staff under pressure it lacked the finish I expect of a hotel and shows the difference between a 4 London hotel and 5 There was a slight mix up with our room but The manager and staff were more than accommodating to resolve this and went above and beyond to make it right and they improved my stay by doing so I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely use again the next time I return to London Any points I didn t like are simply little things , The staff were very helpful reception porters and especially the breakfast staff head waitress The manager was also very helpful and has since followed up with me to check I was happy during my stay not many places would do this The location of the hotel is great Easily accessible close to main attractions Beautiful decor in the lobby stairs Breakfast great selection fresh tasty Plenty of comfort in the room e g bath robe to use slippers etc Bathroom although small very nice I would really recommend staying here great value service breakfast location

9301,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We had problems with our pram and there was no lift available for us to the first floor so the stairs were a nightmare followed by more steps as you enter the tiny cramped bedroom Not child friendly or suitable for disabled access , Location was good
9302,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The double bed was something else The mattress was extremely hard we hardly slept at all The bedcover was very thin and not wide enough to cover two people We would not stay there again , Lovely old building at first impression in the lobby The room was very small but clean with all the usual things like kettle tea etc Also shower gel soap shampoo

9313,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The staff at the reception was rude I had checked my account before leaving to go to the hotel and had seen that they had charged me according to the policy I had booked under The receptionist then informed me that this was not the case and that they were going to charge me again constantly telling me the first charge was a pre authorisation He was not willing to listen this was a frustrating and bad start to our stay The rooms are small which I was expecting due to it being in the centre of London but I did not appreciate the fact that the beds were not long enough Going to the toilet was pretty much impossible there is no space at all They supply a kettle in the room but the tap in the bathroom is so small that you cannot fill the kettle there we had to use the showerhead Not good , The hotel looks beautiful on the outside

9394,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The single room was too small I had a big suit case with me and I had absolutely no space to walk , The location is great The down stairs bar is cosy 
9395,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Grand and historic hotel reasonable prices to stay in the most beautiful old building Sitting rooms and bar were just beautiful Friendly staff Great location in central London quiet away from the hubbub but close to paddington Notting hill and choice of two tubes a minute s walk away Loved it 
9396,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bar staff and receptionists were very moody bordering on rude Breakfast waitresses were however very friendly Room size was farcical yes it was cheap but a 3x3 5m room was certainly not advertised nor would it have been booked , Location and price were excellent
9397,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Staff couldn t do enough The Hotel felt like a home and the breakfast was superb The location was perfect and the stay was best value I have ever had 
9398,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms are pretty tiny If I was with a partner it would have been far too small Cleaning was okay but sometimes things were missed Bar was dead and no in room dining Oh and tv s whilst large weren t HD, Nice staff lovely reception and comfy beds also brilliant location
9399,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms are very small and don t look anything like the pictures portrayed on Booking com , Reception gives the impression that you are in an old English building 
9400,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Shame about the room really basement twin barely a twin Tiny tiny bathroom in which everything got wet quite noisy slightly shabby probably due a bit of a lick of paint and not that clean when we got in there sadly , Great location and the foyer area was lovely
9401,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, 1 Wifi service is very poor and you have to log in every time 2 They mixed up our breakfast order twice 3 Placed us in the basement despite my request to be in upper foors it was very noisy 4 The room service was very poor they were using the towels to clean the washroom floors and the bed sheets were not changed despite having stains on it 5 This is the first hotel I experience in my life that they don t have a scale to weigh our luggage, Location and friendly staff
9402,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, While the room was moderately comfortable it was very small and lacked finesse The sheets didn t fit the bed the shower head did not appear to work properly and the bathroom door wouldn t close These were small inconveniences but for the cost of the room I would not have expected them , The staff were friendly and helpful and the location made it very easy to travel around London 
9403,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The hotel staff made a mistake on the date of my Heathrow shuttle booking which did not arrive on my check out date It was only after I waited for 40mins and asked the hotel staff to call the shuttle company before they realized the mistake I had to make last minute alternative arrangements to Heathrow airport and was nearly late for my flight , Hotel architecture has a traditional English heritage charm which makes my stay feel authentic yet has modern facilities to ensure a pleasant stay Room is new and clean though small There s a welcome basket of fruits and chocolates in the room which are appreciated Hotel is conveniently located from Kensington Garden Queensway and Bayswater Underground 
9404,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Broken thermastat Smell from drains told we would have a superior double room but it was standard apparently in this Hotel superior means standard Bedding inadequate no window no ventilation one sealed window that was dirty very small room , Location
9405,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was terribly small and the bathroom was even smaller I think this is typical for most European hotels I am from the U S and accustomed to larger facilities but it was very small for two people Also we were in the basement meaning we had a terrible view and the one window we did have was drafty and leaked in wind all night long causing the person sleeping nearest the window to freeze , Loved the location Very close to two Underground lines and Hyde Park 
9406,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Unfriendly and unhelpful staff They did not have any information on various questions such as parking in the neighbourhood or where to watch the New Year fireworks they actually advised us to go Trafalgar Square where it was not screened and not possible to watch , Comfortable rooms in a very nice building 
9407,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bathroom was a little small and the rooms were plain compared to the lobby other than that it was good just thought they didn t keep in tone of the hotel , although we didn t encounter any problems or use the hotel facilities that much the check in service was prompt 
9408,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, The room had been recently renovated in a modern style We found it very attractive but it might disappoint others if they were looking for the Victorian style of the public areas These were beautifully ornate with dark paneling and decorated ceilings The one way street was residential with large well maintained Victorian houses now mostly flats It was very quiet A range of local food shops and restaurants was within easy walking distance along with a Circle line underground station It was easy to travel to the theatre via the Circle line We had booked room only so cannot comment on the food 
9409,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Their room prices were a bit steep Even that is fine but then it should include breakfast They didn t include the breakfast in the charge and it was 15 pounds per person which some might find expensive of one looks at the total amount spent , The hotel is very beautiful it has an amazing antique reception and hall The entire experience was great The staff was very helpful the hotel manager was very welcoming on the day we arrived as he wrote a special note welcoming us I loved that personal touch Yes central London is very expensive and the rooms aren t big But it s central London And when everything that one can possibly need is available without asking then nothing else matters The toilet even had a bath tub which was great A great experience And its just on the other side of the Queensway station a 2 min walk And has many restaurants and supermarkets in the vicinity which is an added advantage Totally worth it I recommend it strongly 
9410,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The size of room is really small although they upgraded us to a club room which was at lower ground and even through the window we could not see the sky or anything else except a wall and an air condition fixed on it , Location of the hotel it s decoration and specially the staff were very good
9411,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The cost of the smallest room we have ever had in London We asked at the end of the stay why our water was not replenished and was informed only the first day was included in the price unless you are a club member We believe that for in excess of 500 pounds for a 72 hour stay bottled water would be included The fruit was a nice touch but removed when left and not replaced it would of been nice to leave it for the following day The basis of this hotels prices seems to be the grand entrance as the remained of the hotel is a very dated , The location was very good
9412,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The shower didn t have a curtain strange design feature , Excellent bar very nice decor helpful staff Great history to the building Buffet was expensive but high quality Very close to the underground tube 
9413,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Asides breakfast no restaurant roomservice within the hotel So i have to make sure I eat before returning to the hotel or hold something to eat , I liked the location It was in a nice quiet area yet central and close to the stations so getting around was easy The room was nice and cosy 
9414,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The other receptionist at 52 Inverness could do with training in customer service and interpersonal skills The rooms are a bit small But they are clean and tasteful, The main hotel was poor We stayed at 52 Inverness place which was good The staff was excellent particularly the receptionist and porter 
9415,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was really small However we are in London and obviously the hotel cannot help this , Location was great Very near to a tube station and close to Hyde Park 
9416,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, nil, Location is awesome More restaurants nearby incldg indian and chinese Very closeby to bayswater and queensway station A beautiful catholic church nearby Nice ambience Would love to be there again
9417,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The rooms are not as nice as the lobby No restaurant bar and even the lobby had no place to sit It s either sit in your tiny room or leave , The lobby was period fashionable 
9418,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was decidedly compact but in a good way, Fabulous decor in the public areas and excellent breakfast Location very good for both tube Queensway or Bayswater and Kemsington Gardens 
9419,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The two steps stairs in my room it kind of annoying but it is okay bcz the whole hotel is awesome, The the hotel is so uniqe I like how it looks like from the old movie in term decoration style yet it keeps it modern culture
9420,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Not all reception staff were friendly Some did not even smile , Lovely breakfast in two beautiful rooms Bedrooms are quite small but amenities all there 
9421,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing, It was my 3rd time there they celebrated my birthday with a really nice big room chocolates bath robes and slippers Had a lot of parcels coming everyday they ensured it s put inside the room Location is superb stuff are reallyyyyy helpful and friendly
9422,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Kettle and TV malfunctioned BUT staff dealt with the problems extremely quickly and efficiently, We love this Hotel for its atmosphere and friendliness We enjoyed a very good breakfast and service could not have been better Bed was very comfortable and the pillows were unusually good which was much appreciated 
9423,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The evening night staff was rude when I asked about the the double booking fee , Confusion on arrival as it wasn t clear that I had to bring the same credit card as when I booked the hotel Your staff made it difficult to understand what the problem was The system could be more flexible 
9424,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I thought the room small and unimpressive for the upgraded room selected and below the standard I expect of 4 star hotels, The staff were helpful on the phone allowing my girlfriend access to the room before my arrival and payment for the room 
9425,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, The staff we re very welcoming friendly couldn t do enough the underground Queensway was only a 5 min walk from the hotel Definitely staying again 
9426,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, As many guests said the room is quite small and the shower could have a longer glass partition to avoid flooding the bathroom , The place has a very good location surroundEd by many facilities and well communicated The breakfast if booked early is worth Just one complain they could have natural orange juice 
9427,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, During our stay the airconditioning was not funtioning property Also there was no possibility to open any windows , Friendly and helpful staff Comfortable bed and room Hotel was clean and quiet

9429,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, heating had two choices a too hot b off too cold The staff knew this and did not tell me I woke three times during the night to turn on and off the heat When I told them they said they knew and IF I called they would have given me a portable electric heater Rooms are too small , Location
9430,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, The building is stunning and the reception area and lounge were very fitting of the name Checked in at about 11 o clock and our rooms were ready straight away despite usually having to wait until 2pm 
9431,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Great friendly staff with welcoming atmosphere at a wonderful hotel Upgraded our room because this was our honeymoon night so made even more extra special

9434,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Did not like the stairs in the room which led to the bathroom and the room was very small Good job we did not stay for any longer than 2 nights , Great location friendly staff comfortable bed very relaxed atmosphere in the bar 
9435,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The fact that we booked to stay in Hyde Park but got moved to Paddington and was only told because we called to see if there were parking , The staff were fantastic and the service was brilliant 
9436,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, the hotel looked much fancier on the photos than in reality the hallways were very narrow and claustrophobic the drain in the shower didnt work even after we warned the cleaning lady i got a discount meaning 280 pounds for two nights but this meant a room with a view of the opposite wall , the location was great near hyde park and at walkable distance from the center 
9437,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, No bad experiences our room was in need of a bit of tlc to bring it right up to standard but very clean and tidy, Beautiful old building with lots of history attached to it along with very helpful friendly staff
9438,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Price but I did book it last minute and we all like to save a bit of money, We actually got moved very last minute but it completely worked out for the better everyone was helpful and we got a bigger room extremely happy 
9439,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Shower screen very inadequate pointless in fact and bathroom was instantly flooded Room marketed as deluxe double which frankly is ridiculous Couldn t swing a cat It was clean however 
9440,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We could not turn on the air conditioner they said since it s winter time they don t provide winter time Well i think people should have the option Room was too small Blanket was too small for two people, The complimentary biscuits and hot chocolate You don t see a lot of those in hotels
9441,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Hotel location is excellent near two tube stations and Kensington Park Staff were very friendly and helpful Glad to see that they had a nice bar within the hotel for a nightcap 
9442,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Staff didn t offer any attraction discounts or airport pick up but when we did ask they were attentive, We asked for a room on higher floor via booking com but upon check in were given a ground floor Immediately called and inquired on a top floor room staff brought our luggage upstairs and waited to see if we were pleased with the room Location is on point and convenient to get around 
9443,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, overcharged room bill on check out charged for breakfast on the day before we arrived over charged on quoted price for breakfast command of spoken English from front of house staff difficult to understand room accessed via steps just inside door , location easy bus routes tube station room clean walkable to Paddington 
9444,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Hotel was selected because of the charming public lounge which turned out to be closed to guests because of a private party for the duration of our stay Without access to the lounge the hotel was nothing out of the ordinary to justify its high price ,No Positive
9445,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We were on the ground floor at the rear of the hotel and our room looked over the rear of another building so no view as such but I expect the same can t be said for every room , Location was fantastic just a 10minute walk from the National history v a and science museums and even close to the royal Albert Hall 
9446,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The rooms were very small specially if you travel with a baby The price was the cheapest I found in the area I wanted to stay but it didn t not met my expectations, That after i saw my room and realizing that it was very small they gave me an upgrade for free
9447,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, room 611 was small and compact you could hear upstairs rooms and outside road breakfast was good but both mornings we went at 9 30 and the bacon and sausage was cold there were about 4 staff but they were not watching when people want serving half the time slow service for this priced hotel its a little out of main hubbs taxis expensive but tube station just around corner which is good I am not moaning senior management need to train staff to be more pro active watch the food so it doesn t go cold and smile , the room service cleaning etc was good the hotel was clean bar staff good drinks expensive whiskey and coke and barcardi and coke was 15 70 well it is London I suppose reception staff good 
9448,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The breakfast was a dissapointment The food was wonderful but the service we found poor on asking for tea the used teapot was refilled Dishes were not removed , Everything about our stay was wonderful I had mentioned that it was my daughters birthday anD there were wine and champagne in the room which had also been upgraded it really was a great experiance
9449,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I arrived with a baby and the hotel gave me a room downstairs at the ground floor To get there I have to climb up and down the steps And the room was too tiny and small Too small , Very good reception and welcome staff 
9450,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bit of confusion over final payment my son had to pay for his own gift I had already paid and had confirmation but same card was needed to check in and I was on holiday with no wifi , Lovely hotel clean great area

9453,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Was in a twin club room It had very little space to move around in and had a tiny bathroom A squeeze but manageable However perfectly good as a place to sleep , Good location Clean room comfortable beds Very close to Queensway tube station Within walking distance of museums V A Natural History Museum etc and into city centre 20 30 minutes with lots to see on the way Overall a good hotel and location for the price I paid Would stay there again 
9454,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I find the rooms very small and I m only 5 4 I couldn t make myself a hot drink as there was too much limescale floating around in the cup , I like the location and ease for getting around London and the lovely entrance hall 
9455,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Not being able to stay there and being put in a sister hotel further up the road the room of which was very small We had looked forward to staying at the Grand Royale itself However as compensation they did give us complimentary breakfast at the grand Royale throughout our stay , Location and decor of Grand Royale
9456,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms are really small as often in London anyways Way to hot in the room Good breakfast but is not worthy the extra fee Find room is not so easy, Great place wonderful position Close to tube station and park for morning run Complimentary fruits at the desk Checkin and checkout might take a while 
9457,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Lovely building and very good location I paid for a Superior room but it was more like a standard Will visit again though Building has great character Staff were helpful and accommodating 
9458,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Such small room king size bed taking most of the space in the room the two of us could not move around at the same time and we are both small The large lounge room was always closed This was not as per the advertised facilities , Old world style Location 
9459,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bedroom was tiny and not big enough to swing a cat We asked to change but the rooms we looked at were very similar in size, The staff were the best and breakfast was very nice The reception and the lounge areas are full of character and well maintained
9460,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Size of bathroom far too small and as we were on a festive break the hotel had no festive feel with reception area no Christmas spirit Our bedroom had no outlook whatsoever , Location suited us and staff were very helpful 
9461,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, was on ground level inner courtyard couldn t get window to latch Next morning one lift not working and the other one was being used for laundry, Good Location good value 
9462,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I was moved on to another hotel further up the street on my first night having paid 119 per night no breakfast it was unpleasant I accepted free breakfast on my two morning stay They seemed sincere and apologetic Bathroom in room 117 small and dated but ok considering it is a rustic full of character hotel , It has a traditional old Hotel feeling The breakfast was great in a lovely room The staff are great and the location is in a safe area easy Bus and underground 
9463,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, My arrival necessitated movement to a sister hotel due to a plumbing issue which was an inconvenience but well handled , The staff couldn t do enough 
9464,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Lovely quaint old hotel Beautiful leaded windows We had a 6th floor double deluxe room Rooms are small but well equipped and clean Just around the corner from a busy High Streer and Tube on the Central Line Would definitely go back
9465,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room temp too warm for me breakfast choice v good but not quite hot enough but acceptable lack of parking, Rooms unfussy and uncluttered nice to have a bath beds comfortable overall hotel decor a big plus 
9466,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Even after insisting on a room change after the so called superior double transpired to be no more than a shoe box we were allocated a club room in the basement with a view of a wall no daylight The room was cramped and small and the bathroom was no bigger than a toilet cubicle with a tiny shower enclosure Even the sink in the bathroom was so tiny that you could not have used it to wash in , Close to Queensway tube station
9467,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I m not usually one to write reviews but I am that unhappy and feel I need to warn people about how awful it is Upon arrival the foyer was impressive it s a very beautiful building with art on the ceilings but unfortunately the rooms were a very different story The duvet cover had a big yellow stain on it so we had to ask for a clean one but when we tried to call down to reception the buttons on the phone had been pushed in so we couldn t use it and we didn t even get an apology There were dirty marks all up the walls and curtains We ordered an English breakfast with tea but the tea never arrived The gap between the wall and one side of the bed was about 1ft so no space to move Our view was of other rooms At 11 30 we were packing to leave when a member of staff just barged in despite check out being at 12 Not happy at all with this hotel especially as we paid a lot of money We would not stay here again , The bed was comfy and the location was nice as there was easy access to Hyde Park
9468,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Reception staff on arrival allocated us a room which was already occupied Bathroom very small I m not sure why this room was a superior double , Hotel very convenient for all London attractions and underground links 
9469,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, REALLY small rooms and bathroom Breakfast is expensive and not worth it the coffee pace around the corner had better and cheaper breakfast Staff was unfriendly at check in but became better during our stay , The beds were good and the location is excellent 
9470,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, On arrival we were advised without any apology that we would be moving hotels because they had booking issues We planned our trip around staying in that location and specifically wanted a traditional hotel not a modern one with dirty restaurant that we got moved to My wife was was pregnant and we did not want to be shuttled around hotels on what was meant to be a special weekend away We have not received a word of apology from the hotel after our visit ,No Positive
9471,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, On arrival we were advised the hotel staff had organised alternative accommodation due to a plumbing issue with our room Our alternative accommodation did not have a double room they only a twin room available , The hotel provided transport to our new accommodation 
9472,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Horrific I stay in London every week in 4 or 5 star hotels This isn t a 3 star in my opinion Dirty dated and grubby Shame for such a beautiful building , Not much
9473,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was tiny and shabby Marks on the walls and dated decor Very dusty also Water not replaced for second night of stay Very expensive with breakfast not even included Internet kept dropping constantly with need to keep entering password , The lobby and bar area were charming
9474,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, There was an offer by the hotel on Booking com when I chose it and set my dates it confirmed to me a totally different date Thinking I was wrong I repeated the process but again the same result So I ended up paying for two nights at the same unwanted date I called the hotel but they told me that I have to call booking com I called booking com but they told me I have to call the hotel What a trap ,No Positive
9475,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The double room was incredibly small so would upgrade to club next time Lack of choice for room service , Was perfectly situated for all our needs for this trip Great staff very clean

9477,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Woken up by banging and drilling from work being done next door When the lady came to clean our room she left a big bag of rubbish in our room that wasn t ours On the morning of check out house keeping wanted to clean our room at 10 15am check out not till 12noon , Comfortable bed location
9478,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The lifts were out of order at times The staff were pleasant but did not appear friendly, Location and the room was small but reasonably comfortable for a short stay
9479,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Very few staff members spoke English as their first language which made expressing our needs very difficult The night manager was argumentative rude and unhelpful , hot water location and beautiful entryway 
9480,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, our room was tiny the bathroom door opened into our bed it was that small we could hear everything from the room above television talking and banging didn t sleep at all it was for our 30th wedding anniversary so very disappointed , location

9486,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Lift only to floor 7 and the a flight of stairs to floor 8 where the room was located No view from room, As it was just me a real single room was OK and therefore good value The room had all necessary facilities and modern bathroom 
9487,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, My wife and I wanted a mini moon in London beautiful hotel the Langtry suite is gorgeous friendly professional and accommodating staff the manager arranged for us to have a bottle of champagne and basket of fruit waiting Of course the location could not be more central We had a wonderful time 
9488,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Unfortunately we were booked out to another hotel it didn t have the same eye catching detail of the Grand Royale It was my partners 60th birthday treat and she was so disappointed The staff in the other hotel were very pleasant
9489,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I paid extra for the breakfast couldn t get in to eat dinning room full couldn t accommodate a table for 3 wanted us to sit 2 at one table 1 at another, The Location
9490,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms little small If you open your suitcase you will have to step over it to get to door or bathroom , Rooms slightly on small side but amazing value and location excellent and right on the park Super clean Well maintained rooms and bathrooms 
9491,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Sadly for the price it costs its just not worth the money The deluxe room is TINY and this was an upgrade Dread to think what we would have got if we hadn t Not clean enough and looking tired which you wouldn t expect from somewhere of this price range and star , Good location 2 mins from Queensway tube
9492,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Very small room with no space at all so it is hard to move The room we stayed in had a very small window at the top which you could not even open so the room itself was a bit dark and stuffy It felt a like living in a basement Furthermore you can hear everything through the walls for example when guests in a room above you wake up you can hear their steps If your breakfast is not included in a room rate make sure you pro actively ask the reception for a cheaper pre booked option when checking in Otherwise you are not informed pay more for the same when just coming for a breakfast in the morning and may have unpleasant surprise when checking out and discovering it At that moment nothing can be done as it is in the system already , Nice location next to tube stations and Hyde Park Beautiful interior at the reception and breakfast area unfortunately the lobby was closed for a private event throughout our whole stay Nice breakfast with a good variety of food 
9493,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, room to small for a double it did not feel like a deluxe room difficult to communicate with some of the staff, The breakfast room facilities Hotel location
9494,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing, Breakfast so much to choose from every taste catered for Nothing too much trouble for the staff I asked for a fried egg for my husband and minutes later along came two 
9495,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bedroom did not match the description on the website it was tiny and the bathroom was so small it was actually difficult to move in there We also paid extra for a club room but this just seemed to mean a bowl of fruit and a small bottle of wine were left in the room It was not the luxurious pampering advertised , The location Downstairs was beautifully decorated and the theatre bar was lovely 
9496,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Very noisy outside in the night and early morning Our room was at the back of the hotel and there were workmen outside early on saturday and sunday morning from 6 30am,No Positive
9497,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Everything, I have never stayed in a worse hotel Room to small very dirty not to mention chipped glass and carpet no isinglass a trip hazard I would rate this hotel a 1 star not a five star I feel cheated of my money 
9498,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The mixed gender toilets within the hotel were very cramped upon arrival Other than that i could not fault the hotel , Location was ideal for our visit to winter wonderland 
9499,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Staff very friendly good location right beside Hyde park and one minute walk from Queensway tube station on the central line very clean rooms just a bit small 
9500,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Windows couls not be opened the double bed a bit on the small side , for our purpose the location was perfect everything was fine as usual for London the rooms are small This is as a rule compensated by generous lobbies and lounges which really makes sense as you only sleep in your room The bathroom was modern good design and clean 
9501,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Very small room The room was so cold central heating doesn t work from 9am 6pm hotel policy they did get me a heater though Felt that towels and linen weren t so clean , Good location nearby parks and 2 minute walk to tube lots of stores and cafes around open late 
9502,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Nothing How on Earth can this Hotel be rated as a 4 star If it was not for this false rating I would never have booked this abysmal place

9505,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, rooms are very small related to the amount paid it is too expensive comparing with 4 stars hotels i paid over 150 pound night that a very high cost for this tiny room food and beverage are expensive they offer me to pay 80 pound for breakfast and i didn t not get it of course i am not in four seasons hotel so it is my only complain that the cost is too high related to what i get room size and food , location is amazing as it is easy to go anywhere from there loved the stuff they are so kind and helpful close to restaurants and coffee shops juts take care in shopping as other areas you can get better deals 
9506,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The adequacy of the room size appears to be pot luck The room I was in for the second period of my stay was much better than the first see my other review following the first period of my stay , Helpful staff good location 
9507,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, all the little stairs before you get to the room The shower door was very small no room to put your toiletries no room to hang the towel by the basin the walls were too thin I could hear my neighbor snoring the room service was only cold sandwiches ,No Positive
9508,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Had only one night would have liked to try the bar but it closed early Didn t have breakfast included in room rate that , The location is very central 2 minutes walk from Queensbury tube station yet quiet Gorgeous quintessentially English facade and common areas makes you feel going back in time Nice staff nothing a problem given free room upgrade to club room which was adequately spacious and had view of Hyde Park Free WiFi and tea coffee biscuits in room 
9509,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, the room we stayed in was a bit small and the 5 steps up into it were a bit unexpected the shower could do with a bit bigger shower screen curtain as the loo and floor got soaked while in it , the hotel is exactly as it is in the photos Its a truly fabulous place and wouldn t think twice of not going there again
9510,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms were to small , Good location next to restaurants and travel links clean hotel friendly staff gave us a complimentary extended check out Would stay again 
9511,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The temperature of the room and no air con The bathroom was very small with a sliding door and was very close to the first bed The shower would drench the whole bathroom floor , Complimentary gifts and the old interior
9512,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Unfortunately there is nothing Grand or Royal about this hotel I had room 404 The floor creaked the ceiling creaked as people in the room above me moved around The room was not clean old grubby fingermarks on both sides of the bathroom door weeks of dirt on the washbasin lamps corners of the bathroom hadn t been cleaned Housekeeping woke me up and walked in at 08 00am then back again at 09 00am even though checkout is specified as 12 00 noon I had an upgraded room to superior and it was tiny 25cms between the bed and the wall window God knows how small a standard deluxe room is , The only positive thing about this hotel is its location It is near the tube station and Queensway Hyde Park 
9513,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, not royal not grand the rooms are very small like prison cell not enough space for luggage maintenance very bad , location good nothing else 
9514,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Arriving after a 14 hs flight and being told my room was sold to sb else and no longer available even having my credit card as a guarantee After 20 minutes i got another room for extra price after complainig some more the extra charges were removed from my bill but this procedure is unacceptable Front desk and reservation department needs plenty of training in good manners and hotel service , the location is great safe close to the park and the tube
9515,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Dreadfully noisy Woken up very early sunday morning by people servicing building adjacent Don t stay on this side of hotel, Nice bar area and friendly enough staff small room but clean and tidy 
9516,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The superior room wasn t It was adequate but compact Lack of restaurant , The hotel and room were clean and comfortable Very close to underground stations 
9517,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, when I booked the room through Booking com I thought I was going to have the superior room on arrival I was given the club room BOX the shower was so tight I was not able to turn round it was that tight the wardrobe was in the worst place by the door which was not helpful on entering the room I thought the cost of the room was expensive as it was not the room I had booked with Booking com, I liked the hotel the staff were very nice and nothing was to much if we had a different room I m sure we would of have had a Much better time in the hotel
9518,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The staff who dealt with the initial arrival and stringent way they dealt with the hotel policy when they had no authority for specific information The misinformation the staff gave in relation to credit card provider and details of the credit card being passed to their finance dept when not authorised ,No Positive
9519,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was really quite small but for 108 per night from wowcher it was worth it considering the location There was quite a bit of noise in the early hours as the room was at the back of the hotel and backed onto shops getting they re deliveries etc And the air con heating didn t work properly flashed on the wall until I covered it with a towel Also the sink plug wouldn t close for my partner to have a shave in There was no view as the window was frosted we didn t eat in hotel maybe next time, The building was beautiful full of character it was clean and current
9520,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room just too small particularly if you have any luggage and who doesn t , This hotel did everything it could with the hand it was dealt The staff was very helpful and accommodating the room was well supplied reading lights and bedside tables on both sides nice bathroom with large towels window you could open fairly widely excellent free wi fi connection thoughtful tea tray tho we didn t use it The problem was that the room was so small we could not pass each other One had to hop on the bed for the other to walk around the room If you like to do calisthenics or yoga in your hotel room you will not be able to accomplish that in this room Also in staying 5 days we were in need of another bar of soap but it never was supplied 
9521,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The bathrooms were a tad small I had a bathtub my friend had a shower and the one with the shower was tiny Breakfast was good but expensive , The hotel is really beautiful inside It has an elevator not always the case in London and the staff are fantastic The beds are quite comfortable and it is in a great location 
9522,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Do not stay here I had a single room I didn t mind the small size of it however the bedroom AC only sent out hot air even though it was set at 17 degrees the plumbing in the bathroom made noise all night and there was a green light in the hallway ceiling that was too bright and lit up the room at night A really uncomfortable experience I got about 3 hours sleep , Nothing
9523,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms were small We had a club room which had only a double bed with very little space around it There was a curious little area by the windows with a desk which had no heating though you could close it off with a curtain Bathroom was very small with a tiny washbasin and shower no bath , A two minute walk from the Queensway tube station Gorgeous Building particularly the bar a former theatre and the dining room Breakfast was good too 
9524,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I thought the size of the room on arrival to be small disappointing misleading at time of booking The room didn t smell very clean I asked to be moved , The hotel is in a good location however I have stayed at much better hotels more centrally located 
9525,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Against the positives the hotel has some clear minuses starting from the size of the rooms we had booked a double deluxe room and we found ourselves in a ridiculously minuscule room where two people can hardly move at the same time and the bathroom was at best 4sq m As a side note one of the two lifts has been permanently out of service which made the waiting time to go up and down unbearably long A final warning for future possible customers some of the rooms the hotel offers are in the basement if you are unlucky enough to be assigned one of those rooms when checking in watch out you don t want to be there , Overall this is a nice hotel with some plusses a beautifual old style entrance hall and bar and equivalent large rooms for breakfast the staff is efficient and very courteous the breakfast buffet is quite reach 
9526,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, did not have a bad experience at all the only recommendation would be to have a larger shower , centrally located to where we wanted to go plus subway close by great area to walk and dine Loved everything its quaintness and staff were very dear and lovely 
9527,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Staff very noisy in the morning cleaning a room opposite when we were sleeping well trying to , Good location close to Albert Hall which was where we were going for a concert however not very close Very ornate and historical 
9528,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was ridiculously hot even with the air con on 17 degrees and the fan on full The pillows are very uncomfortable The room looks clean until you look at the skirting s or ledges , The staff were all friendly and accommodating The bedding is very clean and the bathroom is well equipped if a little small The breakfast is excellent
9529,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Absolutely gorgeous hotel the interior was amazing The rooms lovely as well Small but everything you need Lovely hand written welcome message Will definitely be back The location could not have been more perfect for us Our favourite London hotel so far
9530,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Parking was advertised to me that indicates parking on hand and easy and part of the hotel property under their control Was only parking on street or at very expensive private car park found space after 40 minutes, Great bed bathroom bit on tight side but good and modern
9531,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was as big as a shoe There wasn t even enough room to open the little foldable rack that you lay your suitcase on although there was one in the room, Interesting atmosphere in lobby
9532,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The rooms were incredibly small It was difficult for two people to sleep on a double bed we literally had to hop around the room There isn t even any space to open your bag I know rooms in London and specially in zone 1 are small I have lived in other hotels in central London as well but the room here were a big disappointment , The location was very nice 2 stops on tube from Oxford Circus and 2mins walk from Queensway and Bayswater tube station The hotel is located in a Victorian building 
9533,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was to small one could not pass between the bed and the window On one of my 3 day stay the room and bath have not been cleaned We found it in the evening as we had left it in the morning , Very good breakfast very nice staff good location 
9534,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, The location was perfect close to two tube lines that easily put us in different parts of the city The hotel was clean our room was quiet and the staff was friendly and personable 
9535,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Lobby is crowded and needs to be cleaned plus they need to put clocks in the room, The front desk staff was exceptional the nigh shift staff was cherry and helpful a nice bunch I was checked in by Gina who professional courteous and very knowledgable All in all an excellent experience
9536,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bar shuts early no ironing service Rooms are tiny so so small we had a club room supposedly bigger you couldn t open the wardrobe and exit the room or enter the bathroom over space then bathroom my guess 1M2, Good breakfast but an extra not included
9537,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The fruit was a nice add to but should have been checked before we went into the room because the banana left was rancid , Great location most of the staff were lovely It was lovely to have fruit on arrival in the room See other comment
9538,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Sheeets had spots it was all very dusty and the room was very tiny The girl at the reception was really rude The room was not serviced in the morning and when I returned to the hotel at 11 pm I found it as I had left in the morning , The position was very good there was a kettle in the room
9539,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The only little complaint I have is you need to clean the bathroom doors more often Mine was sticky The rest of the room was very clean though , The bar is stunning Actually the whole hotel is beautiful 
9540,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We were given two single beds pushed together rather than the double that we thought we had booked The room was a bit of a dungeon might suit some but for this couple it was not a happy outcome to a romantic evening , Good location and staff were delightful though ultimately unhelpful suggesting it would have been better if we had booked direct with them 
9541,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, despite booking this Hotel in January we were given rooms at top of hotel classed as Superior rooms They were more like attic rooms You could not walk around the small double bed However we were given complimentary breakfast ,No Positive
9542,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bar closes too early in the evenings Bar decor was a bit shabby and tired Single room although comfortable I felt in an exposed and remote situation at the back of the hotel The double lock on the door did not work and the safety chain could easily be broken if door forced ,No Positive
9543,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The noise on top Our room was below the conference and they did not move us when they had an event They were moving the furnitures and fixing the Mir conference room till 5am and we had hardly any sleep We kept on complaining but they only stopped early morning and started early , The cleanliness of the place and accessibility 
9544,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, Location close to Queensway Tube Station and bus stop for buses to the West End Opposite Kensington Gardens Hyde Park and very convenient for Royal Albert Hall V A Natural History Museum Theatre Bar public areas very good Room clean and good bathroom fitments that were very easy to use 
9545,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bedroom was very small and cramped with one side of double bed against a wall and not much space on other side for anything other than walking to bathroom Small desk at base of bed but not enough space to sit at the desk I was traveling alone so just needed somewhere to sleep , Good location with easy access to central London Friendly and helpful staff 
9546,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was really small and there are lots of stairs even within the room, The building is very nice with antique details Breakfast is really good Really close to the underground station
9547,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We were given a room that was as the last person left it ie towels everywhere and used bed etc etc Reception apologised and moved us immediately , Tube pretty much around the corner friendly staff and the breakfast was really good also all the royal parks in easy walking distance 
9548,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The shower is very small and my wakeup call was 20 minutes late my day of departure , The room was very quiet cleaned promptly daily tea and biscuits replenished daily and staff very helpful 
9549,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Certain staff were not knowledgeable and did not provide reliable assistance , Great location right near 2 major underground lines Rooms were small but manageable
9550,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Hotel took extra payment from credit card which wasn t refunded until arrival despite phone calls Breakfast not included in price very unusual these days English fluency not brilliant , Impressive reception rooms and breakfast room Good choice of breakfast Comfortable bed 
9551,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Small room But it is London , Great location Close to 2 underground stations Nice sandwich shop around the corner for a light breakfast Close to grocery shopping and dining Bar in hotel 
9552,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The staff is not polite and cannot even take the pain of answering to a good morning The rooms are ridiculously small and dirty The bathroom is simply a joke 1m This hotel is not worth even 1 star, Close to the Central Line
9553,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We arrived at Royale Hotel at Hyde Park where they took my payment for the room It was only after they took my payment that they then told us that there was maintenance issues within the building so they would have to re locate us to another hotel in Paddington They paid for our taxi but told us the taxi would be with us in 5 mins however we were made to wait 30 mins before i had to again ask the staff how long it would be The hotel itself was really nice just the whole point of us having to be re located after i had already made payment was not acceptable , The hotel we ended up staying in was actually very nice even though it was in a different location to where we had booked it 
9554,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Our room was nice but was a little cramped trying to walk around the bed the TV didn t have good reception , We thought the hotel was lovely and the staff were helpful and friendly
9555,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I had a ground floor room The view was of a brick wall and at times you could hear the tube arriving departing although it didnt disturb my sleep The rooms are very small , The hotel staff are really friendly The hotel is very handy for the tube station and is close to a number of shops and restaurants within walking distance 
9556,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Upon arrival there was one person at the desk who was on the phone which is understandable however after 5 minutes of not even any eye contact as acknowledgment and a mobile phone ringing constantly behind the desk as it was not switched on silent we were then greeted She told us our room was not ready so we could have a club room in the basement if we liked We did appreciate the upgrade from a double room but we still found it to be quite small When entering the room I immediately noticed the black marks all over the walls My partner then noticed a huge crack in the toilet seat I turned on the air con and dust visibly flew out so I ran my fingers over it and found that it indeed was covered in dust After informing the front desk and upon return to our room I was pleased to see the toilet seat was replaced and air con cleaned I decided to have a bath and noticed the plug was broken so in order to drain the water after my bath I had to annoyingly fiddle with it Then when flushing the toilet the actual button stuck and constantly flushed until I forced it to pull back out On my first night I had ordered and orange juice and glass of prosecco my orange juice which was visibly not being used anymore due to the water floating on top of it and the Orange juice sunken to the bottom was left and was still there when we were checking out I proceeded to write my comments in the leaflet provided After I finished writing I turned to the back of the leaflet and to top it off it was covered in some sort of sticky substance which just added to my frustration We looked at a range of hotels and chose yours as it is truly beautiful from the outside and seemed like somewhere we could enjoy staying at However we didn t even want to drink in the bar or relax in our room because we were that disappointed My partner was extremely unhappy too as this getaway was a gift for me Overall unfortunately this was not an enjoyable experience from start to finish , Entrance hall was beautiful
9557,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I know it was in a deal but the room was very small It was at the end of the top floor corridor in the eaves , Location to Hyde Park and Tube stations was superb
9558,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Do not order room service We ordered two panini s in the evening One Cheese Chicken and the other Cheese Pepperoni This was to come with a side salad and crisps This was a simple choice and we expected nothing fancy However when the dish arrived the panini was soggy and had also somehow been strewn over the plate the bottom of the panini stayed on one side the filling on the plate and the top of the panini had been squashed on the other side It looked as though a child had been playing with our food before it even arrived I took the food down to show the manager only to be told that that is how a panini should look I said I have eaten many panini s over the time and this is not how a panini should look the chef came and said oh I dont know how a panini should look I dont eat them This wasnt really the response I was hoping for So just to make you aware please dont order the room service you will be disappointed ,No Positive
9559,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was a bit small and breakfast was a little pricey but still within comfortable standards , Beautiful property with a great history Location couldn t be better Very close to Hyde and Kensington Park Staff was helpful and prompt with request Breakfast room was STUNNING It was close to two tube stations so it was very accessible for travel I would definitely stay there again 
9560,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel the staff were really helpful professionally and friendly The room was beautiful clean and comfortable The breakfast was great I will be recommending this hotel to my friends 
9561,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, The excellent staff especially Aijaz and Rita They were very helpful and and gave great suggestions Generally a very pleasant stay Would highly recommend 
9562,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Clean modern bathroom but very cramped, Great location very friendly and efficient staff and lovely and clean Interesting history of this hotel with pictures and write ups in the reception 
9563,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We were moved from Grand Royale to Shaftesbury International up the road I agreed because I was told the replacement was the same standard It wasn t We were upgraded to a Club Room which was tiny Hair on floor in bathroom and hair in towels Specks of dirt in bed some sort of ironing residue The hotel was next door to some sort of hostel with a rowdy group of drinking buddies outside , Staff were pleasant and helpful 
9564,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Maybe I haven t got my head around London pricing yet but I couldn t understand why a glass of red wine and a bacardi coke in the Theater bar should cost considerably more than a breakfast We did get better value in bars located nearer the hotel , Staff were superb we didn t meet a bad person all week Lots of choice for breakfast the room was more than adequate for our needs if I m a bit picky a spruce up with a paint brush wouldn t have gone a miss and we loved the building The location was spot on for us too and would like to stay at this hotel for all of our London visits in the years to come Thank you 
9565,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Deluxe Double Room is grossly misrepresented in the hotel s online advertising over a nine day stay my room was never cleaned properly and if luckily the bedding which was old and worn may have been changed 1 time On several occasions I saw the Front Desk Staff engage in quite unpleasant discussions with guests who arrived to find that their booking had to been honoured or those like myself who were very unhappy with the accommodation I was promised an upgrade to a Club Room after 1 night but the Front Desk never followed up on this , Yes the Lobby and Formal Drawing Room are quite stunning as is the Theatre but it all stops there
9566,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing negative to say but if I was forced to give something it would be that the pillows are hard and uncomfortable , The building and interior decor is beautiful and in keeping with its history 
9567,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, the room size is terrible small for us from ASIA to LONDON cant stay in this hotel because we cant even open one luggage No space to walk around and even place your products or hang your clothes the room is even smaller than JAPAN room I think winter period not advise for long haul flight to stay here do not have the space to place or even pack thing we need to hop around dam funny for us we are consider petite sizes and we need to hop around the room hahaha good work out for us this hotel is good for 3 days 2 nites short stay with one small bag , the location great for jogger that can jog at the park or different stations to different locations this is why l like this hotel one lady I think assistant manager or manager I like her she is helpful and great the bellboy group also helpful too share more than you ask that kind of answer you will receive request thing fast to deliver to us 
9568,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, One small thing that could be improved is the glass shower screen on the bath shower was not big enough , Good price and convenient location for the tube The hotel is next to Hyde Park so a nice walk through the park to either Oxford Street or Harrods etc 
9569,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Difficult to get around the bed duvet too small lovely view of the bins from neighbouring shops, Excellent location comfortable room enjoyable breakfast
9570,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Decor is dreadfully bland and whole place feels soul less The reception and bar are particularly small and totally lacking in comfort not even enough chairs It is a beautiful old building but has been badly modernised and in no way is this a four star hotel APART from the great staff , Great bathroom very good breakfast and great location just 5 mins walk to Hyde Park Lancaster Gate tube station and a few nice pubs 
9571,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, A little expensive for the average traveller We were last minute booking or would have chosen elsewhere in the area They tried to bill us for breakfast we didn t have and very disorganized on check out , Close to tube station and Kensington Park 
9572,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, The staff was friendly and helpful The rooms were clean the beds comfortable and the bathroom large for a London hotel Close to multiple tube stations great location Will be staying here again 
9573,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, room was substandard for price and did not have fore poster bed nor queen size beds as per advert and confirmed by reception breakfast was wrong on both mornings bar closed at 11am no dining in the evening, the decor of the hotels reception area and bar were very nice
9574,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We were in room 026 Very noisy from 7am Doors banging constantly we could constantly hear the bleeping of a key pad followed by another door banging We had asked for a quiet room Also a small point re the wardrobe Hanging space not long enough for clothes perhaps one shelf should be taken out , Beautiful building staff very welcoming professional 
9575,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Pricing of a single person 3 5x2 m room adjacent small shower was unreasonable I don t know how the picture of the bed was made It must have been made before they built the walls around the room Could not have been more than 50 cm between bed and wall on one side only Had to stack furniture on the cabinet to have access to bed from bathroom Unpractical cabinet to stow luggage while there was no room to leave it in the room , Lively neighborhood access to underground close to Hydepark for a run very pleasant hard working and well trained staff alert security service to keep a watch on a drunk guest Classic Grand hotel surroundings 
9576,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, i booked a double room for 2 person but when i reached on that day they gave us 2 single room due to some maintenance problem of them yet still changed us to other property with double room ,No Positive
9577,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Every thing expansive room is dark no refrigerator the bathroom door is very old and locked us inside many times my mistake is I paid for my whole stay in advance , Location
9578,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was very warm and we had to prop a window open to get fresh air The mattress was probably past its use by date The shower screen was not wide enough for us to stop water going onto the floor , The hotel is conveniently located a one minute walk from the station but far enough away from the main road to ensure no noise at night Being opposite Hyde Park was also an advantage There are plenty of services located nearby shops restaurants ATMs We wanted Olde English d cor and we got it 
9579,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing, The hotel has a fantastic central location close to Hyde Park Very close to Paddington Station enabling easy access to Heathrow Express Heathrow Airport as well as St Pancras Station for Eurostar to Paris Loved the historic building elegantly furnished and decorated Very friendly and helpful staff was the icing on the cake We were delighted to be offered an upgrade to a Club Room Would definitely stay here again 
9580,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, As with many big cities rooms and bathrooms are quite small even in the Club rooms , Great location with easy access to Queensway and Bayswater tube stations and about 15 minutes walk from Paddington Station Airport Express Good eateries in Westbourne Grove and good Chinese eateries in Queensway Edwardian dark oak panelling through public rooms is impressive 
9581,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was too small with VERY cerky floor poor sound proof low ceiling and very dirty window, The location is very good nearby 2 metro station and the Hyde Park is just across the street
9582,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was a bit claustrophobic often seen in older UK properties Would appreciate a second chair so that both residents could sit simultaneously , We selected the location for easy access to amenities transportation etc but the elegance of the property made us look forward to returning home at the end of a hectic day 
9583,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Not quite walking distance to Paddington Room was small and oddly configured with about 8 stairs from the door to the room Breakfast was expensive coffee better around the corner , Good location near Queensway and the park and Paddington Grand and impressive pleasant to stay in nice bar 
9584,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was tiny I have never stayed in a room so small ever The quilt was not big enough to cover both of us The bathroom is tiny and down a set of stairs No where to put anything because the room is so small , The entrance is amazing staff were friendly 
9585,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Although we were advised we had received an upgrade on our room our room was tiny Felt very claustrophobic especially in the bathroom e g very tight squeeze getting out of the shower hit my knee on the sink the first day Net curtains were dirty window broken and had a horrible view of a dirty alley from our window If this was the upgrade I dread to think what our original room would have been like For a 4 star hotel and the amount we paid I would not have expected any of these things , Location was good and room was clean and bed comfortable
9586,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, The hotel is well situated to get around the city I travelled alone and had a single room which was just fine for me Comfortable and clean a nice bar as well 
9587,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We had to climb a narrow staircase and walk along very narrow corridors to our room The room was too small for its description as a Superior Double If we had not benefited from a big room rate discount we should have been very dissatisfied , Check in was efficient The room was clean tidy and well equipped Location near Kensington Gardens bus routes and two tube stations was very good 
9588,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, the rooms are a bit worn down and showing their age For the price and location its still a good deal , location to hyde park and underground Breakfast is great 
9589,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bed very uncomfortable on last night for some strange reason Fine for rest of stay Spoilt the overall impression , Lots of places to eat nearby Quite central and not too noisy 
9590,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The staff is friendly but not well organised They kept us waiting in front of them in the lobby for almost 2 hours for our room over the announced checkin time , The hotel is very close to 2 different metro lines and thus you can easily get anywhere in London Also the hotel is very nicely maintained and the lobby with its old sofas and wooden walls is simply beautiful 
9591,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Simple things the duvet was far too small for the bed The coffee and sugar were not replenished when asked When having a shower the screen was so small that water went all over the floor , Cold iced water when requested Nothing was too much trouble Perfect location 
9592,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room very very small I booked a double and it felt claustrophobic for 1 glad there wasnt 2 of us No restaurant and room service menu limited Room needed redecorating and as an older female I would have appreciated a little help with my luggage up and down front steps No porter and reception ignored me I am a regular visitor to London and usually stay 4 5 star and I just feel grand royal could do better, Location
9593,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was very small and was quite stifling with no opening windows or room air conditioning ok for 1 night, Great location for us as we were attending the Radio 2 concert in Hyde Park Lovely building and very clean with welcoming polite staff
9594,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I choose a club room which I paid a little more for however although it had everything you would expect it was quite small with a window only 2 foot wide , I absolutely loved the original features within the hotel The corn icing the wood panelling the oringal windows absolutely wonderful The bar on the second floor where Lillie langtree aparently entertained guest is quirky and charming Comfortable beds Just around the corner from a tube station and opposite Hyde park 
9595,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing really Room was really small but had everything required so we would stay there again , Excellent location friendly and helpful staff stored our luggage after check out clean and comfortable room Very convenient for several buses and it was lovely to just cross the road and be in Kensington Gardens 
9596,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We didn t try breakfast at the hotel as 15 seemed far too expensive , Quiet hotel Lovely area Close to pubs supermarkets and two tube stations Metres away from the lovely Hyde Park 
9597,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Everything the rooms are small and cramped the staff are just there not welcoming or even happy looking They freeze money in your account you at the bill on arrival and the don t free I your Monet until about three days after your stay Disgusting, Nothing
9598,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We requested them to change to a suite on day one since rooms were very small and they did not give us one , Few of the staff members were really helpful specially one Aijaz Divecha 
9599,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The only thing we didn t like is one of the managers on duty during the day showed very little concern for the customer Awful to have to deal with Fortunately the rest of the staff made up for him , Location awesome Beautiful building 
9600,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The checking in and checking out processes are very slow with staff not taking any notice of people arriving Serving people in the wrong order is just annoying first come first served should be respected Not enough of a problem to be negative but be prepared to be assertive , Good location for Hyde Park Queensway tube station is just around the corner Pleasant and traditional hotel with wooden panelled reception and large lounge yet modern rooms and good facilities for a one night stay 
9601,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was tiny Like a renovated closet yet everything was there as it was obviously well planned out , Quaint little hotel Everything was clean and comfortable Staff very helpful Ideal area from which to walk to most places Air conditioning was good Best wifi I have experienced in years 49mg at least 
9602,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room could be bigger but I can t complain given its ideal location in London , We were moved from the hotel to a sister hotel Shaftesbury Hotel The shower is amazing even though the bathroom is quite small Not surprising given the hotel is in London The staff was great to accommodate us 
9603,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, That rhe hotel did not have a dinner service or any out of hours room service if you felt hungry This is poor as where the hotel is based you can not buy any food after 11pm, Clean room friendly staff

9612,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Arrived to find there were boiler problems They tried to palm us off with another hotel which was inferior and had a walk up price 33 cheaper than what i had paid We have experienced this excuse multiple times in london so stood our ground Another room was conveniently found for us after not accepting their offer ,No Positive
9613,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Nothing really , I liked the name of your hotel I liked the look of your hotel I liked eating breakfast in your hotel I liked all of your staff the quality of service care we received during our 6 night stay in your hotel Your hotel was grand enough for this Aussie Princess her bloke 
9614,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms are tiny, The location was perfect and very convenient to Queensway tube stop The staff were very friendly and helpful Beautiful decor in main areas The room was clean and well maintained during my stay The bed was really comfortable 
9615,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, My reservation was for two bed It was not available when we checked in It became available 3 days later Your front desk did a fantastic job that we decided to stay and I am glad we did , Front desk service Special thanks to Ms Enrika Very friendly 
9616,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, The location was perfect for access to the Notting Hill carnival The bed was really comfortable despite the cosy room size The staff were very friendly and helpful 
9617,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Lack of variety on the room service menu problems with key cards , The staff were wonderful and very attentive beautiful decor and excellent location 
9618,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Staff did not acknowledge you when coming and going Rooms very small Cannot move around furniture Bathroom was the size of a closet , Location Decor in main areas 
9619,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, My room was really small and had a large twin sized bed Didn t really have a restaurant breakfast only but that wasn t a problem as I found restaurants in the area to eat in , I liked the atmosphere The Staff were very helpful to a first timer in London Me The room was clean and well maintained during my stay 
9620,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, the room is not practical difficult to open the window stairs after the door to get in the room loss of space no cover on the bath so the water gets all around the bathroom hairdryer attached to drawer but not enough space to sit down on the chair am I supposed to steel the hairdryer there were small flies, it was a clean room overall except from the small flies 
9621,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I would have liked breakfast to have been included in our stay We were offered it at a reduced rate but it would have been easier if it was included in the initial price as an option , Everything basically The room was great the bed was comfortable the location was great and the staff we very welcoming and we particularly liked the Happy Hour in the Theatre Bar 
9622,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Fire alarm kept going off plugs did not work one morning and staff did not know the jogging route mentioned in the hotel guest guide Rooms not serviced promptly and at our convenience, The location and decor
9623,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Upon arrival we had to wait 10 minutes in the rain before someone could help us bring our 7 suitcases up the stairs into the reception area We had booked and paid for two of the same rooms as we were a group of 4 people One of our rooms were a downgrade from the other the rooms did not have the same appliances and one room had less space than the other We asked to be moved so we could both have the same room type and they said yes but never got round to it We had to wait over an hour for some ice buckets We found a thick long transparent plastic string in one of plates of breakfast and the restaurant staff actually looked into my hair and told me it was my hair because nobody in the kitchen has that hair We accidentally dropped salmon on our bed sheets and it smelt really bad so we asked if we could have a new duvet They gave us an uncovered single duvet for our double bed so when we asked for a double the night porter gave us the same dirty salmon duvet that we had put on the floor outside the room When we confronted him about it he shouted you cannot expect us to clean the bedding everyday My card was overcharged by 264 when I had checked out When I rang the hotel to let them know they said it s not their fault it s my bank When I called my bank they had given me 2 preauth codes proving the hotel were holding an extra 264 from my card and they had to fax my bank to allow the to cancel it The manager was unable to use his own fax machine so he sent me the fax letter through email and he made it my duty to get it faxed to a bank They are highly unprofessional and I will never ever stay at this hotel again It is appauling and disgusting , After explaining to the manager all of the terrible things we experienced at this hotel We were given complimentary breakfast for bothh days and 20 refund although I believe our whole stay should ve been refunded 
9624,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Size of the club room we were in Very small Luckily we travelled light , Nice hotel with mostly friendly staff Great location with fantastic access to Hyde park and Queensway tube 3 minutes walk away 
9625,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Very small room quite a challenge with two suitcases , We were transferred to their sister hotel The Shaftsbury due to some problem with water supply to some of the rooms so this review is actually for that hotel We were given a very small room which had everything you needed and was clean and comfortable but it is just as well that we are smallish people and reasonably fit as the bed was right against the wall and one of us had to climb over the other to get in or out We were given free breakfast every day in compensation of the move which was greatly appreciated and the staff were all lovely The hotel is very close to both Bayswater and Queensway tube stations and to Hyde Park 
9626,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Lots of ladies entering the hotel at random hours of the night and visiting various rooms I guess they must have been looking for something they lost , Not much
9627,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, very small and by the way they gave me a club room I cannot imagine the sizes of the other rooms not very clean No room service Wifi is Zaft always disconnect Expensive The view of room is horrible, location
9628,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, 4am smoke alarm causing everyone to attend the main foyer for an hour on Thursday 26 9 15 Also relatively small rooms and dining room staunch ions need removal , Friendly service good breakfasts close to public transport and parks 
9629,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Cleanliness of rooms is challenging There was a bit of misunderstanding regarding on room upgrade but they managed it quickly , Perfect location beautiful building great staff Extremely good service

9631,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Reception staff poor upon arrival 6 staff behind reception seemingly dealing with 1 unhappy guest whilst we stood there finally someone came to check us in He demanded full payment straight away which is fine then told us our room was not ready this was 3pm check in is 2pm not a good start , Location was excellent clean room 
9632,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The rooms are very small I booked a deluxe double room which is supposed to be bigger than a superior double room but it is difficult to imagine a room smaller than the one I had There was not enough space to get out of one side of the double bed The fire alarm went off at 4am not the hotel s fault but the following night I was kept awake by faulty door chimes which I couldn t stop from flashing green and red it was like trying to sleep in a night club , The fire alarms seem to work Staff are pleasant and professional Building full of character 
9633,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The wifi kept clicking off and there was only one shower gel but over all amazing, The bathroom bed the kind staff and breakfast plus the hotel amazing 
9634,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The fire alarm went off at 4am It was chaos No one knew what to do Proper legal protocol was not followed Poor communication from the staff And not one word of an apology until we brought it up the next morning It spoilt out overnight stay The hotel could be fabulous Just staff and decor in some rooms let it down , The hotel in the main is stunning But the rooms need sorting We had a hole in the wall and it desperately needs fixing up My mum and stepdaughter got lots of complimentary things chocolates drinks etc we didn t 
9635,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, My room was smelly and small hence beds are small for couples no space in the room to store my luggage the lady in the reception showed me other rooms which still small and we have to pay extra money for no value , The location is near to shops subway and hyde Park staff are excellent and helpful 
9636,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was extremely small Despite being located on the first floor you feel like in the basement small unopenable window half bricked up You have to climb up the stairs to the bed the bathroom you cannot turn around Poor working wifi , Friendly staff good location room was clean 
9637,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Moved to another hotel at the eleventh hour situated on the ground floor of an annex next to the front door and lift I booked above ground Had to cross a road to go to breakfast , The staff were lovely
9638,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was small and the small window did not make the room very light , Staff were friendly and professional Very clean Lovely breakfast which was well worth the money 
9639,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, No facecloths a MUST for me Bath was too high to comfortably access shower for someone my age 72 No dining room music A BIT DISMAL, Staff were excellent room very comfortable but a bit colourless Lounge is gorgeous as is theatre bar 
9640,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We didn t have a bad experience, Hotel in a lovely quiet area 2 tube stations right around the corner with access straight to city centre in 5 mins had a lively time and would definitely return 
9641,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was on the small side and the electronic maid service alarm kept buzzing in the night and at times in the morning , The building was beautiful and very impressive 
9642,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Windows didn t open We had to wait for our room although were offered a room on the lower ground floor instead, Although small the rooms were designed around making the most of the space Good selection at breakfast 
9643,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, I have updated my room to luxury room on booking website but I didn t got it And the breakfast was included and also they said you have to pay another 12 00 each for breakfast that s not fair I got the deal on booking com and when you arrive giving you different things and different deal, I liked the location was so close to the station Room was clean bathroom was clean
9644,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The size of the room was very or should I say extremely small Hardly can move or have place to keep our laguge , The staff were very friendly and helpful Loved the location and very quite WiFi was good 
9645,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Although there is a main elevator climbing up and down side stairs a bother with bags , Lovely old style hotel very retro British lobby and exterior Room was renovated and shower room new and functional 
9646,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bathroom could have been a little larger showerscreen far too small , Very friendly helpful staff Ground floor kept in it s original style Good value breakfast 
9647,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Deluxe double was a VERY small room could barely walk around the bed the ceilings were also low on 6th floor so when I was in shower I nearly hit my head on ceiling and I m only 5 foot 4 there were no special out of ordinary touches eg refrigeration guest robes iron or board in room there was a kettle and blow dryer it was clean however I would rate this a 3 star, Lovely ornate lobby perfect safe location 1 block from underground The facade of building is what makes the building
9648,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Read my comment above, Rooms are too small from what updated in the online same like prison room entry disappointed with the service from morning desk as they are claiming the picture advertised is not under thier responsibility they don t give me option to cancel the booking at all I need to pay more pounds to upgrade the room but that room also with unreasonably limited space with higher paying rate Only satisfied with the service of night shift Manager and team Aijaz Aurel Charlie
9649,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Unable to take a shower without soaking the tiny bathroom , Lovely location comfortable room we had a club room which was okay in size the smaller rooms would have been very compact 
9650,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Bar closes early for a Saturday Room was very small and although it was on 1st floor wasn t possible to open window Maids are very noisy in the morning, Location
9651,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Our room was hidden away in the basement but then it was one of the cheaper rooms , The lobby and communal rooms are beautiful and provide a fantastic environment to chill out in 
9652,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, the 1st night was terrible we were arranged to a single room in the basement where our luggages couldn t be opened because of the limited spaces When we opened our room you need to walk up the stairs really terrible But we paid over 2000 dollars HOng kong Very unhappy and disappointed We complained and the manager upgraded us to club room which was acceptable for the rest of my stay ,No Positive
9653,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, At first a staff gave me a room on first floor that i had to walk up many stairs and through a long corridor with my big heavy luggage Luckily another lady arranged a room on ground floor for me that made me feel more comfortable , Good location in a safe residential area The hotel offered subtle bus to Heathrow airport which helped me a lot because I traveled alone and was carrying a big luggage 
9654,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Duvet too small for comfort told we could request for down pillows n bedding never came bed softer than most other places we ve stayed in london bed n bedding duvet pillows poor sub standard quality does not match to your hotel image Quite disappointing Bedroom though small is expected but configuration awkward opens bathroom door to block access to basin tight n squeezy even for one Really need to look into that , Staff n location great
9655,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Rooms was very compact and didn t look four star which was a shame as the hotel itself was gorgeous and staff fantastic, The style of hotel and location was fantastic
9656,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was just far too small to justify the price tag Not enough room for one let alone two suitcases The bathroom was more like a broom closet , Breakfast was good 
9657,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, No open windows Open door to accommodation to be greeted by five steps Also does not overlook hyde park as advertised, Clean bathroom and towels at all timescale
9658,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The rooms are little small but i think for the money i paid I got the best value Good job Grand Royal hotel , Location customer service breakfast was served in very best room What ever i asked they were more then happy to help 
9659,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, On check in we was told we had to be relocated due to a maintenance issue The chap who dealt with this didn t do so in the best manner what upset us the most was the hotel option was not as good and cheaper than yours and when I said we will cancel and I would book elsewhere myself we was allowed to stay This ruined our start to our stay Marks on all bedroom walls and a toe nail clipping on bedroom Carpet small bedroom also , Great location fantastic breakfast of very high quality foods Theatre bar and original features are impressive 
9660,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Very small rooms just fit a double bed with small staircase to the bathroom which was tiny I guess its because of the location which was excellent, Very good location and also nice common rooms
9661,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, For the third time I was bumped out of the hotel upon arrival to another in the group The other hotel had a lift out of order the TV worked when the porter shook it and a large bathroom towel hook fell off the wall on my foot I am fed up with not being able to stay at the hotel I booked and I am meant to be on their partner frequent stay list What was worse while waiting for a taxi to go to other hotel they were booking other solo travellers in , I chose this because of location and I liked it 
9662,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Despite being upgraded to club the room was tiny and the window opened to the staff entrance which was noisy and busy with people smoking I asked to email the manager but no email was sent to me with his contact details , A double superior room was booked and on arrival we where upgraded to club
9663,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, small rooms and expensive as far as quality and price is concerned, Really nice location in the centre The staff was really helpfull and polite The rooms were clean 
9664,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, the bedroom was small in spite of being told we were getting an upgrade it makes me wonder what the downgrade was like the bed itself was uncomfortable, the desk staff were very helpful 
9665,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Towels were rough , Elegant hotel a block away from banks two subway stations one stop from Paddington train station and near restaurants Nicely decorated rooms and has an elevator Breakfast rooms are auper elegant and breakfast is outstanding full English breakfast buffet for 12 per person prepaid Staff is very nice and helpful They have a nice bar area and a reception area with computer and printer area It is a great hotel and right across the street from Kensington and Hyde parks 
9666,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The initial room we had was very small and we had to upgrade to a bigger one The mattress felt as if it was very old as it was extremely soft and the springs felt broken , The staff were very accomodating and helpful and the position was great 
9667,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The room was tiny Just enough space to walk around the bed There was a computer that guest could use but the printer s cartridge was depleted and it was not changed after a request to do so , Nice and helpful staff Beautiful lobby and sitting room on the ground floor and frescoed ceilings in the older part of the building Well kept property and it has elevators The location is convenient to buses at the street corner and subway a block away Short walk to the Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park As to the room the A C was optimal and you could open the window although just a bit if you wanted to 
9668,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, However the rooms were compact and we were asked on arrival if we wanted to upgrade for free to a club room which was bigger than the room we had booked The club room turned out to be compact and the bath was tiny No view as it was on the lower ground floor Wouldn t stay here again , The hotel was good overall with a bus route straight to Piccadilly 
9669,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We were transferred to a sister hotel as the boiler wasn t working The alternate hotel is advertised as 4 star I don t think this rating was gained via the normal national rating system as it doesn t come close to other 4 star rated hotels I have stayed in It does not meet the high standard expected of a 4 star The bedroom was small and cramped the room smelt and the bathroom was worn tattered unclean and the breakfast was average It was a real disappointment , All the staff where lovely and very helpful
9670,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, The rooms were a little on the small side but adequate Can t say anything negative as it has great location clean rooms and friendly and helpful staff , Value for money s The manager also left a personal welcome note for us in our room along with some little luxury items chocolates wine and soft drinks The children were delighted to have some goodies delivered room service too Excellent start to our holiday 
9671,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Room was a little small for U S standards but I was expecting it to be much smaller based on previous reviews very comfortable size for a European hotel Pillows were a little hard and creeking floors from guests in room above were at times annoying but very minor No shower curtain but that s a European thing , The hotel was in a perfect location between 2 Tube stops giving you access to 3 Tube lines a very high end hotel at a reasonable price and staff were great Loved the beautiful interiors of the lobby stairs lounge and dining room Room was very modern and up to date loved the high ceilings Breakfast was excellent but started late so we didn t always eat breakfast there 
9672,Grand Royale London Hyde Park,No Negative, The hotel is superbly located especially if you are attending a concert at the Royal Albert Hall as we were Rooms are clean and staff very helpful The buffet breakfast is sure to satisfy all tastes 
9673,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, Paid the supplement for the larger deluxe room but still very compact in size , Friendly and efficient staff Great location and ideally placed for West London visits and proximity to Paddington Station Good quality well cooked breakfast Nice heritage styling to reception rooms and theatre bar for drinks 
9674,Grand Royale London Hyde Park, We were put into the Park Grand paddington as the grand royale had a water problem We had paid for a superior double but our room was so small we couldn t even stand up next to each other in it A truly awful hotel , free wifi
