182233,Chiswick Rooms, Oh come on if you really need something fridge is quite small P, I m repeating myself this was my third or fourth time here always coming back at least once a year 
182234,Chiswick Rooms, Tiny room Extremely rude staff No accommodations for handicaps No elevator Had to walk up 3 flights of stairs with a broken ankle heavy suitcase I m a 62yr old woman Staff wouldn t even talk to me let alone try to help When I asked if it was possible to call a cab the next morning I was told to walk to the cab office with my broken ankle Room was very expensive Room was so small my suitcase wouldn t fit in the room Seriously that small ,No Positive
182235,Chiswick Rooms, We were awoken by someone opening the door to our room at 01 15 in the morning As I was then awake I went to reception at 01 30 to enquire what was going on to be told that the night porter had assumed our room was unoccupied and allocated a key card to a couple checking in at 1am in the morning We received no apology nor appreciation of our concern for this breach in security from neither the night porter nor the duty manager when we once again reported this incident the following morning The safe in our room was also not functioning We would suggest to future guests to take care with security when using this hotel in future , Room was clean some of the staff friendly
182236,Chiswick Rooms, Bed wasn t very comfortable mattress was lumpy Kettle didn t fit under the sink tap so had to fill it by the glass There was a fridge but it wasn t cold so didn t keep my milk from spoiling overnight there were little pots of milk but I like more than that Wifi said it gave access for 3 days but had to keep signing back in minor It was also rather expensive for outside of central London , Good location near tube Stamford Brook District Line and also had several restaurants cafes and a Sainsbury s local nearby Modern clean room good shower good safe good air conditioning essential in the heatwave Went for a very good and inexpensive breakfast to a cafe not the posh one on the corner but a few doors down beyond it

182239,Chiswick Rooms, The room was in the back which would not have been a problem had not it been dark because of a small window facing the backyard Unfortunately the darkness of the bedroom underlined its being quite compact , Great location easy access to public transportation shops and restaurants The bathroom is compact but very well organised and equipped 
182240,Chiswick Rooms, Minor things the room was cleaned but there were few hairs on the bed linen No breakfast provided No windows , The room was modern and quite simple with essentials for one overnight stay The place is not noisy and therefore allows for nice resting The shower was very comfy The personnel is also kind and helpful

182244,Chiswick Rooms, Room and bathroom was very small not a lot of room for movement at all I couldn t imagine it being a comfortable stay for 2 people , Location very close to good restaurants and bars Very close to Stamford Brook station so travel into and around city is very good 
182245,Chiswick Rooms, Nothing, Location Close to the metro only a two minutes walk There was a nice italian restaurant La Toscana around the corner The hotel had everything I needed for one night Would definitely return 
182246,Chiswick Rooms, Woken up in the night by the fire alarm for no apparent reason Having no parking available is a big negative , Did what it said on the tin clean and comfortable albeit all in a very small space Nice quite room at the back of the hotel Great cafe next door for breakfast 
182247,Chiswick Rooms,No Negative, Small quiet hotel just next to the metro station Staff was friendly room small but clean and everything was just as described and shown on the photos Cosy neighbourhood 
182248,Chiswick Rooms, Wifi would work with 2nd device despite being asked at check in how many devices I wanted to use , For an overnight stay it was a great location for me and a clean place 
182249,Chiswick Rooms, Cleaning of the room afther the first day was not good, The hotel and district are perfect just a little of time to arrive to place and centre more or less 30 40 minutes of underground A lot of restaurants and metro is really close
182250,Chiswick Rooms, The loo smelt a bit mouldy although there was no sight of mould However I asked to be moved and that was done without hesitation, Good transport links the room was clean well presented and functional The staff were friendly and helpful Easy access to multiple restaurants and shops 
182251,Chiswick Rooms, the Hotel boasts of having iPod docking station with music being able to be played in the shower this is a complete lie as the rooms doesn t include this rather has a device which is called iHandy this is like a mobile phone which allows for free calls when i raised this issue to the receptionist they suggested that i use the tv and put a higher volume so i could hear it from the shower had a top floor room which was very humid the bathroom had a weird smell to it overpriced for the room size as well as the facilities , close to train station and local high street
182252,Chiswick Rooms, Paying extra for late check out when we checked in late , It was close to a party we needed to go to We needed a bed and shower of which both were great 
182253,Chiswick Rooms, No breakfast option but if that keeps cost down then not too bothered , If you re looking for somewhere just to lay your head while visiting London this place is perfect Right across from an underground station so you re well connected Staff were lovely friendly and smiley and room was small but spotlessly clean Great price 
182254,Chiswick Rooms, The bed could have been more comfortable Also there seemed to be no way to turn off the bed lamps without taking out the room s key card And they could use a little guide to say what number it is to call reception , The staff were polite and helpful 
182255,Chiswick Rooms, Room size and better thought out electrical sockets, Very handy for where we were going Hammersmith Apollo Only a couple of stops away by tube Room clean only minor gripes room very small and lead from kettle would only reach the socket with a stretch but as I said only minor things that stopped it from getting top marks
182256,Chiswick Rooms, My room over looked the road by the traffic lights so was a little noisy The rooms at the back where I stayed on a previous visit are quieter , Excellent location and excellent value for money Staff are all lovely Rooms are really smart with a nice airy feel and a really modern finish Bathrooms are compact but shower is extremely powerful Would stay again and would recommend 
182257,Chiswick Rooms, Pictures shown on booking com are slightly unfair The room was small was the only unpleasant thing that made the stay shorter so we left one night early You have no place to go round the room at least we did not in the room that we were given They might have bigger rooms but ours was small , The room was clean and the cleaning lady came everyday The location is close to public transport also pubs and restaurants 
182258,Chiswick Rooms, The staircase is fairly small and narrow making it a little difficult getting a chunky or heavy suitcase up to the top floor The hotel was very warm considering we went in January Spent the night with the air con until 5 in the morning Lacks facilities You have a reception and your room and that is it It s ideal for somewhere to leave your bags behind while you go out for a meal and then back to the room , A quaint and neat hotel in a great location where you re spoiled for choice to go for food Reasonably priced and the rooms are pretty modern and clean 
182259,Chiswick Rooms, It would have been nice to have had a carpet on the floor but I understand from a hygiene point of view a hard floor is good 2 hangers for towels would have been good too , Clean and tidy quiet the hairdryer was a bonus good showers All very easy and simple and very good value Chiswick is a good location 
182260,Chiswick Rooms, That you had to log on to the wifi everyday fill in the username and password, The reception staff was extremely hospitable the location was excellent a 1minute walk from Stamford Brook tube station which meant traveling to the centre was very quick and convenient The room was extremely clean and you could control the temperature yourself and open a window 
182261,Chiswick Rooms, Room is very small hard to store any luggage Stairs to upper floors are narrow and steep , Exactly as expected Quiet room not facing the street Modern bathroom 
182262,Chiswick Rooms, Meagre duvet bed not very comfortable frame looked like a camp bed mattress not comfy either I phone docking station in the radio alarm out of date , Very friendly welcome from the male receptionist very close to the tube good shower 
182263,Chiswick Rooms, Beds are worst in every room very noisy when you move Beds have legs This is very bad designing beds You could have flat types of bed that touch whole floor so it won t make noise Besides bed everything is good And time I like 6am 6pm is best time , cleaness tidy
182264,Chiswick Rooms, It is an extremely overpriced facility the room was so small that 2 people at the same time could not stand in the room The space was so limited that we couldn t open the suitcase properly but this was not the worst part the room was not properly cleaned dust everywhere the sheets and duvet were obviously not thorough cleaned plus extra bonus the smell of mould as you entered the room extremely poor facility and sooooo overpriced i wouldn t recommend it to anyone ,No Positive
182265,Chiswick Rooms, I didn t like how thin the duvet was I didn t like the quality of the bed itself as you could feel the mattress springs I didn t like the cramped conditions of the room , I enjoyed the bathroom as the shower was really nice I also enjoyed the square designs that sat where a bed post would sit 
182266,Chiswick Rooms,No Negative, Very clean Small rooms with everything you want Very close to many food outlets and the underground Helpful staff My daughter was ill and we stayed for three nights while she recuperated Everything was very convenient 
182267,Chiswick Rooms, The tea and coffee in the room wasn t of the best quality I think one of the coffees was out of date The shower was very small , Conveniently located near Stamford Brook tube station Ideal if you are just looking for somewhere to crash after a night out 
182268,Chiswick Rooms, Mattress a little hard although this is a personal aspect that may be different for other users Real milk preferred for early morning tea , Clean close to tube excellent range of restaurants Had all necessary facilities
182269,Chiswick Rooms, TV was hung under uncomfortable angle, They have noice intolerance policy which is great No one was loud and we had our piece of rest Room is small but very clean and fresh new
182270,Chiswick Rooms, My room was a bit noisy from the main road outside but i guess it depends where you re located Wifi a bit slow at times , nice comfy bed room is small perfect size for 1 person not sure about 2 people with luggage etc 
182271,Chiswick Rooms, No elevator Small rooms But still i like the hotel , Perfect location 1 min from underground tube and bus stop Very clean Very helpful staff specially Mr Noman Nice shops and restaurants at walking distance Good value of money 
182272,Chiswick Rooms, We stayed at a ground floor room which had a dampness problem If the ac or the window is not kept open the room would smell wet Toilet is very small and the thing they use to hang the towers is not very useful I m not sure about the price quality ratio of this place , Close to subway station There are decent cafes nearby Rooms were clean 
182273,Chiswick Rooms, The rooms are extra small so everything inside the room is also extra small The bed is not terribly comfortable and the sink in the bathroom is so small that it is impossible to wash your face without properly flooding the floor You can literally jump into the bathroom from your toilet seat in one ordinary step The desk is also small and coordinating your actions requires surgical accuracy if you don t want all of your your stuff to fall on the floor Then again the price is lower than the hotels and other B Bs on Chiswick High Road so no free lunch I suppose , Fairly good value for money B B located in a nice are in Chiswick moments away from a District line tube station 
182274,Chiswick Rooms, Nothing lacking except an elevator but we already knew that so no surprise , The double room was small but very clean and efficient use of space Everything you need and the bathroom was very nice also Room looked futuristic Very nice all in all 
182275,Chiswick Rooms, The room initially smelled like bleach but an open window solved it , Small but clean comfortable and conveniently next to the District line tube The staff was very helpful and allowed to leave my luggage free of charge at the reception after I checked out Wonderful 
182276,Chiswick Rooms, The bed was uncomfortable we found the room was too small for us , It was clean modern and for the tiny size of room had all the facilities even down to tissues safe kettle It was close to a subway and plenty of restaurants and shops 
182277,Chiswick Rooms, Check in at 23 30 was pretty grumpy although it s late night I would still hope for a warm reception The lady checking us out the next morning was lovely , Great location We were at an event on Chiswick high road so this couldn t get more convenient 
182278,Chiswick Rooms,No Negative, The rooms are comfortable though minimalistic but they are really clean and nice I slept really well there and comfortably It s situated close to the Tube which is great and makes commuting really easy Plus there are quite a lot of really nice restaurants in an easy walking distance from the hotel plus mini markets for most food items Recommended place to stay in lovely Chiswick 
182279,Chiswick Rooms, I had a genuine request to cancel the stay even get a credit note to transfer the days but I simply was told that as company policy money was not refunded This was only a few minutes after the booking was done I had stayed before in this place however will not book another time ,No Positive
182280,Chiswick Rooms, Wanted to charge a lot for early check in very steep stairs, good spec bathroom shower wifi good very close proximity to tube beds comfortable and very clean white rooms

182282,Chiswick Rooms, No parking, The receptionist staff are very nice and helpful and the room was extremely clean and tidy specially the guy on the night shift he was so helpful
182283,Chiswick Rooms, I just think may be there should be more home coming feeling to the traveler for example that night i stayed was my birthday and we didnt bright candles and small knife to cut the birthday cake If it is possible i think this small kind of offer and help would really cheers anyone , The reception the russian girl at night is very kind and nice to me Great to meet her that night 
182284,Chiswick Rooms, Too small for couple We couldn t open our bags Bathroom sink very small , Nice bed Helpful staff very modern toilet no touch flush system good location 
182285,Chiswick Rooms, The room for 1 person is barely habitable about 9 sq meters including bathroom It looks like Japanese capsule hotel Noise from the street in the morning, Position and price 1 min walk from undeground on the district line If discounted at least 50 is a good value for money Staff is kind and always available Quality towels Wifi is OK
182286,Chiswick Rooms, My room was a twin but it would have been more comfortable with only one bed There was no room to store my small suitcase without it being in the way of something else , The staff were very helpful professional welcoming My room was spotless 
182287,Chiswick Rooms,No Negative, The Chiswick Rooms is one of those hotels that is essentially a B B without one of the Bs breakfast The rooms are small but it has to be said they are clean and quite modern There are no services at the hotel not even a vending machine which makes it just a place to sleep and wash There is nothing wrong with that and I have been to similar style hotels where the rooms are minute The one I stayed in is just about acceptable in terms of size The shower is one of those corner showers that serves a purpose but doesn t give a lot of room to manoeuvre The bed was comfortable enough a double but very very cosy for two It has a small room safe which is free to use and a fridge Also has air conditioning but it gurgled a lot and I m not sure how effective it was It is a good location with the tube nearby and plenty of restaurants within easy walking distance So if you just want somewhere to put your head for a night then this hotel is OK but no frills Good location and clean but pretty basic 
182288,Chiswick Rooms, The walls in the rooms are very thin so you are able to hear the voices of guests in other rooms , My room was very clean tidy and modern The location is also ideal with the tube right across the road 
182289,Chiswick Rooms, Because the rooms are small when a guest is noisy you can really hear it There are signs asking guests to be quiet and it was pretty good , Small but everything you need for a good night sleep
182290,Chiswick Rooms,No Negative, Perfect location on the way from Heathrow to the center of London Rooms are a little bit smaller but you are probably going to London to enjoy it not to stay in the room for a lot of time You can get a great breakfast at a nearby caf Underground station Stamford Brook is just a few meters from the hotel 
182291,Chiswick Rooms,No Negative, I had a very comfortable and quiet room which was perfect for a good night s sleep The hotel is in the perfect location as it s within easy access of the city centre but located in a relaxed London borough with lots of restaurants and coffee shops
182292,Chiswick Rooms, Room smelled badly and it was impossible to breathe in it without leaving the window open Towels smelled like they haven t been properly dried as well Bed was obviously used before I got there as there was hair on it Internet was unusable after 9 pm Single rooms are too small for decent stay , Staff was helpful when my room key didn t work 
182293,Chiswick Rooms, Bathroom not top spec could do with bath mats being supplied There is no elevator and a lot of rooms on the top floors Very warm inside and AC can sometimes take a while to properly cool Wifi isn t great cuts in and out from one day to the next which can be frustrating , Good location Friendly staff Fridge in room which is useful for longer stays Good blackout on the window if you need longer lie in Modern switches for do not disturb and making up the room 
182294,Chiswick Rooms, Very small rooms expected it no breakfast expected it bad WIFI DID NOT EXPECT IT , Great value for money clean rooms great access to the tube good location close to chiswick bars cafes etc and close enough to hammersmith
182295,Chiswick Rooms,No Negative, Room was very clean modern perfect for someone on business or travelling Would definitely book again when visiting Chiswick as it s so convenient 
182296,Chiswick Rooms, WiFi is fairly awful and the hotel could do with better double glazing to block out the traffic noise The bathrooms need towel rails for used towels and a loo brush would be good as well , The rooms are nicely decorated in contemporary chic new and clean Bathrooms are nice with good shower pressure Towels are new and good quality although 
182297,Chiswick Rooms, Bathroom a bit small meant you got wet when you turned on the tap in the sink , Good sized room with reasonably good facilities and good value for money
182298,Chiswick Rooms, The wifi didn t work However I also didn t asked the staff for further instructions And the bathroom wasn t very big But hey what can you expect it s London and the price is reasonable , Nice clean rooms with good functioning facilities and good working airconditioning Also the staff was very friendly and helpful 
182299,Chiswick Rooms, Room very small very tight 116 I reserved 3 rooms and one out of them 116 didn t match my expectation inferior to what I paid for , Cleanliness staff location 
182300,Chiswick Rooms, There s no elevator However the staff was very helpful and would help you with luggage if necessary Not suitable for everyone, Great location for great price Clean rooms and very convenient
182301,Chiswick Rooms, We were provided with a wifi username and password which was supposed to last one full day After about 1 hour on the wifi the code no longer worked , Location was great with lots of nice places to eat and drink in particular a nice coffee shop on the corner The tube station can also be seen from the hotel entrance which was really convenient for getting into London 
182302,Chiswick Rooms, The room was so tiny that it was hard to navigate a suitcase around but very clean and comfortable other than that , There was someone there to check me in cheerfully at 2 00 a m 
182303,Chiswick Rooms, The rooms are without doubt the smallest I have stayed in and as a result you are literally lying next to your door so if anyone at all comes through they disturb you The beds lacked any firmness at all I don t think it was the mattress but the bed frame itself which didn t support the centre of the bed , Great location
182304,Chiswick Rooms,No Negative, A minute s walk from Stamford Brook station and easy access to central London Friendly and very helpful staff Twin room was really compact but well designed and had everything we needed including a mini fridge We were out during the day and back late so the room size didn t matter Good power shower and the air conditioning was a godsend since it was hot weather Value for money in our opinion and we would book again 
182305,Chiswick Rooms, No breakfast Very small room Staff forgot to load the tissue box The refrigerator barely kept cold The AC gurgled all night making sleep difficult , Staff were very helpful and considerate 
182306,Chiswick Rooms, Radio with iPhone 4 connection and didn t work Volume control in bathroom broken Starting to look a little tired Paid 60 on a Sunday night I think that s all it s worth, clean and bright
182307,Chiswick Rooms, Wifi was poor it was also quite difficult to get into the bathroom as the room was very compact Not major issues though , Excellent location to the tube and the wonderful Chiswick high street 
182308,Chiswick Rooms, there is no elevator so if you have big and heavy luggages it may be not convenient another is the mattress is too soft , the location is very close to the tube only a few minutes walk the room is clean 
182309,Chiswick Rooms, I would really have to nit pick to find fault and I can t find any nits , Comfortable bed Quiet room Extremely clean Very modern facilities Super bathroom Everything in working order Fridge in room 
182310,Chiswick Rooms, Wifi was incredibly slow hoped that there may be some sort of breakfast for that sort of money , Very basic small room but clean served its purpose 
182311,Chiswick Rooms, The room was a little small and we wanted to open the window but as there were a lot of bugs flying around from a nearby tree we had to close it Although the air con made it more bearable it would have been nice for some fresh air in the room , The location was not too bad it had resteraunts within 10 minutes of walking and it was just across the road from the local train station which was very convenient as we had to travel again quite early Overall good service from staff also Good Value for money Very clean and cosy 
182312,Chiswick Rooms, I cannot think of any suggestions as it was perfect , I have stayed in many hotels in London 4 star s in areas like Kensington are usually old buildings with poor facilities what in other cities would be a 1 star But I m happy to say that with Chiswick Rooms this is not the case Beautiful modern rooms in a good location and great WIFI access 
182313,Chiswick Rooms,No Negative, You get what it says on the tin scrupulously clean modern well laid out rooms with the right level of facilities No frills and no unnecessary floor space 
182314,Chiswick Rooms, Very small room don t bring much luggage, Excellent location close to Tube Good restaurants nearby Modern room recently fitted out Beautifully clean
182315,Chiswick Rooms, The stairs lol , All staff were very friendly and helpful the room was clean bright and functional and my self and my daughter had a great stay Would recommend to friends and family and would stay again 
182316,Chiswick Rooms, Nearly turned away as I did not have photographic ID when I checked in at 11 pm I was made to feel like an impostor in my own country so would not stay again , Good location Everything you need for a one night stay Lighting hairdryer etc all in tthe right place 
182317,Chiswick Rooms, Walls are incredibly thing Was rudely awoken by a couple in another room at 4 40am I could hear everything , Modern rooms with everything you need Good value for money 
182318,Chiswick Rooms, As the name says it is just rooms no meeting area breakfast room business centre for business travellers but there is a slow but wifi enabled cafe next door and various cafes pubs restaurants nearby , Always reliably clean comfortable compact rooms with free wifi and modern fittings 1 minute walk to Stamford Brook tube station for 30 minute journey to Heathrow 1 minute walk to bus stop for 10 minute bus ride to Chiswick Business Park and Gunnersbury overground station Numerous cafes pubs restaurants within walking distance along Chiswick High Road King Street 
182319,Chiswick Rooms, Cleaning staff leave towels on floor causing difficulty in narrow corridors Suggested to my mum she could not have the pre paid room when I was arriving two days later with the credit card Got there and reception did not even want to check credit card No consistency, Little
182320,Chiswick Rooms, No lifts and had to drag luggage to 2nd floor internet access is still password based and was told for 1 device They should make it easier to access like other modern hotels , Nice clean trendy modern hotel close to the tube
182321,Chiswick Rooms, The net curtain in the window looked like the bottom of it had caught fire Perhaps it was tatty due to wear and tear but it needed replacing Only other noticeable point was that the kettle couldn t be filled from the sink as the sink was so compact This was remedied by filling the drinking glass provided from the tap and pouring into the kettle , Great location and fantastic value for money Good facilities and cleanliness 
182322,Chiswick Rooms, If stairs could kill they re nothing like these on Covent Garden station but still I m not a breakfast person I prefer brunch but the lack of the food service may be a downside to some of the visitors , Localization friendly staff WiFi coverage bed bathroom Tesco and Sainsbury from left and right bus stops and subway just around the corner and there is a lot of great places for foodies for example Franco Manca Pizzeria As for location clean room private bath fine bed and working fridge everything I hoped for and more 
182323,Chiswick Rooms, Our room and bathroom was too small Was ok for two girls but can t imagine staying in this room with my husband , Location I love Chiswick plus very close to a tube District line station
182324,Chiswick Rooms, Tv too small Reception not manned all the time Was waiting 10mins to get wifi password Receptionist didn t apologise for keeping me waiting , Room surprisingly nice Better than pics Size was rather compact but I expected that so no surprise 
182325,Chiswick Rooms, Everything was terrible from the receptionist She was extremely rude to the curtains having holes in them the shower being dirty the towels being dirty and the bedding A bed of rocks would ve been more comfortable than that mattress The room was always far to hot no one told us how to work the air conditioner eventually figured it out on the 2nd last night, Didn t like anything
182326,Chiswick Rooms, I stayed in room 21 single room Unfortunately the bed was tightly fitted into the window bay and as my height is 6 3 I had to sleep uncomfortably at an angle with my feet hanging off the side as I did not fit , I loved the the clean and fresh decor 
182327,Chiswick Rooms, The room is very small I could not open my trolley case easily and had to open it in vertical position and slip one side of it under the bed to get my things It s really inconvenient to take things in or out The shower room with toilet is also very tiny and so is the basin When I put on my contact lens water will drop onto the floor The duvet was not really warm enough , Location was good 
182328,Chiswick Rooms, Quite a lot of noise from the street, Room was small but perfectly formed and fitted out to a good standard No problem with noise from within the hotel Plenty of places to eat nearby 
182329,Chiswick Rooms, The electricity was switched on with your key card which meant the room got very cold when I was out for the day temperature dropped very quickly as soon as you turned off the heating fan , Beds were comfortable facilities clean and practical for my needs great value for money Lovely location coffee shop on corner was brill and literally 2 minutes from the tube station but no noise pollution problems 
182330,Chiswick Rooms, There were no wall hooks to hang up our jackets which was a little unhandy Because the hotel is located in zone 2 the traveltime to the city was a bit long Matresses could use an update , The room was more than enough for a perfect citytrip The make up service of the rooms was handy aswel Nice and helpfull personel Close to an underground 
182331,Chiswick Rooms,No Negative, I stayed here between the 10 11th of January 2016 The staff were very nice and helped me carry my heavy suitcase up to my room The room was exactly as described on the Internet There were no disturbances and the wifi service was good 
182332,Chiswick Rooms, Need better pillows Wafer thin , Small clean comfortable and quiet room Perfect for a one night stay after seeing a show at the Eventim Apollo Easy underground journey from central London 
182333,Chiswick Rooms, internet facilities is weak and its need to be strengthen and when I was there it was cut for almost a day until it restored, its small little Hotel clean and comfort
182334,Chiswick Rooms, Ah not much lol only too much settle dust Which is normal if the room hasn t been used However I would advise if a room hasn t been used over 3 day s and the window is open try and dust the room But all was perfect , The customer service was EXCELLENT there is no second guessing I would recommend and they are EXTREMELY helpful The night staff are 5 thanks guys 
182335,Chiswick Rooms, 1 unbelievable thin walls and floors you hear every every sigh of the person in the room next door and below and on top and the alley 2 be extremely carefull with extending your stay Prices are based on internet rate After agreeing on the price with the receptionist we went for a 15 minute drink Coming back the price was suddenly raised with more 10 The receptionist couldn t do anything This happened twice We started with a 35 pound rate and ended two days later with 88 The managment aknowledged their mistake but refused a refund Greed reigns at chsiwick rooms 3 very small rooms 4 lousy WIFI, clean room nice location
182336,Chiswick Rooms, very compact room which was sufficient for a short stay but would not want to spend too much time there, good value for London Clean room with usual facilities 
182337,Chiswick Rooms, 1 Wifi kept dropping off periodically so I had to keep logging on 2 Room 10 door opens into a tiny hallway with two doors one leads to the bedroom and the other to the bathroom Removal of this hallway and having the bathroom as an en suite off the bedroom would have given the room more space 3 Noise travels from other rooms so you can hear chat TV and coughing which was disruptive on the first night , Exactly what I was looking for so no serious complaints Simple check out Clean rooms
182338,Chiswick Rooms, The wifi kept cutting out the kettle was faulty and didn t switch itself off when boiled , My room was at the top of the building so although the hotel is on a busy road I heard no traffic and slept very well 
182339,Chiswick Rooms, We did not like the New Years Eve night shift woman grey dirty curtains you can see how grey in picture attached and how the front desk lady made a copy of my guest s debit card as a form of ID which is concerning since 30 of card fraud is from Hotels Room registered for 2 I displayed booking and card which paid but questioned my guest for ID , We like the location to public transport modern design and fair price Hotel is generally clean 
182340,Chiswick Rooms, Was really tired after travelling all night Just needed a few hours sleep before attending a meeting in Piccadilly It wasn t to be firstly as we just dozed off we were rudely awakened by a staff member charging into the room and then backing out saying sorry We attempted to go back to sleep but a short while later the fire alarm went off We buried our heads in our pillows and it ceased obviously being tested We attempted sleep yet again but guess what The fire alarm went off again We waited it ceased sleep deprivation is kicking in now its like some form of torture We assumed it was another test after no movement so attempted sleep again Just starting to drift into sleep and yes you ve guessed it the fire alarm went off again I went out into the corridor to be informed by a staff member that people are smoking in the rooms At this point we gave up on the place and went into town to get a bit of peace somewhere The point of booking for two nights was to get a few hours sleep when we arrived at 5 30am approx Was a waste of time and money Wouldn t do it again We came back later that night grabbed a few hours sleep and legged it , Room facilities location Was clean felt secure tube across road 
182341,Chiswick Rooms, The room was tiny If you are 6ft or taller you would not be able to fit in the bed And for over 100 a night you would hope for somewhere to put your bag other than on or under the bed The bed was right up against the window which was single glazed and right next to a busy junction meaning I got a very poor nights sleep ,No Positive

182345,Chiswick Rooms, Hairs in bed bed not very sturdy or that comfy rooms very small Reception lady took 15 mins on phone when we were trying to check in after our long journey blatantly calling her friend as didn t sound professional , Nice shower clean toilet reception 24 hours
182346,Chiswick Rooms, Uncomfortable bed and pillows Hardly slept all night Also the duvet was very lumpy where the synthetic fibres and clumped together leaving completely flat areas so not comfortable nor warm Owner needs to invest in better quality duvets Narrow staircase No lift Very small ensuite but very nicely presented , Receptionist Mohammed was super

182352,Chiswick Rooms, I had ordered a room to the backyard because I need a silent room for sleeping The room I got was also so compact that I couldn t stand up without knocking the head in the ceiling and the window was also in the ceilinng The room was absolutely not worth the money For that price I think they could have a room service for simple breakfast delivered from the new coffee shop at the corner , The hotel was centrally located to the company where I had my meetings

182363,Chiswick Rooms, Due to the fact that bathroom was certainly next to our bed we could feel bad smell from time to time Room was on the ground floor and windows were so small like in the cellar for me it doesn t matter but not everyone can like it , Possibility to turn on music from TV in bathroom good WiFi big mirror in room so you can see yourself perfectly
