343298,Club Hotel Cortina,No Negative, The bed was so comfy and the decor in our room was very stylish The hotel bar was cheap so good for pre drinks and we were pointed in the direction of a lovely traditional Austrian restaurant top of the road then round the corner Also 10 minutes walk to the underground so not long from centre of Vienna at all We didn t bother with breakfast because at 15 Euro a head we could get it cheaper elsewhere but overall this hotel was great value for money 
343299,Club Hotel Cortina, My room was not very dark This was a problem because the Sun was rising very early during my trip However this was the only problem I had during my stay in this excellent hotel , Excellent staff and location The hotel is less than 5 min walking from a subway station and it is located in a very calm neighborhood The breakfast is also good I had a really good time and I definitely recommend this hotel 
343300,Club Hotel Cortina, they can t accept customers until putting air condition as four star level hotel over 30 degree I can t stay room like sauna without air conditioning They provide air fan with 5 dollars deposit and feel humiliating by staffs When I need room key with magnetic plastic they request me another 5 dollars deposit it is the first time to ask for 5 euros deposit for extra key due to giving me only one key , free Wi Fi and free street parking due to away from the center of the city
343301,Club Hotel Cortina, The window is in the height of the ground or some roof with the grass and chimney right in front Although at the booking com page it is stated that the hotel is paid at the end of the stay the hotel was already charged my credit card at the time I signed up ,No Positive
343302,Club Hotel Cortina, The non availability in the hotel of meals other than breakfast meant daily concern about where and when to eat there being limited such facilities in the near area Such additional facilities would of course imply a different hotel staffing model , Staff able and willing to compensate for our poor command of the German language 24 hour support available with good command of information about local activity Quiet location but handy for the U Bahn Room bathroom clean although shower area a bit cramped Airy and bright dining area for breakfast Hotel was able to support an impromptu pre wedding evening for a number of guests and their relations The city itself offers a full and diverse cultural experience with excellent transport links 
343303,Club Hotel Cortina, Breakfast is too expensive , The hotel is located in very peaceful area within 7 min walk to the metro station that makes it s quite easy to get to the city centre The room was really big comfortable and clean 
343304,Club Hotel Cortina, The hotel is 20min far away from the center with the subway and 5 minutes by foot to get the subway you have to count 30 min to go to the city center Otherwise the room was good but very fancy Hotel good for not staying home the whole day but just to sleep and visit the city , Room was clean and the staff was okay 
343305,Club Hotel Cortina, Wifi sometimes was poor but it was only three times during our stay so that is ok, This hotel is situated in 6 minutes from the underground station which goes direct to the city centre The trip to city centre takes 10 12 minutes It was a very nice price for the hotel with such location in Vienna The breakfast was very nice and was included in price for the room 
343306,Club Hotel Cortina, Good value for money BUT not a 4 quite far from the comfort of it From soap dispenser instead of shower shampoo to duvets that are more blankets it is a 3 basic level Alsl if you do not leave the room in the morning the cleaning lady will no longer clean the room after that , It s a good 10 min walk from the tube station but in a very nice residential area The staff is extremely nice and helpful 
343307,Club Hotel Cortina, We had a bad luck with the metro which was under construction and didn t go all the way to the hotel s nearest station So to get there we first took metro to the Sch nbrunn s station and then continued with a bus , The staff was nice and the hotel was clean and cozy 10 10
343308,Club Hotel Cortina,No Negative, We are one young couple who went there for 8 nights When we arrived we had a very warm welcome and the lady behind the desk started explaining to us what we booked and what we did not booked she took us up to the second floor The room was really tidy and according to our needs and the hotel is located not in a traffic zone so one can imagine the tranquility and about 3 minutes walk there is a supermarket The reception is available 24 hrs a day and always a service with a smile 
343309,Club Hotel Cortina, I only thing I would really apreciate is air condition in our room we stayed in third floor and in summer weather there was really very hot , Perfect place to stay very nice hotel few minutes far from the subway clean Free and easy parking close to the hotel 
343310,Club Hotel Cortina, Staff specially breakfast waitress, The lady responssible for breakfast was extremely rude And very disrespectful I book and paid hotel with breakfast however in the morning when I asked for egg I was told my breakfast supposed to be only continental and limited to piece of bread and coffee She has insulted me in front of others and I decided to go to reception and left hotel immidiately I am a frequent traveler I have never experienced this type of attitude in any coutry Reception did not even offered a simple apology or any explaination of why I have not been told about my type of included breakfast The most unpleasent expeience I ever saw
