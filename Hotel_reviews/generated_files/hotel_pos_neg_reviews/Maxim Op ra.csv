43698,Maxim Op ra, Room was a little small and could have been a little cleaner but overall a gem of a hotel and would stay again , Location was fab and the staff were second to none 
43699,Maxim Op ra, Rooms were extremely small My suitcase took up all spare room in the room All male staff were extremely rude only the female staff was friendly Wouldn t book again or recommend Wasn t extremely close to tourist attractions either The person in the room beside me put their garbage outside with the diaper and the entire hallway smelled extremely bad It sat there for almost an entire day I had to call down for it to be removed , Room was clean 
43700,Maxim Op ra, Size of the room is not big but it is also not smaller than most of Paris hotels either If you expect a big room in Paris the price to pay is a lot higher , Very clean room Friendly service High level of comfort 
43701,Maxim Op ra, Room and in particular the bathroom very small other reviews said this was standard for paris though Given new towels each day but they left the old towels in the room on the second day when cleaned Only French channels on the tv we hardly had time to put it on but just seems odd not to even offer any international news stations Bathroom had a really horrid smell when we arrived and the tiling looked a little dirty in the shower Overpriced breakfast for what it was so we didn t bother Just felt like we paid for a 4 star hotel but got a nice 3 star , Very friendly and helpful staff Comfy bed Really powerful shower which was nice
43702,Maxim Op ra, Parking was very far away through a maze of streets we almost got lost practically at the next Metro station to the one closest to the hotel in a public covered car park not on site or adjacent to the hotel as we were made to believe Also it cost 30 Euros per day Breakfast was not included in the room rate and it cost 16 Euros per person The choice of food was very basic We estimated that the breakfast room can only accommodate at most 12 15 people although on the first day we were the only ones there and on the second only one other couple was there This probably was a reflection of what other guests think of the value of this service There was a large TV with numerous channels but nothing in English except CNN Didn t even bother to watch it after the initial channel surfing with the remote control , The location was good walking distance to the Louvre and Galeries Lafayette The rooms were comfortable clean and had all the basic necessities The surrounding area was good too with many restaurants cafes and convenience stores 
43703,Maxim Op ra, Room was small , Very comfortable and clean room Friendly staff was always there at reception to provide more info regarding the tourist places in Paris Breakfast was great as well 
43704,Maxim Op ra, Not clean The bathroom shower had dried fecal matter in the bottom The bed sheets had long curly hairs on the them which made is seem like they hadn t been changed We were moved to another room and there was dried poop on the toilet seat we arrived very late and didn t discover until after unpacking and at this point it was 2 a m Although a sanitary paper had been placed over the toilet there was still dried poop on the seat Photos were taken of it all and provided to staff There were no extra amenities offered or discounts for the disgusting encounters , Location night staff and room were really great 
43705,Maxim Op ra, No Parking and hotel does not reserve any places in the parking nearby Therefore it was full when we arrived , Location is good staff is helpful Rooms are clean and modern a bit too small though However very fair price considering location and condition 
43706,Maxim Op ra, When we checked out we were asked if we had taken something from mini bar in our room We didn t even touch anything there and we said it So we paid for the room left our bags at the reception and went out to have the last dinner in Paris When we came back to pick up the bags we were said that the cleaning staff had found an empty bottle of juice or whatever it was I have no idea and it meant that we had drunk the juice and had to pay for it So emm 4 euros is not a problem especially taking in account the fact that we got the room really cheap but it s weird to feel like a thief Guys if I had taken something from your mini bar I would definitely have told you about it and paid for it at once So now I don t know if it was just a mistake or the staff maybe only the cleaning staff did it intentionally Anyway it really spoiled our impression , As for the rest great place to stay in Paris Very clean close to the city center and three metro stations We really liked the view from our window Small and quiet parisian street Staff at the reception was really nice and helpful Good wi fi high speed 
43707,Maxim Op ra,No Negative, Fantastic location really nice reception staff spotless The rooms are small but in line with other Paris hotels The room is compact but has everything it s stylish and impressive Air con was excellent Really great value 
43708,Maxim Op ra, Breakfast a bit basic for the price Room a little small Double bed was 2 singles pushed together , Clean and nice bathroom Upper floor and quiet Plenty of cafe s bars in the area 
43709,Maxim Op ra, 4 euros charge for 0 5l evian bottle of water , The bed realy big Very nice room and relatively cosi Nice bathroom and clean as well The area is also very very nice Walking distance to the opera Tube stations really close 15 mins walking to gare du nord train station 
43710,Maxim Op ra, Room is so small No place enough to put things but not a big problem for 3 days trip , Location 2 min walking to Grands Boulevard metro station M8 Line Carrefour is very close Bakery is very close

43712,Maxim Op ra, Disappointing and expensive 16 breakfast with little choice and not very good quality , Nice modern hotel with comfortable rooms with all necessary facilities Received free room upgrade and the espresso machine in the room were a plus Two metro stations available even if not around the corner Friendly staff 
43713,Maxim Op ra, There was a mistake with the date of booking and no one of the staff mentioned it to us Thus we ended up forced to pay 43 more than the originally proposed price In fairness to hotel staff I believe this was a problem with the Booking com website ,No Positive
43714,Maxim Op ra, The only thing in the whole hotel we weren t sure about was the size of the wardrobe When it had hangers and clothes in the doors didn t close , The hotel was very fashionable Very modern and extremely clean and crisp 
43715,Maxim Op ra, The rooms were a little bit smaller than expected but when you are in Paris you should not be spending time in your room, The hotel is close to main stations so I did not have to connect once I boarded a traind from Grands Boulevards or Cadet
