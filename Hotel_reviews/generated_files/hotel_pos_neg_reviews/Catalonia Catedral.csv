272345,Catalonia Catedral, There isn t much to fault a minor point that the bar has a cocktail menu but if you try to order one you might be advised that we don t have all the stuff to make cocktails Fortunately a gin and tonic made a reasonable substitute , The hotel was in a great location and they were thoughtful enough to inform us prior to our arrival that a city wide taxi strike on the day of our arrival meant that we d have to get the bus included in the message was a link to the relevant bus service The room was kept very clean and tidy by two maid visits per day There was a large amount of choice at breakfast and the omelettes cooked on demand were really nice We didn t have dinner at the restaurant however the pizzas from the bar were very good 
272346,Catalonia Catedral, Uncomfortable beds and poor configuration The full size beds pushed together to make a king like hotels often do in Europe however sheets were put on as two separate beds instead of one bed making it impossible to sleep next to my husband , Clean rooms 
272347,Catalonia Catedral, The room looked onto a building The pool top was disappointing No music or staff , Excellent location Good size room coffee making facilities Helpful staff 
272348,Catalonia Catedral, Nothing , Hotel staff saw my partners birthday cards and brought a bottle of champagne on the house to our room Very nice touch Highly recommend all round 
272349,Catalonia Catedral, Unfortunately towel changes only one time in three days Shampoo and bath gel didnt charge every day Sweeming pool was very small This hotel does not have gym and spa The double rooms was very small than other hotels I recommended for selecting of one hotel do not decided base on photo in websites I could booked better hotel with same price , The hotel located in very good place few minute to catalonia square and la rambla street All shoping bus station reaturant were near the hotel Hotel was very clean 
272350,Catalonia Catedral, Though maybe not directly responsible the condition of the Hotel s transfer van which was grubby with torn searts and the attitude of the driver who communicated the minimum in grunts was a great welcome for visitors to Australia I m sure , Not much
272351,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Room wonderful because of space and cleanness especially my room has terrace and private pool Staffs always very kind and friendly Breakfast good variety Location one of the best hotel in Barcelona for the sightseeing and shopping
272352,Catalonia Catedral, No place to put your clothes Plenty of hangers but just a single shelf in the closet for the rest , Amazing location The staff had some great suggestions for dinner spots 
272353,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, This fabulous property combined history with modern chic The location was perfect to enjoy the Gothic Quarter We stayed only one night but when we are next in Barcelona it will be our choice of accommodation without question 
272354,Catalonia Catedral, I didn t like having to change my accommodation due to outrageous misrepresentation And I really didn t like getting stung on my ridiculous cancellation fees due to having no electricity which meant the toilets didn t flush , Barcelona
272355,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Perfect location for those on foot Tons of shopping dining and cultural activities within walking distance Jonathan the bartender is excellent Best gin and tonic of the entire trip 
272356,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, There was a good selection of food at breakfast hot and cold The rooftop pool was great there s no snack bar up there but you can order room service to the pool Staff were very friendly and the hotel was lovely and clean The location was perfect 
272357,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Excellent location for visiting Barcelona Located in the Gothic quarter If arriving by car beware you need to come early in the morning as its in the pedestrian precinct 
272358,Catalonia Catedral, Taxi put us down by the bus stops in the square saying he could not travel through pedestrian area as there were so many people We struggled with our cases and had difficulty finding the hotel If we had known we would have made sure we knew the position on a map , It was my birthday while there and we received a bottle of bubbly from the Management must have checked my passport We thought this was a lovely gesture 
272359,Catalonia Catedral, This hotel was so central even my taxi couldn t find it The listing on booking com should inform guests that not all taxi drivers understand that they are permitted to enter the pedestrianised area I had to drag my luggage down two streets and got lost The room was tiny and would not have been suitable had there been two of us There was only a sheet on the bed and a blanket in the wardrobe Barcelona might be warm but its not that hot Unfortunately I had come from Hotel Artes so it had a lot to live up to and it simply did not compare There was zero facilities except for a pool which I chose not to use More importantly the cafe wasn t even open for coffee in the morning unless you had booked breakfast you had to go next door to a cafe The room facilities consisted of instant tea and coffee and a stocked mini bar which I didn t use I wouldn t return to this hotel given what else is on offer nearby , Location was as central as you could get in the gothic quarter Clean and modern with good shower and large storage space However the wooden floors were not insulated and all I could hear was someone in the room above walking back and forth in their heeled shoes 
272360,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Front of house were very helpful giving advice and recommendations Location was perfect and the square had a real buzz to it most evenings Would definitely recommend and would stay there again if I go back to Barcelona 
272361,Catalonia Catedral, The only thing that I wasn t keen on was the cost of breakfast 20euros pp So can t comment on the food due to the high cost Also the price of drinks at the bar two gin and tonics 33euros which was very steep especially when we were paying 6euros elsewhere , Hotel and stafff were very friendly and professional Hotel in a fantastic location Room was very spacious and clean 
272362,Catalonia Catedral, Room service menu could have more items on it , Very pleasantly surprised with this hotel Rooms are so comfortable clean and modern we felt as if we got a lot for the price Despite being in a busy area Gothic Quarter we were never disturbed by street noise We were literally facing Barcelona Cathedral as soon as we stepped outside the hotel what a beautiful view every morning The pool area on the top floor is also a lovely little outdoor space with nice views Loved our stay here 
272363,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Amazing location amazing pool area very helpful and polite staff Perfect for a girls trip and couple trip Hotel is clean and very good turn down service Next time i will try with my family because it seems perfect I highly recommend this hotel 
272364,Catalonia Catedral, As I said I have nothing in particular to complain about other than a overal feeling that it was not worth the money compared to what you can get for the same price in the surrounding hotels For this price at least the breakfast should be included , Nice clean and central hotel although the overal feeling was that it is not worth the money and too expensive for what you get The food is great as is the breakfast although the breakfast should be included in the price costs additional 20 eur The stuff is service minded helpful and friendly The pool terass is nicely decorated although no bar there just a wending machine that did not work the days I was there but I guess that should be fixed The overall feeling was that is was not worth the 250 eur per day although I actually have nothing in particular to complain about 
272365,Catalonia Catedral, Having to leave, Rooms are fully equipped with everything you need Nice and quiet dark comfy bed guaranteed good sleep Breakfast is amazing serving everything Staff are friendly and courteous Location is perfect 
272366,Catalonia Catedral, One staff member on Reception apparently a trainee let us down with a booking for a trip but this was quickly resolved by one of his colleagues , The staff the food the breakfast buffet was fantastic the bed the bathroom and the location The cleaning standard was excellent throughout the hotel and we were made to feel very welcome 
272367,Catalonia Catedral, During our dinner in the second floor restaurant it was quite distracting noise wise with the staff setting up for breakfast in the adjoining room , Excellent location staff and facilities 
272368,Catalonia Catedral, Breakfast could be enriched, Amazing hotel pretty near to the Cathedral and within the Barrio G tico Great staff Although it is in a noisy square the soundproof glass windows allow you to have a perfect quiet sleep 
272369,Catalonia Catedral, Sadly weather not quite as warm as hoped But that s nobodies fault Still had a fantastic week, Huge bed Fantastic view from room Helpful staff 
272370,Catalonia Catedral, The only thing they could improve is slightly bigger bathrooms but they weren t really that small , It was quite late when we arrived but the staff were very friendly and helpful The building is in 2 halves sort of thing so you take one lift from the entrance lobby to the main lobby and then another lift to your room There are only 4 floors so it is easy to take the stairs if the lift is busy We had a triple superior room as we were with our son It was very spacious Plenty of room for luggage etc Very clean The bathroom could have been a little bit bigger but it was fine The toiletries were not a brand I recognised and there was no conditioner There were plenty of towels and other toiletry bits e g razor etc there was free fresh bottled water in the fridge each day although the tap water is fine to drink You get a chocolate at night The breakfast was great Lovely sweet things but also plenty of savoury items a lot of local produce hams cheeses There was good selection of bread The coffee was a commercial Nespresso machine There was also Cava should you fancy a drop first thing There were plenty of teas to choose from We didn t have to wait to get a seat and it was not crowded even though it was a weekend and school holidays The location is fantastic It s right in the old city and so close to many of the famous sites It was not noisy at night and we felt very safe 
272371,Catalonia Catedral, The bar restaurant staff were not very friendly or welcoming The bar area is very small but not well attended to by the staff and we felt as if we were intruding whenever we were in it A shame because all other staff at the hotel including the reception housekeeping and porters were top notch , The location was excellent within easy walking distance of many tourist attractions Ramblas and the main crossroads for the tourist bus and metro The beach harbour is about a 10 mins walk The reception staff were excellent and extremely helpful with directions and suggestions regarding sightseeing During our stay it was my birthday I had not informed the hotel of this but they noticed I guess from our check in form and the hotel delivered a complementary bottle of sparkling wine to our room on my birthday which was unexpected and a lovely touch so full marks there The room size and cleanliness were very good The beds were exceptionally comfortable The food in the restaurant was very good The rooftop swimming pool was unheated during our stay in March but my daughter risked it and had good fun There were comfortable sunbeds around the pool and I would imagine that it would be lovely to go back to the hotel pool on a hot summers day after a day of sightseeing shopping 
272372,Catalonia Catedral, It is located too close to the Cathedral as we found out during the night where the bells ring every hour , Location is excellent in the heart of the Gothic quarter The hotel is very nice and the staff are very helpful 
272373,Catalonia Catedral, Late check out was not accepted because of full booking, Location Best location in Barcelona tour Heart of Gothic area Convenient for Shopping restaurants and bars Room Large space clean comfortable bed quiet airconditioning works well Staff Friendly Breakfast Good I have stayed more than 10 hotels in Barcelona This hotel is the best hotel in Barcelona tour among them 
272374,Catalonia Catedral, The shower was problematic The water temperature fluctuated from ice cold to scalding hot It was impossible to get a satisfying shower Not acceptable for the price they charge , The location is excellent Close to the cathedral and gothic quarter and many restaurants and tourist attractions in the city Staff was friendly and helpful Breakfast was very good 
272375,Catalonia Catedral, Expensive Breakfast 20 pp compared to beautiful restaurants In radiys of 80m restaurant staff not so pleasant just one woman no heating lobby bar sitting not so nice as the rest of hotel simple pool with skimmer, Very nice room excelent room service clean room free bottle of water 2 lifts nice terrace comfortable bad
272376,Catalonia Catedral, You might find this an odd comment to make but they do not follow what is common practice today regarding clean towels in hotels Most hotels have the policy that if you want a clean bath or hand towel you place the towel on the floor If you are willing to reuse it how dirty can it really be you hang it up This hotel could save tons of money if they used this policy and didn t snap up the towels twice a day What a waste of resources , The location cleanliness of everything wonderful friendly staff willing to answer questions give directions and make recommendations reservations etc 
272377,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, The location was excellent and close to everything The cathedral was around the corner and Las Ramblas Placa Reial Mercado de La Boqueira Gothic quarter Arc de Triomf and waterfront are all within walking distance away There are lots of great restaurants around as well with a fantastic Japanese restaurant just in front of the hotel and a hip affordable Vietnamese place just on the back side of the hotel It s my third time in Barcelona and I d be very tempted to return to this hotel or another one nearby 
272378,Catalonia Catedral, One evening I could smell cigarette smoke from another room , Staff was super friendly and helpful Location was perfect in the heart of the Gothic Quarter and near the subway 
272379,Catalonia Catedral, Only thing I can think of is that the door to the balcony had to be opened by the staff as the handle was removed from the door Obviously the hotel has certain regulations to ensure the facade of the building is kept looking well However it was never a problem for the staff coming up to open it , From the moment we walked in we were greeted with a wonderful smile from the front desk Andrea was polite helpful and spent time to ensure we were welcome The waitresses staff and cleaners who I must say worked so hard to keep every corner of the hotel spotless made our stay at the hotel just perfect Thank you so very much for helping us enjoy Barcelona to the very best it can offer A true 5 star hotel Regards Monette and Steve
272380,Catalonia Catedral, could not find anything that I did not like maybe when I go back next time I can find something , great location next to sights restaurants old town taxis even walking distance to tour operators great sound proofing rooms dead quiet
272381,Catalonia Catedral, It got a bit noisy outside on Friday and Saturday nights since the hotel is in the heart of an area Barcelonans love to traverse and enjoy until quite late Just closing the window didn t cut the sound enough but I always have ear plugs with me and then I slept well Sunday night was quiet and peaceful , This hotel is a wonderful modern renovation inside a gothic structure in a fabulous location in the old Gothic Quarter of Barcelona All of the quarter is steps away and it is a short stroll to La Rambla Our room was comfortable with nice amenities and was spotlessly clean And the price for the room in such a great location in this city can t be beat The front desk staff was excellent friendly well informed and helped us with directions and ways to get where we wanted to go We will definitely stay here again if we return to Barcelona 
272382,Catalonia Catedral, I suppose it could have a few USB charging points as every traveller wants to charge many devices now , We were upgraded for free most likely as it was a quiet time of year which gave us a terrace and direct access to the pool
272383,Catalonia Catedral, The food Not because there was anything wrong with it I m from Ireland and I just thought the food was a lot different from at home oviously My partner enjoyed it though , The location was perfect and the staff they were the nicest I ve come access 
272384,Catalonia Catedral, Room was on 2nd floor overlooking a back street and we were awoken every night at around 2am by sound of glass recycle pick ups trash pick ups etc , Fantastic location very courteous staff
272385,Catalonia Catedral, Pool a bit on the small side but went in winter so didn t use it anyway , Staff were very friendly Rooms immaculate Great breakfast Great location Good wifi 
272386,Catalonia Catedral, Although I understand did not like very much the repairs going on I have to appreciate that it was obvious all efforts were made to minimize the discomfort for us so excellent overall , Modern and good looking hotel Excellent friendly and helpful staff Very good location near Cathedral and in the touristic heart of Barcelona
272387,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, The hotel was excellent value for money and in a super location in the Gothic Quarter just a few minutes walk from Placa Catalyuna Very knowledgeable and friendly staff I will definitely stay there again 
272388,Catalonia Catedral, Coffees at breakfast weren t so great The bedside light was broken I asked for someone to look at it and replace the bulb no one did , Selection of food at breakfast was excellent Beds were very comfy Staff friendly and helpful 
272389,Catalonia Catedral, Had the breakfast once which at 20 euros each was overpriced The bar wasn t open in the evenings although it was only a short walk to several others , The best thing was the location a few steps from the Catedral a 5 minute walk to La Rambla Our room was very comfortable clean 
272390,Catalonia Catedral, to be honest there was nothing I would change , Great little hotel in the centre of the Gothic Quarter excellent staff and the rooftop pool area was a winner with the smokers 
272391,Catalonia Catedral, There could have been a jacuzzi , The breakfast was enough until early dinner and delicious But the main things was how helpful and friendly the staff were 
272392,Catalonia Catedral, Nothing to complain about , The location is just amazing as well as the decor and the staff The room was very comfortable with all the amenities a true 4 star should have 
272393,Catalonia Catedral, It s hard to get to not a problem but something To think about A property Can t go wrong , Location was ideal th breakfast was first class but you paid that price for it bedrooms comfy quiet clean great stay There s a Pan Co right next door for a quick coffee and bfast at a low price when needed Walk to museum cathedral great sites to visit 
272394,Catalonia Catedral, The glass elevator is noisy aviod rooms near it , Excellent Location in barri gothic right next to tourist info and Cathedral Many good food tapas and shopping 
272395,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Great location and very modern clean rooms Very friendly helpful staff Situated near the old Catedral Within walking distance to all the major tourist attractions 
272396,Catalonia Catedral, The bar area was more of an after thought than an area you would want to spend an hour or so in Staffing levels reflected the lack of interest in the bar area , Location was first class room was well sized 
272397,Catalonia Catedral, The attitude of the reception staff when trying to book a taxi with baby chair from airport not possible when booking a taxi to airport the taxi arrived without babychair when asking reception to print us boarding passes they send us to a bar where 2 extremely slow PC vere located to help ourselves , The location and room were superb so was the breakfest 
272398,Catalonia Catedral, It is noisy at night in the main street , Great hotel in primer location very helpful and polite personnel good breakfast wonderfully connected to the airport with the city shuttle bus going to Placa Catalunya 
272399,Catalonia Catedral, Nothing , Staff was wonderfully welcoming and helpful Room was fantastic were upgraded to one with a plunge pool Bed was comfortable room was clean and quiet 
272400,Catalonia Catedral, It is a minor point but the extra large pillows were hard to sleep on , The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the area The rooms were amazing and the breakfast was well worth trying 
272401,Catalonia Catedral, it was all good crowded neighborhood but expected, The staff was super helpful and had great suggestions for food I love to try the food wherever I travel so a huge plus they told us place THEY like to eat 
272402,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Excellent breakfast nicely appointed room and the recommendations from the hotel staff for restaurants were very good The area is the best and since it is in a pedestrian area it was also very quite 
272403,Catalonia Catedral, The room was a bit dark as the window looked into the backyard, Prime location The team is very pleasant and responsive The room was kept clean I would definitely go back on my next trip to Barcelona 
272404,Catalonia Catedral, Key cards didn t work at first but was resolved swiftly at reception 3 quirky lifts which we had to keep using for the stroller but they functioned fine Slightly annoying that our twin double bed was set up as two singles which made it more awkward for us to keep the baby on the bed whilst preventing him from falling through the gap in the middle Toilet didn t flush well at times but it wasn t a huge issue , Amazing location but not too noisy Great blackout curtains Clean beds and rooms and helpful staff Yummy bedtime chocolates Lots of useful light switches Spacious bathroom and rain shower 
272405,Catalonia Catedral, Breakfast choice was limited and I have a deep seated hatred of Nespresso pods , Central location comfortable room although I had gone for a room on the top floor with a private terrace 
272406,Catalonia Catedral, Staff were very helpful ran out of soya milk one of the mornings but staff ensured that it was sourced for the following morning, Great breakfast Catered for gluten free diets Best shower pressure of any hotel Fabulous stay 
272407,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Very clean and modern and right in the heart of the Gothic area Staff were very helpful and chocolate with evening bed turndown was a nice touch Definitely recommend and would stay again The rating of this hotel is not misleading 
272408,Catalonia Catedral, Didn t like leaving , The staff are very friendly and extremely efficient The beds are big and very very comfortable The location is excellent My third stay here Would not hesitate to return to this hotel 
272409,Catalonia Catedral, Some of the rooms face an indoor courtyard and therefore offer little privacy The rooms are also quite small , The breakfast was excellent and the accommodating staff gave it to us for free to make up for our original room which faced an indoor courtyard The location is also excellent Walking distance to all the sites 
272410,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Lovely hotel in absolutely fantastic location Quiet room on fourth floor Beds were so comfortable slept really well Helpful friendly staff Bed and breakfast basis Perfect spot to explore on foot or close to bus metro and taxi Highly recommend 
272411,Catalonia Catedral, Location of our room apparently my fault because I asked for a view I got solar panels half the pool railings and rooftops at the back of the hotel all from a window no Juliet balcony as shown in the room photos We could not open the curtains fully as people using the pool could see directly in A totally CLEAR glass bathroom toilet door What s that all about We were offered to move next day but decided not to bother That was before the lift kept going nuts Room 501 next to the lift first morning the lift door was repeatedly opening and closing itself and banging at 5am and then again at 6 20am I had to phone reception both times because they could not hear it Trust me we could Continually inconsistent servicing of room water one night no water next night no milk I don t expect this at 4 star level Paid more than expected probably due to Euro In fairness staff kept apologising and gave us complementary breakfast In truth I would rather all had been well , The location is the feature of this hotel The bed was comfortable There were some nice things such as voucher for welcome drink and night time chocolate 
272412,Catalonia Catedral, The bed was two singles pushed together and could have been more robust , Lovely room in a really well situated hotel just off the Cathedral square right next to a semi pedestrianised shopping street Breakfast was excellent Ate lunch once in the snack bar at the hotel and the food was excellent The staff were really helpful and friendly Unfortunately we didn t get chance to try out the pool The location is fantastic for exploring the Gothic area of the city and for shopping but yet was not overly noisy 
272413,Catalonia Catedral, The lounge facilities were not good The bar was in a passage and there was not really any seating where one could relax for a while , The location Very central to the old city we could walk almost everywhere Staff all very helpful and polite 
272414,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, The rooms are spacious The king beds were very comfy Nice facilities Good breakfast buffet for 19E We had two rooms one facing the front of the hotel was a little noisy due to the pedestrians on the plaza near the Cathedral and the customers in the restaurant terrace across the street The other room was on the back and had its own private terrace This room was huge and also quiet 
272415,Catalonia Catedral, Location is great but getting there by taxi is terrible Taxis don t want to access the area Taxi dropped us and we had to find our way , Location the hotel is beautiful and the staff very helpful 
272416,Catalonia Catedral, Some taxi drivers did not drop us at the hotel due to the narrow and crowded roads so we had to walk for a short distance , The location was excellent the room was very comfortable and clean the staff were very friendly and helpful 
272417,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Location was excellent We love the Barre Gotic in Barcelona and have stayed there before This location was even better than before Close to everything and walking distance to so much more Amazing restaurants and shopping at our doorstep The hotel was really good Clean and confortable and nice to have air conditioning We had our 16 year old son in the same room on a sofa bed It Was a double sofa bed and there was still room for our 3 cases Not a problem but weird was the liftconfiguration From reception you take a lift to 2nd floor and then walk to the back of the hotel and get the lifts to your floor 
272418,Catalonia Catedral, Finding the location of the hotel was a bit confusing Our cab was not able to drop us off in front of the hotel for some reason so we started off a little turned around Not ideal on cobble stone streets while carting luggage Maybe it would have been easier if the cab dropped us off near Cathedral of Barcelona with fewer cobbles Overall convient hotel location , Helpful front desk staff and house keeping Clean modern decor with rooftop pool Great central location Walking distance to popular tourist hot spots cafes and restaurants Tourist information center a few doors down on the left Get tickets in advance 
272419,Catalonia Catedral, Didn t have beer in the self service machine on the roof Would have been easier for the bar personal , The staff was very friendly and helpful The location is great and the pool area is quite good I would definitely go there again 
272420,Catalonia Catedral, Nothing , Location staff pool to cool off after a long day of sightseeing great restaurant cute little bar nice rooms Bottom line everything you need for a great trip to Barcelona 
272421,Catalonia Catedral, Bar area not well set up , Great room with private balcony and plung pool Central location with shopping bars and restaurants close by Breakfasts were great Staff very helpful and professional Excellent base for the old city 
272422,Catalonia Catedral, Our only criticism would be the cost of the breakfast We decided to go against purchasing the breakfast at 19 euros each per day The market on the Ramblas offered fresh quick cheap alternative , Rooms were kept lovely and clean Facilities were great and location was excellent 
272423,Catalonia Catedral, The rooms are a bit dark the hotel was constructed in an ancient cathedral and the window opens on the interior of the hotel with a glass elevator at the center So you cannot really open your window without having pretty much every other room clients and elevator users watching you They vaporized too much perfume in the lobby and the smell was too strong and unpleasant The deco of the rooms is too sober black and grey which is a bit depressing especially given that the natural light does not enter the rooms especially those located in the first floor , The location is perfect near important touristic spots and not far from the beach but not noisy at all The staff was really nice and professional The breakfast is varied and of high quality 
272424,Catalonia Catedral, No taxies in front of the hotel unless yo ask the reception to call a taxi But it s a walkable area with a lot of shops so it doesn t really matter Finally The breakfast may not have as many varieties as some other hotels but the quality was good , central location clean 
272425,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Wonderful in every way Second stay here We had a room with terrace to walk right out to the pool this time and that was a nice extra Highly recommend and will stay here again Also recommend cooking class at market Boquerio
272426,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, I liked the hotel a lot the the location of the hotel is great the staff were very nice and i want to give special thanks to hassan from the reception who was really kind to us and was really friendly and we got special Al Eid gift from the hotel 
272427,Catalonia Catedral, Whilst this isn t a major issue I did have to ask for an iron more than once , The rooftop pool and bar were an excellent added extra Lots of space for clothes All staff were very friendly and approachable Would definitely stay again 
272428,Catalonia Catedral, The staff were all extremely helpful and polite However when short staffed they were stress was offloaded to the customers to an extent I didn t like that , The roof terrace pool area was excellent and never too busy The rooms are clean and the beds are super comfy 
272429,Catalonia Catedral, rooms at the front of the hotel very noisy from early in the morning price paid didn t reflect the hotel s own tariff on display at reception which showed the room we had being a lot cheaper At 255 euro per night breakfast should be included , location is excellent for everything 
272430,Catalonia Catedral, Housekeeping either came so late in the day 4 00pm or not at all in one occasion The staff is great but too lean Bar service at the pool took 30 minutes and the whole outdoor space closes at 9pm Additionally there were no drawers or shelves in our room so we had to live out of our suitcases for 5 days , The room was spacious modern and comfortable
272431,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, There were three main reasons why we booked this hotel the location the little private pool on the balcony that the bathroom was in a separate room with a door and not only covered somehow with a see through glass wall staff was very helpful and friendly
272432,Catalonia Catedral, Nothing bad to say about this hotel we loved staying here , Roof top pool was refreshing and clean Rooms lovely cool and clean Good black out curtains ensured we didn t get woken up by the early morning sun Reception staff on duty all the time meant we could eat out very late Location in the gothic quarter was excellent Cleaning staff great Short stroll to a metro station Would love to stay here again 
272433,Catalonia Catedral, Room was within 10 metres of an open roof top terrace restaurant which closed at 1 30 am Impossible to sleep At almost 300 euros per night this is unacceptable ,No Positive
272434,Catalonia Catedral, Would have liked breakfast to have been a little less expensive as cost prohibitive which meant we had breakfast out each day , Super central location wonderful friendly reception beds so comfortable and overall a lovely relaxed venue for a family holiday Especially liked the little chocs put into the room each day 
272435,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Everything perfect Very attentive service from all staff It was our son s seventh birthday during our stay and having seen his birthday cards dotted around the room even left a little gift for him when we returned later in the day 
272436,Catalonia Catedral, Everything was great we had absolutely no issues , Amazing location in the heart of Barcelona Walks distance to everywhere Staff is super nice and helpful rooms are clean and comfortable We will definitely be back at this hotel 
272437,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, The location staff were fantastic you couldn t get a better location in Barcelona the staff were incredibly friendly and their recommendations for places to go or eat were all excellent 
272438,Catalonia Catedral, It took a long time to get drinks at the pool area and if there wasn t a staff member up there then you couldn t order anything Maybe it would be good to have a phone in the pool area where guests can call for service or to order drinks or food should they wish , The hotel was in the perfect location staff were friendly and welcoming and our room was comfortable I would recommend this place to people travelling to Barcelona 
272439,Catalonia Catedral, Can t think of any faults This place was wonderful , Everything about this hotel was excellent Helpful friendly staff Lovely bedroom en suite Great food in restaurant Close to attractions Close to city bus tour routes Close to all types of restaurants About 20 minutes from airport Used taxi for airport to hotel return
272440,Catalonia Catedral, Pool didn t open until 10am which was a little late Breakfast was 19 thought that was expensive particularly given current exchange rate so didn t bother maybe it was value for money , Amazing location rooms are spacious and spotless Staff very helpful Will return 
272441,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Bed is comfortable the water pressure is very good lots of hot water with a good shower Staff are excellent spoke English very approachable and helpful Great location 
272442,Catalonia Catedral, The breakfast is quite expensive at 19 each so we decided to eat out instead The bar whilst serving good cocktails lacks some atmosphere in the early evening , The room was fantastic clean and a lovely terrace on that exits to the pool Very impressed 
272443,Catalonia Catedral, Despite the room being so big there was hardly any closet space and not a single drawer or shelf in the room For those traveling for several days there this may be a challenge , Great location right in the heart of the city and mere seconds away from La Rambla The staff was very friendly and helpful the room was spacious and the room with terrace is right on the pool level which was a great bonus Wifi was very good Huge bathrooms which is nice but could have used the space better 
272444,Catalonia Catedral, The air con wasn t very good never usually a problem but it was so hot , Gorgeous hotel fantastic location amazing rooms Couldn t reccomend enough 
272445,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Excellent location definitely the best part of town to be The pool was a great way to relax after a hard days sight seeing The cleanliness and general standard of the accommodation was very good and the staff friendly I would without a doubt stay there again 
272446,Catalonia Catedral, Expensive, The hotel rooms are top quality and the hotel is situated in an ideal location perfect for tourists wanting to explore the city All the staff were very pleasant and helpful I would 100 recommend this hotel 
272447,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Excellent location in a quiet street just off the Cathedral square and within a short walking distance from the Rambla the Boqueria the Picasso Museum the Palace of Music Catalunya Square even Barceloneta about 15 20 min Just ideal for Barcelona sightseeing Comfortable well equipped modern room Friendly and very helpful staff 
272448,Catalonia Catedral, Took 3 days to have a light bulb replaced but only a very minor concern one has to be truthful , Full English breakfast was superb and the fruit yogurt selection was its equal
272449,Catalonia Catedral, The bar area was disappointing with very little seating area to sit and chat with friends and the small terrace area wasn t very inviting, The staff were very helpful and the location was great just round the corner from the cathedral and bus stops for the tour buses The rooftop pool was a very welcome respite after a day of sightseeing 
272450,Catalonia Catedral, I know it s the life style of the area but music outside the window at 2 00 a m wasn t appreciated , Room was clean staff friendly great location 
272451,Catalonia Catedral, nothing to say, Location cleanliness of the hotel helpful staff everything This is my second time in Catalonia Catedral and I will stay here anytime

272453,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, This hotel was amazing The staff were extremely friendly and helpful Especially Mark who went out of his way to help us as the day we were travelling home there was a Metro strike The hotel also gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne as they had realised it was my husbands birthday We will definitely be going back

272460,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Excellent location in the gothic quarter easy walk to lots of bars and shops Spacious and quiet room with large comfortable bed Rooftop pool ideal for relaxing after exploring the city Hotel staff were friendly and very attentive 
272461,Catalonia Catedral, The over priced room that did not include breakfast For customers only staying one or two nights you hardly spend time in the private area Was not worth the price at all , the cleanliness and bed size 
272462,Catalonia Catedral, Nothing , Great location Staff were friendly helpful Room had all the bits we needed Clean Wi Fi worked well Loved having a bar on floor 2 so we could go have a drink and a snack at the end of the day without having to go back out 
272463,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, We loved the room balcony and private pool It looked exactly like the picture on the website It was incredibly spacious and a terrific location for exploring the city Very friendly and helpful staff on reception We would highly recommend this hotel 
272464,Catalonia Catedral, The partial shower door made it difficult to keep the bathroom floor dry But guess that may be a European things as we encountered several on our trip We never found an ice machine but the bartender graciously provided us with some , The staff was incredibly helpful with suggestions directions arranging transportation Great rooftop pool for hanging out with friends 
272465,Catalonia Catedral, Nothung, Lovely hotel and very helpful and lovely staff We were upgraded to a suite on level 5 which was a wonderful surprise after a stressful time getting there Thank you to all staff at front desk Very helpful 
272466,Catalonia Catedral, After requesting a no smoking room we were given a smoking room which was changed after a bit of teeth sucking at reception Room superior looked out over a noisy ally a noisy restaurant with outdoor seating late at night and a building site which seemed to be a hotel being refurnished Peaceful no but then you are right in the city centre Taxi driver from the airport said access to hotel entrance was difficult which it is in a pedestrianised zone so dropped us 300m away with heavy bags , Excellent location for walking to old town cathedral and gothic quarter staff pleasant and helpful actual room and bathroom very nice and comfortable 
272467,Catalonia Catedral, Aircon not working properly , Perfect location In the centre of bari gothic Close to the barcelona cathedral and amazing restaurants Andrea at the front desk was incredibily friendly and helpful when checking in 
272468,Catalonia Catedral, Nothing, The location is fab right in the centre near the cathedral and gothic quarter shops etc But still very quiet and chilled The rooftop pool was lovely although we didn t get much time to enjoy it Breakfast was excellent with an amazing choice of food The room was cool and quiet and very clean with a well stocked mini bar the prices reasonable too Great choice for a city break 
272469,Catalonia Catedral, Couldn t open the balcony window and that was only to be nosy watching the world go by , Fabulous location excellent staff all friendly polite and professional did everything possible for us Breakfast has everything you can imagine and all very fresh Location couldn t be better right in the middle of it all and if ever lost all you need to do is find the cathedral

272474,Catalonia Catedral, Cold cooked breakfasts Poor stock levels in bar and restaurant Poor customer service in bar and restaurant by a few members of senior staff , Good location and kept in pristine condition Great reception staff 
272475,Catalonia Catedral, Breakfast was not as good as it shoud be At least tea service should be made to the table Cooked breakfast selections were almost cold like omelettes or sausages etc The price of the breakfast was definitely high for what you get , Staff members were extremely kind and helpfull The room was beautiful with terrace and a very small pool It was very silent and peaceful so we had a very good sleep Furthermore the room was very clean Modern and comfortable furniture was very nice Free wifi was working fast and the connection was good The hotel is in walking distance to many famous places like Barcelona Cathedral Picasso Museum Las Ramblas Pessaig de Gracia etc We enjoyed our stay very much on top of everything the staff members were extraordinarily good 
272476,Catalonia Catedral, Making tea and coffee at breakfast was a bit of a faff , Staff recognised us from last visit approx 11 months ago and appeared genuinely pleased to welcome us back 
272477,Catalonia Catedral, No replenishment of milk in room Replaced failed kettle pronto Bar prices not cheap, Breakfast good location excellent staff friendly Nice touches with complimentary bottles of water and chocolates every day
272478,Catalonia Catedral, Didn t find Towels for pool Service in pool area could be better and hotel could offer a simple breakfast , The hotel staff was very helpful went out of their way to get us info bookings etc location very lively offers choices for eating shopping walking around
272479,Catalonia Catedral, Although the pool and pool area were very clean the water was freezing It was April so I m sure in the summer it s much warmer We could hear everything going on in the street below our room it was as if the window was open which was quite disruptive when we were trying to sleep this was very bad on the Friday night , We stayed here for 4 nights with our 8 year old and 5 year old in a family room The room was a very good size and children were very comfortable in their sofa bed Our beds were very comfortable as well but we were gaven twin beds instead of a double this was resolved by putting the twin beds together but we would have preferred a double The hotel was very clean and well managed The staff were friendly and helpful Breakfast was great The selection was fantastic and all the food was fresh There was even an option to order food from a small menu 
272480,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, We had a premier terrace room on 4th floor Loved the easy access to the pool terrace Very comfy extra large bed and slept well Good adequate breakfast and helpful staff Overall good location and lovely hotel which made our weekend visit very enjoyable 
272481,Catalonia Catedral, The room we had was a bit dark but didnt really matter , Great hotel super location comfy beds good and fresh breakfast till late and very friendly and helpfull staff We were given two restaurant recommendations nearby and they proof to be perfect Would definitely go back and recommend the hotel to family and friends 
272482,Catalonia Catedral, Almost nothing Front desk on the first day wasn t really helpful but they surely made up for it on the second day Still could have been more helpful , Excellent breakfast and an amazing location 
272483,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Comfortable beds quiet room friendly and helpful staff made us feel special and welcome Breakfast alone was worth the trip to Barcelona Selection of meats eggs pancakes breads yogurt fresh fruit smoothies juices incredible We didn t hear any noise from inside or outside the hotel in our room Good night s sleep Super close to Cathedral and Placa Catalunya 
272484,Catalonia Catedral, We genuinely can t think of anything, Wow what can we say this place is a gem location was fantastic staff where very helpful and it made our stay in Barcelona The room was great and came with a vue of the kissing wall The staff went out of there way to help us and gave us directions to one place we could not find on one night it had started to rain and they sorted an umbrella for us The hotel is located in the gothic quarter and very easy to get to on public transport with good links to the metro busses and the aerobus Our visit was to see relatives and we would stay here again next time 
272485,Catalonia Catedral, Nothing, Staff were exceptional we requested to change our room as we booked a double nothing wrong with the one we had but we got the double room but it was much smaller than our previous room we asked to change again and they attended to us without hesitation The location as far as I m concerned is perfect Right outside the cathedral walking distance to bars shops Las Ramblas Catalunya square A great Hotel
272486,Catalonia Catedral, Noise from street outside Mainly Friday and Saturday 12 midnight to 2 am Very noisy street cleaning machinery, Lovely hotel Excellent room Excellent food
272487,Catalonia Catedral, We found the breakfast poor value for money Hot food was cold and poor choice in hot food , The location was excellent The staff were helpful and friendly The room was comfortable and high standard of cleanliness 
272488,Catalonia Catedral, Too be honest there was nothing about this hotel we didn t like , Staff are extremely pleasent and helpful The design of the hotel is excellent The location is outstanding Just a two minute stroll to the cathedral a 10 minute meander to La Rambla and easy access to metro buses and shopping The Gaudi Cathedral is a bit of a walk but certainly worth the effort This is an old building tastefully modernised and well thought out When you arrive check out the spectacular hand painted atrium It took the artist 3 months and we had the pleasure of seeing him both at work and finishing his creation 
272489,Catalonia Catedral, Nothing , The location is superb Right in the heart of the Gothic quarter Surprisingly wasn t noisy even though our room looked right onto the main square Breakfast was fantastic all you can think of was on offer Staff are highly skilled and very friendly I would definitely come back here again 
272490,Catalonia Catedral, For a 4 hotel the room seems to be quite small Very limited general facilities Bar and restaurant quit simple , Friendly and helpfull stuff very central location 
272491,Catalonia Catedral, Private pool is useless very small and like 50cm deep I would rather call it a Jacuzzi without the waterjet function , Had a great modern room with terras private pool 
272492,Catalonia Catedral, Think there was staff shortage as dining room staff were manning the bar hence we were asked to wait half an hour for a drink when we returned to the hotel after eating out not good ,No Positive
272493,Catalonia Catedral, The set price breakfast was 19 Euros per person which is a bit steep especially if one is a light eater We passed on their breakfast and went to the amazing market a few blocks away where we could get wonderful food and coffee for about 5 Euros each , Perfect location with easy access to Metro and points of interest Helpful staff at front desk 
272494,Catalonia Catedral, Towels were a bit hard room noisy the second night outside at 330 am shouting in street, Staff excellent location fantastic Would stay here again but ask for a quieter room nice complimentary bottles of water in fridge and tea making facilities
272495,Catalonia Catedral, Felt uncomfortable with bathroom door next to the bed opaque glass no lock 1 cm gap around it Stylish but very little privacy Found breakfast too expensive 19 very often the case in many hotel chains so we had it in a nice cafe nearby for a fraction of the cost, Helpful and smiling staff Good location right in the heart of city modern decor Wifi included overall very satisfied Terrace pool thoug too cold to swim the weather was good enough to relax in the sun 
272496,Catalonia Catedral, Would have been nice if the shower gel and coffee had been replenished more frequently I m really only nit picking now though , Gorgeous big room very clean nice decor Really comfortable bed Bath and rain shower was an added bonus Helpful polite staff Amazing location close by to the cathedral shops and La Rambla Easy access to the metro Jaume is just 5 minutes walk The roof terrace and pool would be fabulous in summer All in all it was perfect for a few days break 
272497,Catalonia Catedral, Nothing really If you want to be picky the bathroom floor was really cold and could have done with a matt maybe of if they could provide slippers Will go back next time I m in Barcelona for sure , The room was spacious modern and comfortable Housekeeping does a proper job The breakfast is excellent The buffet is much better stocked than some of the five stars I ve stayed in Absolutely perfect location No surprises 
272498,Catalonia Catedral, Breakfast is not meeting my expectation the selection of the food is limited Tv cable is of a limited choices, Receptionist staff Room services Location Cleanliness Wi Fi service
272499,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Great location and very friendly staff I would highly recommend The bedrooms were comfortable and modern It was easy to walk to all the shops and restaurants Also the beach was only 10 min walk 
272500,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, This was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly with them giving us recommendations of where we could eat The room was very clean and comfortable The food in the hotel restaurant was excellent Would most defiantly recommend
272501,Catalonia Catedral, Nothing, Both our bedroom and bathroom were well equipped spacious and comfortable I can not imagine what else you could possibly want for breakfast that is not on offer here The staff are welcoming and consistently helpful The plan of the hotel is such that although you are in an excellent location right by the cathedral the rooms face in to bijou courtyards and are therefore not affected by the action right outside the front door Superb 
272502,Catalonia Catedral, A bit on the pricey side but a good introduction to Barcelona , Everything was great about our stay Location was perfect Staff were very helpful They helped us find good places to eat and explain the metro system Bathrooms were clean and a good sized room 
272503,Catalonia Catedral, Having to change lifts at first floor got to be a bit nauseous towards the end of our stay otherwise nothing to complain or worry about , Location in the Gothic Quarter just at the back of the Gothic Cathedral and 3 minutes walk from Ramblas and Bouqueria Market couldn t have been much better Being on a pedestrianized street meant it was also very quiet Good range of options for breakfast and the whole place was spotlessly clean Bed was huge and very comfortable When hotel found out it was my partner s 50th birthday they gave us a free upgrade to a room with a private pool 
272504,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, The staff were excellent we headed to a tapas restaurant the first night from recommendation and it was the best tapas we ve ever had Absolutely delicious The room was very spacious and comfortable Overall the location was excellent less than a minute walk to La Ramblas and the Cathedral Would highly recommend
272505,Catalonia Catedral, You need to take two different elevators to get to the second floor and above Breakfast is 19 euros which is pretty steep considering there are tons of cafes around the hotel where you can eat good a breakfast for 5 euros Noisy at night if your room is on the street side Stairs are difficult to find , The location is great It s close to everything Staff is friendly and nice The room we had was decent and comfortable 
272506,Catalonia Catedral, Would have liked different seating in bar and a member of staff serving purely on the bar as they had to serve in the restaurant as well and so could take a while to serve just drinks i, we were very happy with our room which was modern very clean and well appointed Staff were very pleasant and helpful 
272507,Catalonia Catedral, It would have been nice if the hotel pool was heated , A great hotel in a perfect location The hotel is clean and comfortable and staff friendly and helpful We chose to have breakfast in the hotel which was excellent with a large choice of good quality food 
272508,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Staff were very accommodating even though we were checking in late at night and on a busy holiday The location is top notch really good distance from La Ramblas and Placa Catalunya The rooms were very clean and the bathroom spacious Lounge and cafe on the first floor was also beautifully done Would stay again here in a heartbeat 
272509,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, It s in the best location but yet very quite The staff was friendly and helpful and the room was very big and clean Great VFM you won t regret it 
272510,Catalonia Catedral, The only issue was that our door key didn t work on 4 separate occasions which meant 4 separate trips down to reception, The staff couldn t help enough really amiable and friendly The location was perfect and breakfast first class So much choice
272511,Catalonia Catedral, We did not like the heat coming off the lights over the bathroom mirror making the room almost impossible to stay in The only other mirror was in the hall and it was poorly lit , We enjoyed the quality of the beds and the blackout features of the curtains The staff were courteous and efficient Breakfast was delicious 
272512,Catalonia Catedral, As I had some business in town I asked for 45 minutes late check out but it was not possible so I checked out from morning , Beautiful building spacious and clean room Had dinner one night in the restaurant tasty food and reasonable prices 
272513,Catalonia Catedral, The blanket was a bit uncomfortable and there were no slippers in the room , The hotel was very clean and modern and the location was fantastic Staff were very helpful 
272514,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Right in the centre next to cathedral can walk everywhere All updated inside Spotlessly clean Great selection of toiletries toothbrush razor combs etc great for those travelling hand luggage only 
272515,Catalonia Catedral, We were on the 4th floor and the air conditioning vents outside the room on the terrace were very noisy I would go for a room on the 2nd or 3rd floor , Fantastic location Room was spotless Staff were very helpful and the breakfast was delicious Rooms actually looked just like the photos 
272516,Catalonia Catedral, Can t fault the place , We arrived to greeted by a very friendly member of staff who checked us in quickly efficiently We had even been upgraded as we were there to celebrate our birthdays The rooms are beautiful very clean the shower is fab We really couldn t fault the place very centrally located Would definitely stay again 
272517,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, The staff were so accommodating and helpful Located by the Portal d Angel a pedestrian shopping street and the cathedral of Barcelona it is very convenient to restaurants and transportation The room was very clean and the elevators very handy I cannot say anything negative about this hotel 
272518,Catalonia Catedral, Absolutely nothing, Staff A1 service location value for money and cleanliness are second to none and I haven t seen a breakfast like that for years 
272519,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly They assisted us with several reservations for activities in Barcelona as well as with directions Room was modern clean and well appointed with a comfortable bed I suggest asking for a room higher than the 1st floor as there can be some noise from a courtyard below 
272520,Catalonia Catedral, it was a shame that we were not all on the same floor , Happy to accommodate a large family group fantastic breakfast selection great value for money Cocktails were good and not to pricey very helpful with restaurant recommendations and timings for events like the Magic Fountains 
272521,Catalonia Catedral, It would be nice if the hotel provided breakfast, The location was perfect we could walk to almost every site we wanted to see The staff directed us to two very nice dinner restaurants 
272522,Catalonia Catedral, Glass bathroom door would prefer traditional door for more privacy, Helpful and friendly staff and the location great breakfast small bar for relaxing wo go access
272523,Catalonia Catedral, We were there with our two kids and the room was not very big The kids had to sleep on a couch which is only conventient to a certain extend My Impression was that is was a slightly bigger double beed room whith a couch in it to turn the room into a family room if required Looking at the price per night and size and comfort of our room I was not 100 satisfied , excellent location very central and an ideal starting point for a city tour Despite the fact that the Hotel is close to the cathedral our room was very quiet harldy any noise Around the hotel there are some nice tapas bars and excellent shopping options The rambla is only a few minutes walk away the same for the more historical side of Barcelona I can cleary recommend this Hotel 
272524,Catalonia Catedral, Noise is an issue here Noise from the outside the double glazed windows don t do a thing to soundproof noise from the corridor The worst part is that the bathroom door is only a smoked glass pane no auditory privacy whatsoever Awkward Also the standard room was a little small for two people The restaurant while it had received good reviews was always deserted and lonely felt dark and enclosed We ate elsewhere all three days , This hotel really is at the heart of the city tourist sights shopping wandering excellent restaurants all within mere steps of the front door 
272525,Catalonia Catedral, Street outside is very noisy with street noise from street sweepers bottle banks being emptied and tourists throughout the night The balcony doors fail to cut out this noise Avoid rooms that overlook the street if noise at night bothers you , Convenient position Twice a day tidying of room 
272526,Catalonia Catedral, my only gripe is my wife has allergies to certain pillows bedding They could only give us more sheets as they had no alternative to what we had already Itchy nose aside the stay was great , The location was brilliant right near the old town gothic quarter staff were really helpful too 
272527,Catalonia Catedral, The bedroom was a little bit small and claustrophobic but very clean and the walk in shower was amazing The hotel breakfast was very expensive would have been nice to have had the option of something less lavish and less expensive , The location of the hotel was fantastic and Barcelona was amazing
272528,Catalonia Catedral, Basic room with very high price Did not find anything luxirous which is expected for this price No view from the room and windows cannot be opened No warm blankets, Good location next to main city attraction and restaurants
272529,Catalonia Catedral, The hotel was good but the price was far too expensive For that rate I would have expected a bigger hotel bigger and better decorated room and more facilities Out room was quite dark and looking out on a large pipe , The location was very convenient and the staff were very helpful The hotel is very clean 
272530,Catalonia Catedral, A little expensive for what it was Just a little antiseptic almost characterless Bar seemed to close at 11 Restaurant little overpriced , Location modern design
272531,Catalonia Catedral, It is difficult to reach in a vehicle because the area immediately around the hotel is all pedestrianized and taxis can only drop you at the lower end of the adjacent plaza , Very modern styling throughout and very clean and well appointed Food was very good and the hotel is very centrally situated near to the cathedral and surrounding shops and restaurants 
272532,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, I had an AMAZING stay at the Catalonia Catedral The location is perfect in the heart of the Gothic district 1 minute walk from the Barcelona Cathedral I truly felt like I was part of Barcelona My room was large with a very comfortable bed and perfect view The staff was extremely friendly and helpful The breakfast was phenomenal 
272533,Catalonia Catedral, Expensive and you are really paying for the location The rooms are nice but for the price I would normally expect great lobby services a nice bar and a good restaurant Even the swimming pool is tiny and shallow and very cold The only staff you can find are at the reception desk and some were just a bit surly , Great Location right on the square in front of the Cathedral 
272534,Catalonia Catedral, One slight issue with the WiFi as they need to re set the router regularly However the internet speed was excellent, Every thing in this lovely boutique hotel
272535,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, The staff were extremely helpful and the hotel was beautiful Couldn t fault the location and the pool was perfect for the kids Cocktails were pretty good too 
272536,Catalonia Catedral, The room had no drawers shelves for storage I have never stayed in a hotel of any number of stars without them Easy to rectify by putting in a small number of shelves , Good location friendly staff The breakfast was good and our booking had it included in the price but it was expensive at 19 Beds had decent pillows and clean linen every day Wi Fi was good and the restaurant was ok when we used it but plenty of choice nearby 
272537,Catalonia Catedral, Nothing, I have booked a premium suite in catalonia catedral hotel with terrace and private pool I really recommend it to couples to go there Extremely clean room with lots of facilities 
272538,Catalonia Catedral, Nothing, In the centre of the gothic city and a rooftop swimming pool perfect The staff were friendly welcoming and helpful The very modern hotel has excellent facilities throughout The breakfast is fresh and extensive even vodka We will return 
272539,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, We enjoyed the location in the middle of everything We had a very quiet room loved it Comfortable beds clean room and big shower Friendly and helpfull staff 
272540,Catalonia Catedral, The wifi was very poor Other than in the hall or the lounge area we had no signal really should have a wifi base in each room since most travelers do not have cellular or data, Everything was perfect Staff were friendly and very attentive
272541,Catalonia Catedral, Was pretty noisy as the corridors have pseudo wooden floors and the staff spent an hour on two consecutive days cleaning a room next door to us making a racket Also the shower was variable with hot cold coming and going, this has a great position walking distance on a smooth pedestrian road good with bags from placa Catalunya where the airport bus drops you off Its good enough but quite expensive and I suggest more research may get better value in the same area which is perfect 
272542,Catalonia Catedral, Nothing it s central there was a party in the square but that s what to expect in a central location, Lovely hotel in a great location We only stayed for 1 night but wished it had been longer Breakfast was also lovely 
272543,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, The location was Amazing Right around the corner form the Barcelona Cathedral in the Gothic Quarter Walking distance to La Ramblas and quick access to the Metro Extremely friendly and helpful staff Beautiful clean rooms And we even got a glass of champagne to welcome us on check in 
272544,Catalonia Catedral, The rooms are a bit dark modern but with dark interior Would appreciate a bit more light , Location intimate environment cleanliness charm David at the front desk is the best concierge 
272545,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, The location is perfect for enjoying the old city The hotel is modern our room was quiet and not cramped the beds were great and the shower was good 
272546,Catalonia Catedral, No bathrobes when asked for staff did not understand but we saw other visitors at pool with bathrobes No slippers but we saw visitor at breakfast with Catalonia slippers We had booked a room with extra bed for 3 people but only had two cups glasses tea etc did get 3 x towels Price is only about 12 percent less than booking two rooms but we wanted to share so they should have made provisions for 3 people , Loved Breakfast amazing location perfect Very quiet Lots to like 
272547,Catalonia Catedral,No Negative, Excellent hotel right in the heart of the Gothic quarter On semi pedestrianised street opposite the Cathedral Staff were very friendly and helpful Restaurant and bar served quality food and great value Overall better than many 5 star international chains a nice surprise 
272548,Catalonia Catedral, The restaurant menu was limited Was there for a week and ate about same thing each day , Location and staff Staff very nice friendly and always ready to assist 
272549,Catalonia Catedral, One member of staff was unhelpful when key card wouldn t open the room door Acted like it was our fault the door wouldn t open Needless to say it was a problem with the batteries that operated the card locking system, The rooftop pool bar terrace
272550,Catalonia Catedral, Wifi a bit temperamental in the room and not being allowed to open room windows to balcony a bit of a pain but both are no big deal , Amazingly helpful staff from front desk through to wait staff Room is large comfortable and with lots of well arranged cupboard space Breakfast is varied and delicious and the pool area a nice retreat The hotel is in a great position and well soundproofed Had room 220 looking over the street wonderful
272551,Catalonia Catedral, Breakfast was excellent but should be included as part of the price of the room , Great location for exploring the centre of the city I asked for a quiet room and that s what I got 
272552,Catalonia Catedral, On arrival taxi driver would not enter the plaza across the front of the Cathedral so we had to pull our cases along to the hotel obviously not the hotel s fault , Very comfy bed great location 
272553,Catalonia Catedral, Not good value for price paid Small room Curtains needed to be closed permanently as the room was across from glassed lift No foyer lounge and no lounge in general to relax Room on smoking floor and smelled of smoke in corridor Although indicated in the room beauty salon sevices available I had to walk 15 20 mins to sister hotel Ramblas for treatment ,No Positive
272554,Catalonia Catedral, The hotel was clean and the bedroom and bathroom was well furnished and clean however I feel that it was expensive we paid almost 500 for a three night stay without breakfast , The central location of the hotel 
272555,Catalonia Catedral, Nothing , Excellent location loved the modern interior and traditional exterior Rooms comfortable and attractive
