371929,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, The view could have been better but I would hardly say that is there fault I was really impressed over all, Reallly good breakfast bar and the pool was a great size 
371930,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, nothing, Trendy hotel in an area with sights to see nearby Restaurants shops and supermarket within 100 metres Near airport bus drop off pick up location Near other public transport Great staff on front desk always giving great advice of what to see Barcelona was the highlight of our European trip in regards to hotel matching what the Booking com description stated it would be Can not fault this hotel 
371931,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, I wish we realised there were terrace rooms They have a large terrace to sit and entertain The other rooms are quite small but very comfortable and clean Apart from the lady who checked us inthe other front desk staff were indifferent and if I had to give a description I would say bored There was no greeting or eye contact on entering the building from the male receptionist the or brunette female If you want to be close to the old city it is a very long walk The pool is pretty cold but refreshing, Bed was extremely comfortable The bath products were lux The blonde lady who was there at check in was extremely kind and helpful If you are looking to be away from the crowds and near the top restaurants and the mall this is a great location If you want an adult hotel this is great 
371932,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Room facilities are not up to the standerd I expected for the price and I was disappointed as many other similar hotels for half the price, Nice reception area and modern look inside the building although rooms are basic
371933,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Paid for prior to trip didnt realise tourist tax would be added although not great expense was unaware of it , Good selection on offer for breakfast and available until 1100 Luxury hotel very clean Room thoroughly cleaned daily Pool terrace lovely private and small so not crowded 
371934,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Wifi was annoying frequent dropouts needing you to reset your connection and login required each time you went to use the connection Pool was nice but small and a warm day fills the terrace early with only a few places to sit Staff were fine without being exceptional we waited almost 10 minutes to check in while another guest was asking for extensive directions not the staffs fault and great that they could provide the assistance and then the phone rang which was answered and dealt with all with us standing in front of the staff with no acknowledgement Location is a little further out from the main attractions but close to the metro and airport bus stop , Room facilities were fine Comfortable and clean Close to the Metro and a shopping centre with some good little bars and cafes around 
371935,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup,No Negative, Receptionist was efficient friendly and very very helpful Rooms were excellent beds very conformable and the shower was heaven rooms were not HUGE but big enough and the design was very well thought out pool on roof was a plus Hotel was well located for early airport run or to visit the wonderful sights of Barcelona good restaurants in the area and a shopping mall if you felt the urge to shop Parking was across the street from hotel and offered at a discount rate with hotel stay 
371936,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Staff was quite rude also amongst one another It seemed like there was one girl new to the team which wasn t treated nicely by its colleagues Especially one blond lady at the front desk was a bit aggressive was only there on the Monday when I checked out was claiming we didn t pay for the room in a really aggressive way even I paid for it online over booking com and not apologising after she had discovered she was in the wrong I booked one room for three people online it looked like we are going to get a room with two double beds that was however not the case Our friend had to sleep on a folding bed in a room designed for two people So it was all really cramped and not what I would expect when I pay 550 EUR for two nights in Barcelona, Nice little terrace with swimming pool
371937,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Bar service was very slow Restaurant did not offer much next to breakfast Service had to be provided by the same staff as the reception which made everything pretty slow , Nice quiet and clean hotel with decent rooms 
371938,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Nothing , Wow Fantastic apartments Stunning design lovely pool beautiful rooms I would recommend the rooms with the terraces they are sunny and large with a comfortable outdoor sofa and table Swimming pool was a real treat Lovely staff Would definitely stay here again with no hesitation 
371939,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Smallish rooms and a little hot and stuffy but all and all having a balcony really helped bring in some fresh air, The front desk was a great help Hussain was amazing Nice hotel overall
371940,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Beds were a bit hard but this is more personal preference , A great property so close to the airport bus that goes every 5 minutes Transfer was smooth staff was excellent and helpful the pool though small was still nice at the right weather breakfast was nice Also good to not stay too downtown downtown 
371941,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, We had a leaky kettle but I m sure if we d have asked it would have been replaced No other problems at all from check in to check out perfect in every way for us , The Hotel was Beautiful Exactly as we d expected and more glass and mirrors glass lift very clean and friendly helpful receptionists The room was wonderful spacious big comfy bed fab walk in shower and separate toilet The only draw back was the lack of drawers to put your clothes but we got round that one and it was only a minor problem There is also a terrace at the top of the Hotel and a plunge pool but we didn t have the time to explore looked like a sun trap though We were VERY impressed by the cleanliness of the place and how contemporary everything was Staff are very helpful and the room cleaned every day to a very high standard We didn t sample the breakfast as it wasn t included in our package and preferred to go out for our meals anyway Totally delighted with this Hotel and was very comfy for the 4 nights we stayed here Would definitely recommend 
371942,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup,No Negative, Location was excellent Christina at the front desk was amazing great guidance about the sights and local transportation and she was extremely helpful in getting us tickets for the sights and helping us get checked in online for our flight to Malaga Rooftop lounge great place to relax Pura Brasa resto across from hotel on Grand Via has amazing beef tartar burgers great service reasonable prices The patio is great for relaxing people watching Arenas Barcelona converted bullring has great shopping ok Restos 360 views of city Steps to Metro Stn Aeroporto bus nice coffee shops small supermarkets 
371943,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Breakfast is expensive Strange half frosted glass on toilet doors in room Would be better to be fully frosted and more private , Rooms and hotel decorated to high quality Great powerful shower Good location 
371944,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup,No Negative, Loved the hotel design the little pool area on the rooftop was fabulous on a hot day and it was great to explore a different neighbourhood away from the main tourist haunts 
371945,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup,No Negative, Best water pressure at any Hotel worldwide I have Ever experienced Means beautiful shower experience and also beautiful linen and comfortable beds sounds strange to some but was fresh and super clean with No smell so often Hotels are let down by bad aromas but not Ofelias 
371946,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, relatively small room very small pool no door of the shower room wet on the floor after shower almost slip , location although not in the center of the city it s very convenient to get to the city by metro the airport bus is nearby only 15min drive to the airport also beautifully decorated 
371947,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, We would prefer to have clean bath towels every day cause we had the same for 3 days and also the breakfast was every day the same and it was a little bit boring ,No Positive
371948,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Maybe room was a little smaller than we thought it would be but we were fine with that plus there was no door between bathroom and living room so when someone woke up earlier he would always make a lot of noise , The location was quite good for us and we enjoyed walking to the center of Barcelona about 15 20 mins Stuff was very friendly and we liked the design of hotel a lot 
371949,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, No bar somewhere to sit at night before retiring to your room, The decoration and design is superb The reception and intererior lift is simply marvellous 
371950,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, The room was pretty small and the location turned out to be out of the way of almost everything we wanted to do Thankfully there is a metro stop very close but it just requires at least 20 mins to get to everything , The staff was very accommodating kind and helpful The hotel is hip and tastefully decorated 
371951,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Coffee hot water machine provided for hot drinks at breakfast , Spacious room with good hotel facilities The roof top terrace and pool was an extra bonus 
371952,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Wifi is impossible don t choose this place if you have to work There is no way that it keeps online for more than 5 minutes and you have to sign in again Heating and AC doesn t work at the same time , Deco is nice 
371953,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Trying to save money with very important things like heating or hot water is not a good idea too obvious and annoying I haven t seen this never ever in my life and we go to many hotels around the world Rooms are quite small , The staff in the morning is extremely kind and sweet Nice deco and lobby Super quiet elevator 
371954,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup,No Negative, We could open the window to the back yard during the night which was good did not get disturbed by traffic The hotel is located close to a subway station and quick transport to airport 
371955,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, If you want to explore the Old City it s quite a hike by foot so take a taxi or ride the Metro instead , Beautiful boutique hotel on a quiet street right next to Las Arenas and Placa Espanya and the Metro It s walking distance to Montjuic the beautiful palace built for the World Expo in 1929 the Catalonia Art Museum must see the Joan Miro Museum too weird for me and the magical fountains Felt very safe as a solo female traveler My room on the 5th floor was bright spacious immaculate The staff was very welcoming and they let me check in early 11 a m because they had a room available That was such a blessing after a red eye flight from New York There is a comfortable lobby with art books for browsing Several lively tapas bars right around the corner Loved staying there 
371956,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, The bed mattresses possibly need to be improved We stay in a lot of hotels and these beds were a little too firm , The staff were so helpful and accommodating The hotel very welcoming in ambiance and the plunge pool area on the roof very welcoming in the heat 
371957,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, The WiFi definitely needs improvement as it constantly kept getting disconnected and the signal was very poor I was situated on the first floor so not sure why the problem was occurring , Very good room excellent decor and very quiet hotel 
371958,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, The room smelt very strongly of something I couldn t identify Not bad but definitely not pleasant I would guess some sort of cleaning agent We left the window open all afternoon but the smell was still there But my main issue is with Booking as literally my primary requirement was a hotel with parking so I checked this on the search filters To my surprise the hotel didn t have parking and I had to pay 18 to park in a car park nearby , Stylishly decorated with incredibly nice staff
371959,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup,No Negative, Boutique hotel in great location to explore this fabulous city Comfortable rooms and excellent staff always willing to help Shops and restaurants close and all main sights are within walking distance Alternatively the underground station is very close 
371960,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Air conditioning wasn t fit for purpose Room Was far too hot even for December in Spain Not a showstopper , Comfortable rooms Excellent location Fabulous staff a credit to their company Can t praise them highly enough

371963,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Wifi not consistent Pool and area is small and was crowded at times, The balcony attached to the room The decor was beautiful Staff were helpful 
371964,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Water is only provided on the first day I don t think its a big issue but wifi disconnects every now and then and everytime its required to re enter the username and password to login again I would also recommend to add a door to the shower area for more privacy and to avoid the spilling of water which could ultimately damage the wooden flooring this is not criticism just an advice , Location is perfect and central very near to placa d espanya square and metro station There is a supermarket inq the bldg next to the hotel which is open until 2a m There are a number of restaurants and cafes right in front of the hotel There is a big mall literally in front of the hotel meaning a few steps away The mall has several shops restaurants and a big supermarket The room is very nice and elegant with wooden flooring and an outdoor terrace The hotel lobby design is very nice and classic The bathroom is very good especially the rain shower The bed and mattresses are super comfortable The AC is perfect Room was cleaned every day Staff are very friendly especially the lady that checked us in on monday 19th september 2016 around noon time unfortunately I didnt get her name She was very nice and helpful in showing us how to move around and get to places in Barcelona Our luggage was stored in a locked room all day as our flight was late in the evening There are security officers in the hotel lobby 24 7 Can t comment on the breakfast since we didnt try it 
371965,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup,No Negative, Very comfortable spacious rooms Excellent location and very helpful staff We arrived early off a flight and were hoping to store bags until we could check in but staff allowed us to go to our room immediately which was great 
371966,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Pricing is way too high for the experience provided at over 200 euros per night for a 3 star hotel rooms rather small and views very urban residential breakfast was poor and there was no other way to even get a coffee or snacks when asked for ice for drinks purchased they stated that you have to go outside and buy locally pool area whilst smart and beds comfortable is much smaller that photos suggest Only 6 beds and 3 or 4 chairs all squeezed in making it uncomfortable when many more guests wanted to relax or use the pool which can really only hold 3 4 people sitting in it at one time no staff apart from person on ground floor reception it was like the place was self service most of the time except there is nothing to buy to eat or drink , Location right next to a metro stop and major Arenas chopping centre and and the boutique upscale style of the hotel 
371967,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Nothing it was really great, We were really delighted with hotel Clean luxurious without being too stiff modern and boutique style Super comfy beds and stylish rooms and bathroom We will definitely be back

371973,Ofelias Hotel 4 Sup, Every type of tea known to man in your room but NO COFFEE We only drink coffee Late flight nowhere offered when I asked to freshen up had to do so in toilet area which was a shame Have massive room to store cases for you why not divide it up and create a small shower room for such purposes , Loved the location area perfect for us Lovely facilities in room bathroom area great and loved the big mirror and lighting in the room Visual effect on arrival into reception was stunning loved the seating areas and the huge white walls where the 2 lifts were Would definately stay again
