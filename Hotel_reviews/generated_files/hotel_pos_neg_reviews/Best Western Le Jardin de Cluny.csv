259731,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, The locker was broken I asked twice to be fixed and it was not This was rated as a 4 star hotel but the room had no amenities and no frigo bar The room was too small and was smelling badly, The local was excellent
259732,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, Dining in that area was not great St Michel has an area where you can eat cheaply but we did not have any good food here Hard to find a restaurant that offers different to the rest , Located close to Notre Dame and Luxembourg gardens walking distance to most things and close to rail for travel to attractions further out Clean and comfortable 
259733,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, The picture on Booking com and the room we received were worlds apart The nice modern white d cor of the pictures displayed on the website was very deceiving When we arrived at our room which was right next to the lift we heard the lift all night the wall paper was peeling the d cor was at least 20 years old and the room was very very tight to get around Not to mention our toilet door and front door opened into each other which meant you step into the room and into the toilet The bathroom was not renovated like the ones in the website and we were very disappointed regarding the sewage smell To top it up my son and his girlfriend arrived a week later and had booked at the same time they received one of the renovated rooms on the other side of the courtyard They paid less and received the better room When booking with other websites we have been more satisfied This experience is the second time Booking com has deceived us with their pictures A couple of years ago we had the same thing happen when we visited the Greek Islands Unfortunately for Booking com I will not be booking through you again Although I have an existing booking with you for this year which I am yet to experience , The bed was comfortable and the room was clean Location of the hotel was in a safe district and easy to get around the city Although we had to walk at least 5 km to get to all the attractions there were metros and buses located very close The staff were very helpful and knowledgeable The premises were secure and well looked after mostly around the foyer area 
259734,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny,No Negative, Desk people and all staff were friendly attentive and helpful Breakfast was good Would have liked some variety in the eggs Good maps and good directions for finding trains subways and points of interest Good efforts to be kind to the earth and to not waste energy 
259735,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, Breakfast on the first morning A group had been there and food was not replenished Shortage of hot food compote and croissants Staff came to serve hot drinks then disappeared This was not the experience the next day The good breakfast was back to normal , Hotel is very convenient to major attractions and lots of places to eat nearby Very clean Efficient staff ease of check in out Room well equipped 
259736,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, The elevator was not working House keepinh trolleys left on the room aisles all day long but probably because the elevayor did not work , The location is perfect The staff was very accomodating and helpful at all times
259737,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, Tiny room Very loud When your neighboors take a shower you hear everything I don t know what make a hotel a 4 hotel but it is probably not the size of the room , Excellent breakfast but quite expensive 
259738,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny,No Negative, The minimalist design fused with mute color combinations create the perception of a calming zone The clever interior design is complimented with a nice big comfortable bed wirh good quality linen 
259739,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, Rooms were very small and noise travelled very easily between them, Excellent location very friendly and helpful staff and hotel itself was very clean
259740,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, Our bathroom and toilet had a glass door directly facing the beds As friends sharing a double room it was very uncomfortable for someone to have to leave the room while the other was in the bathroom , Beds were comfy and location was fantastic
259741,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, The wifi did not work in the rooms which was frustrating Our shower and those of the others in our group was little more than a single trickle that spilled into the minute bathroom because of a lack of proper shower door In general for 4 stars I expected better looking fittings and a feeling of value for the money we spent , The location was good for walking to Notre Dame Lourve Latin Quarter etc 
259742,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, Room a little small for a couple with two large suitcases , Wonderful location Staff very friendly and helpful Room small but very clean and comfortable 
259743,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, The photos do not look like the rooms at all very misleading The modern bedrooms advertised are actually low budget poorly installed rooms that are totally different ,No Positive
259744,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, The poor noise insulation Felt like the people in the room next door were actually showering in our bed All corner rooms ending in 07 will have this problem as hotel has carved shower room area of adjacent room out of the corner of the room we had , Friendly staff and location 
259745,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, Wifi It was terrible We had to log in every time we returned to the hotel and it was very unreliable at best Also carpeting in the rooms would be a plus The price for breakfast is way too high , Location and room layout
259746,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny,No Negative, Before we went and knowing what Paris hotel rooms are like having been there 10 weeks earlier we upgraded to a superior room and that is what it was large very modern good fittings and a beautiful bathroom the staff were very friendly and attentive would stay at this hotel again if we return to Paris 
259747,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny,No Negative, Location Very quiet no street noise Just a block from cluny museum museum of Middle Ages which is one of Paris best finds And 10 min walk to Luxembourg gardens to get away from crowds The little lounge in the lower level was great to use to regroup and freshen up upon arrival before we could get into rooms
259748,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, Window view was only to a small central courtyard but that is being picky , Perfect location to enjoy the sights and sounds of the Latin quarter Brilliant staff that could not do enough to help or advise on location 
259749,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, There was a night club near the hotel which played very loud music till all hours of the morning, From the moment we walked in we were treated with exceptional service and were highly impressed with the facilities location and breakfast View from out corner suite was incredible It was also our honeymoon and they certainly went with some extra touches in the room which made the stay very romantic 
259750,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, Walls are like made of paper you can hear everything from room next door Breakfast selection was limited we had much better breakfast outside for half of the price, Friendly staff excellent location Beds were comfortable and room size was okay for European standards Overall hotel was okay but not like 4 stars which you find at the other parts of the world 
259751,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny,No Negative, The location was perfect close to everything but on a quiet street The staff were friendly and efficient and helpful The rooms were good sized by Paris standards comfortable and elegant 
259752,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, Nothing , Location was my favourite are of Paris the Latin Quarter just close to Boulevard Saint Michel and Saint German des Pres Great place to start and end every day for a Paris romantic But for other travellers also excellent for Metro location and sight seeing in general near Notre Dame and the Seine Staff lovely special credit to the young lady who welcomed us on our first day 
259753,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, I thought the breakfast was expensive much cheaper to grab a bite and a coffee at a cafe nearby , Great location so close to metro station cafes and to Left Bank restaurants and life Good shopping streets nearby Room was clean with a comfy bed friendly staff Free wifi was a big win 
259754,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, Everything was PERFECT for us There was a refuse strike going on in Paris whilst we were there but that s not hotel fault and it didn t even bother us we still had an amazing time , Location superb Concierge all of them were very helpful and friendly particularly Andre 
259755,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, The organisation of the building and distribution of the rooms wasn t clear from the first moment it could be better indicated in signs or at the checkin moment , The room was nicely decorated and had a very good lightning and ambient in general All the staff at the counter was super nice to us beyond mere politeness we received a very welcoming and familiar treatment 
259756,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, There was not a thing that I did not like , Loved the location I was one block from St Germain which meant I had the luxury of Paris at my fingertips and I had the quiet a hotel the next block over affords I was literally around the corner from the metro station The hotel is well light beautifully decorated and provided me with everything that I needed The staff was wonderful All of them Andre Paul Jamil not sure of the spelling Igor and Sebastian were complete gentlemen Professional helpful kind considerate thoughtful discreet and a pleasure to communicate with I am looking forward to returning to this hotel The housekeeping staff does a great job keeping this hotel very clean 
259757,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, A little bit noisy in the morning because of junk cars crossing around , Probably the best location and the best quality taking into consideration the price for hotel in Paris The bed and pillows are just great the shower is really good 5 minutes walk to Notre Dame De Paris 
259758,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, The room was tiny and so was the shower Overall not much comfort here e g not enough space to keep the luggage for the price we paid, Staff were very friendly and polite We were on our honeymoon and they even offered a small complimentary bottle of champagne The location is excellent
259759,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, We could not park a car even for unloading bags I think they could ask the authorities for at least one reserved spot , Excelent staff Very attentive and acomodating Hotel is renovated and in great condition Location is excellent Always something to do and see

259761,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, We were not informed until we arrived that Hotel was undergoing renovation It was quite a shock on arrival to find the Reception area and stairs covered in dust sheets workmen and tools Lift was not working so we had to be relocated from more spacious quiet rooms on top floor with balcony to standard rooms on the 3rd floor We were given 20 per cent discount but considering we were in cheaper rooms anyway and suffered a lot of discomfort and disappointment I did not think this was very generous I have stayed in this Hotel on a previous occasion and had been very satisfied but not this time , Friendly helpful staff Rooms small clean and comfortable but plenty of noise from adjoining room and lift 
259762,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny,No Negative, The staff were friendly helpful and just incredible The breakfast was great The location was fantastic as you could walk to most of the major attractions They made our stay in Paris a very enjoyable one

259767,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny,No Negative, Staff were very helpful and the location was perfect easy access to major stations and lots to do nearby The room was a bit on the small side but I think this is standard in Paris hotels Although the area was quiet and convenient you tend to hear noise from other rooms but wouldn t put me off staying in Jardin de Cluny again

259770,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny,No Negative, Loved this hotel Very friendly and helpful at the front desk The Housekeepers were friendly and attentive Our room happened to be a larger than typical Parisian hotel room and it was amazingly quiet It might have been a deluxe room It was on a very quiet street I passed on the breakfast preferring my morning eggs at a local brasserie The location was great 6 minute walk to notre dame but plenty far enough from the tourist mobs A minute from the Metro

259775,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, We had the breakfast the first morning But quite boring and quite expensive considering there are some great little bakeries with fantastic food , Location was sensational in the Latin quarter close to the Seine and Notre Dame On the outskirts of the tourist area so close to good food not over priced The staff were extra helpful and friendly especially Karin 
259776,Best Western Le Jardin de Cluny, They didn t provide hair conditioner The shower cabin is very small The room can be small for those who travel with big luggage Wi Fi signal didn t work good in our room so I had to go to the lobby for good signal, Andrea from the front desk was very helpful The location is perfect
