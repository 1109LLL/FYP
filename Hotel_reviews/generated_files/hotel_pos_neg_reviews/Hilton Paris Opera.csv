30211,Hilton Paris Opera, complimentary water was only given on day 1 i was there for around 4 5 days, really good breakfast very comfy room very good location hotel had great facilities staff spoke very good english and were very helpful
30212,Hilton Paris Opera, Our room was located at the back of the hotel next to the big station It was vey busy lot of noise from men fighting music ect until 11 pm I would probably have changed room if I had children Also they stop re filling the breakfast at 10 am eventhrogh it doesn t close until 11 pm That was a little annoying since you wanted to sleep in on a holiday but now you had to be at the breakfeast room 9 30 , Great hotel atmosphere location and service We were there for the Tour de france and stayed for 6 nights The breakfast was nice to and american with pancakes waffles cake ect and service was again great Very very drinks and lunch in the lounge with nice quite lounge music great for playing cards working and relaxing Took 20 minuttes to walk to champs elysee and 7 minuttes to the big gallery lafayette 
30213,Hilton Paris Opera, The rooms were much smaller than the pictures shown on the website The rooms had absolutely no views It was a dead end with some construction sight , The hotel was very central Location was good 
30214,Hilton Paris Opera, i can t fault this hotel , Breakfast scrambled egg and bacon particularly tasty Bed very comfy Shower best shower in the world Executive lounge was excellent kept us going with sweets and drinks Bar downstairs was amazing very polite staff very efficient Very highly trained staff from the chamber maids to reception staff to waiting staff all said hello or bonjour We were well looked after We had a complementary bottle of wine and chocolates as it was our anniversary A nice surprise I would definitely recommend and book here again 
30215,Hilton Paris Opera, The property itself is fine updated and very friendly , The Customer Service Front desk and concierge were all very helpful and professional We requested two beds in the room through Booking com and upon arrival it was one king bed After informing the front desk they remedied the situation quickly and all was well with our stay The location was convenient and the train was steps away from the front door We will return again Thank you 
30216,Hilton Paris Opera, In upper Paris area so saved all upper Paris agenda for this location Little further from Eiffel Tower A lot more homeless in area but staff keep a watchful eye and will rescue you if bothered , Absolute luxury The executive suite was divine It was as big as an apartment Couldn t complain Super spacious clean furnished not one thing left unturned The shower was clean and water pressure perfect The room is equipped with lots of seating furniture outlets lamps plugs My absolute favorite was the executive lounge access Free buffet breakfast in a private cozy comfortable lounge with snacks drinks cafe machines sofas flat screens We ate there every morning Will stay here again Next door to metro 
30217,Hilton Paris Opera, I requested allergy free room due to down allergy Did not have Requested connecting rooms as we were traveling as a large family with three rooms Did not get They had it but refused to give it to us due to a club change The first night my daughters bed had NO bedding and we waited until 12 30 at night to get anything at all My child is 4 so this is unacceptable She slept with a mattress cover as a blanket They didn t even care They didn t see a problem with it Our first night in Paris was all about the hotel The staff thought changing one of our three rooms to an executive club room was sufficient for all of this Absolutely made a dream trip to Paris with my mother and daughter a challenge The first room we had you had to straddle the toilet to open the door We made the best of it but when I think of it I get upset again Every time we asked the concierge for a recommendation they knew nothing of what we needed We did need a Dr once on our trip and that was quick and very resonable priced , Once the arrangements were somewhat corrected it was clean 
30218,Hilton Paris Opera, We weren t aware that the penalty would be applied for smoking in the room they should tell the guest about the policy when they check in 200 euro has been added to my bill without a warning given or something to inform us of this , Everything was okay though the room is extremely small 
30219,Hilton Paris Opera, I am horrified by the service we received at the hotel on arrival a new receptionist who was being trained under NO Supervision at all charged my partner and I by mistake more than 1000 euros on my Credit Card This amount has been held in my bank account for more than 10 days and have not yet received an apology from the hotel Very sad never staying at a Hilton hotel again , Absolutely nothing
30220,Hilton Paris Opera, checking in was a bit slow , bed was comfortable and the furnishings and tile where beautiful Lobby staff doormen concierge always friendly and helpful 
30221,Hilton Paris Opera, A bit expensive for example a small packet of Pringle crisps in our room cost 7 outrageous price so advice for others don t eat what s on display in your room , The location of hotel
30222,Hilton Paris Opera, It would be a nice touch to place a pair of sleepers and a bathrobe in the room I missed them It is not hygienic to walk on the carpet with bare foots where you enter in shoes that you wore on the street I usually carry sleepers with me but I thought that in a 5 star hotel is a basic feature , absolutely superb service beautiful interior everything was up to the highest standards cleanliness no noise which is kind of a big deal double entrance door to the room plus one more door from the little foyer to the bed room 6 USB charger plug in the room great lighting and big window even in the bathroom Heated bathroom floor great water pressure in the shower and handheld and shower from the ceiling as well Great location Printemps Department Store and Galleries Lafayette are in walking distance and service Overall superb experience 
30223,Hilton Paris Opera, This is comment to Booking Genius member program the facility did not know anything about the genius perks that booking com advertises There was supposed to be free welcome drink and hotel stuff told me that it is water in the rooms that is available to absolutely all guests This is misinformation from booking com site ,No Positive
30224,Hilton Paris Opera,No Negative, They noticed that is was my wife s birthday on the day when we checked in When we came to our room in the evening there was a hand written happy birthday note and complimentary wine and chocolate on the table How awesome 
30225,Hilton Paris Opera, Had an Executive Room with only 1 chair and a sofa missing we telephoned reception 3 times to request another chair or sofa each time the staff said that they would sort it out but nothing happen Executive Room had very little food offerings especially during lunchtime and afternoon only supplied leftover breakfast pastries Our bathroom door in our room was badly worn Breakfast room was too small for the amount of guests , Location was excellent for shopping at the department stores 
30226,Hilton Paris Opera, Breakfast was not good for a hotel of this standard food cold and not enough selection Also the bar area was cold , The hotel was in a good location and was very clean and the staff very helpful I was asked for a 400 euro deposit for mini bar which annoyed me so I told staff empty mini bar and I didn t pay the 400 euro this was a down side and also the breakfast buffet was not what I d expect from a hotel of this standard not enough variety and food was cold but overall the hotel is very nice and we enjoyed our stay 
30227,Hilton Paris Opera, the receptionist alexander made our staying in this hotel awful he s very rude and has no manners and arrogant and provocative we had and an issue with the extra bed and he literately kicked us out of the hotel and told us that my brother can sleep in the lobby or book another hotel for him he did not let my brother in the room because there is no space for extra bed although i have sent dozens of emails and called them about the extra bed and in booking com room description there was nothing that there is no extra bed can be fitted in the room he did not give us any alternative choices and did not apologies and did not co operate with us and i quote from him YOU SAW A CHEAP PRICE AND BOOKED THE ROOM AND DID NOT READ how do you hire a receptionist who says those kind of things to a customer although we re a member in hilton honors he did not treat us well A big shout out and thanks to the receptionist angelie she was really co operative and understanding and helped us to move into another room that my brother can stay with us at the same hotel and she checked on us and made sure everything is good, great hotel great location near galleria lafayete decent breakfast the rooms are very clean
30228,Hilton Paris Opera, Breakfast Located at mezzanine floor with low ceiling Limited variety of foods available, Location and value for money One stop from Paris Nord Station Walking distance from major department stores Good subway access for other shopping area Traditional public space with modern newly refurbished room Relatively spacious which is unique in Paris 
30229,Hilton Paris Opera, The rooms although very cute are tiny Very expensive mini bar , A very nice choice An excellent location I would stay in Hilton Opera again and recommend it to other travelers 
30230,Hilton Paris Opera, No hot water first night room poor standard bottle of water and some mints to say sorry does not cut it bathrom design awkward, Staff were excellent 
30231,Hilton Paris Opera, Be careful in the bar 36 euro for 2 g t ouch , We were on honeymoon they upgraded our room put hand written note and a bottle of wine the staff could not of done more to help the breakfast was fab 
30232,Hilton Paris Opera, Cash stolen from my room Attitude of staff Nowhere to sit in bar area becuase far too many non residentst use hotel Overpriced hotel, Room was comfortable
30233,Hilton Paris Opera, If i really have to nitpick it would be breakfast items can be improved though they do have bacon scrambled eggs croissant and other breads salads noodles etc Also the same exact items were at the buffet table the 2nd day , Firstly the check in process was extremely efficient and pleasant We stayed in the Executive room on the 2nd floor so the bed bath and the room is extremely comfy with everything we expect from a 4 5 star hotel in Paris centre The staff are always friendly and smiling so that adds to the good service The location is fantastic with plenty of restaurants and shopping within walking distance My family found the Christmas light up decor along Rue Haussmann and outside Galeries Lafayette and Printemps to be the best anywhere we have seen so far including Singapore 
30234,Hilton Paris Opera, I liked everything and disliked nothing otherwise would not be returning here every year when I am in Paris , Location as I always say about this hotel Location is the winning point right next to St Lazare station a stone s throw away from the grand stores like Printemps and Galerie Lafayette what more could one ask for And of course the friendly staff the quality of room and service all together complete the experience 
30235,Hilton Paris Opera, Breakfast could be richer They serve only one kind of cheese in a cheese country of French Breakfast service is poor When one food finish they put new after you warn them Even croissants Be careful of concierge We wanted to go to airport by train and they suggested to take a taxi They told us it would take only 30 35 minutes but it took us 2 hours to arrive in Paris evening traffic , The hotel is renovated The atmosphere is nice Rooms are quite good and big enough 
30236,Hilton Paris Opera,No Negative, Me and my wife stayed in Hilton Paris Opera Hotel in October as part of our honeymoon trip and was amazing We stay 7 nights at the Hotel and just loved the stay The staff was always so nice and helpful doing everything to make sure we could have the best stay with all the comfort The Hotel is very well located 10 minutes walking until reach the Opera Garnier and you have all kinds of transportation nearby The room was so nice and clean quietly and with an amazing outside street view We also loved the fantastic breakfast pancakes eggs and bacon yogurt and French products as well Thank you so much for all the treats you gave us The Guest Relations Capucine was also amazing helpful and concerned in make our stay the most comfortable as possible We highly recommend Hilton Paris Opera Hotel if you are going to stay in Paris We surely will return 
30237,Hilton Paris Opera, Not good value for money Being charged for items from mini bar we did not consume rubbish hair dryer and no slippers dressing gowns, Quiet rooms and very good shower
30238,Hilton Paris Opera, Breakfast is not too good extra charge for fried eggs Food in the lounge is not frequently replenished and the floor was wet with water from the fridge when we went there one of the afternoons , Good location Rooms are clean Pillows and the bed are very comfortable 
30239,Hilton Paris Opera, The rooms are beautifully decorated but rather small the bathroom is tiny but this is Paris and that is not unusual , After a long 26 hour journey from Western Australia we were delighted to be given early access to our room at 9am rather than wait until the 3pm checkin It was very much appreciated The recently renovated Grand Salon is a magnificent space to have a coffee or a wine and tapas We also really enjoyed the breakfast 
30240,Hilton Paris Opera, Can t open windows no smoking area very hot in vip small lounge Not very good location No sauna or steam room or swimming pool no Resturant no garden nothing like Hilton at all rooms are not that much either hotel needs lots of improvement and changes value of money 0 ,No Positive
30241,Hilton Paris Opera,No Negative, The rooms are stunning and offer a lot of comfort the location was fabulous as we were a walk away to all of our destinations Would definately stay again And I would like to mention the shower it was a dream There was a huge selection of food and it was cooked to perfection Love love loved every minute of our stay 
30242,Hilton Paris Opera, Plugs for North American electrical appliances did not work Converters that the room service brought up did not work correctly and it ended up burning out and ruining my 200 hair dryer which now does not work back home My hair straightener was also affected I would like to be compensated for this as I am most upset ,No Positive
30243,Hilton Paris Opera, Took ages to check in only two staff on the desk second desk closed Room Service was ridiculous phoned and ordered coffee for two was brought 2 nescafe sticks no cups no kettle no milk phoned back waited and waited still nothing so went to Mcdonalds across the road for coffee instead , Location good hotel beautiful young irish gentleman on reception was very good 
30244,Hilton Paris Opera, I was not happy at all with size of my room and it was an expansive amount for such a small room that I can t walk comfortably in , It s a clean hotel in a nice location 
30245,Hilton Paris Opera, Staff responsiveness as I had a challenge with paying off my taxi cab from the airport and the staff were not very helpful but the concierge finally helped , Rooms were very neat and quality of bathrooms was very good 
30246,Hilton Paris Opera, No decent restaurant Had to go out to find something more than a snack bar Rooms extremely small and only a shower in the room I had , Fantastic Grand Salon with beautiful decoration ceiling and chandeliers Shame it was only used as the bar I did get a quiet room on the top floor but this was a garret and I expect it would be very hot in the summer Even in March the room got very stuffy overnight 
30247,Hilton Paris Opera, The concierge service staff not so friendly not clear when directing the location on the map , Breakfast is excellent bed is very comfy but the room a bit compact location wise is good 
30248,Hilton Paris Opera, The front office was impolite and not professional and the house keeping is very very bad The breakfast is very poor and the area is not even good for a 1 star hotel , The location was perfect the house keeping is very bad since they don t meet the standard of the Hilton 
30249,Hilton Paris Opera, Nothing , We liked everything Check in We arrived at 9am and check in was at 3pm Our room was not ready but the hotel staff found another room so that we could relax They made sure we had a room with a bathtub since we had a small child Room we were in room 421 It was a comfortable size and had high end design furniture The white marble bathroom was just luxurious Food and cleanliness We only ate there for breakfast The buffet was pricey but with a wide variety of foods The hotel is squeaky clean too Location the hotel is next to Saint Lazare train station and public transportation It is only a couple of streets away from department stores the Opera and Madeleine Last but not least On the day of our departure there were strikes at the airport and taxi drivers Concierge staff went out of their way to check our flight status and availability of shuttle or public transportation to the airport Definitely our new home in Paris 
30250,Hilton Paris Opera,No Negative, First and foremost the staff And then of course the location and the overall quality We are returning customers and this is the place to be in Paris 
30251,Hilton Paris Opera, The toilet paper holder fell off the wall and bruised my foot They didn t seem to care didn t offer any compensation They didn t fix it until the 4th day after two reminders Also we had requested early check in as we arrived at 10am but they didn t have one ready They did try 5 rooms and we finally got a room after 12 30 They did offer a glass of prosecco while we waited , Great staff Friendly even if things were difficult Helpful in recommending a phone store and restaurants for dinner Great comfortable room and layout Loved the bed Close to all the major sites we walked everywhere 
30252,Hilton Paris Opera, At check in staff was not totally friendly seemed a bit stressed even though not many people were waiting , Excellent location subway in 2 min by walk Very friendly concierge and staff in breakfast area very clean hotel with superior facilities
30253,Hilton Paris Opera, The location the scaffoldings outside my room the noisy building work The corporate feel of the hotel the executive lounge and how small deluxe room is although its described 20sqm the room is 10sqm Unless they take into account the bathroom and the wardrobe space , The staff the size of my room junior suite 
30254,Hilton Paris Opera, There was no restaurant and the choice of bar meals in those circumstances was very poor The staff in the Grand Salon were very slow and not at all attentive It s a fabulous room but I wasn t made to feel very welcome there The concierge Porter service was average at best , The location is ideal for the centre of Paris The Grand Salon is a magnificent room in which to take afternoon tea or a drink in the evening The staff on Reception were excellent
