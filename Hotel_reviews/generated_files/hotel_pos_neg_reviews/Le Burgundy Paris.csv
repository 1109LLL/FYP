217984,Le Burgundy Paris,No Negative, Excellent location very stylish and cozy place Just what we looked for With a pleasure can advise this hotel No noise and extremely confortable bed 
217985,Le Burgundy Paris,No Negative, I have to say that stuff was amazing They have upgraded our room due to my pregnancy and did not let me wait on reception Hotel is extremely clean breakfast is great and excellent location especially if you are in Paris to shop or go around museums 
217986,Le Burgundy Paris, The fact that the Spa was closed and they just mentioned it once i enter in my room is not the best move to do even more regarding the fact that i always stop by the Burgundy when i travel to Paris , Amazing place to spend few days in Paris with a lovely staff and amazing rooms and nice high tech improvement with the iPads 
217987,Le Burgundy Paris, Room was just big enough to move around absolutely no space to lay your luggage open No kettle provided Upon request it was brought up but again gotta requesf for a cup No cofee tea in the room either Hairdryer was difficult to use gotta press hard onto the button to operate it and irs very heavy , Location cleanliness nice atmosphere 
217988,Le Burgundy Paris,No Negative, Perfect location Staff was amazing Courteous professional and helpful and during the busiest time of the Summer July 12 15 they could not have been better Special thanks to the front desk for arranging the additional days and the Concierge for the great VIP tickets 
217989,Le Burgundy Paris, The junior suites on the website were decorated in a nicer way My suite 302 was a bit boring looking even though it was spacious and very comfortable I would have loved to see the extra design effort in my room , Literally everyone working there was smiling and very polite and kind and extremely helpful I never waited more than a few mins for anything and service from everyone was done with a big smile What a great team thank you so much to everyone 
217990,Le Burgundy Paris, The gym could be larger and a bit better equipped , I really like everything about the property The best location wonderful stuff the restaurant and bar were also perfect 
217991,Le Burgundy Paris, I stayed in room 505 and there was a very bad smell coming from the bathroom or the air condition I informed the front desk but the problem wasn t solved they told me that they would inform the maids but I told them that they had to inform the management We had to sleep with open windows the second day ,No Positive
217992,Le Burgundy Paris,No Negative, Second stay in this lovely hotel and wonderful again I ll definitely will come back Great location luxury rooms super friendly staff great breakfast For me it is one of the best places to stay when you are in Paris 
217993,Le Burgundy Paris, What lets this hotel down is the food When we arrived at about 1 30pm and ordered a simple vegetarian pizza from the room service menu we were told that they had run out of them Afterwards when we came down to their terrace area and wanted a table we were told that all the tables had been reserved and the bar was occupied with a private party so we should go find ourselves a local caf When we ordered breakfast in the room the next morning the bowl of cereal had no spoon the basket of bread came with no plate and the cup of decaf coffee was ice cold , Beautiful hotel in a fabulous location at the heart of Paris The staff are all friendly the rooms are luxurious and spacious this hotel is real hidden gem This is our second stay at this hotel and apart from my gripes about the food see the separate panel I would definitely recommend it If they sort the food part out I will happily revise my score to a 10 
217994,Le Burgundy Paris, Restaurant Staff could have been better But because the Hotel did not appear to be busy maybe they were too relaxed , Check in comfort of the bedrooms facilities therein and cleanliness of the same all merit commendation 
217995,Le Burgundy Paris,No Negative, We loved everything the property the location the attentive service the breakfast The hotel was super friendly for our toddler who loved walking around and saying hello to everyone The staff was super patient and kind and you could see the 5 star training in the way they helped with everything including getting a doctor to come to see the baby in our room and charging the cost to the room since we did not yet have euros in hand And you can t beat the location in the 1st arrondisement This is surely our new favorite 
217996,Le Burgundy Paris, I don t think I would change anything great location very helpful staff delicious breakfast Had no time to use the spa maybe next time , Well the room the bed pillows etc were excellent Even though I made no breakfast reservation it came as complimentary from booking com Nice gesture 
217997,Le Burgundy Paris, The spa because it is small and not comfortable Wifi signal could be better , The hotel is very nice quiet and comfortable Staff is friendly specially concierge with very nice restaurant recommendations We had a problem with the room when we arrived strong bad smell probably coming from bathroom pipes and in the next morning they changed our room 
217998,Le Burgundy Paris, My only regret no water boiler in the room to make some tea , Enjoy the outstanding placement only 5 minutes walk from the Opera house and other main attractions The hotel has a great modern and relaxed luxury atmosphere The room was spacious and very well isolated We had great breakfast and a tasty quick tapas diner at the lounge bar Overall service was good 
217999,Le Burgundy Paris, hotel pipes in a perfumed scent that at times can really be overwhelming There is construction going on next door at what will be a new chanel store so banging begins early It can be noisy if you have a room facing the street , Wonderful location attentive and friendly staff Nice sized room Comfortable bed pillows 
218000,Le Burgundy Paris, Room service menu could be better and more flexible during the day Most of the real food was late night Hair dryer weighs a ton I almost couldn t use it They have wonderful signature hotel products but don t sell them Wish I could ve bought some to take home , Beautiful and comfortable hotel Great front desk and turn down Location is perfect if you want to be a tourist for a few days or shop Amazing spa pool worth the price of staying there alone 
218001,Le Burgundy Paris, Listed as a five star hotel and it s a 3 4 star at best The staff are untrained and fumble through the simplest issues The room service guy doesn t bring a pen Every time something was delivered to the room a major component was missing The restaurant staff no nothing of customer service One evening we were refused entrance because we might only order coffee even after we said we might order dessert we were refused a seat more than 75 of the tables were empty Don t waste your money or time here there are many other options , Location is great
218002,Le Burgundy Paris, There is a migraine inducing oud smell throughout the hotel The gym smells of vomit The toiletries also smell of oud They said its their signature scent , The bed
218003,Le Burgundy Paris, We had a suit the decoration of the living room is not at the standard of the rest of both the common areas and the bedroom, We loved the attention and flexibility of the staff to respond to our needs the decoration of the ground floor is really great the rooms are spacious
218004,Le Burgundy Paris,No Negative, Great location for a short stay in Paris where one could visit iconic museums galeries excellent restaurants and cafes all located within walking distances But the most important it s ideal location for one of the best shopping experiences in the world 
218005,Le Burgundy Paris, Food service No understanding of food allergies Children not catered for , Very comfy clean rooms Great location Reception and door staff very welcoming 
218006,Le Burgundy Paris, Gym is not suitable for serious work out Too small and insufficient Excellent spa though , Excellent location off Saint Honore 100 mt to Madeleine very comfortable rooms and a very professional stuff We are upgraded to a suit and this made our experience even more special 
218007,Le Burgundy Paris, rien , The members of the staff were amazing As it is a small hotel we felt like being pampered with the personalised service I had actually tested almost all its amenities and services the bar the restaurant the swimming pool the hammam the sauna the room service the reception the concierge the housekeeping I can say Kudos to the management as it succeeded in ensuring a well organised team I used to work in luxury liners and Le Burgundy s organisation reminds me of the way we organised our manning Indeed a very pleasant stay 
218008,Le Burgundy Paris, Internet was quite slow , Very nice hotel nice service and nice people The hotel look is very trendy with very design items which make a nice feel The room was quite big and comfortable The location is perfect 
218009,Le Burgundy Paris, Carpet little bit dirty in the room Print underneath the coffee table Bad smell in the bathroom , All Location fragrance olfactive ambiance staff design spa room etc 
218010,Le Burgundy Paris, The staff typical french unattentiveness No smile , Love the room the smell when you go into the lobby very strategic location to go anywhere The facilities rare to have a gym and pool in a medium sized hotel in Paris 
218011,Le Burgundy Paris, Totally over priced This is NOT a 5 hotel more like 4 Breakfast was not good and very little choice in comparison to ther 5 hotels Quite offy receptionist offered a very cramped low celing room with view of roof tops On an email we had asked for a room with a view and very quiet Only offered interior room as an alternative or one on the first floor which was noisy or an up grade costing hundreds more Having asked for a quiet room and accepted the first floor room we were woken up at 7am with drilling outside the room and a crane with workman looking into our room The room actually shook We had also seen a mouse in the hotel the night before After complaining we were given a very nice interior room although this was specifically what we had not wanted but the room was comfortable and good quality and was quiet On paying the bill they had deducted 20 only off the bill we had been awake with the noise from 6am as the trucks started to arrive and had spent many hours the next day negotiating moving etc After complaining this was not a sufficient deduction we were offered a special rate on our next visit and an up grade we would not return then offered 30 deduction on the first night only and then some more Whilst I accept the work outside was not in the hotel the building work had been going on for several months and we had not been informed espcially annoying as we had requested quiet The Manager said they did not get clients email addresses when booking through booking com Whilst this is otherwise a comfortable hotel in an excellent location it is very over priced for what it is and the hotel should inform clients of extensive building work going on outside before they arrive , The location
218012,Le Burgundy Paris, the rooms in the end where next to the lift door were horrible , Good location right next to the place Vendome That s pretty much the all 
218013,Le Burgundy Paris, Rooms are somewhat cozy The spa and pool are very cramped The bar is in my view anyway too loud and not particularly comfortable or inviting , Pleasant hotel modern style 
218014,Le Burgundy Paris, Room on the smallish side normal for Paris and the espresso maker iron board were only upon request vs already standard in the room But these are details , Beautiful room friendly staff good breakfast and as a bonus we had a small courtyard linked to our room 
218015,Le Burgundy Paris, No coffee tea machine When given it did not work well and no milk TC did not have adequate English channels and most of the time it did not work giving a message of satellite issue Wifi in one of the rooms had a very poor signal and hence not effective , Comfortable bed Clean room 
218016,Le Burgundy Paris, The staff person at night baggage holder and room service which have been inelegant and lack of manners Apart from it it was just perfect , The smell of the hotel The general olfactive ambiance and the fragrance of the shampoo conditioner shower gel and body lotion I wish I could buy it for home The design All the amenities 
218017,Le Burgundy Paris, Toilets are separate from bathroom and the toilet was really quite small you can put your head on the door when on the toilet , Great service valets are amazing remember you and when you leave and bring your luggage on time and just great Great casual fun pool
218018,Le Burgundy Paris, Gym too small and almost has no equipment but the atmosphere and the staff care take over The room is a letel bet small to what I m used to but not to Paris, Location and the staff care and hospitality 
218019,Le Burgundy Paris,No Negative, Compared to bigger 5 stars hotels in Paris Plaza Bristol Meurice Le Burgundy manages to come out close to equivalent on most criteria staff room size and furniture quality of the food Very positively surprised May become our regular hotel for our quarterly trips to Paris
218020,Le Burgundy Paris, Nothing complaint, Great hotel and location the room size is bigger than standard very clean The bed is comfortable It s a lovely hotel I will come back to stay here for next visit to Paris 
218021,Le Burgundy Paris, The lady on reception could have been more genial and accommodating We asked if it was possible to check in early she said no without checking , Perfect location easy to walk to most of the famous sights near Madeline Metro quiet street at night lovely bar area best hotel bed ever concierge staff lovely
218022,Le Burgundy Paris, Shower needed a good clean and de scale and fitness centre is extremely basic , Excellent quiet location our room was spacious comfy bed very good breakfast cocktails to die for and staff is extremely attentive and helpful
218023,Le Burgundy Paris, We have stayed in this hotel about 3 years ago and it was much better then than now , the location is excellent Breakfast selection is small but high quality 
218024,Le Burgundy Paris, I suppose to be expected from a 5 establishment but extras are quite pricey so we didnt spend as much time in the hotel as we might otherwise have done Breakfast 35Eur each not included decided to pick up croissants and coffee at local shops for a fraction of the price beer 12 Eur at the bar facial 150 Eur for the hour , Location was excellent Staff were pleasant Bedroom well equipped and quiet Lovely bar chill out area Swimming pool sauna steam area well kept and clean
218025,Le Burgundy Paris, The spa was small , The location is fatastic I liked the specialty of the hotel i e the passport of the hotel the library in the room I love the bar 
218026,Le Burgundy Paris,No Negative, We stayed in hotel for a New Year 2016 and had New Year party in a hotel restaurant It was unforgettable celebration nice menu fantastic music Staff is very helpful rooms are spacious and comfortable Location is perfect I would like to come back 
218027,Le Burgundy Paris, Staff did not know about our reservation , Breakfast is great Rooms are spacious for Paris Very good bed and bathroom Very good location for shopping and visiting Paris 
218028,Le Burgundy Paris,No Negative, Staff was very attentive the restaurant and bar were great the room was very nice the SPA and the swimming pool were great The hotel location was great 
218029,Le Burgundy Paris, I booked this hotel in advance and paid in advance as a special treat for the New Year s Eve period for my wife who has recently recovered from cancer Post the terrorism events in Paris and the heightened security concerns across Europe me and my wife decided to change our plans and not travel to Europe during this period We contacted the hotel and presented our case yet was told that we will not be granted a refund for the 1600 that we paid for two nights because they said as far as they are concern life goes on and their are no security concerns in Paris We was very offended and the hotel made no efforts to assist us and stuck to their policy despite this being a peak period and they could very easily have rebooked our rooms Now we have two night paid and we have lost our money For such a prestigious hotel I am deeply upset at how they have treated us We spent along time to choose the right hotel and paid a premium and now we have lost everything , Nothing
218030,Le Burgundy Paris, No breakfast included with booking made online We paid for our breakfast but I think there should have been a bigger selection for the buffet considering the price paid I felt our junior suite was a bit too cozy as I was expecting a more spacious room The Baudelaire did not live up to our expectations but possibly because there was a large function at the hotel so our food was compromised The staff also looked very busy , The location of this small hotel is prime situated in the heart of Paris nearby high end boutiques and famous sites The staff at the front desk were helpful at all times and the premises were clean I appreciated the late check out as I had requested for it 
218031,Le Burgundy Paris, All in all the negatives were down to the timing of our visit Building site right next door and so very noisy early morning There was filming going on during the day which interfered with customer access so not exactly customer focused Maybe a bit of planning to avoid key times in the day would have been sensible Concierge services could be a bit more proactive Mini bar should have had wine in it not just a small sparkling wine , Very cool space and pleasant staff Room was stylish good size particularly the bathroom and very clean always a positive Good location 
218032,Le Burgundy Paris, Only slightl complaint was the shower Shower stalls have two closing doors that meet at a corner and islets easy to over flow , Very cute small hotel staff very friendly an accommodating Great bar and restaurant And is at the center of Paris great location
218033,Le Burgundy Paris,No Negative, I have stayed here three times in the last two years This hotel has a fabulous boutique feel and is close to prime shopping It is very easy to walk to most attractions in central Paris The design is sleek and clean yet not stuffy Breakfast is excellent The staff is very friendly and accommodating I particularly love all the doormen I will return here many times 
218034,Le Burgundy Paris, Front desk and concierge staff were not prepared as you expected in a 5 stars hotel with the exception of concierge Samuel Doormen never did their work Horrible and intense air freshener in the lobby, Location interiors design nice rooms excellent restaurant very good pool
218035,Le Burgundy Paris, There was only one mirror and that was in the bathroom It was only on our last day that we discovered there was an electrical outlet by the radiator for drying hair in front of the mirror We also discovered that there was a full length mirror inside the wardrobe , Le Burgundy was a beautiful Boutique hotel The staff were excellent Very friendly and couldn t be more helpful There was never any less than three doormen and they all treated us like royalty The location could not have been better we seemed to be in the in the middle of all that is great in Paris The hotel was modern very clean and exquisitely decorated 
218036,Le Burgundy Paris,No Negative, Perfect location and lovely contemporary decor plus excellent staff I have stayed here twice now and it will always be my go to hotel in Paris 
218037,Le Burgundy Paris, I grew to dislike the perfumed aroma in the public areas of the hotel , This hotel was a very comfortable oasis in the middle of the most beautiful district in Paris Our room was lovely and all our needs were well looked after by all the staff 
218038,Le Burgundy Paris, We liked everything , Check in was easy On day of arrival with early checkin No problem Roland at concierge right away helped us with museum tickets and put us on a waiting list for the Anne Frank house It was sold out for two week past our visit date He put us on a waiting list He suggested an evening dinner cruise which was very nice
218039,Le Burgundy Paris, Restaurant was closed at time of visit and limited areas to sit for coffee etc bar was quite dark for daytime which was where we had to use during our visit at breakfast and for coffee, Location most of the staff
218040,Le Burgundy Paris, the only drawback is a breakfast it is very good but not as amazing as in George V or others equivalent ones while it is still quite expensive They should decrease price or increase quolity mean variety , I am rearly writhing a review but this hotel worth it I ve stayed before in other 5 stars Paris hotels and some was great but crazily expensive others just good with acceptable prices but this one combines both I guess that manager of this hotel should be a perfectionist everything is on a place everything created with a thought of beauty and comfort Truly 5 star hotel Totally recommend 
218041,Le Burgundy Paris, We have stayed here before and enjoyed our stay however in this occasion there were noisy deliveries and building works through the night The staff neglected to inform us of swimming pool closure throughout our stay and the did not even have the common courtesy to offer any kind of rate reduction Staff are dishonest and it is a shame but I will not stay there again A little apology and a discount would have sufficed , Location
218042,Le Burgundy Paris, This is the second time I lived in this hotel I feel very disappointed The laundry service was not good I require a dry clean for my blouse After the dry clean the odour is still remain on the blouse So I need to send it to another dry clean store again The room service guy is unprofessional For example I ordered a cherry ice cream last night This morning I want to order cherry ice cream again I have been told they was no cherry flavor only strawberry After a long time check they acknowledge that they did have cherry flavor So I ordered two scoopes In the later evening I want to order another two scoopes cherry ice cream I had been told that they do not do two scoopes only four scoopes Terrible room service, Everyday there was a sweet sent to the room I liked it a lot Their ice cream was very delicious which you cannot find in other places The location was nice lots of brand shops around
