250064,Melia Paris Vendome, The only problem I had was that I had to cut my trip shorter and was not able to work anything out for the days I didn t stay in the hotel This was my fault in having to change things but my work is this way often so it is helpful to be able to work something out with the hotels I stay in , My room was light and sizable the staff very courteous 
250065,Melia Paris Vendome, If I had to pick one thing it would be the small lifts but I believe that s common in Paris and many European cities , Room was spacious very clean and the bed was very comfortable We had an incredible stay in such a beautiful city and neighborhood We would stay here again and recommend this hotel to anyone going to Paris The staff were extremely helpful and friendly especially the gentleman who checked us in name escapes me and the Concierge Antoine went above and beyond to help us upon check in Well done 
250066,Melia Paris Vendome, The wi fi was not working very well most of the time and it could be improved Also there were no slippers in the room or bathrobes But the towels were adequate always clean and soft , Location is excellent near all the important monuments walking distance to Louvre Grande Palais and the Christmas Village on Champs Elyssee The staff was very kind smiling helpful with all our requests There were chocolates in the room one day and two bottles of fruit nectar together with macarons another day Very comfortable bed and pillows and the room even though not large was spacious enough Overall we had a wonderful stay at Melia Paris Vendome 
250067,Melia Paris Vendome, It s small and pricey but it s hard to fault the Melia for that everything in Paris is a bit cramped and expensive Parking was not that easy for me I spent 30 min wandering around until I found a garage around the block , Location is about perfect for central Paris I walked to everything Breakfast was VERY good Modern touches to hotel but still has the Old Paris feel I will look at staying here again 
250068,Melia Paris Vendome, The rooms on the street are a little noisy at night , The staff were excellent very helpful when we needed them The location is great just a short walk to the Louvre with a metro just 2mins down the road 
250069,Melia Paris Vendome,No Negative, Antoine on the staff as well as the concierge were absolutely fantastic I discovered JUST as I arrived that I d had my wallet stolen Antoine especially went above and beyond to help me sort myself out I got the impression that they really wanted to take care of me after such a scary thing Losing everything in a strange city can be absolutely horrible but despite it I had a wonderful overnight at the Melia Vendome Thanks for all the help The hotel itself is lovely and in a very nice part of town You fall out of bed and you re in place de Concorde 
250070,Melia Paris Vendome, Room a little small for an 8 day stay but bigger than my river cruiser state room I would be happy to stay here again , Friendly courteous helpful staff Good breakfast buffet Quiet newly refurbished room with marble bathroom and separate marble toilet room 
250071,Melia Paris Vendome,No Negative, Staff is very kind professional and helpful Hotel is right in the centre of main attractions and next to Concorde metro and near the Seine A few minutes walk through Touileries gardens and you get to the Louvre Great Breakfast 
250072,Melia Paris Vendome, Very small elevator Only one person can fit with 2 luggages With no luggages maybe 2 3 max , The location is very convenient Very accessible to shops supermarkets restaurants Each and everyone of the staff were all very friendly and attentive Very helpful with information taxi booking luggage and everything else They act like professionals 
250073,Melia Paris Vendome, Temperature was a bit too hot in the room even when heating was shut down When opening windows it was a bit too noisy , Treatment was excellent they even have as a special present when knowing it was such a special weekend for us All team was extremely kind Rooms are well maintained and comfy 
250074,Melia Paris Vendome, Please see above , This is overall a good property Unfortunately I was placed in a location closed to the service elevator where every night the laundry was delivered at 2 00am and the clanking noise of the elevator would wake me up I have stayed in other rooms and they were just fine The staff offered to moved me but I was settled and was busy with work and had no time to move 
250075,Melia Paris Vendome, In general room and breakfast too expensive for what you get I guess you pay extra for the location Bathroom was very small and room too hot The main problem was the noise We unfortunately had a room with a connecting door Very poor sound isolation through the connection door We could hear every word our neighbors were saying which was particularly annoying since they stayed up until the middle of the night I think this is only a problem in the rooms with connecting doors since we didn t hear any of our other neighbors My advise would be to ask a room without connecting doors , excellent location nice lobby good bed
250076,Melia Paris Vendome, The room was a little traditional with wood a taupe silk wallpaper and brown carpet Therefore although comfortable the colours and lighting were a little dated, The size and facilities of the accommodation The location which makes it easy to walk to shops the Louvre and otherplaces of interest 
250077,Melia Paris Vendome, No tea making facilities in the room We English love our early morning cup of tea A light in the wardrobe area would have been good Had to use a torch each time we went to open the safe No view but not too bothered about that , All of the above as shown Mostly we liked it all and hope to come back for New Year Please send us details of rates for period over New Year 2015 2016
