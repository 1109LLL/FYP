78366,The Rockwell, The room seemed like a train cabin Very small bed and bathroom , The Rockwell is a nice hotel Our room a double was very small also the bed was small The bathroom was tiny I guess that is to be expected in London The breakfast a la carte was fine and the reception area peaceful The hotel is in a good location 
78367,The Rockwell,No Negative, Very good location along the Piccadilly line from Heathrow Friendly and professional staff and good sized and well appointment bedrooms Very quiet 
78368,The Rockwell,No Negative, We would certainly recommend this hotel the location is very convenient our room was comfortable and a good size the staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was especially good with an excellent choice of food 
78369,The Rockwell, Bed too soft would take out carpeting Shower could be much better We stayed in ground floor maybe there are better rooms above It is a Victorian House made Hotel so that the entrance Hall is small , TV spacious room 
78370,The Rockwell, Nothing I can particularly think of , Clean room and helpful staff Room was well maintained Bathroom was spacious although the room itself was a bit on small side Location was also good and there are lots of places to visit within walking distance I only stayed for 1 night but would love to stay for longer Food menu looked appealing although I did not have a chance to try 
78371,The Rockwell, Room is too small no room for the suitcase when you opened it the room was blocked Don t take what they call Superior single It is not worth the fee , The be was OK 
78372,The Rockwell, Bathrooms are very small especially the shower though the products in there were lovely Nowhere to put suitcases in the room so had to walk over them to get to the bed but London hotel rooms are always small , Very cool hotel Lovely garden out the back for breakfast and drinks Peaceful and quiet inside despite being on a very busy road Position fantastic for Earls Court Tube and we could walk to Kensington Gardens Many inexpensive restaurants nearby Happy to store our luggage we left cases for a week while on a quick trip to Scandinavia then returned to the hotel for 2 more nights Would definitely recommend the Rockwell to friends 
78373,The Rockwell, A little far from the tube station if you have lots of luggage to pull , Very well renovated property Nice restaurant with a cozy patio nice breakfast room is on the small side following the standard in London but comfortable and well equipped with a nice bathroom 
78374,The Rockwell, Bathroom could do with a slight makeover Minor gouge in floor of shower tray soap dispenser tray missing shower cubicle with screw holes showing Shower head leaking a little Sealant around top of sink needs attending to But and it s a big BUT these are very minor quibbles and I m sure they will be fixed soon as the hotel s housekeeping is exemplary , Friendly attentive and very professional staff What are we going to do without our excellent EU hotel and catering staff post Brexit Very comfortable and homely ambience in the hotel Great outside patio area at the back Restaurant breakfast room is on the ground floor and is light an airy rather than being stuck in the basement as with several London hotels The bar area is welcoming as is the comfortable lounge area at the front Most single bedrooms are small and cramped but not this one A lot of time and trouble has gone into its design It made the best use of the space available Coffee and tea making facilities in the room plus minibar An in room iron and ironing board would be welcome The air conditioning was a Godsend as was the excellent sound insulation Although my room overlooked Cromwell Road I hardly heard the road noise and I m a light sleeper Breakfast was good Fresh croissants and pastries and good choice of Tiptree conserves I prefer freshly cooked breakfasts and am not a fan of pre cooked breakfasts in warming cabinets but hey at this price you can t complain Coffee was excellent The pi ce de r sistance would be freshly squeezed orange juice but you don t get that usually in UK hotels at this price I like this hotel lot and it s one of the best I have stayed in in London Overall a very pleasurable experience and I ll definitely stay again 
78375,The Rockwell, Shower was small and I am a small person but nicely updated really quite minor , Loved the location easy walk to museums restaurants shopping and very close to tube stop Room though small had extraordinary storage both in bathroom and generous wardrobe Breakfast served in lovely garden behind hotel a rare feature of a small hotel so centrally located Breakfast exceptional in quality and variety Staff friendly and accommodating and included in very reasonable room price Had room on back side and it was remarkably quiet Heard no other guests nor exterior noise Bed was very comfortable 
78376,The Rockwell, The bed is super small if you travel with a friend it is not suitable Bathroom is not convenient There was nowhere to put shampoo shower gel which was very annoying Staff said they were currently renovating and thus they removed all the shampoo etc holders in the showers Late at night we had no warm water to shower but could be that we did not wait long enough as also one afternoon it took a few minutes to get really hot water Room was clean overall but there was hair in the shower , The location is great very convenient from to airport close to tube station Staff was friendly and helpful Nice view from the room we were on 4th floor Convenient re shops restaurants etc in the area 
78377,The Rockwell, The staff were friendly but seemed to have fairly limited English and the airport shuttle advertised on Booking com is not a shuttle at all but instead a Limo service that the desk will book for you so be warned I specifically booked this hotel for the airport shuttle and was shocked when a Mercedes Sedan arrived to pick us up and then I had to back 50 British pounds for the 30 minute ride to the airport To top it all off he only accepted cash because that is how it was booked resulting in my boyfriend having to run into the terminal to find a cash machine so we could pay Had I known that it was not a shuttle I would not have booked this hotel or booked the shuttle through the hotel and instead taken an Uber or the Underground for a fraction of the cost Perhaps it was a language barrier but when I asked for the shuttle at the front desk there was no clarification that they were booking a limo what the cost would be or that I would have to pay cash I felt completely blindsided and cheated once we were picked up and dropped off at the airport , The bed was very comfortable and the room was actually quite spacious especially by European standards The bathroom was very nice and the toiletries provided were great Just don t plan on taking the airport shuttle that is advertised on booking com 
78378,The Rockwell, I didn t manage to get hot water in the bathroom but perhaps it was my fault The breakfast was good but more variety would be a plus, Nice single room with satisfactory space and very quiet Very nice garden at the back of the hotel unfortunately the weather was not good so I didn t enjoy it 
78379,The Rockwell, 1 They do not proactively honour the Genius perk You have to ask for it or decide not to be calculative and give it up I don t think is the right way to treat guests 2 This is not exactly a fair review because not everyone will encounter the situation I find that the staff are not trained to handle special circumstances well The air conditioning in my room was not working and the hotel was well aware as there was already an electric fan in the room I understand that such things happen what I find unacceptable is that the staff did not inform me when I check in I had a rude shock when I get to my room I think it is disrespectful to not acknowledge seek understanding communicate to guest that they are not able to offer what was clearly stated in the facilities they offer which the guest paid for as a whole package if the hotel is clearly aware of the situation Even if the staff just took over the shift everyone should be briefed on what is going on in the hotel right now and have a proper handover for a 4 star hotel So I find it hard to be understanding I was not offered any goodwill compensation until I went down to complain Electric fan is not a like for like replacement of air conditioning It takes up room space and it is actually not very effective because the window cannot open more than 3 inches But my main issue is actually how can they be so disrespectful I went to talk to the staff when the manager was not around the staff asked me to look for the manager the next day Nobody proactively came to look for me to address the issue I had to look for the manager and raise the issue again The manager offered me a free breakfast as compensation Due to the fact that they did not communicate to me up front and did not bother to follow up gives me a just your luck suck it up impression I would if this is 3 star hotel , This is my third time staying at The Rockwell within 2 weeks Each time I get a different room This is a boutique hotel so every room is different All the rooms I stayed in are extremely clean Tasteful decor 
78380,The Rockwell,No Negative, Excellent location ideal place for lovers to go on foot it takes just 10 minutes to get to the beautiful Kensington garden and then have a walk to the center by magnificant parks Easy way to get to Heathrow by metro Perfect staff Small size room appeared to be more cozy than expected due to comfortable furnuture arrangement But please be aware if you are big size person you might face some small inconvenience expecially in the tiny bathroom For me it was very nice stay and i recommend this hotel 
78381,The Rockwell, Shower unit was a little tired and difficult to adjust water temperature Still usable , Excellent breakfast continental and English available Nice terrace to the rear 
78382,The Rockwell, The bathroom was extremely tiny Room had limited place to have 2 suitcases open That is about all I can think of, The Rockwell is a delightful small hotel in Earls Court near the Tube station making it very convenient for getting around Small room but clean and fairly quiet Staff very polite Nice high quality toiletries provided Wished I could have stayed longer 
78383,The Rockwell, The WiFi wasn t great It would occasionally disconnect and the staff would have to restart the router modem They were always polite about it and complied immediately , The stay overall was great The room wasn t ready in time but we were upgraded to a suite as compensation even though we did not complain about it At one point during the stay my ipad stopped working and I urgently needed a computer There were none available other than the ones at front desk and I was permitted to use one of them The staff were nice and it is great value for money Highly recommended 
78384,The Rockwell, My room had a small skylight instead of windows nowhere to hang my clothes the cupboard doors were wonky and the water taps went dry for 5 minutes , Staff were helpful and breakfast was good for this price of room 
78385,The Rockwell, Breakfast can be improved plates warmed and eggs cooked to order croissants warmed and cafeti re on the table , The staff are so helpful and kind It has a lovely atmosphere and very comfortable excellent value It is a little corner of peace in busy London Nothing is too much trouble 
78386,The Rockwell,No Negative, I was staying in Standard Single room I like the decor especially that there are lots of windows Really comfortable Bathroom was a lot a lot better designed that Superior Single The shower stall makes a lot more sense 
78387,The Rockwell, Staff morale seems low but that is none of my business My first night was in Superior Single which I find not as good as Standard Single The bathroom is illogically designed There was a huge cabinet beside the shower stall and the shower stall was really small It is smaller than a public toilet cubicle Very inconvenient and ruins the experience Please get priorities right I love the Standard Single , The hotel is super clean and I really like the style The amenities offered were great Service was good in the sense that they really try to deliver your requests immediately 
78388,The Rockwell,No Negative, The room was very nice We enjoyed the extra space in the loft There was no noise from the street making for a good night s sleep The backyard was a beautiful courtyard excellent for relaxing after a day of touring 
78389,The Rockwell, Size of the room was just perfect for a small child with no luggage The room was impossibly tiny and hotel staff couldn t move me Not as advertised by Booking com and definitely not worth the rate paid No room to even use the teeny tiny desk in the corner which was a major problem because I was on a work trip The shower didn t drain The TV didn t work well would randomly turn off over and over The bed was fairly uncomfortable and even a bit unstable and rickety Though they were nice the hotel staff gave me some bad information about getting a VAT refund which wasted my time You can t get a VAT refund for hotel bills and the concierge staff should have known that The staff also didn t seem to know if breakfast was included or not Hotel was advertised as having shuttle service from airport which was false They had room service but there was nowhere to eat the meal except on the bed and no place to put the tray , The staff were very friendly and nice 
78390,The Rockwell, Nothing , Very comfortable bed Had s good night sleep considering how hot it was this weekend Had the window open and still very quiet Our room was facing the back Even though we only stayed for 1 night we found the staff very polite and friendly We would stay here again the price was less than the hotel which we have stayed in before a much bigger hotel opposite Gloucseter Rd tube station We had a nicer room at the Rockwell also Very satisfied customer
78391,The Rockwell, I wish when they d refurbished that they d put in sensible sized shower cubicles I m not vast but can barely turn around in them and splashed out on separate temperature and water flow controls instead of the awful single control that takes an age to get the temp right , This is a great boutique hotel with wonderful staff excellent atmosphere and rooms that are quirky and comfortable
78392,The Rockwell, The room was particularly small with no room to store a suitcase and the air con was not working , Only a couple of minutes walk to Earls Court station and good proximity to bars and several major museums Pleasant and helpful staff Very good restaurant with attractive outdoor area 
78393,The Rockwell,No Negative, Super stylish hotel Very high quality fixtures and fittings obviously recently renovated and to a good standard Staff very helpful and accomodating It s ideal for business and as a base for Westminster central London I ll be booking there again if the price stays competitive 
78394,The Rockwell, The room was not of a standard advertised Very small with double bed pushed up against the wall Desk adjoining the bottom of the bed therefore sleeping on left hand side of the bed blocked in on three sides Very disappointed that this was described as a four star Room was set up as a single and really should be classified as a single, location
78395,The Rockwell, No complaints here , Great staff Very friendly and accommodating Always there to greet you Conveniently located Close to two different underground stations Walking distance to several museums Very quiet and charming Smaller hotel with all of the perks and amenities without the chaos of a large hotel Had a room facing a very busy street without any noise Incredible Buffet breakfast was included it was simple overall but very satisfying 
78396,The Rockwell, Disappointing that the room didn t look as good as the photos Bathroom small and the shower box tiny Room was a bit tired and in need of an upgrade However was clean and tidy , Is in a convenient location handy to transport Room a reasonable size Staff friendly Breakfast good Clean and tidy 
78397,The Rockwell, Food was awful Ordered a steak with bearnaise sauce No bearnaise sauce Chef tried to pass off balsamic reduction as bearnaise sauce Dessert advertised with clotted cream and fresh fruit came with canned whipped cream and tinned fruit Hugely disappointed Small amount of money was taken off the bill but token was no where near enough , Nice lounge area 
78398,The Rockwell, No parking at hotel street parking is sparse and you have to watch the signs if you leave your car on the road Otherwise options like the Marriott offer parking spaces single day at 35 , This property is in a great location close to public transport lots of food options and if you bring a car into the city you will find parking nearby at the Ibis or Marriott it is not cheap Wife had the breakfast and thought it was good 
78399,The Rockwell, Booked a single room was placed next to the elevator so upon entering a constant hum asked to be moved given another room The single rooms are very small and compact I kept banging my arm on the small table next to the bed No proper sound proofing in the single room so I could hear the noise from the traffic as on a main road in London Dont book a single room if you want to work as there is no space Wifi kept dropping out so very difficult to work , Staff are very friendly and give good customer service Nice garden to relax in and a good location 
78400,The Rockwell,No Negative, The staff could not have been more helpful I arrived in a hurry and had to get ready for a wedding in 20 minutes the traffic had been particularly bad and they got me a salad and a drink incredibly quickly found me a taxi and were so kind and helpful The bed was really comfortable a good selection for breakfast and they made my coffee just how I like it I will go back Easy access to tube station Earls Court and the room was quiet at the back of the hotel 
78401,The Rockwell, Everything was perfect but one day was too hot in the room and it wasn t possible to open the window more than 10cm , Extremely friendly staff in the perfect location The room was comfy and clean 
78402,The Rockwell, No shower caddy to put soap shampoo and other things I have to put all these supplies on the shower floor very inconvenient and not hygienic, The room I stayed at 204 is clean and plenty of sitting chairs for hanging clothes Even if the room was facing a major street Cromwell road it was not noisy at all the hotel have double pane window The shower has strong water pressure It is a main street and easy to access 
78403,The Rockwell, The room is in a very odd long rectangular shape which is hard to place furniture The mattress needs to be replaced seriously The shower is small but it is to be expected in London , Quiet room and fairly pleasant view from the window 
78404,The Rockwell, Room was tiny and weird I checked in quite late after exhausting travelling working day room i was given was not my vision of comfort Interestingly I have called hotel earlier in a day and advised of my exhausting day and late check in staff still thought this would be great accommodation for me that s not what I call customer centric service Bed was at the gallery You could hear other people talking and entire construction was creaking when people above were moving Its highly ulikely for me to return here , Unfortunately nothing to call out as good I felt like Alice in the Wonderland most of the time everything was so small WiFi was working nicely Checkout was fast 
78405,The Rockwell, We had some issues with our WiFi the first night and the night receptionist said they could only try resetting it the next day because the router is in another room Even after that the connection was a bit unstable for some reason this applied to all 3 of our devices phone tablet and laptop The room especially the toilet showed some slight wear Minor touch ups could do wonders , We chose this hotel mainly because the location was amazing It is on the western edge of Zone 1 but this hotel is very near to Harrods and the Knightsbridge Sloan Street shopping area the V A Museum the Natural History Museum definitely recommended and Royal Albert Hall It is also only a short 5 minute walk to Earl s Court Station which is a short direct tube journey to the West End Piccadilly Circus and Leceister Square Breakfast was good They had a reasonable spread of food of a good standard Room size was a plus it was very large and we needed the space as we had a lot of luggage for an event Staff were friendly and helpful Allowed us to grab some bread and pastries to go as we were late one morning 
78406,The Rockwell, A couple of days the breakfast was warm not hot We told them they investigated Turned out the bay Marie resistance was not working properly All good though these things happen , Food was beautiful beds were comfy Staff were nice
78407,The Rockwell, No milk for tea coffee in room V small toilet shower room but clean and practical , Nice big comfortable bed The White Company toileteries Friendly staff 
78408,The Rockwell,No Negative, The breakfast was excellent Eggs Benedict freshly cooked delicious Good variety of food Very quiet room on first floor Everything we needed for 2 night stay Lovely garden setting for use in warm weather Excellent location 
78409,The Rockwell, Nothing, Complimentary upgrade to a suite clean and comfortable in an ideal location Staff were warm and welcoming nothing was too much effort Breakfast was tasty fresh and plentiful 5 minute walk from Earl s Court underground A beautiful garden at the back of the hotel Quality products in the bath room Bed was comfortable slept very well 
78410,The Rockwell, Disappointing not as good as the previous time I stayed here Aircon didn t work room was at front so traffic noise an issue Mattress seemed hard and I got backache afterwards , Good location for Earls Court underground friendly staff complimentary toiletries 
78411,The Rockwell, The size of the room has nothing to do with what is advertised The room did not have even 16m and it was advertised for 26 fact which I find not honest The furniture in the room is very old with old windows I asked for a silent room and got one facing the street although there are rooms facing the garden as well No adaptor in the room although it was obvious that we were from outside England It was provided following our request stil Why not make it easier and offer it in the room There were 2 pieces of hair in the shower otherwise very clean The heating system is old and noisy , Very good breakfast nice area only a few minute walk from the underground a lot of nice cafes and places to eat nearby
78412,The Rockwell, Bed too soft and springy shower was extremely small and claustrophobic We did not receive the promised welcome drink and did not receive any extra bedding despite asking, Breakfast was nice room was fine although small
78413,The Rockwell, Described by reception as a garden room our bedroom was basement front of hotel with views of the dustbins However the noise insulation was excellent and we were only aware of the passing traffic when we could see it in the morning Breakfast was fine self service The menu offered many items not seen and staff made no effort to invite us to use the menu , Seating in all areas was comfortable Newspapers were freely available Bedroom was roomy and comfortable Towels were very high quality Garden was attractive 
78414,The Rockwell, Some of the bedroom furniture was looking a little weathered The room rate was a bit expensive Although the hotel advertises that children under 12 can share the room with 2 adults I think the bed would not ve been large enough , The front desk staff particularly Lisa very helpful Lisa responded to all my queries ahead of my stay very promptly and accurately The back garden pretty as well as serene ideal for an afternoon read or cup of tea The attention to decorative detail e g potted plants comfy armchairs the colour scheme The building itself original ceramic tiles and ornate wooden and wrought iron handrail The tea making facilities with complimentary bottled water Lots of restaurants close by 
78415,The Rockwell, The inclusive breakfast was fairly basic , I have stayed at the Rockwell several times and always found the staff helpful and friendly and the room comfortable and quiet 
78416,The Rockwell, The bathroom had the beginnings of mould on the ceiling and the towel warmer was situated right next to the toilet which meant that my boyfriend burnt his leg on it we had to get them to turn it off We were told when checking in that we had been upgraded to a garden room which meant that there was a small concrete area with a table and chair connected to the room not what I would consider a garden and was a bit of a let down I imagine it would have meant more if we were smokers The addition of some plants at the least would go a long way , The staff were extremely polite and the breakfast was lovely Bed was large and comfortable Very convenient to the earls court tube station very short walk but no sounds from the trains 
78417,The Rockwell, Room small dan the shower cubicle is very small with no hand shower It s difficult to move around and wash hair While the bathroom is actually large enough and super clean with rooftop window , The croissant and the bed that is bigger than usual single bed
78418,The Rockwell, A minor gripe about the bathroom I m not a huge chap but the shower was a squeeze as was rest of bathroom A sliding or outward opening door would do wonders Also given the high spec of this hotel the shower deserved better than a turn it on and guess how far to rotate for a comfortable temperature separate control systems have been available for a few years now, The staff were friendly and extremely helpful For a small hotel there were always plenty of people around to provide help and service The room was larger than normal for London huge comfortable bed and armchairs for chilling out Breakfast was limited buffet in small dining room but all fresh and staff would try to meet special requests not always successfully and were unswervingly charming and friendly even with harder to please guests
78419,The Rockwell, Should indicate if no window just skylight kettle was filthy couldn t be cleaned blanket had an unsightly stain , Staff was great and room a decent size Bathroom very nice size Staff very responsive and free luggage storage 
78420,The Rockwell, breakfast is in a small room which got very hot there was not always a table available some guests left because they did not want to wait or sit in the rather dark bar for breakfast On my second day they were out of ham prosciutto and normal ham tomatoes Croissants even after I asked it took them more than 20 min to refill restock so I simply gave up Also there was no Genius plus goodie as promised when I booked the room very tiny shower , Staff is very friendly rooms are small even the superior ones but very clean 
78421,The Rockwell, But the room was without windows only opening to the roof and no bath only shower , It s excellent service and people and location is exactly near museums I like
78422,The Rockwell, Friendliness slight lack of professionalism i dont particularly like being made to feel a stranger in my own country room slightly neglected ie a visit from maintainance crew wouldnt have gone amiss a soap tray was missing and ring around shower needed fixing but didnt hinder use , Breakfaat
78423,The Rockwell, I had already forgotten about the British standards for showers wall mount with no possibility of aiming and little possibility for water control only not enough cold enough cold and enough burns available with a compulsory jet in the ear , Excellent location with good public transportation options clean fly invasion killed off efficiently The hotel staff made do with what they had No effort was spared no false promises were made The native smiled as if she knew something we didn t but should have 
78424,The Rockwell, Price a little steep but it is London after all , Lovely sized room and clean as a whistle close to Earls Court and Gloucester Road tube stations ten minute walk from the museums
78425,The Rockwell, Bathroom shower was small Could hear some noise from outside of room , Only a short walk to nearest tube station Staff were friendly provided more complimentary water upon request Bed was comfy 
78426,The Rockwell, Litter in room bin from previous guest and hotel ran out of milk for rooms, Professional staff white company toiletries only 5 mins walk from Earls Court tube station
78427,The Rockwell, Window didn t close 100 so a little bit of traffic noise as my room was at the front but this wasn t hugely problematic I really don t need a turn down service I d rather have a quid or two off my bill , Single room was small but perfectly functional decor in good condition Only 5 10 minutes walk to tube 
78428,The Rockwell, duvet was not very wide but good mattress shower unit a bit small , good breakfast croissants great personel very helpfull very clean everywhere no noise from outside to hear in bedroom even room was at busy road luggage storage 2 easy chairs in bedroom tv has large flat screen with many channels 
78429,The Rockwell, Very basic breakfast not included in the room rate , Great location near Earl s Court underground station with quick connection to Heathrow express 10 mins walking from Natural History Museum Complimentary water tea coffee in the room 
78430,The Rockwell, The room was tiny The shower was also tiny The remote control for the TV didn t work well , Quiet location my room faced the road but I was still able to sleep Sleep spray was provided among the free toiletries This is the first time I ve seen this at a hotel and it s fantastic if you ve got a stressful day ahead and need help getting to sleep Breakfast was good including fresh bread 
78431,The Rockwell, The room was chosen as it was meant to be quiet but the pipes were very noisy The room was also set to be at 25 degrees at least and too warm for myself and so by the time I realised this and it was later in the evening the fan was on all night adding to the other noises The hotel was quite pricey I think for the type of room , The staff were friendly and offered to help Also quick to get a iron and board to my room 
78432,The Rockwell, Firmer pillows would have been nice but it wasn t a show stopper Larger towels would have been nice I m quite small and the towel was just big enough to wrap round myself If I d been bigger the towel would have been pretty useless The room was a little cold but I d just come from a hot country so I was feeling the cold , The room provided everything I needed I loved the toiletries in the room excellent quality Staff were very welcoming and friendly These little things make a big difference Can t comment on the food as I didn t stay for any meals 
78433,The Rockwell, Nothing all was very good On a busy road but that cannot be helped , Room was very comfortable with good aircon a nice size and despite being at the front and on a busy road the sound insulation double glazing was very good Well appointed clean modern inside great staff and very good value breakfast 
78434,The Rockwell, There was only one member of staff available in the restaurant and she was run ragged to try and cope but extremely helpful in trying her best to keep everybody happy Also the cooked breakfast ran out whilst there was still a number of guest arriving for breakfast and took around 30 minutes to be replenished , However having had a moan about the the cooked breakfast running out the quality of food when we had it was very good All members of staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel was extremely clean and is central to local facilities We would definitely stay at this hotel again 
78435,The Rockwell, Not topping up breakfast items till they had ran out so you had to wait no English breakfast tea and the bar shut a 11pm to residents even though it didn t say it did, Very clean and nice in a good decorative order
78436,The Rockwell,No Negative, Croissants were absolutely delicious Bed was very comfortable particularly the pillow had a good nights sleep Staff were extremely helpful Whole experience was so good that we have booked the entire Lewis family for a 3 night stay for New Year 
78437,The Rockwell, The shower cubicle was tight there was no soap dish and shower head doesn t move much main letdown, Quality hotel room and facilities were definitely 4 star comfortable bed
78438,The Rockwell, unpredictability room s floor side view lay out mezzanine , good restaurant with two very professional waitresses polite front desk staff and concierge 
78439,The Rockwell, After being out the whole day in London we came back to our room and it was not yet made up We got two bottles of cider in the hotel bar and took it to the room Opening it the bottle neck of one of the bottles broke so could be discussed if that was my fault I used a proper bottle opener I believe the bottle had a defect What soever they could have replaced it for free but they made us pay the exchange bottle Well it wouldn t have meant them going bankrupt And we would have been delighted of the generosity And 5 50 is quite a high price , Nice average hotel nothing special but clean close to underground and central located but far from the nightlife area Soho Quite good English breakfast set up as a buffet also offered continental with cereals and cold cuts like ham and cheese Very nice choice and nicely decorated There is even a restaurant in the hotel medium priced We rather experienced London and it s nightlife Very big and comfortable bed a bit on the hard side but we love that and super clean and nice bathroom Big room for London situation A very good deal Unfortunately non refundable 
78440,The Rockwell, Room was small Specially bed was too small for me 184 cm One night went well but longer stay in that bed would have been hard , Clean and good location Easy to reach from Earls Court station 
78441,The Rockwell, We had a ground floor room and had to keep the curtains closed for privacy it was next to a busy road and pavement It would have been nice to have the lower half of the windows frosted for some privacy whilst the curtains are open , Lovely big room friendly staff and excellent breakfast 
78442,The Rockwell, Overall you are so close to Earls Court and tons of shops that you don t need more on site, Lovely quirky room set on two levels which added a nice change
78443,The Rockwell, 1 is too far from London main shopping area 2 the single room is rather too small, 1 the hotel is very good soundproof although it s located next to the main road 2 all amenities are provided
78444,The Rockwell, coffee sachets supplied in the rooms could have been of better quality a dacaff option would also have been appreciated, toietries supplied were excellent
78445,The Rockwell, Split level bedroom is slightly difficult to access for older people , All staff very friendly and helpful Room well sound proofed from busy road traffic 
78446,The Rockwell, I found the bed not super comfy but it could be me since I am a bad sleeper Too bad they did not had a fuse for my laptop but that s my own fault since I forgot mine , Wifi super fast Staff super friendly Location perfect Super clean room The breakfast 
78447,The Rockwell, Smallest shower ever No iron or iron board in the room but they were delivered once we rang reception Small double bed , Close to Earl s Court tube station Good value considering it London 
78448,The Rockwell, Our room was cold but once we told reception they explained how to operate the heating system shame they didn t volunteer this info at the start , Great location helpful friendly staff lovely room perfect for a weekend break 
78449,The Rockwell, Would have been very disappointed to have had to stay in the original room which was tiny and the shower didnt work , Staff were helpful when we were given a very poor room on the first night Moved us straight away with no problem
78450,The Rockwell,No Negative, My daughter left her beloved toy rabbit Alan at the hotel Alexandra saved him Our hero Loved the split level room so we could stay together as a family without having to compromise on space Location was great with only a 5 minute walk from Earls Court and 15 mins from the Science and Natural History Museums Plenty of restaurant s en route 
78451,The Rockwell,No Negative, It was very clean and quiet but it just has a short walk distance to the tube station The space of the room is big enough and we would stay here again next time 
78452,The Rockwell, Breakfast not included Very annoying noise in our room during the first night but the staff gave us another room for the 2nd night and it was much better Room ok but not as beautiful and big as the photos suggested , Good location rather nice common areas and comfortable bed Not too expensive for London Nice staff on the whole 
78453,The Rockwell, Any negatives were very minor paint chipping in a couple of places heating in bathroom insufficient probably due to the very high ceiling , Well pretty much everything Location not in ultra central London but at the edge of zone 1 a 5 walk from Earl s court tube station Nice amenities Comfortable room small of course but it s London All that is needed in the room tea kettle 3 types of tea 1 herbal bathrobe bottle of filtered water Nice helpful staff pleasant breakfast room although small good breakfast Fast wi fi Good price for the quality offered Would return 
78454,The Rockwell, Breakfast a little expensive , Extra flaky croissants delicious breakfast Very close to all the attraction points Near the public transportation facilities bus metro Large and nice rooms Safe and pleasant neighborhood 
78455,The Rockwell, Constant machine noise hum possibly refrigeration extraction laundry or generator next door looked like it was being renovated when we visited Disturbed our sleep a little on the first night it wasn t loud but it was noticeable when we weren t moving around or watching TV but we soon got used to it so didn t feel the need to complain Floorboards in room creaked a lot Not a problem for us but might have been for those in rooms on floor below Slightly questionable choice of bed covers many layers but that s probably just a matter of preference , Hotel was convenient for tube stations Earls Court Gloucester Road and a short walk to museums Science Natural History V A Staff were very friendly and attentive Food in the hotel s restaurant was excellent Also some good eateries nearby if you like pizza give Franco Manca a try but arrive early it gets busy Checking in and out was quick and efficient Room was larger than expected for London

78489,The Rockwell, The sullen male receptionist who checked me in took me by surprise why is he at front of house If you want Latte with the breakfast you ve paid for you have to pay for it Nescalf coffee in the room Disappointed that my two wake up calls never happened , Loved the room Loved the location Loved the price Loved the silence Loved the huge bed Would definitely return 
78490,The Rockwell, Due to the interior being of light coloured scheme there were a few stains on the furniture and carpet blankets are in need of renewal they reminded me of something my grandmother would have not chic or keeping with the theme of the hotel , The bathroom supplies were great cozy room great cupboard space and magazines are a nice touch was a great bonus to open the window doors for fresh air
78491,The Rockwell, Room was very small , Staff was friendly and the attached restaurant was convenient and had decent food Room was decorated nicely but not extravagant

78493,The Rockwell, Small room constant humming noise in the room small bed just beside the wall Very small bathroom If you have to have carpet in the room make sure that it s clean This is not 4 stars standard , The location was very good Close to tube and with many restaurants and shops close by Walking distance to South Kensington

78499,The Rockwell, Rooms that face Cromwell Rd can be a bit on the loud side area around Earls Court Station is a bit on the dodgy side but I had no security issues , 3 minute walk from Earl s court Tube station lots of restaurants and grocery stores around Small but very nice room with beautiful bath

78503,The Rockwell, My single room was next to the lift so could be noisy Also had some kind of vent outside the window maybe from the kitchen so again noisy at times Also the mattress was a little soft for me and felt like I was going to fall out of bed , Excellent location a short walk to Earls Court tube station and all the museums of South Kensington Friendly staff The room was small but compact and had what I needed Nice bathroom and shower 
78504,The Rockwell, My only niggles are having to pay for everything in the room i e Biscuits bottled water etc and no bath Definitely not deal breakers so I will be back, Extremely well located for the conference I attended at Olympia about a 15 minute walk but with plenty of public transport as an option Public areas warm and welcoming as were the staff knowledgable and helpful Unlike other reviews my room was very spacious with an extremely comfy very large bed Although I paid the extra for a double room

78508,The Rockwell,No Negative, Perfect location close to train Hyde Park excellent shopping and restaurants All attractions and Heathrow easily reachable by train but the hotel is in a pleasant residential non touristy area Decor is stylish but cozy avoiding both the generic chain hotel vibe and the super trendy ultra modern look It s not a huge room but is very comfortable with small lounge area including couch and desk spacious bathroom and bed on mezzanine floor upstairs Quality furnishings throughout No street noise at all even though it s on a main road Amazing value for money 
78509,The Rockwell, The breakfast could have been improved although it wasn t bad at all Just not a very wide variety of items , We had double deluxe rooms which were very comfortable and not small which is a big bonus for a hotel in London Staff were really nice there were tea making facilities in the room which is always a nice to have Toiletries were also good Decor was lovely and there were a lot of extra touches which give a luxury feel such as new Elle Decor and Esquire magazines in the room and lavender sleep spray for the bed I would return to this hotel 
78510,The Rockwell, King size bed was really two single beds pushed together I had a sore back after sleeping in the crack Not easy to get a taxi in that area, Garden room was very large by London hotel standards Staff was very helpful 
78511,The Rockwell, Price of breakfast is higher than the value indicated in booking com When I asked the reason it is said since I did not bought it from booking com a different price policy will be implemented But in voucher of booking com a cheaper price is written and the issue is not indicated before having the breakfast , Rooms are clean Staff is helpful 
78512,The Rockwell, I did not like the fact that you could not have guest in your room after 11 They actually will come knock on your door and kick the person out if they dont leave when they ask them too , N a
78513,The Rockwell,No Negative, We stayed in the mezzanine suite for two nights and had a great time I have stayed in many hotels in London and this has been my favourite The staff were fantastic from start to finish and will certainly be using this hotel for future trips 
78514,The Rockwell, The shower room was a bit confined and the door opened too easily If the window could be opened more it s perfect I understand the security reason though , It had enough light through the windows which I needed All the facilities are just perfect except for the shower room It s VERY helpful to have a fridge I could keep my milk for tea and fruits The room was very clean comfortable and had enough space And bathrobe was provided excellent I appreciate they have asked me if I prefer quite room I d love to stay again 
78515,The Rockwell, Had to seek staff out on several occasions at breakfast time No one seemed to be managing it , Mezzanine bedroom was an interesting quirky touch that we both liked Excellent location close to Earl s Court tube station Excellent standard of hotel for the price Nice outdoor area with seating 
78516,The Rockwell, Only bad experience was trying to get breakfast one morning We hadn t purchased it as part of our room booking Waitress had to be chased down to take our order and was very confused from start to finish Food was still good , Very kind and helpful front desk staff Bed was comfortable More than enough room for your luggage in the storage cupboard Quiet and very conveniently located near Earl s Court Station 
78517,The Rockwell, The shower is a little narrow but otherwise is a good room, The hotel is conveniently located just a few minutes from Earls Court underground station The room is spacious enough for 2 people and the staff was extremely accommodating helping us with everything making our stay an excellent one 
78518,The Rockwell, The bar It had a very poor selection of drinks no lemonade It was very expensive so no surprise there was no one in there and we only had the one , Handy for Earl s Court tube station 10 minute walk Everything you could need for a short break was available in the room The bed was comfy The breakfast was good with a varied selection including an English breakfast served as a help yourself buffet The garden was a very pleasant place to sit 
78519,The Rockwell, The breakfast was a little lacking My partner and I hoped to order from the menu but it seemed like only a continental was available but for the price we weren t bothered to just leave it and go somewhere else the second day Other than that our stay was fantastic Thank you very much , Despite being in such a great location our room was still very quiet and comfortable 
78520,The Rockwell, Room was quite hot but cooled down during the night The air conditioning machine did work but was far too noisy to use while trying to sleep , Only a short walk from the Piccadilly and District lines so easy to get to and from the hotel Surprisingly quiet 4th floor room even though it was facing Cromwell Road Clean and pleasant throughout 
78521,The Rockwell,No Negative, Lovely small hotel charming decor in excellent Cromwell Road location within easy walking distance to Earls Court and Kensington High Street Staff delightfully friendly and helpful Room and ensuite bathroom very comfortable clean and quiet Excellent breakfast 
78522,The Rockwell,No Negative, The hotel was clean and the staff were very friendly I had lunch in the private garden courtyard in the sunshine which is a real bonus for this hotel Very peaceful and yet you are in London 
78523,The Rockwell, To be contacted about the fault with our room so we could have decided the room change a mezzanine room was not appropriate for us There was also no remote for the TV in our room and the minibar fridge wasn t switched on , Courtyard garden is lovely for breakfast and peaceful considering its central location Upgraded to a mezzanine room due to a fault with the garden room we had booked Very clean and well kept 
78524,The Rockwell,No Negative, Friendly staff Modern hotel in great location on bus route to main attractions Outside eating area when warm Varied breakfast menu We opted for the freshly prepared eggs Benedict which were delicious 
78525,The Rockwell, The door in the bathroom were a bit crooked and it required a bit effort to open close The little basket in the shower to hold shampoo and soap also crooked Not a big deal but little things like these should be mended immediately , Nice English style Very cosy Garden available in the summer it s pleasant to have breakfast there 
78526,The Rockwell, Since there was a TV there could have been some proper news channels The cabinets weren t wide or deep enough for the luggage , The location in Earl s Court is pretty much optimal The hotel and the room were both nice and compact The room size was nearly perfect for a single person The shirts delivered by the laundry service were in excellent condition 
78527,The Rockwell, Typical for London the room was tiny , Had a room on the 4th floor facing the street but didn t hear any street noise A C was quiet and worked well Nice to have a fridge in the room 
78528,The Rockwell, Bed was a bit too soft for our liking , The room space the layout of the room with the vast wardrobe space Plus point we had the full moon right by our room window 
78529,The Rockwell, Breakfast was appalling It was not until I demanded a refund did the waitress offer to have a freshly cooked breakfast prepared for me And for the price of the breakfast I am surprised they are unwilling to provide freshly prepared food like the majority of London hotels I stay at , Reception staff very friendly and helpful 
78530,The Rockwell, Small shower only 1 elevator at the hotel and wifi reception was average at best , Location very clean friendly and professional lady at the reception 
78531,The Rockwell, Booking error caused our booking to be for a Single Room which they could not let my wife and I stay in They were unwilling to accommodate us and charged us full price despite filling the room after the fact ,No Positive
78532,The Rockwell, Couldn t control the air con so rather warm in July , Beautiful artwork stylish spacious rooms very quiet comfy bed great staff Loved my stay and will definitely be back 
78533,The Rockwell, We would have preferred the bar to be open a little later than eleven o clock it would have been nice to had a nightcap when back from shows evenings out do not like using mini bar , The garden area the friendliness of staff who couldn t be more helpful Garden room we stayed in was very nice also a good size 
78534,The Rockwell,No Negative, For the money that I paid in London the quality of the accommodation was exceptional Really great location and lovely room Couldn t fault it for the price Paid for a single room expecting a shoebox but it was a great size 
78535,The Rockwell, Rude staff when checking out 20 minutes late it s not the end of the world shame because the hotel was fantastic and the staff on the night we arrived were amazing , Everything
78536,The Rockwell, they had a problem with the drain so the shower got fluddrd and the wi fi in the room didn t work well, the design is great rhe room was big and comfortable
78537,The Rockwell, I accidentally left something with these guys and they refused to post it forwards I would have paid any amount of money to get my article but they just flat out refused to help expecting me to hire an international courier but no international courier was willing to accept the job I had to get someone English to go to London and take care of this for me I know we should never forget things in a hotel but it is a routine occurrence I would expect a hotel of this calibre to be able to handle , The staff were fantastic and really helpful they gave me a quieter room though of course I d asked for a quiet room and just been assigned one on the elevator The problem is the management not allowing a professional policy 
78538,The Rockwell, Food was a bit overcooked but was still quite enjoyable BBQ both nights Felt good to eat there Breakfast was great Had a single room on 4th floor that needs new carpet Everything else was great , Lobby and restaurant were very nice Staff was super helpful Overall was much better for the money than most in such a good neighborhood Easy to get around 
78539,The Rockwell, I had booked the superior double and asked for twin beds On checking in they said they were full and it appears that my message hadn t been read Bathroom a little small and provision of milk appeared to be limited to two a day , This hotel was a great location for our special trip to Wimbledon The room was very big clean and the staff very polite and friendly 
78540,The Rockwell, Shower was dirty cracks peeling paint in the corner of the room by the bed in room 101 No complimentary bottled water which is something some may take for granted nowadays , The nicest most comfortable bed in a hotel that I ve stayed in this year Great location around the corner from Earl s Court tube station with services into Leicester Sq in minutes 
78541,The Rockwell, The room is too small Totally difference from the pics showed on the website Kind of cheating , The location is good Very convenient to all the attractions Services is good 
78542,The Rockwell, All good , Staff was personable informed and made you feel at home Good morning buffet breakfast Good location and near the tube if you wanted to be at Buckingham Palace 
78543,The Rockwell, Room configuration was unusual with a mezzanine bedroom compact space down stairs I couldn t adjust the volume on the air conditioning unit , This felt like a boutique hotel The staff were very attentive It s location is very central to the city Their restaurant was small but perfect for a quick or leisurely meal 
78544,The Rockwell, The bed was a double with one side pushed against a wall however we were aware of this before our stay from other booking com reviews Worth noting as this would make it hard for anyone mobility impaired , We had a fantastic stay at the Rockwell Our room was quiet and private on the top floor of the hotel with a nice outlook over South Kensington Chelsea The hotel has a great location close to the Earls Court station making it easy to navigate London The staff were really friendly and helpful Overall a comfortable and enjoyable experience 
78545,The Rockwell, room was in mezzanine floor and was very small it looked liked sqeezed between staircases prepared to get extra revenues with no regards to the comfort of customers bathroom very small the single shower tap could not be regulated for hot and cold water so you had to wait for 2 min in cold freezing shower before you could get hot water or wait outside but then the water flooded the foor as the shower sprinkler was fixed chairs in the room not clean, Friendly staff
78546,The Rockwell, The bathroom could have been a tad bigger , This hotel was a terrific find Located centrally and close to South Kensington Chelsea Knightsbridge and the West End I liked the cosy feel of the place The rooms were spotless the bed comfortable the bed linen lovely the food very good and the staff courteous and friendly Nothing was too much trouble for them This is a hotel I would gladly stay at again Highly recommended 
78547,The Rockwell, Nothing it was perfect, The staff we re amazing friendly made it feel like home from home The hotel was beautiful I would definitely recommend a stay at The Rockwell
78548,The Rockwell, the room was exceptionally tiny the hallways you could barely walk down without both your shoulders touching the walls nor could you fit into the teeny weeny shower and i am a small woman , the staff went above and beyond to accommodate my needs 
78549,The Rockwell, Missing shelf in the shower cabinet, Very friendly and helpful staff tasty and generous breakfast buffet Peaceful location next to Earl s Court underground and lovely back terrace Plenty of pubs and restaurants nearby 
78550,The Rockwell, Nothing at all , Staff was very kind professional and ready to attend every need I had Breakfast was really good and with a large choice Room small but confortable and clean Really good position and easy to find I ll definitely come back 
78551,The Rockwell, My bathroom was more than adequate but could have been a tad larger , The Rockwell is a terrific place to stay in London Everything about this boutique hotel I found appealing The staff were very friendly and efficient nothing was too much trouble for them My room was comfortable nicely decorated and extremely clean The hotel is well situated and the 74 Bus which is on the doorstep takes you to South Kensington Knightsbridge and Oxford St The tube is just around the corner I also enjoyed my dining experience there Breakfasts were excellent I will return to The Rockwell and can highly recommend this hotel to other travellers 
78552,The Rockwell, I stayed in a Superior Single Room and although it was advertised as being soundproof I was disappointed to be able to hear the people in the neighbouring room quite clearly The shower was extremely small and felt very claustrophobic I had asked for an early morning call but did not receive it , The location is good and it s only a five minute walk from Earl s Court Tube station The staff I spoke to were very courteous and helpful The room was clean and tidy 
78553,The Rockwell, Unfortunately we were charged for breakfast in check out more than the staff told us There was a confusion about the price and their mistake compensated by us The room was different than they promised in booking com it was smaller , Clean rooms good location and rich breakfast 
78554,The Rockwell, My room was a little one for two people It seemed to me a good room for one However for our need was enough I was with my daughter 16yo , Staff is very nice and professional The garden and the lounge for the breakfast is smart light and cosy Quality breakfast 
78555,The Rockwell, We were planning on eating in the restaurant on our first night Mon 9th May We were very disappointed that this was not possible and were advised of a French restaurant close by The food there was excellent but very expensive Why were we not advised before we arrived that this facility would not be available It was good to be able to open French doors but garden room Stretching it a bit , Comfortable king size bed Requested non allergic pillows but feather ones were on the bed Upon reporting to staff along with lack of coffee in room it was acted upon immediately 
78556,The Rockwell, It was an exceptionally hot weekend in the high 28 degrees The air con is really one of the radiator hybrid thing that is fitted under the window and as one knows that s good when it s emitting hot air rises but useless for cool air sinks In fact though set at 17 degrees the temperature never fell below the low 20s However it does serve as a fan function which is better than many non air conditioned accommodation in London The other problem was the threadbare really old and rough and tatty bathrobe For me if there is a bathrobe there needs to be slippers even disposable ones but there aren t And the condition of the bathrobe makes it very uncomfortable and abrasive to wear after a shower on your naked skin I would recommend either replacing or eliminating it The last issue I had was with the bed and I rarely criticise bedding as I am quite a versatile sleeper Perhaps it s because it is a single bed for a single room so it has been easily misshapen by all the frequent uses Basically it is a very soft bed that is very lightweight heavier better quality mattresses will hold its shape and position better placed against the wall This means that guests especially if they are more than average build will find themselves naturally leaning towards the right outer edge away from the wall Thus the mattress is slanted and when I lay my size 14 5ft 8 inches body on it to sleep I found myself having to stop myself from falling off the bed a few times Rather disconcerting For those travelling with a car like in most parts of London parking is very limited if any expensive and restrictive , A good lift that serves all floor The room is very clean there is a fridge safe coffee tea making area with kettle hairdryer cable tv and amenities like shoe polishing mitt white company complimentary shower hair wash shower cap and sewing kit I like the strong shower pressure and despite being a single room the shower is a good size The soundproofing of the room is quite good in comparison to some other hotels in the sense that you can only hear the immediate person next to you but in a muffled way The front reception still manages to always smile and greet when I walk by despite sweltering in the heat without relief The room service staff I ran into on my way out the first day was really friendly and turned out my room really nicely when I returned Wifi signal was medium to strong and I had no problems connecting my phone and laptop The signal does however mysteriously drop disappear between midnight to 1am Accessibility is good if you are keen on being in the Kensington area It is a quick walk to Earl s Court station The 10 minutes walk is full of restaurants e g Lebanese fast food joints e g Mac cafes and supermarkets Sainsbury Co op so you can pick up any necessity on the way out or in The station has lifts so it is handy if you have heavy suitcases like me or if you have kids or walking difficulties 
78557,The Rockwell, No notice of restaurant closure on any website Builders doing refurb smoking outside my room at 7 45 each morning Manager sulking in his office and wouldn t come out , Nice reception staff and great new porter concierge very friendly and helpful made this staff much better than it really was 
78558,The Rockwell, Sewage coming up my shower drain Well these things happen , My sewage problem was readily solved and I got upgraded to a double and then superior single room 
78559,The Rockwell, lower ground floor room excessive noise i guess caused by air conditioning motor a constant drone through the night , room and bathroom were very good size
78560,The Rockwell, Restaurant was undergoing refurbishment so had to have breakfast in room However it was nice but limiting Minor point and would still stay there again if in the area, Nice interior and cosy hotel for Central London Price was also competitive compared to hotels in vacinity
78561,The Rockwell, Room small but was for single person so expected No bath which would have been nice but I knew before I went , The bed was extremely comfortable The staff were excellent and so helpful Would certainly go again 
78562,The Rockwell, Room only had shower a bath would have been nice , Comfortable bed nice linen nice shower comprehensive continental breakfast Nice team polite service White company toiletries Don t be put off by the noise traffic of Cromwell Road I had no disturbances to my sleep or stay 
78563,The Rockwell, I booked as a business traveller and expected a desk or table to work The dressing table was too small to work on as part of it is taken up by the kettle and tea coffee There was no where to put my suitcase so I moved an armchair and rested my suitcase on the arms of the chair There is no where to put toiletries shampoo conditioner soap etc in the shower I had to put them on the floor I reported this twice but received no feedback I was not informed prior to my visit that there were renovations taking place in the hotel Breakfast had to be taken in my room as a result but again no table on which to place the tray I also did not like the fact that the breakfast tray or the bowls plates on it were not covered From a hygiene point of view I would have preferred bowls to be covered with plastic wrap at least I would have liked two cups of coffee but was brought a single cup rather than a pot of coffee The bedside lamps point down illuminating the bedside tables but were useless in providing light for reading in bed , The location was great staff were friendly my room was quiet clean and reasonably comfortable 
78564,The Rockwell, breakfast is pretty basic, the whole hotel is done very well the decor and the ambience is very calm and sophisticated I stayed in a mezzanine room which was really nice
78565,The Rockwell, Noise I was able to hear everything on the corridors as if it was inside my room not to mention they were fixing something during the day on the top floor , Location
78566,The Rockwell, I would have liked the bed to be more comfortable memory foam mattress and a duvets would made all the difference , The staff was lovely and attentive The food was tasty and good value for money the location was wonderful close to museums and the park The room was really nice big and bright and the shower was fantastic great water pressure We will be back 
78567,The Rockwell, That the two lowest price red wines were sold out at 16 and 18 pounds meaning I had to pay over twenty pounds on a very nice bottle of wine as glasses of wine not available on room service and mini bar had only white and rose would have had white but it hadn t been restocked though it was later, Bed very comfortable best hotel pillows I have had for ages toiletries nice as well Staff super helpful Eggs Benedict at breakfast were superb other food v good too Lovely to have a small garden 
78568,The Rockwell,No Negative, Room was very spacious and comfortable Short 3 minute walk to the subway There are many restaurants bar s and grocery stores within short walk of hotel Room was very quite no street noise Had good fast internet service 
78569,The Rockwell, With my room being at the back of the hotel I heard a humming noise that was quite distracting to me when I was trying to sleep Room 408 In fairness to the hotel I am someone who does not like white noise so others may not be as bothered by this as I was I asked the clerk about it the second night and after I did the noise seemed to dissipate The third night the humming noise was back and when I checked out I asked the clerk about it He said he could not say for sure but it may be the air conditioning unit of the building next door over which they have no control I would stay here again but would ask for a room on the front of the hotel , My room was very clean The bed very comfortable The size of the room was perfect for a solo traveler I think it may be a room intended for only one as there was only one bathrobe in the closet It it were a room for two I could see that it might be a tad too small Room 408 at the back of the hotel Location was easy to get to from the Earl s Court underground station Only a 36 minute commute from Heathrow The little neighborhood that I had to walk through was very sweet I ate at The King s Head which was excellent as well as the Indian food restaurant Masala which was more casual I also ate at the Secret Thai restaurant which had a charming atmosphere and great food Location of the hotel was a 10 15 minute walk to the Natural Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum I am a walker so it didn t bother me but the Buckingham Palace is 2 6 miles from the hotel Easy to find and very safe but it is a walk 
78570,The Rockwell, Super tiny single room the bed a bit too soft weird bed sheets shower uncomfortable to use cromwell rd has a lot of loud traffic, Quiet corridors nice helpful staff good Wi Fi very clean rooms beautiful interior of the hotel safe and pretty neighbourhood 
78571,The Rockwell, We were in room 207 and the shower head is fixed facing the shower door When we turned on the shower the water immediately fired at us We did find it funny but some may not , Comfortable bed room over looking back garden quite and 5 mins walk to Earl s Court tube station 
78572,The Rockwell, The windows were single glazed so let in the noise and the cold , The staff were very helpful with restaurant recommendations and always had a big smile to cheer me up 
78573,The Rockwell, I really missed a gym and there was no headboard so sitting up in bed to read or watch tv was extremely uncomfortable , Loved the pillow spray and the room was cute 
78574,The Rockwell,No Negative, Only stayed for one night and didn t have time to use any of their facilities so can t really provide a full covering review Mainly just slept in the room and passed by the lobby which were both clean and nice Super smooth check in check out and friendly staff Good location with ca 10 minutes walk to Knightsbridge 
78575,The Rockwell,No Negative, Great location peaceful and nice room and bathroom Super friendly and very helpful staff And they could really speak Hungarian I really felt like being a guest at a friend 
78576,The Rockwell, One day when I returned in the evening there was no water in the room I was moved to another room only upon request , Very friendly and helpful staff Good breakfast
78577,The Rockwell, Bit of a walk to nearest tube at Gloucester Rd could put some off For some reason they don t do duvets , Lovely hotel Nothing not to like Staff were delightful The dinner we had in our room was exceptionally nice Will stay here again 
78578,The Rockwell, It annoys me that you spend almost 200 for one night for 2 people and you have to pay for breakfast the next day , The hotel was lovely and in a good location for what we needed
78579,The Rockwell, I forgot how small London hotel rooms can be It was certainly adequate but I could not turn around in the hallway with a small backpack on and not get tangled in handles How a tall large male would get in and out of the shower is a mystery And I mentioned to the staff a lack of place to put soap shampoo etc in the shower was frustrating A small pad of paper would also have been helpful Just practical necessities for travelers , 7 mins walk to Earls Court tube station 25 mins to V A Natural History Museum great continental breakfast and dining in meals for dinner were very good Several other restaurants only 10mins walk away Grocery and drug store Also 5 10 mins walk Loved having a window I could open cotton sheets and a wool blanket No slippery synthetics thank goodness In spite of previous reviews of unfriendly staff I found every staff person friendly and helpful When I spoke about the small room as I was leaving the staff response was an immediate we wish you had asked we could maybe have moved you 
78580,The Rockwell, Just a minor suggestion The shower design was a bit uncomfortable nowhere to place shampoo bottles soap , Great location very spacious and comfortable room and very polite staff
78581,The Rockwell, Room was a little too warm and even with air con on it wouldn t cool down Possibly need stronger air con as was waking up in the night as so hot and can t open window Everything else however was wonderful would defiantly recommend ,No Positive
78582,The Rockwell, Single bedroom is super tiny I rather pay a bit more for bigger room especially if your staying a few days My room on entering looked clean until I saw the dirty toilet with poo still in it I asked for a room change immediately Staff was polite but needs to have better knowledge of local places to be able to help guests , Good location walking distance to high st kensington and Earl s Court station 
78583,The Rockwell, The service and cleanliness in the standard The size of a small room cramped uncomfortable can t open window Bed uncomfortable and too small Breakfast is included in the room with just bread coffee and a little something else Forget it with full English breakfast Too expensive compared to the service they receive It should be a 3 star hotel not 4 star , I was glad to check out early 
78584,The Rockwell,No Negative, Right in the heart of London 10 minutes walk from the national museums park 5 mins from Tube station perfect location Elegant spacious rooms impeccable service we also had a very fine dinner there An ideal weekender 
78585,The Rockwell, The hotel staff seemed rather indifferent or rude as we came and left each day The only time that the staff seemed pleased was when we checked out on our last day I m not a very popular guy so this wasn t that big of a deal or surprise I did have an allergic reaction to what I believe was the detergent that the hotel used to launder the sheets This caused me to develop a rash over much of my torso However my girlfriend had no issues After this I decided that I am a weak human , Based on the location near Earl s Court size of the room and the price we paid overall the Rockwell was a good deal The rooms were clean everything that I saw online was as advertised Plus based on a floorplan I saw we were given one of the larger rooms in the hotel 
78586,The Rockwell, My room on the third floor seemed a bit squeaky not sure if it was the elevator or the floor boards from the room on top but there was this intermittent noise especially at night Walls are also on the thin side , I loved this little boutique hotel a gem in a quiet neighborhood though it s a hike from London s main attractions except the museums The rooms are very comfortable with a very good use of space Food was great and staff very helpful 
78587,The Rockwell,No Negative, The room had lots of storage a comfortable bed and mirrors where you could put on your makeup without going back in the steamy bathroom The lighting was good as so many places have dim lighting The window opened on to a lovely quiet courtyard The breakfast was adequate For us the location was excellent near the Earl s Court tube and within a walking distance of the Kensington High Street 
78588,The Rockwell, Tight quarters I m a tall guy and had two larger bags however the height and space in the shower made up for it , I arrived late and had to depart early the Front Desk receptionist promptly assisted me with transport arrangements for the following morning Very clean room and bathroom 
78589,The Rockwell, Cromwell Road is quite noisy bring some ear plugs with you , Nice staff great location Only 45 minutes to Heathrow Nice pubs and restaurants nearby 
78590,The Rockwell,No Negative, My first impression was this is very upmarket hotel Very contemporary and chic boutique paradise in the centre of london Excellent spacious room with all the comforts one expects The staff were fabulous and made sure my stay was very enjoyable The breakfast was delicious and I could have had a scottish breakfast for a small supplement I will definitely be back to stay loved it 
78591,The Rockwell, room was too hot for me but once I flagged it the staff addressed it straight away , Location the quality of the room and the hotel in general makes it an incredible value for the area 
78592,The Rockwell, I was in room 408 on the top floor it was right underneath the aircon units for the building They vibrated my room all night like having a washing machine on full spin above your head not good at all Apart from that the hotel was fine I was just unlucky to have that room , Very clean nice breakfast good location and staff 
78593,The Rockwell, We had superior room but bathroom was too small and tv screen 14 so the room standard was for sure not 4 star , clean helpful staff walking distance from shops resturants national musuem and underground
78594,The Rockwell, Only negatives were the shower temperature controls slow to heat up then almost scaldingly hot No extractor fan in the bathroom Bedroom was warm which was fine after a day out in the cold but it was hard to adjust the temperature seemed to be either warm or chilly These niggles did not get in the way of us enjoying our stay , Fantastic location and quiet room Loved the boutique decor and style of the fittings Large comfy bed Ample selection of tasty food at the breakfast buffet 
78595,The Rockwell, very very small thing that is easy to ignore or fix shower head aims at the door so you get soaked upon entering and you have to reach way in to turn on again getting soaked just turning it on and adjusting the temperature , super clean and comfortable bed was very comfortable quiet staff was excellent nice big bottle of free water in room ease of transport to tube and buses 
78596,The Rockwell, Common areas of hotel exceptionally warm It is a very busy road but that didn t cause any problem whatsoever , Staff room and restaurant all excellent 
78597,The Rockwell, Nothing to criticise but one light was out in the bathroom which wasn t a problem anyway as the other one worked fine , Location was perfect train station is a literal 2 minute walk Amazing quality rooms comfy bed overall amazing hotel 
78598,The Rockwell, beds not made with proper duvets, great location in West London neat place with understated stylish character just the right size to maintain a personal atmosphere friendly staff nicely done
78599,The Rockwell, No windows roof lights only in single room Air con failed to cool airless room Too stuffy on top floor , Lobby restaurant style room sound proofing
78600,The Rockwell, The only thing we did not enjoy was the tube which is completely out of your control I cannot fault the Rockwell hotel I hope to visit again , The room was very comfortable the food was lovely and all the staff were wonderful nothing was too much trouble Thanks for a great weekend 
78601,The Rockwell, we had trouble with the heating in the room it took us 1 day to realize we had to put the heating at 28C to get some actual heating in the room the heating also made a lot of noise the carpet was dirty, reception area is really nice
78602,The Rockwell, Location is pretty good if you have sufficient travelling time In our case we have limited time and the hotel wasn t as close as we think to reach our destinations The breakfast staff kept on making mistakes with the orders she needs better training , Nice stay friendly staff modern room with patio delicious and big breakfast worth to pay 9 50 in advance 
78603,The Rockwell, I had a room at the front of the hotel which was rather noisy from traffic noise but you got used to it and I slept well Was not sure whether the window was double glazed because of this , I had a very pleasant stay The location was excellent The hotel felt like a home away from home Staff were very polite and unobtrusive and nothing was too much trouble with a warm welcome each day 
78604,The Rockwell, The bed wasn t quite comfortable In our room we could hear the traffic outside The staff wasn t very friendly The breakfast was too pricey The used furniture might be from IKEA doesn t look very classy , We liked the huge TV in our room and the electric water jug Everything was very clean One young man at the reception was very friendly compared with the rest of the staff 
78605,The Rockwell, Not a bad experience but the location was a little out of the centre of London for our preference , The staff were very helpful and friendly The decor and comfort were excellent for the price charged The food was also excellent 
78606,The Rockwell, Comfortable but very small bed the curtains didn t make the room dark enough which caused us to wake up too early , Very good value for money conveniently located close to subway station quiet lots of nice products in the bathroom 
78607,The Rockwell, Rooms have 2 levels The TV and desk are on the first level and the bed is in a sort of attic You cannot watch TV in bed Breakfast is poor, Location is good near Earl s Court tube station Facilities are in a decent condition
78608,The Rockwell, The bed was on a second level up a narrow staircase Clothes had to be stored on the main level so it was a bit awkward having to go up and down when I needed something , The staff was extremely friendly and attentive to my needs The room was clean and well maintained Was within walking distance to the Tube 
78609,The Rockwell, Nothing bad just double bed was quite small this was the only thing we d have changed , Really Lovely staff Very helpful Very clean Close to tube and restaurants etc good value for London prices
78610,The Rockwell, The mattress felt a little saggy and it would be helpful to have a shelf in the shower for shampoo etc however these things did not impact on my stay, Welcome from reception staff was excellent as was the attention from the waiting staff at dinner The bathroom was spotlessly clean and I was delighted to find a bathrobe supplied
78611,The Rockwell, A bit small room than my expectation and periodical interruptions of the wifi connection but the benefits took over these minor things , Nice and friendly staffs and very clean linens Concierges kindly tried to give the best route when I ask how to get my destination even away from London southern eastern area also kept my luggage after checkout 
78612,The Rockwell, The hotel charged us 12 5 for continental breakfast because we made the booking through booking com If we had not payed for breakfast in advance the price would have been 9 50 Just those small things thar irritates you When we pointed out the strange in this they would just shrug it of without giving any refund So it seems if you book through the any site they actually try to get some extra out of you Just makes me mad , The rooms are ok 
78613,The Rockwell, There was no water point or health faucet near the WC in the room Also the shower should have a hand shower head It is difficult to bring luggage into the main front door there should be a more friendly and open front entrance designed, Friendly and cheerful staff Got a room upgrade as well 
78614,The Rockwell, Before going I had wondered if I would hear Cromwell Road traffic at night but I did NOT The double or triple windows shut out all the traffic noise quite successfully on the street side My single room was a little on the small side but that did not bother me , Excellent hotel excellent helpful staff good elevator lift good well supplied bathroom facing an area of London where I love to walk Kensington and Chelsea My room was quiet and comfortable A short walk to Earl s Court Tube Station which has an elevator and direct tube line to both Heathrow Airport and most of the downtown places that I like to visit many great stops on the Piccadilly Line There are also bus stops very close by Grocery stores drugstores shops and cafes all convenient on Cromwell Road Gloucester Road and Earl s Court Road Several really good pubs just a little to the north including a quieter one which is my favorite I have tried about 11 London hotels on various occasions and this one and one other are my all around favorites 
78615,The Rockwell, The receptionist was rude unwelcoming and unhelpful The bed in the room was uncomfortable The bathroom was disgusting there were bugs in the shower and the shower had no soap handle which is very inconvenient and it had no temperature control for the water Also the sink kept flooding and the toilet s flush wasn t working well The wifi kept disconnecting I do not recommend this boutique hotel as it s nowhere near a good four star hotel , The location of the hotel 
78616,The Rockwell, Shower was powerful and acceptable for us but some of your more chubby customers might have difficulty , Lovely large room with two comfortable chairs so that you didnt have to sit on the bed Staff extremely helpful Close to tube station and Piccadilly Line which takes you to Heathrow 
78617,The Rockwell, It would be nice if the current blankets and sheet could be changed for comforters , The staff was very friendly and accommodating Excellent service Great location
78618,The Rockwell,No Negative, This hotel was so cute and perfect for me for my 2 night stay in London Very close to Earl s Court tube station a relatively quiet one at that and nearby restaurants and grocery stores Had an excellent dinner at the King s Head nearby great vibe and great food The staff at the hotel were very pleasant and helpful I loved every amenity Would definitely stay here again
