188525,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia,No Negative, Staff were fantastic really friendly breakfast very good loads to choose from great area very central to museums and other attractions Restraints and shopping areas
188526,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, one of the worst experiences I ever had it s an apartment at few minutes walk from the main hotel the receptionist gave us the wrong key and we had to call several time and finally walk back ourselves twice before they found out the error they didn t even apologise for that they ended up totally ruining our evening there weren t enough towels in the room and they didn t offer to bring any we had to walk back to the reception the following day to get them the wifi wasn t working fortunately now europe is free roaming the last day we had to leave early so we asked the receptionist if we could leave the keys inside she told us yes so we did few days later I was charged for late check out I called them and explained the situation they promised a reimbourse which of course never came , nice apartment
188527,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, Bad smell from bathroom sink at our suite room rm 108 Despite the comfortable bed and sheet we could not sleep at all due to odd smell from the bathroom Thus we were very very tired throughout the travel Must be from improper plumbing of sewage That bad smell overwhelmed all other great facilities and location of this hotel Later we figured the bad smell from the sink where we wash face and brush teeth thus blocked it with water , Convenient location free local phone with data breakfast
188528,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, Nothing actually , Very friendly staff We were 30 minutes late to check out we were there for a big event but they didn t even mention it Great room we had the studio 5mins walking from hotel really nice decorated with loads of facilities 
188529,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, It was the worst experience ever Unprofessional personnel messed up reservations room which has never been properly clean Awful experience No proper air con in 37C heat and room with remains of previous guest dirty coffee cups and dirty surfaces broken lamps the list can go on ,No Positive
188530,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia,No Negative, They upgraded our room when we arrived since it was very hot in Paris at the time We ended up in a beautiful spacious airconditioned room The staff were all very helpful and friendly The location is perfect for exploring Paris on foot or by public transport The Louvre is literally around the corner But when you are in the room it is quiet and comfortable Don t miss the wine bars and restaurants in the little side street one block away 
188531,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, Breakfast was very nice but a bit pricey at 15 euros , The hotel is centrally located but on a quiet street with pleasant cafes steps away The staff was knowledgable pleasant cheerful and accommodating The property was pristinely kept The cushioned bay window seat in the room and the elevator were both enjoyed appreciated by my mother The linens were crisp fresh and sumptuous The train station to the airport is a short walk away Excellent choice for travelers on the go 
188532,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, The wine dispenser in the lobby wasn t working properly so we weren t able to get a drink at the hotel not really a big deal I m clutching at straws here The rooms were very compact but we knew that when we booked It is Paris afterall , A lot of thought had been put into the decor finishing touches that really maximised the small space and gave the room a luxury feel It was also on a very quiet street well it was on Sunday The staff were extremely friendly 
188533,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, My room was functional but very small But it is Paris , The staff were some of the most welcoming and helpful I have come across in all my travels Awesome friendly concept and location 
188534,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, The wallpaper Typical French so I suppose one should expect it The shower and toilet facilities were not fully separated from the bedroom area Should be a complete wall, Excellent location Staff were very helpful and knowledgeable
188535,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, not super clean lift only allow one person with luggage , excellent location creative design safe and just like a home staff very nice and helpful Found one of best breakfast just opposite the door
188536,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, This hotel had every bad wifi problem it was unsecured yet also required a crazy long form to be filled out before you were granted access it was super weak and also disconnected you every few hours The air conditioning was very weak and quiet which sucks if you like it as background noise Also if there were minibars in the room this hotel would really be improved There is a little wine bar downstairs but they were completely out of white wine , The staff was SUPER friendly and nice they even let me check in early The decorating was just wonderful and those pretty pops of color and great wallpaper made a difference in my enjoyment of the room There are lots of comfortable pillows and a comfortable bed 
188537,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, Our only negative comment is that on the first night the room was really warm The thermostat had been set to 25 degrees which was quite frustrating but after we fixed it the temperature was fine , The room we had was perfect and the location was great We really liked the serve yourself bar and felt it was a nice touch The hotel staff were really helpful in providing tips and recommendations in the area 
188538,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, We thought we were renting a room in the hotel but instead it was an airbnb like apartment They had only 1 set of keys so we had to coordinate which was very inconvenient On top of this you can t buzz in the person who comes later from the apartment but instead have to go down 7 floors to open the door ,No Positive
188539,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, Thought I was staying within the hotel however realised the studio is outside of the hotel 500m away in a seperate apartment building which upon checking in in the evening was not ideal Had I known this understood when booking via booking com I would ve opted to stay in the hotel for the comforts of well a hotel The bed is not 100 secure and there is no real service in the apartment unless it s prompted , The decor was really lovely for an apartment ample room for a single business trip The staff we re great when I was in the actual hotel at check in out only they were able to assist with my reservations and business bookings The hotel looks amazing location decor warmth Great thing about this studio is the location and that it s opposite from Claus breakfast dining 
188540,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, The bed was good but it could have been a bit bigger , Beautifully decorated rooms and very spacious for hotels in Paris Location is excellent and the staff is very friendly and flexible Good place to stay if you re going for a weekend trip and want to explore the highlights of Paris On one side of the bed there were USB connections to easily charge your phone Bathroom was small but cleverly designed to optimize the space 
188541,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, The walls are not very sound proof , The staff is super friendly and helpful The hotel location is amazing While the rooms are small the very new and colorful interior made the rooms very pleasant 
188542,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, well the apartment is literally not in the hotel I noticed that in both rooms there s only one small trash bin in the room As in the apartment the bathroom is quite narrow , we booked the Studio Attrape R ve It was more than what a hotel could provide Even it s not located in the hotel but it is really cozy and comfortable for a couple like us Really good location and tbh it s like a home for us in Paris We decided to book for one more night but unfortunately the apartment had been booked So we had to move to Junior Suite Sans Mod ration in hotel Crayon Rouge It has really modern design With lots of space in the room it has a huge bath tube also with massage function Lucky for the girls the room also has a make up desk In general this hotel apartment is really good for couples young people to come and enjoy the best experience in Paris 
188543,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, I called to extend my stay but reception was not aware of this upon my arrival The next day it was still not arranged as receptionists did not communicate with each other I tried to have an iron board in my room but they failed to accomodate this TWICE Upon arrival they did not mention I had to pay in order to have my room cleaned I stayed at the appartment 5min from the hotel One of the receptionists cursed on the phone when hearing her colleagues did not do the work I would not at all recommend this hotel , Good placement near fabric streets and close to Louvre
188544,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, Nothing, Great location walkable distance to major attractions Nice cafe bistro near by friendly staff newly renovated nice furnishings comfortable bed and pillows
188545,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia,No Negative, Excellent location for all sorts of activities including sightseeing and shopping in Paris Staff was in all occasions very friendly and extremely helpful 
188546,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia,No Negative, Very close to the Louvre in one direction and restaurant area in the other Easy walk to both Fresh contemporary design Boutique size Helpful friendly staff 
188547,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, No conditioner provided just shampoo body wash A minor complaint Towels are very stiff and scratchy , The location of this hotel is ideal The spaces from the lobby to the hallways to the rooms have a hip well curated vibe The walls are pretty sound proof even though I was located right near the elevator I didn t hear other guest very much ever so slightly if someone was talking loudly as they got on off the elevator But not a peep from within the rooms The bed was very comfortable and I slept well The room is small but it s Paris so I expect small A tiny little gem of a hotel 
188548,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, Can be a bit quite at night and weekend due to in business and office area, Good location for sightseeing close to area with lots of cafe and night outs
188549,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, The breakfast wasn t fresh And minimum options The cleaner getting in the room twice without knocking the door , The staff were so nice and very smiley face all the time loving helping you It was my honeymoon and they were very happy to me they put a bottle of wine and desert with a big card plus flowers on the bed it was amazing I really love it Thanks a lot
188550,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, the bed is a bit too high but not really an issue Room is really small but ok for 1 traveler so basically nothing really bothers me a nice place , the location is perfect just in the heart of everything i d like to see all within walking distance and convenient to CDG airport as well Decoration is in cute active style not like traditional hotel kinda like it No issue on Wifi connection i didn t try the breakfast so no comment Staff is nice as well 
188551,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, Despite a guaranteed check in of 3 00pm we weren t able to check till after 4 30pm which was frustrating , I loved this hotel It was so cute and had a real designer feel Our bed was super comfortable and the room was quiet 
188552,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, For the price it would have been good to have housekeeping and or breakfast included Although it is difficult to compare what is reasonable for Paris as well as the differences with staying in the Studio vs a normal room in the hotel , We stayed in the Studio Attrape Reve and given that it is in a residential apartment building we really felt we got the local experience It was a fantastic combination of the support of a hotel with the independence and local experience of a rented apartment Grabbing some local produce and fresh bread for breakfast was a great way to start the day It helped to have the kitchen amenities of the studio so we could refrigerate things and make eggs for breakfast etc The studio itself was small like all things in Paris but it was beautiful and exactly like the pictures The location was fantastic and we spent so much of our time in Paris walking Service was excellent and staff very helpful 
188553,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, Square pillow was wrong shape for me There was a rectangular one too Shelf over washbasin I kept banging my head on it No tea coffee stuff or kettle in room Room was small Breakfast area is just a communal table We went to nearby Pain Quotidien instead Staff are overworked at times with just one person to clear away breakfast dishes and man reception on the day we left , Rain shower Location near Palais Royal gardens You can walk to everything Staff are mostly smily and always helpful Decor Fizzy water machine in communal kitchen Small sitting area in lobby Lots of lighting options
188554,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, The double rooms were a little tight for two people but really we only slept in them we were out sightseeing 95 of our trip so not a big problem , Bed was amazing pillows especially Breakfast fantastic staff were so friendly and couldn t do enough for us A 100 would return 
188555,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, it would be good if water boiler could be provided in the room, excellent location easy access to metro bus major tourist spots within walking distances and safe area lovely deco in the room
188556,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, Breakfast could have been included for 190 Euro s per night This is an extra 15 Euro s , Great location Well decorated hotel including bedrooms Good sized rooms Worth the extra money compared to Hotel Crayon sister hotel around the corner I ve stayed in both for business The rooms in the sister hotel are starting to become tired Would definitely recommend Hotel Crayon Rouge for everybody 
188557,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia,No Negative, the location very central and convenient very calm I was upgraded from a basic room to a suite because they had availabilities The room service is very qualitative italian dishes would definitely come back
188558,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, Dirty towels were taken one day and no fresh provided and we had to ask twice not a big problem though Some people may not like the self service style kitchen however we enjoyed it, Friendly staff and a relaxing environment that felt like home Very quirky place that was a little different in a good way 5mins walk from the louvre for easy exploration
188559,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, The WIFI in our room was intermittent Had many problems keeping a stable connection during our 5 nights stay and we were asked to connect to other rooms WIFI instead The room was extremely small We almost couldn t open our luggage They should just do away with the wardrobe table and chair which wasted space in that small room The toilet sink bath area has no door If you re conscious about that please do not book this room not sure about other rooms in this hotel I was staying with my sister and the open concept did feel awkward , The location was excellent All the staff I ve encountered at the front desk were friendly and approachable 
188560,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, Small window in my room 209 it wasn t a problem because I stayed only one night and arrived late in the evening but I suspect that may become more an issue if I had to stay longer, I liked the decoration and style of the hotel The breakfast was excellent and the staff extremely helpful and polite 
188561,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia, Unfortunately the room did not have an actual window which was not clear in the description or photos It was a window looking directly on a grey air shaft so no natural light at all This made it feel very unrelaxing and confining I didn t want to be in that room long at all It s a shame because otherwise I really would recommend this place , I thought the decor of this hotel was quite quirky and fun and also the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful The location was superb close to the Louvre and lots of nice places to eat 
188562,H tel Crayon Rouge by Elegancia,No Negative, The hotel is in a great location for the sites and there are many small bars and restaurants in the immediate area The breakfast is a buffet served at a big table which was really friendly and was great to have a chat over breakfast with the other guests The room was spacious and comfortable and the staff were so helpful and friendly Would definitely recommend and we will go back on our next trip to Paris
