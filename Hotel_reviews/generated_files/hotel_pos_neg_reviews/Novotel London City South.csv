210640,Novotel London City South, I did not prefer the bathroom When we took shower the water will spill out That means we have to be more careful at the lavatory , One room is enough for four people The staff will come to your room to manage the sofa bed 
210641,Novotel London City South, Long walk to the end of corridor furthest from lift when hotel obviously not full still availability on websites , Comfy bed large walk in shower all you needed for a short break when you are out all day sightseeing 
210642,Novotel London City South, The room was not prepared for the expected number of guests In fact we were expecting a 3 people room but were allocated to a double room with additional folded up bed There was no towels or toiletries for three and glasses and cups were not in the room In general not much space for three people and lack of attention to the detail and guests comfort We needed to ask for a steam room and sauna to be turned on after finding out that they were completely cold when we turned up to use them We needed to ask for dressing gowns and slippers as they were nowhere to be seen , Staff were very nice
210643,Novotel London City South, The bathroom was a wet room and the whole floor flooded when we had a shower we had to soak up all the water with the towels It left the floor really slippy which was dangerous , Good location 5 mins walk to the tube Also really close to borough markets Hotel room was nice 
210644,Novotel London City South, the Gym is rather small bathroom in the room also small , modern and airy hotel excellent location walking distance to everything shops restaurants pubs museum theatare tube station and yet very quiet Comfortable bed Friendly helpful and enthusiastic staff breakfast had lots of variety all fresh delicious and replenished quickly Also a must try are the sweet potato fries chips from the bar 
210645,Novotel London City South, location good with access to city but abandoned at night and not very safe feeling Bleak , staff helpful location to train and bridge access for city 
210646,Novotel London City South, The buffet is the same every day They make their scrambled eggs and bacon in a very unnapealing manner and there is no station to request them as u like Near a bus line but multiple changes always needed , Staff are very helpful and speak multiple languages The decor of the room is unique 
210647,Novotel London City South, Not keen on the open plan washbasin Makes the room look very untidy with wash bags etc Would only stay with family would have been very uncomfortable if staying with a friend for example getting out of the shower and reaching for a towel can only look glamorous in films ,No Positive
210648,Novotel London City South, Unfortunately we didn t get to sleep in the hotel on the second night , The staff were excellent and on the night of the third some were up all night with the problems caused by a nearby incident The local area is normally very safe 
210649,Novotel London City South, The a c isn t very cold At all And no pool, The location was convenient and safe Easy for the train and bus Restaurants and pubs and coffee all close by Hotel was good Clean quiet Staff was helpful and friendly Nice bath products as well 
210650,Novotel London City South, The fact that my family and I have checked in to our room resting and out of a sudden someone else opened our room claiming he checked in to that room as well This mistake is not acceptable although the staff has apologized They assigned 1 room into 2 different guests ,No Positive
210651,Novotel London City South, Nothing to dislike as it was indeed a pleasant stay even though , The bed was comfy and the space within the room is sufficient for our family The design is modern and it s clean The bathroom has a good space and my kid loved the bath tub of course The location is great We could go on foot to tower bridge etc It s next to the mind boggling Borough market despite the unfortunate incident The underground is near and we could travel further conveniently Staff were helpful 
210652,Novotel London City South, As always breakfast is too expensive , Mainly chose this hotel for its location which is excellent for the City and Southbank and also for the West End No complaints 
210653,Novotel London City South, Breakfast choices not great More fresh fruit and yoghurt selection would be great Dining room looks tired and dull, Clean spacious room with great view of the Shard
210654,Novotel London City South, Basic accommodation Clean but nothing special Room was small very crowded Staff converted sofa into a bed without being requested Asked that they convert it back Fire alarm in the middle of the night ,No Positive
210655,Novotel London City South, We were in the bar area having a coffee soft drink with my 6 year old son It was only 8 OOPM but there were adults in there being excessively loud and using offensive language so we had to move seats Maybe polite notices could be displayed , Staff extremely friendly and nothing to much trouble We went to a London show and were able to leave the car in the car park for a further 8 hours after we had checked out brilliant Room comfortable and price very reasonable 
210656,Novotel London City South, Nothing really , Excellent location if you would love to explore the south band of Thames Tate modern shakespeare globe tower bridge borough market are all within walking distance London bridge station is only 8 min by walk Room is genuinely clean 
210657,Novotel London City South, cost of breakfast, the room was lovely staff were really friendly and hotel was perfectly located for tubs trains and you walk to many of london best sites 
210658,Novotel London City South, Just a personal view having the sink outside the bathroom inside the room felt somewhat strange In fact there is no bathroom as such just a WC and separate large walk in shower Both enclosed , We had a very comfortable stay the bed was good and the room a reasonable size We liked the Nespresso machine and the view of the City It s easy to find and has good parking 20 for approx 24 hours a rarity so close to the City It s really close to Borough Market Tate Modern and buzzy Flatiron Sq with bars restaurants and street food 
210659,Novotel London City South, It became difficult to check in when wanting to pay for my room in cash I paid 230 for one night for a Superior Premium Room with Queen Bed and Sofa Bed when we arrived the room wasn t like the photos that are advertised for that specific style room and we had no remote for the tv our sofa was made up into another double bed So had to put it back into a sofa so we could relax on the sofa And once asked about more tea coffee facilities the receptionist said it wasn t there issue that s for the house keepers job so will have to wait till morning Plus the fire alarm went off at 07am Once rushing to get dressed and outside the hotel to be told false alarm and should go back to our room Not very good at all The breakfast was included in our price but there wasn t much food left when we arrived at 10 30 quiet a lot needed re filling up Over all quiet a disappointing result , The location was good but we had to use our phone maps to find the hotel from the tube station as not really many directions to the hotel 
210660,Novotel London City South, 1 The shower was poorly made the water kept leaking into the bathroom creating a serious flood 2 Even though the advertised checkout time was 12 the cleaners started knocking on the door quite early in the morning,No Positive
210661,Novotel London City South,No Negative, Helpful staff with my early arrival before going for meetings Location next to the station and other public transportation A perfect example of business hotel by Novotel nothing more nothing less 
210662,Novotel London City South, hard beds slept 3 in one bed as the other bed was an opened couch but paid whole price as a bed , Extremely friendly staff good wifi close to tube station
210663,Novotel London City South,No Negative, Location was excellent and the staff were extremely polite friendly and helpful I was driving so the on site parking was very useful and reasonably priced at 25 a day in comparison to other hotels London that have on site parking which costs around 35 to 45 a day 
210664,Novotel London City South, Upgraded to Executive room A really weird contemporary design with open plan facilities offering little or no privacy Would definitely be better for a single occupancy Pointed out that safe did not operate and a bedside light not working but they were not rectified , Location ideal for attractions on the South Bank 
210665,Novotel London City South, At 9 30 am we were woken up with a male staff coming into our room with his key He was obviously the cleaner I managed to get up and alert him we were in the room He apologised and went I complained to the staff on check out but they just said that the staff have no way of knowing whether people have checked out of their rooms or not Unbelievable in this day age with all the technology Anyway it s no excuse as check out is not until 12 noon so they should have checked then We hadn t got to bed until 3 30am from our night out so when he appeared he woke us all up and that was it we were awake angry to say the least When I complained the staff offered us a free drink in the bar I refused as we were on our way into London and a free drink does not make up for the lack of sleep What was turning out a great stay ended up as a disaster , The location was perfect as we were on a night out at the Shard Room was great for 3 of us and the hotel gave us cakes as it was my daughters birthday Everything was great until 9 30 am the next morning 
210666,Novotel London City South, Breakfast was overpriced, One of the most comfortable hotel beds I ve slept on The room and bathroom were a great size with lovely view of the shard Few minutes walk to London Bridge station which was very useful 
210667,Novotel London City South, The cooling system in the room did not work properly When booking a taxi for us the staff booked a private taxi without a meter that had a smell of sigarette smoke and that that wouldn t give us a proper receipt , Nice and spacious room nice breakfast Location 
210668,Novotel London City South, Little far from Station It makes you little tired with small kids and suitcase , Clean room with 2 bed one is normal another is sofa bed It is suit for my family 2 adult and 2 kids Good price It is difficult to find the hotel 4 people in one room with this price and place 
210669,Novotel London City South, Sat nav left us a few roads away from the hotel so we had to ask for directions , Excellent quick booking in as we were running very late for a theatre visit 
210670,Novotel London City South, Breakfast was not as good as in other novotels Also there was a thumping constant noise during the night Some sort of water pump Location is perfect ,No Positive
210671,Novotel London City South, the sofa bed was really dusty and dirty and the room was a little bit crowded with the sofa bed as well , the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was very clean 
210672,Novotel London City South, The sofa bed was less comfortable , The location suited our needs close to Tate Modern and Bankside walks Pancakes for breakfast was a nice touch Good that you can steam up the see through bathroom window for privacy 
210673,Novotel London City South,No Negative, Breakfast room facilities also they gave us a free chocolate muffin for our sons birthday all nicely presented in our room on arrival and free drink tokens for the bar for the birthday celebrations Pina colada is really lovely 
210674,Novotel London City South, Room service food menu was very poor only 2 sandwiches available cheese and pickle and tomato and nothing else Quite surprised for the price we paid Would definitely have paid for room service if there was a wider choice so it was quite unfortunate , Sauna and steam room facilities were a good treat 
210675,Novotel London City South, The rooms were quite warm and any adjustment in temperature control did not help did not really have any convenient takeaway places that we could find for an easy dinner, the reception staff were very friendly 
210676,Novotel London City South, This is simply information for others rather than criticism with the password free WiFi they have my device wouldn t let me access the internet which wasn t helpful business wise Luckily my partner s device wasn t so particular and we were able to get what we wanted done but had I been alone I d have had problems , The location of this hotel was just perfect for our trip and we were able to combine business with pleasure because of it We were given an executive room which was extremely comfortable A really good size working area and a great bathroom An excellant quality bed black out curtains made for a refreshing sleep and the self service breakfast was great value with a good selection of hot and cold foods available This was our first trip to a Novotel hotel but it definitely won t be our last 
210677,Novotel London City South, Unfortunately due to my cat being really ill requiring feeding v small amounts every 2 hrs the hotel would not allow us to postpone our visit no empathy whatsoever ,No Positive
210678,Novotel London City South, The comfort of the bed, The staff were friendly and we had a snack at the bar area which was lovely The view from our room was lovely The only fault would be the comfort of the bed 
210679,Novotel London City South, There was construction occurring the next morning admittedly after 11AM but we had to leave the room quickly as the noise was giving us both a headache , Fantastic staff and room they even put a complimentary bottle of wine out for us to celebrate our recent engagement 
210680,Novotel London City South, The heater was not working properly There was no possibility to raise the temperature up to 21 degrees in the room Most probably the heat switcher was not working properly ,No Positive
210681,Novotel London City South, The Shower is such that the whole of the bathroom gets inundated with water which apart from being inconvenient is quite dangerous, Helpful staff good room location for a person with walking difficulties
210682,Novotel London City South, Bed was a bit harder than I m used too, Staff were fantastic all very approachable and nice They gave our daughter a toy which made her day Location was superb and the new refurbished rooms are great 
210683,Novotel London City South, The toilet in our room didnt have a working light, The room was really modern which was lovely the bed was comfortable the shower was amazing some hotels ive stayed at dont have powerful showers that dont heat up hot enough for me but this shower was lovely staff were helpful and polite and also late us have late check out The breakfast selection was great 
210684,Novotel London City South, The shower was a little see thru , The people working at Novotel we so friendly and helpful the hotel was beautiful and the room was comfortable The gym was really nice and the breakfast was great 
210685,Novotel London City South, Breakfast was average but overall fair value for money , Very friendly helpful staff Immaculately clean room with Comfy beds Spacious bedroom a modern bathroom 
210686,Novotel London City South, It seemed a very generous act to upgrade us to a suite Unfortunately the bedroom wasn t as good as a queen room and the huge lounge area was cold sad and grey Maybe the suite was awaiting refurbishment , Convenience for Shakespeare Globe Being upgraded to a suite but 
210687,Novotel London City South, The way the staff behaviour in this hotel was disgusting and will never visit here again We paid exactly the same as other paying guests but because me and my friend weren t dressed in a suit the hotel staff totally ignored us This was just the first of a bad experience The first morning we sat down for breakfast and the staff immediately told us to move so that a table could be made for a family which requested a table made for 6 I m not sure why the family was better than us but this is the way the hotel staff made us feel Working in a high end retailer I train my staff on not to judge customers and this is what this hotel did ,No Positive
210688,Novotel London City South, The room was very nice however the bed mattress was far too hard very uncomfortable we hardly slept in it all night Hotel did not have their own car park run by the hotel next door and was very expensive to park there , The hotel location was excellent walking distance to many attractions Borough market around the corner Will definately return here 
210689,Novotel London City South, Our room was very nice but it was so hot in there could not have the windows open as due to noise from outside Put the air con on but not sure if it was working , The staff were very welcoming and the service was good Breakfast was good went down about 10 am which was a good time as no queues had read comments about the breakfast queue
210690,Novotel London City South, Extra bed single bed in the room would have been nice a little bigger it was more like for a child rather than adult sharing a room with friends, The whole experience was great
210691,Novotel London City South, Although the buffet breakfast was well stocked and produce cooked well and of good quality the mushrooms were a little cold and dry Very Very minor grip , Room was nice and modern cleaned well Staff were friendly 
210692,Novotel London City South, The breakfast was awful not a great selection to 16 each , I like the room was pretty good Was my hubby birthday and they bring a brownie to the room so they were pretty kind 
210693,Novotel London City South, Didn t want a big breakfast so didn t feel like paying nearly 17 for coffee and croissant Plenty of places nearby for a quick bite , Location was perfect for the wedding we were attending and family lunch the next day The room was comfortable pleasant temperature and relatively quiet some inconsiderate guests coming in around 2 30am spoilt it 
210694,Novotel London City South, The glass walled bathroom Don t leave the curtains open on a weekday when the adjacent offices are occupied , Comfortable room a good breakfast and very fast checkout Perfect location for Shakespeare s Globe and The Menier Chocolate Factory 
210695,Novotel London City South, The reception staff were not helpful The Wifi did not work for over 24 hours which impacted my work The staff did not take it seriously Slow and did not keep me updated As result I checked out early they did not bother asking why I was leaving early or even say thank you for staying with us Do not stay here if you are on a buisness trip Also the design of the room is awful the toilet has no sink You have to walk through the room to get to the bathroom I will never stay herr again , The room service staff were great The cleaners were kind and professional 
210696,Novotel London City South, The breakfast was really bad and disgusting I gave up waiting for a bit of bread a queue of people waiting for pancakes to cook Everything was fried for too long Hash browns were rock hard mushrooms hard it was so greasy only negative point about hotel was a shame , Staff were very friendly and helpful room was nice and comfortable shower was good Easy checking in and out and location was good 
210697,Novotel London City South, The only problem was that the drain for the shower had not been installed at the lowest point of the bathroom Consequently the water gravitated to the corner of the bathroom beneath the washbasin and spread all over the place from there We had to use all our towels to mop up the water and the bathroom floor was extremely slippery and dangerous , The breakfast was really nice and the staff were all helpful and friendly 
210698,Novotel London City South,No Negative, this is an excellent hotel ideally situated for sight seeing Lovely clean rooms and the staff so friendly and plenty of t hem We would return here 
210699,Novotel London City South, Couldn t fault the place or the service The only comment perhaps was the layout of the breakfast bar It was the usual central London hotels milling around experience although plenty of helpful staff to offer guidance , Without doubt the staff Hotels can be clean and offer great locations and all that you would expect but the staff can make or break a visit The staff here were exceptional we had reason to contact reception a couple of times and everything was dealt with quickly and to our satisfaction 
210700,Novotel London City South, A couple of hooks to hang damp coats on in the bedroom would be useful , We liked the friendly staff and all other aspects of this Novotel We had chosen this Novotel due its location near Tate Modern and the Borough market 
210701,Novotel London City South, The breakfast was cold The room wasn t ready at time requested The room wasn t the standard we expect when paying a lot of money for a night , The location was good and the hotel was near a tube 
210702,Novotel London City South, View could have been better but it is always hit or miss , Staff attention to detail let us check in early with no quibbles gave the kids a little toy very friendly Room was great bathroom was fantastic Great location for what we needed 
210703,Novotel London City South,No Negative, Stayed here for special birthday the very welcoming staff upgraded us to lovely comfortable room excellent breakfast Ideal for Shard Southwark cathedral Borough Market Would stay again 
210704,Novotel London City South, Pillows My husband and I found the pillows very hard unfortunately which didn t make for the most restful sleep however bed was very comfortable , Beautiful rooms and bathroom Very quiet rooms which was surprising considering where the hotel is located Breakfast was lovely with a choice of full English cooked breakfast and continental Would definitely stay here again but may ask for softer pillows 
210705,Novotel London City South, The lack of fresh air in the rooms fresh free water uncomfortable pillows We all had dry eyes and slept poorly as a result of the hot rooms and lack of fresh air , The staff 
210706,Novotel London City South, Shower flooded into room and corridor Nobody around when we arrived late Car park wasn t open There were two of us sharing the room Second bed was poor , Room looked nice 
210707,Novotel London City South, Paid for extra adult bed in room but only a put me up bed not a proper single bed given No extra towel cup etc given for the extra adult had to call reception and ask for it Had trouble every day with the use of Sauna and Steam room either not turned on broken or leaking gave up in the end Television would not work one day had to call maintenance to get it fixed , Clean rooms Staff helpful Conveniently placed
210708,Novotel London City South, The extra bed was not that comfortable and the A C wasn t powerful or cold enough , Service was extremely good and the food was good The room was also quite big 
210709,Novotel London City South,No Negative, clean comfy room good breakfast nice staff would recommend this hotel we were upgraded for my 60th birthday there was champagne chocolates on arrival lovely surprise

210711,Novotel London City South,No Negative, They care about everything They help me with the suitcase and organize to get me a cab The breakfast was very good I will recommend this hotel to my friends and family 
210712,Novotel London City South, 3 bedroom ridiculously cramped and a rip off for the price No extractor fan in bathroom Slow flow of water, Very very little apart from the staff Breakfast fine
210713,Novotel London City South,No Negative, Perfect location near Borough Market restaurants but the hotel is in a quiet zone It is also quite near London Bridge station and near the Tate Modern The staff are superb and helpful 
210714,Novotel London City South, The mattress of the bed clearly needed changing it was very soft and saggy consequently little sleep , Location for the south bank being able to use the river boat rather than underground and taxis also lots of things in walkable distance 
210715,Novotel London City South, price of breakfast very over the top went out to the breakfast club and saved 6 50 each so over 2 days that was 26 saved just on breakfast s come on that s over the top , Room super clean comfortable had lots of items like tv blue tooth speaker stylish bathroom felt pampered 
210716,Novotel London City South, Good breakfast selection A little dry having been left under the heat lamps for too long Car park a little expensive , Location In the heart of London Quiet set back off the busy roads 
210717,Novotel London City South,No Negative, Very clean bathroom with a lovely shower good size rooms and amazing breakfast The check out time was 12pm so gave us plenty of time to have a leisurely breakfast without getting rushed out of the dining room Good coffee excellent cooked breakfast and lovely warm crossionts 
210718,Novotel London City South, Shower didn t drain properly due to the uneven floor which meant there was a cold puddle awaiting us in the morning after a pre bed shower Slightly overpriced but then again aren t all central London hotels , Well situated for South Bank attractions Room was modern and well appointed 
210719,Novotel London City South, It exceeded expectations Well done , Wonderful location for the weekend plus ease of parking Very helpful staff mainly French Used the bar in the evening really friendly with a good range of food WE ll be back 
210720,Novotel London City South, I was disappointed that we would have had to pay 16 pounds each for breakfast on top of what we had already paid for the room We went outside for breakfast for 5 pounds each which was worthwhile ,No Positive
210721,Novotel London City South,No Negative, Bed was really comfy and enjoyed having use of the little gym at the top of the hotel Everything was very clean excellent stay for a one night business trip 
210722,Novotel London City South, The bed was uncomfortable there was a problem with the AC the room was very cold, The location was great fast access to the train and busses the hotel was clean
210723,Novotel London City South, The room was very hot at night even though we turned the heating down , Rooms were very spacious and clean Even got upgraded to a superior room The staff were very friendly and helpful Breakfast was very filling too 
210724,Novotel London City South, Toilet config was a little odd and the WC itself was in a tiny cubicle in the room , Location was great for Borough market London Bridge a short walk for access to tubes etc Hotel was good quiet excellent sized bed massive Didn t feel room needed both a small bath and a shower would have preferred a bigger shower and a bigger room for WC
210725,Novotel London City South, I wasn t keen on the pillows Although there was tea and coffee supplied it was a bit stingy There was only herbal tea supplied and 1 bag of camomile and 1 of peppermint I would ve liked a selection of teas and more of them, Nice room lovely bathroom
210726,Novotel London City South,No Negative, Loved the fact there was onsite parking it was clean in a great location And overall I generally had a pleasant stay I didn t want to leave 
210727,Novotel London City South, Breakfast is extortionately priced Down the road at The Breakfast Club so good and much cheaper , Eric the receptionist is wonderful and all the staff Had a lovely time The shower wall is fun 
210728,Novotel London City South, Some of the food drink prices were quite high I know it s London but we didn t eat there because of this , Babaye was great welcoming us and providing assistance Room was comfortable great beds and had everything we needed 
210729,Novotel London City South, Bar quite expensive could do more to promote offers , Good location Family room big enough for two adults and two kids on the sofa bed Great bathroom and shower 
210730,Novotel London City South, Nothing, Location was great a 5 minute walk to the tube station and just beside Borough market and the Shard The hotel room was extremely clean and the bathroom was extremely modern The room contained Bluetooth speakers which was a nice touch also Staff members were extremely friendly and attentive I couldn t recommend the hotel enough for value for money 
210731,Novotel London City South, Rooms felt dated and run down Could use a fresh coat of paint and a bit of attention to the details Inconveniently placed plugs why no wall plug by the bed plastic cups in the bathroom can t splurge for glass and awkward full length mirror resulted in mediocre stay , Location was convenient and price was decent for London 
210732,Novotel London City South, Lack of tea and milk every day out off the four nights spent there Room extras Ie pen pad non existent , It was good for me as my wife w in Guys hospital having an operation walking distance 
210733,Novotel London City South, I was sold a superior room with glass partition between the bathroom and bedroom and I didn t get that I wasn t even sure if they gave me the right room Can you check for me ,No Positive
210734,Novotel London City South, Staff in restaurant needs a lot of training on Customer service We went to restaurant at 22pm and we were informed that we cannot sit in restaurant that should be open until 23 00 as we are too late As a solution they sat us at the bar which would not be a problem if we would not hear the constant noise of setting up the whole bar for breakfast at 10pm on Saturday night Except one gentelman in the bar I think he was from Romania no one paid attention to us We were the only customers eating and the waitress made us feel like she wanted to get rid of us as soon as possible Our main courses were served together with desserts so you can image our face when we received icream with burgers the same time The excuse was that restaurant is closed It was only 22 30 so it took them 30 min to prepare it They completely missed the fact you could order iceream 24 7 so I m not sure why they could not wait until we finish our mains Food was poor quality too probably rushed to be prepared so staff can go home The whole experience was horrible and we did not go to breakfast because of that Hotel is lovely but now we know the reason why your restaurant is empty on Saturday night We were laughing next day that you can get more friendly service at McDonalds than at 4star hotel restaurant In addition please review this comments as opportunity for improvement I am not a needy customer in fact I used to work as assistant Manager in one of UKs Novetels during my studies and from what I remember it was a high standard restaurant It s a shame this is not the case anymore , Room was lovely Very clean Good location 
210735,Novotel London City South, Nothing , The room was clean spacious and very hi tech The staff had put in a cot for our little boy as requested The bed was very large and comfy and staff were all polite friendly and helpful They all made us feel very welcome and at home We would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here whenever we go to London now Also check out is later than many hotels at 12pm 
210736,Novotel London City South, The electronic door lock on the room the lift doors and the safety deposit box did not work properly Very little storage space limited power points and the doors on the lift and the room operate far too quickly for a disabled wheelchair user to enter No maintenance staff available when needed at night , The location near to where my son and his family now live and the helpful friendly staff Breakfast was good but very expensive 
210737,Novotel London City South,No Negative, The staff at the hotel were first class helpful friendly most of all always being there no matter what the time If they didn t have something at hand they sent it to the room A great hotel 
210738,Novotel London City South, Nothing, On Southwark Bridge approach so one of the quietest bridges in London Bit of a trek from underground Not far from Borough Market which is a compensation Nice sized room and good breakfast 
210739,Novotel London City South, Room was clearly only set up for 1 1 towel etc Bar area was uncomfortable and had a party of 3 swearing drunken guests who were not told to keep the noise down or refused drinks at any point Wifi unusable which is poor for a business hotel, Staff helpful and breakfast was fine
210740,Novotel London City South, This is a really insignificant comment I m going to have to dig deep to complain but here it goes The wall between the bathroom and bedroom is glass half of which is frosted There is no door on the WC so privacy is an issue however on our second night we learned that the small button next to the bath cleverly turned the unfrosted part of the glass wall frosted making the bathroom completely private My complaint we had to find this out for ourselves a note explaining the operation of the button would have helped So there you go that explains what we did t like If that is your only complaint you re going to enjoy a great stay at this hotel , Really good hotel in a great location The hotel has its own car parking unusual for central London Rooms are stylish and contemporary and have everything you need If you don t want budget and want to avoid the heavy costs of 5 stars the Novotel is a perfect fit 
210741,Novotel London City South, Nothing to complain about except maybe the price of breakfast but that is the same in almost all hotels , Car parking at the hotel a real bonus Room was totally refurbished excellent with free water in the fridge 
210742,Novotel London City South, Staff was not fully aware of the terms and conditions of using the car park and kept referring us to Ibis hotel who they shared the car park with The room was relatively small It was quite cramped for 3 adults , The excellent location Possibility to use secure car park Car park is extremely convenient for people who choose to travel to London by car Good value for money nice modern room however a bit too small for 3 adults 
210743,Novotel London City South,No Negative, Arrived to be greeted by friendly helpful staff The room was modern and extremely clean and had plenty of sockets near mirrors The bed was very comfortable The bathroom was a good size with good lighting and had a great walk in shower There is private parking at the rear of the hotel if needed 
210744,Novotel London City South, I booked a superior room and requested 2 single beds for a specific reason and spoke to Booking com and the actual hotel to confirm this On arrival there was a double bed in the room and we were told they did not have any single beds in the hotel at all The room had a put u up bed which was very narrow and hard and was totally unsuitable for my husband or myself Eventually we were offered a larger room with a larger double bed which we felt we had to accept as we didn t know much about other hotels nearby I felt very badly let down by both the hotel and the people at Booking com that I had spoken too prior to booking , The second room we were offered was spacious with a very modern clean and well equipped bathroom There was a good TV and an adequate tea coffee station There were plenty of lights and power points a pleasant bar and restaurant although rather pricey Very efficient lifts and free wifi was a bonus
