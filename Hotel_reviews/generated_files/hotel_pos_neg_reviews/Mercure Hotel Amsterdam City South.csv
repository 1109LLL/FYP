349629,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Toilet smelt like it had a turd festering inside it which wasn t pleasant, Staff member that welcomed us couldn t of been more friendly Others weren t as but I suppose we all have different personalities He made sure we had a room with a view which was very pleasant 
349630,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Jacuzzi had no water in so couldnt use it very tiny menu at the bar and not much option if you didnt want to pay 22 for the breakfast hotel was further from the city than expected do we spent a fair bit of money on transport to central and back twice per day, was clean and staff were friendly
349631,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, A regular shuttle service to the Metro station would have been a nice addition , The room was relatively spacious and well equipped The location was very handy for the Metro station which gets you to the centre in 10 minutes 
349632,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, It doesn t have any good restaurants or groceries shop close by , The staff were really friendly and gave us useful information about public transport As well as tips about where to go in Amsterdam 
349633,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The breakfast already cost too much at 16 Euros each However this was a discounted rate When they tried to charge me more upon leaving at the normal price of 22 Euros I complained and they applied the original discount Beware you captive to the breakfast charge as there is nowhere else around unless you go into the city centre , THe view from the 15th floor on the skyline of Amsterdam in the distance The craft beer in the hotel shop 
349634,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South,No Negative, A lovely new hotel in a slightly out of the way part of Amsterdam We were pleasantly greeted at the door and made to feel welcome and comfortable Happy to recommend this hotel 
349635,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, There is nothing bad to say from my view but some people may find the rooms dont live up to the same funky style as the hotel reception Also the location may not suit people who prefer being in the city centre surrounded by various amenities , Staff we helpfull and pleasant Rooms were comfortable and clean and the air conditioning worked well There is a sauna and steam room but we didnt use these If you enjoy cycling there is a lovely 30km track in a rural part of amsterdam close to the hotel You can hire the bicycles The hotel is located in a quiet and less built up part of the city which we found nice as it wasnt noisy at night It is a 10 minute walk to the Overamstel metro station which makes it very easy to access any part of the city It is also 2 stops from the Zuid station where you can get the train to Schipol airport 
349636,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, We requested room not to be cleaned as per invite in our room as stayed for 2 nights As this is good for environment we agreed to this Received a voucher for 5 euros as reward for this but this had to be spent in hotel bar Due to a problem with trains on day of departure we arrived back at hotel later than planned and asked to buy a bottle of water to take on journey to ferry Were advised could only purchase a glass bottle at bar for 5 euros which could not be taken from bar I asked if I could spend voucher in hotel shop and buy a plastic bottle but was refused Very unreasonable as I explained our circumstances to staff and still was refused It s a shame as room and hotel were both great and staff very helpful until this point ,No Positive
349637,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Nothing close around the hotel eg Shops restaurants shop on hotel is very expensive last time I came the room I stayed in had a full fridge of drinks and was topped up every day this time the fridge was empty and really dirty couldn t put anything of our own in there bed is really hard and uncomfortable , Lovely friendly staff couldn t do more to help you around the city nice decor rooms shower is really cool TV with loads of different channels and free WiFi
349638,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, you can not do hotel check in by yourself so you have to wait to be served if you have any queries simple questions such as asking for direction you have to queue after the check in line and wait to be served Regardless so the hotel staffs are ery friendly , I like the open plan hotel lobby
349639,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, A little bit out of town but fantastic metro system , Sun terrace comfortable beds nice view of the canal from room efficient clean relaxing taxi to metro in morning
349640,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the train station and hotel does not have a regular shuttle to train station People with disabilities will have to plan accordingly , The hotel is on a canal and a short train ride from Amsterdam Central 
349641,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Our hair dryer didn t work, The staff were very friendly although the service was a little slow at the bar and the shop All staff spoke very good English and were very helpful with any questions we had Beds were very comfy and black out blinds were amazing 
349642,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, I called down to reception on the first night to see if they were still doing food I was told I could get pizza from the bar for 15 and this was available any time When I went downstairs to get this I was then told I would have to use a takeaway as the oven has been turned off I pointed out I was told it was available any time to which the guy agreed to make me a pizza which took 35 minutes to cook by which time I was falling asleep The ironing board had some mysterious pink marks on it which ended up being ironed onto one of my white shirts The clear plastic chair had some very mysterious stains on it and bits of cannabis and tobacco thus it hadn t been cleaned On the second night of the stay I used the restaurant I arrived at 9 20pm and waited around 15 minutes to even have my order taken It was taken and I waited patiently for my food The food was ok but when I asked for a pudding I was told the kitchen is closed never before have I been refused a pudding during a meal I am already sat down to and having already been served a main I took this as being very rude and very unheard of in my opinion I believed it was courtesy to finish offering the service to those who are seated within the time frame I also had a privilege room which seemed a bit small in my opinion When the location is taken into account I feel it is overpriced for what I received I needed to be close to Amsterdam RAI however we were about 1 mile away which was good but it was very far out from everything else , I really liked the breakfast there was plenty of selection and everything was very fresh and replenished very quickly The check in was exceptionally fast and the gentlemen was very friendly and efficient I also liked the novelty of the rain shower this is something new to me so I did like that 
349643,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, A little far from the city however train was very convenient with just a short walk to the station , Very clean and comfortable All necessary amenities Great coffee maker I the room Also free water and other drinks daily left in our fridge Fitness centre and sauna was excellent 
349644,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The shower was clogged up and we could only have 3 minute showers before the water would spill out the door The air con was very poor and we was sweating all night We went to the restaurant and they didn t take any notice of us We was served very slowly and we only got noticed because a family came and sat on the next table , How up to date the hotel was 
349645,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Nothing, The staff was very nice the room very clean they gave us a better room than the one we booked because they made a mistake with our reservation but I am very happy 
349646,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, On the last day of our stay we have realised there is a bicycle and scooter rental at the hotel Also we didn t know there is a ferry from hotel to city centre Quite possibly it was just our oversight but possibly this could be advertised better This leaves us no other option then book our next stay with you in nearest future so that we can cycle around beautiful Amsterdam and also take a ferry to city centre ,No Positive

349648,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The receviing staff were not friendly and least helpful abrupt not willing to give more details to assist us when we checked in We waited for 1 5 hours more after the time promised We were offered drinks only from the bar for service recovery , Spacious room for three persons 
349649,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, industrial surrounding one had to travel to the center to sit in the cafe or buy food, The hotel was really good Considering the price it was perfect The personnel was very helpful and welcoming They were always there and did their best to assist us for example print something out or show us the easiest route to get somewhere Each morning we had a nice long breakfast what was very convenient as we could come at 6 30 or have a late breakfast at 9 30 and even after it was over we could remain their as long as we liked Concerning the room service I would like to say that they most time managed to clean the room while we were out or having breakfast This way they did not bother us at all Despite the industrial surrounding the hotel was 5 minute walk from the metro station and had a nice sunny terrase overlooking the canal 
349650,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Quite long walking from the nearest Newrest Metro Station Free shuttle timing is very odd and not flexible , Our room was upgraded with free mini bar though non alcoholic drinks only 
349651,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, There wasn t anything I didn t like about the hotel my only issue was the distance to the centre Taxis where available at all times outside the hotel or the metro which was about 10mins walk from hotel to station , The hotel is lovely staff are friendly and very helpful hotel clean and spacious Didn t eat here as we were out and about whilst we were there therefore unable to comment on food 
349652,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Wifi was free only with a poor connection For a good connection we were asked to pay 9 99 , I did like the river view from the back terrace and that I could enjoy my breakfast watching the river 
349653,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, After traveling all night they didn t try to get us in earlier that ck in time Hotel was away from everything only service was to metro one hour a week no shuttle no restrauants close Had pizza service in room only not menu in room Tv did not work tub would not hold water for hot bath reading light over bed would not work We were too tired to call maint wait plus we did not want them in room while we were out,No Positive
349654,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, An airport shuttle and the restaurant and shop was quite expensive, The dinner was lovely but expensive and the room was comfortable The train station was very easy got to and easy to use 
349655,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The towell service they only gives you one set per room you have to request more, Location it is in an area that gives you the opportunity to see the whole city and their different aspects
349656,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Bit further out from the centre as expected but with the metro 7 minutes ago was ok, Great Hotel clean and modern Rooms lovely bit warm but better than being cold 
349657,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Ha ha cost of living in Holland, Checkin time is 2pm Coming from Asia this is late by comparison We arrived at 9am but staff let us use the gym to have a shower 
349658,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Room was rather hot Was noisy even on floor 16 hours to sleep with window open More tea coffee and real milk rather than coffee creamer powder in the room as complimentary drinks would have been much better Decaffinated tea at breakfast please , The triple room was excellent value three large single beds very comfy Hotel reception were friendly and helpful giving local advice and direction Bathroom facilities were clean and towels changed daily Views from room and lobby were excellent Breakfast was varied and a wide selection on offer 
349659,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Nothing , It was a superb hotel Staff were very helpful and with metro a few hundred metres away was so easy to get to City centre which was 7 minutes away Would definitely recommend it 
349660,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Totally understaffed bar and restaurant and no alternative restaurant in this remote area I had booked subsequent 3 nights but in 2 steps and the invoice system and the hotel computer system were not equipped for such a situation despite same name and credit card Mistake in breakfast invoice too , The kindness of the staff at the reception and the design of the furniture in the reception area
349661,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, I would take the location of the hotel into account Although there is a metro stop not too far away from the hotel we ended up taking taxis most of the time As a taxi is going to run you EUR 25 30 to from the hotel you should factor this into your costs , The hotel is very nice with large rooms and good sized bed The breakfast buffet had an excellent variety of foods available whilst the food in general is also very good There is also a nice little shop onsite for those midnight snacks 
349662,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Nothing at all was bad , Excellent staff excellent room excellent bar excellent location The theme here is excellent The Hotel was out the way of the city however it wasn t too far at all and for the reasonable price of the rooms it was so worth the out of centre stay Highly recomended this was my fourth visit to Amsterdam and this hotel was by far the best hotel I ve stayed in 
349663,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South,No Negative, It is difficult to reach to hotel by the nearest metro station that is overamstel They have very limit hour of free shuttle from the nearest metro station No taxi is available from overamstel metro station We have walk down with all luggage and KID from overamstel metro station to hotel total distance is almost 2km it was very much painful no private taxi available at overamstel metro station it is far away from Amsterdam Central station one way cost is Euro 40 
349664,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South,No Negative, Staff was amazing Restaurant staff was friendly Food at restaurant is of very high quality though a bit pricey Location by the River Amstel amidst lots of greenery was superb Morning jog by Amstel was an incredible experience Truly loved our stay 
349665,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Location very far from city centre and the nearest train station is a good 10 min walk and a secluded station at that , Very comfortable clean rooms and great helpful friendly staff They arranged for the canal cruise they printed directions for us and they offered us complimentary drinks if we didnt need our rooms cleaned which we didnt coz we were hardly in our rooms 
349666,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Not so critical but you can increase cheese types in breakfast and may create extra value and awareness for your customers with more outstanding and catchy breakfast Customers would like to see more differantiation with simple items in their hotel stay , Mini bar in the room and surprise sweety are nice Rooms are quite clean and comfortable Check in out are fast This hotel is a quite nice facility close to train station I will stay again if I visit Amsterdam again 
349667,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Bar staff were quite rude to my partner he s diabetic and asked for some water one of the male staff looked in my partners bag as he opened it and saw cordial in there then accused him of making his own drinks First of all he shouldn t be looking in other peoples belongings secondly it was our last day so yeah we had been shopping and got a few things thirdly what happened to innocent until proven guilty My partner did nothing wrong and made to feel like a common criminal He explained his condition to the member of staff but he just walked off very childish and unprofessional I think the male member of staff needs to find a new profession because he clearly doesn t know how to deal with the public or complaints , Nice hotel clean reception staff very welcoming and friendly
349668,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, room too small breakfast too expensive i preferred to take breakfast outside far from CBD so needs hourly shuttle to city center only two in the morning, bicycle perfect staff very friendly helpful i like the lobby decoration
349669,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South,No Negative, Great location out of the city centre but very close to the Metro for easy transportation into town amd other locations All the staff were friendly and helpful Room was spotless bed was extremely comfortable restaurant had great food Buffet breakfast had a huge selection and was worth every cent Absolutely wonderful hotel

349671,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South,No Negative, Bed was really comfy staff were so lovely evening meal was excellent s easy to get to from any train station on the 51 orange line for the metro About 10 minutes from central station Loved the morning transfer canal boat into central and the tour guide was great Brilliant value for money and so so modern Will definitely be back 
349672,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, empty minibar at disposal to the guest far from the city centre older rooms but clean , friendly staff very good restaurant solid bar wifi accessible everywhere departure of boat to the down town directly from the hotel nice view on south part of the city 17th floor 
349673,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The AC did not work the first night which meant a sweaty evening This problem was fixed by cleaning the system and resetting the cooling level and providing a fan After the first sweaty night we asked for the sheets to be changed but that didn t happen on the 2nd day there Ultimately they were changed The staff responded well but we had to be persistent Overall the staff did a great job We had two rooms for two couples and both AC systems had to be fixed , It was a good breakfast generally but the scrambled eggs were not so fluffy 
349674,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Not much around the hotel, Taxi rank out front or short walk to metro station so good for transport to the centre Staff are very friendly and helpful Rooms were nice and clean
349675,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, we must spare much money in credit card because the hotel take guaranty so much we stayed 2 night with 3 room they took euro 2200, Friendly staff comfort room and nice bathroom
349676,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South,No Negative, One member of staff was lovely very accommodating the rest didn t really bother steam n sauna are liacated on first floor considering this is a family hotel which kids attend naked men should not b allowed to walk about first floor scratching there backside in a 28 year old woman and I was put off several times from going to first floor to use the facilities due to this please ask men to wear speedos or something to cover them self 
349677,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Nothing to do around the area Seemed a bit isolated but a lot of the big chain hotels had a hotel situated around the same area , Staff at check in were very professional and gave all information needed The 24 hr shop and staff was excellent and had delicious choices if needed for snacks or dinner in your room Regular Train service handy to city centre after short walk to station Special offer of breakfast hotel for 16 
349678,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Check in very slow and I personally didn t like the islands rather than a desk where staff met us Although room was great it wasn t what we needed and we couldn t give up the upgrade for our original room as it was been given to someone else and hotel was full Bus shuttle to train station only runs for 1 hour in the morning and only 2 boat taxis in the morning no way to return by boat I felt that this was misrepresented in hotel information , The staff in the restaurant and bar were very good and helpful We were upgraded to a Privilege room which had good points and bad points see what we didn t like The food was limited but very good and not too expensive in the restaurant and breakfast was also quite good 
349679,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Nothing couldn t fault anything, We didn t have breakfast at the hotel as we prefer to eat out and wander about Very nice hotel with helpful and friendly staff Very clean and comfortable room
349680,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South,No Negative, Very easy to get around as near to a tram station but far enough out to get a good nights sleep with kids Very helpful staff and a steam room to boot 
349681,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, If I was returning I would look to book something a bit closer The journeys in and out although straightforward did eat into the short time we had , Although the hotel is out of the centre of Amsterdam it is easy to commute on the metro The staff are very helpful the hotel is nice and modern We got a free upgrade to a privilege room which was nice as we were celebrating a birthday 
349682,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Only downfall to the room was the air conditioning wasn t cold enough we had it at 5oC and it was still very warm in the room , Although not very central it was only a short walk from the metro station and from there we could easily travel to the centre of Amsterdam Tickets for this were purchased at reception One of the most comfortable beds i have slept in Staff were helpful and friendly 
349683,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The food is a bit pricey, Staff were very friendly I booked a double room with a double bed for my wife and I but on our first night we were given a twin bed The manager was very helpful and although we couldn t get another room on our first night we were upgraded and looked after for our 2nd and 3rd night Great views over the city
349684,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Rooms stuffy had to ask for fridge to be put on coffee tea very poor when available no proper cups only plastic ones room not cleaned each day only beds made had to get extra towels glasses not allowed in ur room long distance into main town bit misleading as said 15 mins when it was more Charged taxes when already paid staff very slow when booking in manager very rude to customer when waiting in que staff on their phones when went to the bar for a drink , Lovly food helpful staff easy to get to rooms nice place to sit outside walking distance from hotel to shops nice view
349685,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Booked a double bed but was given a twin room Hotel were fully booked during our stay so it didn t seem worth complaining was too tired but beware Room was generally clean but the carpet was clearly very old heavy worn and needed to be replaced some years ago Similarly the window did not close properly some road noise and the air conditioning was largely ineffective , Don t be put off by the out of city location This hotel gives very easy access to the city a quick and easy walk to Overamstel metro station as well as fairly simple access to from the airport train Schiphol airport Duivendrecht metro Duivendrecht Overamstel meaning you can do the airport transfer for approx 8 EUR per person vs 50 EUR taxi that booking com offer you or a 30 EUR Uber The 5 EUR bar discount incentive for skipping a day of maid service is a nice touch and should be adopted by more hotels I also recommend the boat transfer options that are offered daily leaving the hotel at 08 45 and 09 30 it s basically a 1 hour canal tour for only 6 EUR per person Pleasant outlook overlooking the canal though not much to see out the window Rik was really nice and helpful on check in and gave us a lot of information for our short stay in the city including a map with the location of the metro lines etc The bar staff in contrast were not quite as welcoming but we only went once and didn t stay there long 
349686,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, the welcome greeting was somehow strange there was a women at the entrance who first of all asked you all kind of stuff before you could get to the check in counter i had the feeling i was checking in a military bootcamp because of her way she approached and asked after that we did a pre check in 11 00 we were told the room will be ready at 14 00 early check in was not possible later when we retourned we got the keycards only problem was that they werent working so we had to get down again they rewrote the keycards and we tried again we could now open the room but there was already luggage in the room and it was only 2 bed room instead of 3 beds which we booked so we had to get down once again to the reception after that we were told that there was a mixup with the room after that everything worked out and we finally got our right room , nothing really that stood out working fridge on the room was a little plus i usually have bad luck with those restaurant was a little bit on the pricy side never the less we tried it out and were pleasently surprised about the good food Burger Chicken Filet Tagliatelle 
349687,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The shuttle service which is available only from 8am 9am and the 7 minutes walk away from nearest metro station , Friendliness of staff Very helpful people and the comfortable room
349688,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, But for the price I expected more The gymarea was tiny the sauna was just average Paying more than 200 Euros per night room should be enough to get more value Even for Amsterdam Also I missed the employees telling you about the hotel and the facilities Where to find them working hours To be honest I wouldn t recomend the hotel if you could get one with similar equipment for a similar price , In general the hotel was OK Clean Breakfast was fresh 
349689,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South,No Negative, We apreciate the easiness to get to the hotel from the airport and the very good connections with the city center The staff is very helpful we could leave our luggage n the storage room until the hour of checking in because we arrived earlier and after check out because our plane was n the evening There is a little store in the hotel from where one can buy something light to eat salads fruit yoghurt sweets juices and beer The room was clean We enjoyed n the morning and evening the pleasant walk to the metro station The surroundings are safe 
349690,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Quite far from everything 8 10 min walk to the metro but nothing interesting around the hotel It is an industrial business park area , Clean hotel with excellent wi fi signal Good breakfast but the same each day and also quite expensive Fast lift to the upper floors I would recommend this hotel only if you benefit of a good night price 
349691,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The location as described on the website was not correct The room was too hot woke up most mornings feeling a little stuffy , The breakfast was great and the staff were very polite and extremely helpful The room was spacious and comfortable 
349692,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South,No Negative, The staff could not do enough for us they were all so helpful explaining how to get around and lots of tips In the day there was a lady at the bar what a delight So helpful and kind thank you 
349693,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Metro was about a 5 min walk One of our party was on crutches so not always easy No bars or restaurants in immediate area but apparently about 10 mins walk Sadly we didn t get to these due to our friends mobility issues However food was so good in the hotel and staff so lovely we were happy to stay where we were , Extremely helpful and friendly staff Nothing was too much trouble They gave us directions to various places and were always helpful with whatever query we had We ate in the restaurant a couple of evenings and the food was amazing Breakfast was very good although we felt it was a little pricey 
349694,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Metro is close by about 7 8mins walk however would be great if hotel could provide shuttle to the metro on the hour especially during cold season, Hotel reception staff was very welcoming helpful and informative especially Rik Short walk to restaurants and supermarkets 
349695,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Nothing interesting in immediate surroundings of the hotel Just some business warehouses , Clean room and bathroom comfortable bed helpful staff Location is not the problem if you don t mind walking few minutes to Metro station then it s just 10 minute ride to the center of Amsterdam 
349696,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, hotel is located a bit far from the happening places so was not convenient to take the metro every time we wanted to go to amsterdam center plus you need to walk to the metro station which is at approx 7 min walk, Cozy hotel looks new and relaxing atmosphere rooms were nice and clean friendly staff and always willing to help the area is quite so good for business travelers
349697,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The bar does not have anything to eat after 10p m There is any restaurant near the hotel , The bedroom has very good conditions good bed very clean view to the river and so on There is a mini market Stach inside the hotel excellent yoghurt you can buy something whenever you want it is a good alternative if you arrive late at the hotel 
349698,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, No where near the city centre so you need to walk about 700m to the metro to catch a train into town also a pain if you have a lot of luggage and coming in from the airport as it s a long bumpy footpath We checked in early and had to hang around and wait for our room then they forgot to come and get us for about 30 mins after check in time ,No Positive
349699,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Breakfast could ve been cheaper I d have loved to take advantage of it but 22 per person is a bit steep Other than that nothing, After reading other reviews I was a bit sceptical I was worried about the distance to the city as that s what most people seem to complain about however i believe they re talking a load of rubbish It was so close A 5 minute walk 10 at the most if you re walking slowly to the metro station whereas other reviews stated it a 20 minute walk then a short journey on the metro to the city It did not take long at all I found it very convenient I had a room on the 8th floor lovely rooms and very comfortable twin beds Also went to a concert at the ziggo dome the hotel was in good proximity to there as well easy public transport 
349700,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Old fashioned Furniture in suits, Very comfortable suit though with a little bit old fashioned furniture Good breakfast cheese sausages vegetables eggs crumble muesli brasserie etc Services are excellent You can buy tickets to metro at the reception book excursions to Amsterdam regions of Amsterdam and other cities Brussels Brugge 
349701,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The room is a little small for me my wife and my 4 years old child But we managed to sleep comfortably , We love the breakfast various kind of foods provided My child enjoyed staying here
349702,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South,No Negative, Big comfy bed great shower got an upgrade when we arrived thank you Nico who was really friendly and helpful as were all the staff and the 24 shop downstairs was a nice touch the hotel is easy to get to via trains and metro Would stay again 
349703,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, We didn t stay longer , Honestly I cannot rate this hotel any higher Already booked to go back Don t let the distance from the centre put you off we paid 13 euros for unlimited tram Get the 51 from the centre to Overramsten walk 3 min down the road and your at the hotel Its 5 s I think personally Worth every penny and more 
349704,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Taxi drivers from the city centre to the hotel valued at 30 Euro in the evening so best bet is definety invest in the metro card like we did was easy and efficient and only a short walk from the hotel, Large room with a good bathroom clean and fresh 
349705,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Parking was a bit pricey for the location in the outskirts of the city bathroom sink did not work to be fully honest I didn t alert the staff most likely they would have fixed it , Staff was helpful and friendly restaurant was good easy to get to the city by train subway
349706,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, bed sheets and towels were few and small could go with more pillows and king sized bed was hard also room was supposed to be sound proof but could hear freeway traffic at night, room was generous by Amsterdam standards and dark and meal downstairs was good babycot was good quality with comfy mattress instead of the usual travel cot so toddler slept well before the long haul flight home
349707,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, If you are a gym fanatic the gym area might be a bit disappointing The hotel is 10 minutes away from the Metro station but we knew that from the begging I would not call it a minus , The hotel staff was lovely and really helpful The room had a nice view to the water canal There is a lovely indoors bar and restaurant Drinks and food can also be served outside on one of the two terraces One of them has a lovely view of the water canal The rooms a cozy and really nice decorated The spa area is also lovely and pretty well equipped 
349708,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South,No Negative, Lovely hotel and the staff were really friendly and helpful We were visiting to celebrate a 30th birthday and they upgraded our rooms for us which was a lovely gesture Breakfast was brilliant and they catered well for a gluten free diet 
349709,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, There is no one staffing the shop so we were left waiting for service House keeping did not change the cups in the room , The bed was really comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful We had booked a double room but when we arrived we were given a twin room which suited us better We found the little shop very handy It is easy to get to the hotel from the city centre less than 10 minutes on the train I would recommend this hotel 
349710,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, We booked a double room but we were given a twin for two nights and a double for one night The hotel compensated with free drinks vouchers and a free breakfast They advised if we booked directly and not through booking com this wouldn t have happened I believe room allocation could be improved ,No Positive
349711,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Stayed for four nights but never took breakfast as felt it was overly expensive at 16 Euros per person Little disappointed with the bar staff not particularly friendly or helpful When we booked our travel tickets we left an open credit card in case we booked anything further which we ultimately did not Upon departure we were told our tickets would be processed and that would be that However on checking my bank statement the hotel had billed me for our stay despite the fact I had paid everything in advance I phoned the hotel who confirmed they had made a mistake and the money would be refunded within a few days five days later I am still waiting , The front desk staff were all excellent We were able to easily book rail train passes through them Pleasant hotel for the price we paid Small hotel shop had lots of good products 
349712,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The breakfast was extremely over priced and also the 24 hour snack bar was ridiculously priced especially for a simple bottle of water , Just out of the city centre and on a morning you can get a canal boat into the centre for a fraction of the cost of a canal tour and the metro was only a short walk away too so very accessible 
349713,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, that our break was too short perfect hotel perfect staff, The hotel was utterly excellent perfect location with a very short walk to the train station and then a short 15min hope on the train into the centre of Amsterdam The hotel staff could not have been more information and helpful from the reception staff to the bar and restaurant staff and also the cleaners our room was cleaned and immaculate each day Nico on reception was a real star on information of where to go in and around Amsterdam and organising our bike hire The hotel has bike hire on site and the bike were brand new and very good price for 24hr rate we managed to cycle for 23miles around Amsterdam and so easy to start and finish at the hotel The food was excellent and breakfast you could not have wanted any more all freshly prepared and refreshed when empty and a huge variety on offer There is nothing at all wrong with this hotel its staff food or location utterly perfect on all fronts The only thing wrong is the utterly idiotic comments guest have made on previous reviews about having to walk the very short distance to the train station unless you have disabilities issues for goodness sake you are staying at a city hotel where you are visiting a city that you will walk around it took us no longer than a 10min slow stroll at worst to reach the station then hop onto a train and 15mins later you are smack bang in the centre of Amsterdam jeez you may as well stay at home if you can t walk that short distance get a grip people this is a cracking hotel and a great value could not ask for more
349714,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, A bit far from the center but a 5 minute walk from a direct metro station to the center , Great staff very healpfull the 24h food shop was good since in the surrondings there is nothing 
349715,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Reception staff was not so helpful We wanted help with luggage since we travelled with a toddler and They wanted 4 per bag to carry that to the room One reception guy was behaving with a such an attitude Their system was out at that time and we had to sit and wait for nearly one hour for the keys No tea cups and spoons in the room No adapters to borrow from the reception they were selling adapters , Shower room is good
349716,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, We booked a room with a double bed but got two single beds It was a Classic room reception told us it could be either format and singles was all that was left Not good enough , Excellent double shower room 
349717,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Not really an issue but as a tea drinker the tea was terrible BTW this wasn t just in the hotel , The hotel was far enough from the centre but not too far This meant it was not noisy at night 
349718,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Housekeeping not great Papercups in bedroom and powdered milk why Yuk , Modern hotel exceeded expectations from photos and reviews Nice shop in foyer for snacks helpful staff We bought metro tickets from reception as well as river boat trip from hotel which is well worth it for money and experience
349719,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Required an extra pillow which I never got also lost English channels so reported this never got this sorted went two days with lost channels, Good location for the hotel and to the metro
349720,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Part of staff was not polite We had to wait long for the service at the bar or at the internal shop The hotel rooms were too old and no worth the money for what they offered No facility offered by the hotel to get to the city centre or at the airport Just one bus shuttle that would get people to the closest metro station only once at 8 45 The towels were not white at all the hairdryer was too much used etc , The hall was nice 
349721,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The rooms werent ready on arrival which was a little inconvenient to us Then our rooms were not together not even in the same tower block You had to return to the lobby then get a different lift to their room We didn t like having to drink out of paper cups that were provided in the room Ours was a triple room and my parents had a double On comparison their room was modern and better equipped than our triple room And we didn t like to look at the empty drink bottles that someone had left outside the lift area near our room These should have been moved sometime over our 3 night stay , The staff were very polite and helpful We didn t eat in the restaurant but it looked pleasant We enjoyed having welcome drinks on the terrace due to our room not being ready The beds were comfy and the room was clean It was only a 5 minute walk to the metro and the links to Amsterdam cental and other areas were good 
349722,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The temperature and no fan available Moved rooms but made little difference Still no fan Accidentally left some clothes behind in first room and these were not recovered , The room was clean neat and pleasant quite spacious despite 3 single beds Beautifully made up each day 
349723,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South,No Negative, We enjoyed the hotel even with the travelling to from the hotel to the centre of Amsterdam We did not go for the breakfast as we thought it was expensive Lovely hotel would definitely go back caught the train from the airport just make sure you have euro coins as some machines will only take coins or debit credit cards 
349724,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The gym was very small The sauna and steam room were not in operation you had to request switch on from reception Also we found the bar and restaurant quiet expensive A glass of wine was 6 compared to restaurants in the center which were charging around 4 50 4 95 Also the menu was very limited We did eat there the first evening but it was just ok The quality did not really reflect the price charged We did not stay for breakfast as they were charging 22 which was excessive We had tea or coffee in our room and then headed into the center were we started our sight seeing for the day , Our check in was very pleasant the gentleman who checked us in was very informative He provided a map and made sure that we were well informed regarding local metro sites to see and places to eat He offered to book any tours which we would like to experience He also gave us a leaflet with general information his name and no On arriving in our room we found that it had an unpleasant smell I am guessing the previous occupant had been sick However with one phone call we received an apology and we were immediately moved to a second room exactly the same very clean and comfortable but without the unpleasant sent The hotel offered an incentive which I had not come across before They offered 5 to be redeemed in the bar if you did not want to avail of staff tiding the room As we had arrived in the evening there was no real need Also some people prefer to just leave there belongs out and know that staff will not be entering the room The hotel also had a small shop to where you could pick up drinks and snacks or a sandwich 
349725,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The hallways and meeting areas were not kept clean enough Pizza boxes stacked neatly in the hall were left there for two days And removed after I mentioned it , Staff was very friendly Location near the conference RAI building City Center a train ride away or a long walk 
349726,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, booked for 2adults and 3kids but ended up choosing between either staying in two different floors or two twin rooms on the same floor absolutely pathetic for family,No Positive
349727,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The spa facilities The sauna was not working and was not as good as I was told , The staff could not be more helpful Would defiantly recommend to a friend and will be coming back The bed was amazing and couldn t of asked for more 
349728,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, An indoor swimming pool would have been the icing on the cake , We stayed for three nights staff was very helpful We had a meal on the first night and it was very good The breakfast was very nice with plenty to choose from The children rated the hotel as the best one they have ever been to And we travel quite a bit 
349729,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The room was very hot even when the air con was on all night only one normal tea bag that didn t get restocked next morning, The staff were very friendly and were very knowledgable about the location The shop with snacks came in handy when you was a bit hungry It was a perfect location not to far from the centre and nice and peaceful at night time 
349730,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, There is a short walk from the metro to the hotel but only a hindrance when carrying luggage, A very comfortable hotel with spacious rooms and an amazing view if available ask for a room on the 18th floor Lovely service staff are very helpful with any needs you may have 
349731,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South,No Negative, Lovely hotel and not that far from the city centre which was a concern initially but it s only a 5min walk to the metro station from the hotel then 10 15 mins to the centre Room was lovely very clean and comfortable with a nice shower The staff were friendly and helpful Will definitely stay here again the next time I visit Amsterdam

349733,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Cost of breakfast and bottled water, Lovely big clean room breakfast a bit pricey but very nice Good location just 8 min tram to the center but far enough out to also be relaxing
349734,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, We were given a single bedroom even though we booked for a double Staff said they were over booked which didn t seem fair that we had to suffer for it It would have been ok if we were offered free breakfast as it wasn t our fault they over booked , The beds were comfy and it was a great place to relax after being busy in the city 
349735,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The hotel was a bit too far away from the centre 20 mins on the metro and the room windows were facing the motorway which was noisy in the mornings, Super helpful staff and very nicely decorated rooms
349736,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The location was a bit far but the 7 8 minutes walking to the nearest Metro as advertise is accurate Took us longer on arrival as we had a lot luggage to drag from that station but it wasn t too bad For room temperature control somehow only the heater can be turned on at nights and air cond during the day Not sure whether this is common to all hotels in this country One night it was a bit too hot thought we could turn on the air conditioning but only heat came out Opened the windows instead until morning , The room was big for our family of 5 Our 11 and 12 year olds slept on the sofa bed and our 8 year old on the additional extra bed which fitted the room without making it too crowded A young Portugese chap from housekeeping was so helpful in setting up our bedroom upon our arrival and made our 4 days stay here more enjoyable The staff at the reception were all so friendly and helpful We thought the location is good if you are planning to rent a car which we did for 2 days This is due to its location just beside the highway as well as ample street or hotel parking available Walked to Sixt rental to collect and send car which took 20 mins 
349737,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, No balcony We are smokers and had to go out of the hotel if we needed to smoke We stayed at the 11th floor , Nice view Great staff Clean Good breakfast Good restaurant Coffee and tea in room King size bed very cozy

349741,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The hotel itself is in the middle of mild industrial car dealerships warehouses area The metro is a 10 minute walk which isn t too bad and only a few stops to the city or to the airport but don t expect there to be any life outside the hotel itself ,No Positive

349743,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The prices were quite high for beverages at the little shop, The room was amazing bed was very comfy staff was helpful and the facilities were very good
349744,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Price of breakfast is very high at 22 50 per person during weekdays The location of the hotel is also quite far from central station I would have preferred a hotel closer to the main part of the city A day ticket for the metro is 7 50 so it can get quite expensive if you re staying for a longer period There is also nothing in the area of the hotel so travelling out of the area is a must in order to eat or purchase snacks the ones in the hotel shop are very limited and the restaurant menu is quite pricey and also limited , Room was lovely Ample space and a huge bed It also had a bath and hairdryer

349747,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The hotel has two sides A B Only the A section of the hotel is renovated We initially had rooms on side B which were really not great plus everything smelled of cigarettes However it was no problem to switch to side A Nonetheless this is something to consider should the hotel be fully booked , The Mercure is comparatively cheap is conveniently located approx 15 minutes into the city center by cab and airport and has a good breakfast buffet 
349748,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Room was very warm and air con seemed to make it warmer , Fantastic customer service and a gorgeous hotel even in the rooms which were a little bit older Arranged a surprise cake for us with only a few days notice it was delicious It is slightly out the way but a taxi doesn t cost that much and it s only about a 10 minute walk to the nearest metro station 100 recommend

349770,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Only thing to improve which I see is the size of the standard rooms and more international TV channels however this is really not very important , Everything was really great we enjoyed stay in the hotel and all the facilities very much The breakfast was also pretty good and tasty Also would like to mention that a hotel administrator named Jonis was really professional helpful and very hospitable so a special thanks to him he made a great impression on us at the beginning of the trip

349777,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, At breakasf items like cheese bacon would run out and it was never replaced or maybe later but not swift enough I overheard some customers really annoyed about no bacon for example The bar closes very early for a hotel 2am would be normal enough , The staff excellent rooms comfy lovely seating area shop great idea

349792,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, At the time we arrived their system was down and we had to wait for about 2 hours till we could check in , Everything was great The hotel is 10 minutes away from metro station and it s just by the Amstel river We had a room at 10 floor with an amzing view The stuff was friendly and very helpful The room was always clean and the bed really comfortable 
349793,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The room we got wasn t as shown in the pictures It wasn t as nice as pictures It said we would have a bath and shower but we only had a bath which doubled as a shower Not great rooms for a four star hotel The location wasn t great as we had to get in and out from town using the metro but and was 25 in a taxi , The lobby was very nice and stylish and the staff were friendly and helpful 20 minutes away from the centre 10 minutes walk to the metro and 10 minutes on the metro in

349795,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South,No Negative, Staff were brilliant and couldnt have done more Location is amazing as only 10mins from local metro Room and Hotel was generally top class Would recommend to anyone 
349796,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The onsite shop was a local business but only sold what I would class as fancy drinks there was no just plain Pepsi lemonade everything was flavoured The cups in the room were paper cups rather than proper mugs in a hotel this nice we excepted a proper mug Also just Amsterdam in general there was no milk for the tea powdered creamer was available instead gross , The view from our top floor bedroom was breathtaking The bed was extra big and comfy great value for money Very smart hotel with very helpful staff There was always someone there to help us The hotel was close to the metro system so very easy to get into Amsterdam also very easy to find the hotel from the station there was even a sign post at the metro pointing you in the right direction which was just one straight line 
349797,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The location is a far from center metro station is quite near 750 meter 8 10 min by walking at evening time nothing to do at hotel surroundings, Room is very organized well and all is tidy and clean Rest rooms and shower is extra clean and shiny coffee machine with espresso capsules cool drinks for free 
349798,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, There was one particular staff that could have had better customer service I should have remwmbered this lady said name But overall the staff were friendly and helpful ,No Positive

349801,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, A free shuttle service to the Airport and having child carrier chairs on the bicycles they rent would be just perfect , The family room is large and perfect for a family of 4 with children under 10 years No noise from adjoining rooms or exteriors They rent bikes right there very recommendable option to visit the city You can even reach the center by walking about 45 minutes Staff always willing to help The food was excellent It breathes a comfortable atmosphere and the facilities are new 
349802,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, I think that breakfast is a little bit too expensive We paid 16 Euros for a person We took it just one day In the other days we ate in the city It is a buffet with everything you need but you can eat better in town , First the room it was super We had one room at 11th floor with riverview The reception staff especially Helena was nice and helpful They give you all the information you need The hotel is 7 minutes from Overamstel station With 51 Metro you are in 10 15 Minutes in the centre of Amsterdam Also the airport it is just 15 minutes away I really recommend it 
349803,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, They couldn t find out booking at first which caused some stress amongst the group Which I feel was unneeded , The hotel was great excellent quality for the price we paid

349821,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Stayed in a privilege room on the 10th floor which was a box very cramped Hate to know what the standard room was like because the upgrade is definitely not worth the money which they advised is usually an extra 30 a night They also advised there would be extras on the room for all of the inconvenience caused during booking When confronted about this as there was nothing in or on the room they gave us a pack of waffles Won t be booking again , The front of house staff were pleasant

349901,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Hard to say I do not want to complain here as our stay was great and room was clean every day If you really want to ask me what I will change I have a general comment for all carpet hotels I will change the carpet in rooms It is much more clean to have wooden floor or something which is not carpet like as I assume that you are not cleaning it every month Nothing special happened to ours but just as generic comment , Very helpful and kind personnel everywhere in the hotel Nice breakfast with a lot of choices Price performance Good options to travel from and to Amsterdam city center With a bit of planning even a good connection to the airport using train metro combination Also good selection of goods in the local mini market very nice to have it

349903,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Far from the center We needed to use both metro and tram The staff was not friendly Hardly answered our questions We did not receive explanation about transportation and the possibility of purchasing a 4 day ticket which we realized by chance and appeared to be an excellent solution for this particular case Many essential items are missing in the bathroom For late check out we were requested to pay 20 Euro per hour whereas our friends at the same day received late check out for 10 Euro per hour in 4 start hotel in the center of Vienna , The hotel is clean Free wi fi
349904,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, 1 Absolutely dirty windows everywhere in the room in the coridors 2 In a double room only 1 small shampoo and even this small pack was never renewed until it is finished 3 NO SLIPPERS which is absolutely unacceptable when we asked on the reception the stuff member at first promised to bring us slippers but then after half a day of not doing it we asked again and got an answer that for our room it is not provided Which sounds very weird because slippers is so very basic hygienic thing 4 Very poor working lift with the system when you have to activate it with the key from the room , Breakfast was good
349905,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, the area is kind of desolated some industrial buildings around no restaurants shops etc you cannot open the windows but there s an aircon of course , reasonably close to metro about 10 minutes by foot which takes you to the center pretty fast also some 10 minutes not more convenient and fast access to Schiphol by metro train foot we had a 3 bed room which was quite spacious nice and clean breakfast was excellent children under 12 had it free of charge 
349906,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The last night we had a charge of 90 deducted from our account and after speaking to the staff on check out we were told this was for breakfast despite not eating any Apparently this is what their system does it ll deduct the money and refund you in three days I was not happy with this and had it refunded that day apparently you have to request it be taken off of your room to not be charged , Hotel had everything you need easily book transportation tickets with them free taxi to the nearest metro and a free boat ride was the icing on the cake

349917,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The distance from the train station to the hotel is a downside it is very difficult to get to the hotel especially when you have luggage I also think the signage can be improved as well from the station I got lost and ended up on the other side of the canal , Rooms were great nice and very modern World class
349918,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Didn t like that the sauna and steam room werent on asked a member of staff waited 15 mins but nobody came to turn then on , The canal so close to the seatting area staff always helpful

349945,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Location and surroundings such a nice hotel in a dull area the distance from the city was a bit of a pain, Size of bed and toilet facilities were excellent staff were very sweet too 
349946,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Located out of the city in an industrial area with almost no business activities , Lovely hotel next to river Amstel Comfortable and clean Excellent staff service 
349947,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, not so much to do in the direct surroundings of the hotel unfortunately At least the metro isn t so far away , the breakfast is really nice with a lot of choice 
349948,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, They blocked 200 euros on my card after check in which was ok Before check out in the morning they blocked 100 euro extra without any notification Then on check out they charged me another 200 euros When I called hotel and asked to release my 300 euros they agreed but as result they released only second transaction 100 euro For the rest 200 euros I had to wait for 2 weeks when money was released automatically I did not want to call them again and spend time money for expaining situation again Another not pleasent thing was after check in we were brought into really dirty room with some fungus next to the window After complaining they switched the room pretty quickly , The stuff was very friendly all the facilities we required were in the room 
349949,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Drainage in bathroom sink and bathtub sluggish in our room 1231 23 to 26 Cab ride each way to downtown Centraal Station so you know building was not exactly close to general places of interest , Staff very friendly and professional Views from corner room 3 windows were great Was a treat to sleep in traditional height beds Metro station was about 2 blocks away 
349950,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Dirty Sock in the corner of the room which was there on arrival and never taken away despite daily cleaning Location is poor for travelling tourists metro 15 minutes so hard to just pop back to the hotel and then taxi at night as it was another 5 10 minute walk from metro to the hotel, Bed was comfy very quiet area
349951,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Tried to charge us 625 when we had booked our 3 night stay as 370 The maid that cleaned are room was awful Staff wern t very helpful when we asked questions regarding amsterdam and travel Then on check out we asked reception how much for taxi to airport in which they said 35 euros when we got to the airport the driver charged 45 euros and was very rude when we explained that our hotel said it was 35 ,No Positive

349956,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The room were were supposed to get was not the room we got on arrival which was very dissapointing why would you put a picture of a room that you are staying in and then on arrival get a completely different room very unprofessional The food menu was the same everyday which was questionable to wonder if it was fresh would of thought for such a nice hotel might have different choice of food menu everyday Also the TV did not work in our room but didn t bother us much , The sauna and steam room were great to have in the hotel The staff at the bar were really nice and helpful also some of the staff at the check in area were really helpful also We arrived on an early flight and the staff let us check into the room earlier than the usual 2 pm which was great The one good thing about the room was the view we had of our room was spectacular at night looking out towards the city

349962,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South,No Negative, I thought the hotel was beautiful The bar and seating area is lovely They ve really made use of all the space First impressions were really good when we were greeted with a lovely member of staff to check us in It is a business hotel but they have 5 floors of rooms which are out to the public privileged rooms as they call it The room was lovely was a little small but there was only 2 of us so wasn t a problem Cleanliness was good We stayed for 3 nights and they tidied our room every day We had a really good shower it gave us an option to have the water head as normal and we also had a shower that was on the ceiling too which wasn t ideal for a woman when they don t want to wash their hair hehe But was still good because I could just swap the option and use the other shower We didn t go for the break fast but I m sure we wouldn t have been dissappointed Over all we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend to anyone Business or couples Definitely live the life of luxury in this hotel 10 10
349963,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Expensive breakfast not so near from central part just 10 min walking from nearest metro station but very expensive if you take a taxi it s far from all the stuff I wanted to do , The bed and bed clothing was GREAT Leave one day to rest haha The shower was great too and they gave us all the drinks in the mini bar for free D
349964,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The shower tended to flood and the room was a tad small as the bed as it was huge took most of the room, Staff very friendly very welcoming and the facilities were wonderful
349965,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The shower drain was not functioning properly and that was a problem Staff was notified but the issue was not resolved , The staff were very helpful and happy at all times The restaurant provided wonderful customer service and the breakfast was good The location was more on the industrial side and there was a beautiful lake with havr benches available to sit on Very peaceful lake area The metro was about 15 minute walk from the hotel The room was quiet so you can be ensured a good night s rest 
349966,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, My room was not renovated and the carpet was visibly old and the smell of stale smoke still lingered from who knows how many years ago, Great breakfast and friendly staff Many nice lounge areas in lobby
349967,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The room given to us was not similar to the shown on booking com for standard room type The look and feel of the hotel was below the image given on booking com or their internet site Additionally the walk to the nearest metro station is too long it s not 5 mins as said or 5 mins when walked quickly Being dependent on a train and then on subway to reach the city centre was not very convenient for us aswe had to purchase two separate types of tickets Also on bookking com they say that the hotel offers a boat transfer to the city centre but this turned out to be having a stop in front of the hotel for the city cruise line which you can benefit with a paid ticket But the word offer indicates that it is on the house This was a a big disappointment to us , I liked the variety of breakfast served for long hours from 07 00 until 11 00 
349968,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Nothing hotel was abs perfect Fifteen mins on metro to centraal Last metro back of a night was just after twelve so be careful Taxi bk from central was 25 Taxi from airport was 45, The huuuuuge bed an really helpful staff

349970,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, We had to pay another 8 9 euros at check out for City Tax which was not mentioned before Only one bathrobe and one set of towels although it was a double room and we book for two people A bit industrialized and empty area There was no shop in the area The Cycling Sauna Fitness centre and Hammam are a joke Sauna was approximately ok but for 4 star hotel it is not enough All of them All were old small and unattractive The metro stop Overamstel is a 6 minute walk from the hotel maybe if you are Usain Bolt there were at least 10 12 minutes , Nice bathroom the bed and the room overall was ok 
349971,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Sent email ahead explaining that we would be arriving one day late on a pre paid 6 day booking Was very annoyed to be told by check in staff when we arrived that we were regarded as a no show from the hotels point of view All sorted in the end but not very proffesional, Great ambiance and restaurant
349972,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, There wasn t anything I didn t like , The staff were helpful and friendly The hotel and the roomswere very clean The rooms were also very comfortable and warm 
349973,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South,No Negative, The room was very cozy and the window had a great view to the city The common rooms of the hotel have all a nice decoration and aspect and the staff is always ready to help you The hotel is at 5 minutes walking from a metro station The metro time till central station is about 10 minutes 
349974,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The breakfast could have been enriched by more traditional Holland made cheeses which I only noticed only two of them , The hotel and the room as well reflects the Mercure standards at a glance Easy transportation thru tram to the centrum 
349975,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, The neighbourhood si pretty empty I had no other options than having lunch at the hotel restaurant Towels were thin and seemed very old Shower box was big and had 2 showers the bigger and coolest one though had the problem that would make the water leak from the glass door flooding the bathroom Highway very close so still a bit noisy even with windows shut , The hotel was clean and overall comfortable I liked having a small selection of teas in the room other than the usual black tea and instant coffee 
349976,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South,No Negative, Excellent hotel immaculately clean lovey bar and food helpful staff I would just say that it is a little outside of the city centre We used the hotel shuttle bus which was a few euros Mostly used taxis which was about 25 Euros
349977,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Once I have checked my bank account I was surprised to see extra charge of 165 euros for a rent of two bikes 16 16 euros and two boat trip 7 5 7 5 euros total 47 euro Nice stay for 3 times surcharged services I have found in the room an welcome for other person , First impression was good and I was supposed to give a very good feedback because the plase is quite have bikes interesting boat trip

349981,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, I did not see anywhere that breakfast cost so much Bar I was excited to try Dutch bites and sample beers Hardly no one in there once I received order no one came back you sample beer to determine which one you would like a full glass frustrating that service was so poor if it where busy that would be one thing Never even received a napkin and the Ditch bites where oily Solo travelers need the same attention as a group as I typically tip good for good service , Room location ok
349982,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, A little too far from town but just around the corner from tram line which is reasonably priced or great boat taxi , Wonderful staff couldn t have tried any harder food very good wouldn t know about breakfast as was extortionately priced which was a shame they have everything right and i am a perfectionist

349985,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, My wife and I both thought the location was a bit too far out of the city We often went to the city square therefore a taxi journey was required 20 25Euros for one direction was alot There is a shuttle service but only Friday and Saturday Presume this idea came in to play when reviews began saying the location was far away , Hotel was surprisingly very well kept The staff helped us with an early check in as we arrived at 9am We even used the canal service that was available

349987,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam City South, Beds were made but the linen was not changed How early the boat and bus were returning to the hotel we were unable to see Amsterdam by night The extras on the TV did not work , That they accommodated for being so far away from the city centred by providing a bus and boat for 5 euros Clean towels everyday
