62875,H tel California Champs Elys es, Staff way of speaking their was no air conditioning in my room hat to speak with them several times to change the room after changing the room the next room was also with bad air conditioning so finally at the middle of the night i had to change my room for the third time, In the hotel acctually nothing
62876,H tel California Champs Elys es,No Negative, fantastic stay the staff has been very helpful there is a small and beautiful courtyard the restaurant is also very good with good service champs elyees and metro is just within 1 min walk 
62877,H tel California Champs Elys es, It was so hot in our upper room we paid extra for a duplex that none of us could sleep up there The bathroom which was upstairs was like a sauna without any bath or shower turned on We complained several times but were not given another room or a discount We only used half of the room downstairs with a family of 4 sleeping together on a pullout couch bed since it was too hot to sleep upstairs One of my sons even slept on the floor It made our experience very uncomfortable and no one at the front desk cared I called many times stopped by asking for a room change so upset I was crying DO NOT STAY HERE IF IT S HOT WEATHER IN PARIS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THEY ADVERTISE AIR CONDITIONING IT DOES NOT WORK , Bathroom was great with a nice shower and large tub Bell staff was very friendly They have a nice lounge restaurant on site 
62878,H tel California Champs Elys es, We are only just getting used to the fact that in France you rarely if ever get offered a facecloth in the bathroom Facecloths are provided in most hotels around the world Finally went out and bought one to solve the problem Otherwise thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the California Hotel , This was the first we d stayed in Paris to close to the main attractions and we loved being able to walk to many of the sites we wanted to see We had breakfast on the Champs lys es each morning walked to the Grand Palace for the Rodin exhibition walked to the Tuileries and the Louvre etc You see so many little extra slices of Parisian life this way We asked for a quiet room and were rewarded by one the back of the building looking out onto greenery The room was compact though very comfortable 
62879,H tel California Champs Elys es, We had issue with our toilet flush the first night but they didn t have maintenance personnel to fix it They offered to move in different room but we were with our family and wanted to be on same floor When asked they said someone will be there to fix it first thing in the morning at 7am so we decided to stay in our room Morning we reminded them 4 times no one showed up until 11am It was very frustrating Also another incidence happened We had booked Rideaway from airport to hotel We planned to go too palace of Versailes the sam day after checking in We talked to the same driver and he agreed to take us of 120 00 round trip So we asked him to wait Upon checkin staff mentioned that they also have transportation available and it will cost 160 So we decided to go with the driver who brought us We wanted to freshen up so we went to our rooms Mean while my husband told them we will go with you guys and let other driver go But I immediately went down to tell Staff not to make any change and let the other driver stay backs we committed to him first we will go with him I got a call after few minutes in my room that we let other driver go and you can take our driver I wasn t happy with this They should have not interfered Staff said we settled with him and took care of him They should have not done that , Very good Location Staff was friendly Hotel was clean

62883,H tel California Champs Elys es, nothing really, the staff especially the very kind receptionist who gave us early check in which is something very rare to happen in Paris at least from my experience with other hotels The reception lady decided to give us the room because we were really tired from our long journey 
62884,H tel California Champs Elys es, Check in staff was aggressive check out staff was okay The hotel was not clean at all It was an incedinet and the staff moved my room to a jenour suite The Cheif refused in an aggressive way to help preparing a special order for my family as they are allergy from some items , Only staff Not even all 
62885,H tel California Champs Elys es, Breakfast was horriable I did not had option to eat as i dont eat dairy food like cheese even after having package with breakfast was told if you want fried egg you have o be paid Incase if i visit paris and stay there will not opt for breakfast , Location is great and staff are helpful Hotel is maintained very nicely and clean

62891,H tel California Champs Elys es, It was quite costly and they didn t do anything nice or extra for our anniversary like I had asked I mean a free coffee rose petals or cheap bottle of champagne would have cost them next to nothing and made our stay that more special They also did not honour the price from Booking com so be careful , The location is great walking distance to shops and restaurants The staff all spoke English and were very helpful The lobby was elegant but the rooms a bit small and outdated 
62892,H tel California Champs Elys es, Based on price it wasn t worth 164 as you also had city tax on top wich comes to nearly 170 no parking had to pay an extra 30 for parking Iv definately stayed on better hotels with an suite for 100 max plus we had to buy everything on top breakfast lunch or dinner if they were included on that price I would say yes it would be worth it but it wasn t , Was very close to city centre shops and attractions and eiffel tower

62898,H tel California Champs Elys es, The check in staff were very close to being rude No charm at all Felt like we were treated as a nuisance rather than valued guest Kept waiting for 30 mins even though it was 4pm and we had been advised by booking com we could check in early Likewise check out was equally poor Asked if we could check out late as advised by booking com we could subject to availablity When we requested this were told no message had been received fair enough but the answer was still no until later I showed my booking com email and then they said yes and we should have showed the email Which made me feel they simply didn t believe me the first time I asked Bottom line is for a 4star hotel I feel we were poorly treated A pity as check in day was my Birthday and not even good wishes were forthcoming Will find another hotel next time , Location is great and the hotel is comfortable for a city break Breakfast was fine not great eggs were cold but overall just about okay

62919,H tel California Champs Elys es, Breakfast was not included and costed 20 euro I went for the a la carte option thinking to save a bit on this but should have thought again I agreed with the hostess I d tell her what I d get from the buffet and she d calculate it for me So I ordered fried eggs for 7 euro and took a coffee and 2 slices of bread For the latter she charged me hold on to your seats 11 euros She told me she couldn t charge me differently as she could only charge me for a full bread so I had to pay 11 euro for 2 tiny slices of bread All together it was 23 euros so the next morning I was a clever boy again and just went for the full buffet for 20 euro What a scam though even in Paris , Very proper hotel to Parisian standards but as with all hotels in Paris I find also this one overpriced But at least you get something in return Located on a sidestreet of Champs Elysees is
