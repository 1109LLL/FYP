248560,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The only two bad things I can say is one of the staff members waiter was quite rude and didn t understand much English Being in London you think hotel staff would have to know English cannot fault the reception staff though very friendly and very helpful Also we requested a room with a nice view weeks before we stayed and we did not get this but I did not want to complain as its only a small thing and seems silly so in future all I can say is let people who have requested something know you cannot meet what they are asking for , The reception staff two men and a lady cannot remember there names also the location of the hotel is perfect 
248561,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The hotel automatically takes an extra 60 hold on top of your hotel stay which was not mentioned when I booked in case you spent more Because I only wanted a hotel with good location and facilities to cater for a family whilst travelling on my own with two children I thought this was a bit off However I explained this and I offered to pay up front for my stay and they accepted that , Location was great just off Trafalgar square tube near by close to the riverside and close to theatre with a little Tesco next door but one Stayed in family room which had a fridge kettle and microwave so nice to be able to sort a warm drink out on at bedtime and simple breakfast in the morning and of course have a bottle of wine chilling after a long day out and about Staff really friendly and helpful Asked for more pillows as they was only one each and we all like two and they were waiting for us on return 
248562,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, They take 30 extra off of your credit card There is no mini bar This is supposedly refunded in three working days after you have left Imagine how many foreign tourists may not check I will write a review if this doesn t happen View of heating pipes and outside wall , Kitchenette was really handy

248565,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, We didn t really appreciate being on floor 9 as far away from reception as possible when we are both reluctant to use lifts and had to climb 9 floors several times a day Room was smaller than expected with views of roofs Maybe that s London , Comfy bed Great location Seemed very clean
248566,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square,No Negative, I planned 3 days in London with my 12 year old daughter so the location of the hotel was very important for us Its 3 minute walk from National Gallery 15 from London Eye or Royal Opera House We didnt even need to use the tube to Victoria St as its a really nice 40 minute walk by St James s park Also the hotel staff was very friendly and helpfull We will certainly go back there Izabela Poland
248567,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Room bathroom were a bit basic but clean There were renovations being done in the lobby bar at the time of our stay so it was unavailable for use , Location was excellent and room was clean Providing water bottles at fill station was a great idea
248568,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Superb except for 1 minor point my wife who doesn t like UHT milk asked for a small jug of fresh milk for her tea but none was available which was disappointing We will stay again but bring some milk with us ,No Positive
248569,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, slow check in and a lift out of action but these were minor points and staff very apologetic, beds comfortable well appointed rooms perfect location for central London
248570,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square,No Negative, The central location was a great base for getting around Comfort size and cleanliness of the room at a constant pleasant temperature was great Three little things made the stay better 1 The magnifying mirror in the bathroom essential when you are short sighted 2 Availability of fresh water constantly 3 Wi fi was excellent 
248571,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Before helping you at the check in desk they check what room you are in the size of the room determines the service level you will get Asking for some help was not being considered as something to check what could be done but rather as a no interest For a hotel of this level unheard of Rooms rather disappointing Amenities below par , Location is good 
248572,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, A room safe would be a good idea slight pain having to use safety boxes in reception Doesn t stop us going back but something to consider , Always stay at the Grand when we are in London Staff are always pleasant and helpful Rooms Clean and well stocked The effort made for my wife s birthday stay a card a bottle of wine and some sweet treats a gesture well appreciated Well Done
248573,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The double room was very small The lobby was not very grand nowhere to sit , The location was wonderful Walking distance to many attractions museums restaurants and train stations 
248574,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The fact that we were only staying for 1 night , I mentioned when I booked the hotel that it was my Birthday on the date of stay and when I arrived at the hotel we were informed that we had been placed in 2 rooms with great views which was a nice surprise and they also wished me happpy birthday during the check in which was lovely When I got to my room they had left a bottle of wine and some snacks and a little London fridge magnet which I thought was another lovely touch There was also a card wishing me a happy birthday from the hotel management Needless to say this started my visit to London off very well indeed The room was larger than I expected despite only being the Small room as described on the website and the bed was very comfortable I could hear no road noise or noise from other guests at all over night and I was generally very happy overall with the room standard and all it s decor furniture and supplies The shower was hot and very powerful and the complimentary toiletries were of a high standard Check in out was very quick and the staff were cheerful and professional The entrance hall looks great it is shared by the Grand Hotel and the bar and lobby area is beautiful 
248575,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, No bathroom slippers room doors are heavy and closing loudly next door banged in the middle of night at 02 30 , Friendly staff location architecture wifi
248576,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The bar was being refurbished but they had to do it sometime and it will be ready for when we go back again, The friendliness of the staff from start to finish and the location couldn t have been better for us 
248577,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The restaurant was under renovation Having said that there were accommodations made fro breakfast and restaurants are near buy Renovations are a necessity and I know I will enjoy the new facility the next time I visit , The location was amazing from the standpoint of London sights as well as transit options I had a room on the 8th floor and found that it was very quiet for such a busy area The staff were very polite and helpful 
248578,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Bar closed at 21 00 on Sunday night and despite the write up and photographs the club lounge is not available unless you are a member, Fantastic location
248579,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The hotel took two payments from my card and refused to reimburse me Thankfully the bank stopped the transaction Staff we dealt with were incredibly rude and unprofessional Room uncomfortable and outdated, Okay location
248580,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Shame the brasserie wasn t open the pizza restaurant was but it seems to be in the middle of a refurb so we couldn t grab a coffee there but a very tiny quibble as we ate out , The staff were very helpful the facilities provided water and ice on tap additional teabags and milk toiletries thoughtful and useful Magnifying mirror in bathroom Comfortable room with sufficient sockets to charge mobiles etc Good value for location Love Club Quarters 
248581,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Only 1 pillow each on the bed Also the kettle completely siphoned out with boiling water when I first put it on Unfortunately a member of staff with extremely limited English was sent to deal with it and he had no idea what we were trying to explain had happened This also fused all the sockets in our room and our friends room next door , Very comfortable bed and quiet room 
248582,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The reception area was not big enough for the staff A safe fridge and Toilet brush are needed in the rooms, Large room lovely furniture plenty of sockets usb ports etc etc Very quiet and was on the front 
248583,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Room was very closed up no windows paint in bathroom was peeling taps weren t clean and had limescale , The decor was pleasing most of the hotel except for the room we were staying in was very beautiful and luxurious 
248584,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, First of all the room itself double is missing many expected elements There is no fridge which is quite surprising and painful More they provide a big TV which is impossible to look at from the bed ahahah and you need to literally stand in front of it Finally and the most important the room was cold and the heating system did not work The stuff suggested an mobile heater to be installed but the maintenance guy said they do not have one So we got a bit cold and we regretted we took this hotel I cannot imagine myself going there again , Honestly the only good thing about this hotel is location Everything else they provide is far below the value you expect for the money 
248585,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Although impressive looking in the ad we didn t get opportunity to visit the bar as it closed at 9pm, View of Trafalgar Square and proximity to West End for theatre and cinema 
248586,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The hotel is strange The lobby area is beautiful and then you go into the corridors and the rooms themselves and you get a sense they are very tired, Location is excellent next to Trafalgar Square
248587,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Didn t realise breakfast wasn t included in the price but garfunkels up the street do an excellent breakfast , Great location very handy for theatres
248588,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The guy at the check in was great the day after my arriving there was a smoke test at 9 30 in the morning I talked about my disappoint to the woman at the reception and I didn t recive any excuse just this answer it s a test Unbelievable Really sad As a client I don t suggest this hotel to other people And at the check in for each day the hotel pick up from a credit card 30 pounds extra for each day in case of And they will send back this extra fees after a while I don t know how because they didn t get me them back yet but it s not a big deal any way People that goes in this kind of hotel like me knows the good way to live and of course we are going to carry on to the things that are in the suite , The location the top of the top 
248589,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, There s Nothing not to like, Brilliant location oxford street London eye Big Ben within walking distance and 50 yard from Trafalgar Square where there s access to the tube staff where freindly and helpfully and really smart Hotel
248590,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Huge mess up with the bill The reception charge your credit card with your room rate charges plus a percentage more on top in case you apparently break something or charge stuff to your room then when we checked out they charged the card again with charges for dinner drinks from someone elses room The bill is completely non sensical so my advise is check it before you check out , Location excellent for west end shopping Lovely staff Rooms basic comfortable and clean 
248591,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, we were three in the superior family room dust a little bit everywhere no view at all a wall at 2 meters bathroom products provided for one person only only 2 glasses in the kitchen only 2 coffee sticks but great location very helpful staff ,No Positive
248592,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Not specific to this hotel but wish city hotels didn t try to charge so much for breakfast , Very polite staff great location and got it for a great place what s not to like 
248593,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Ironing board and iron were tatty and rather shoddy This was in stark contrast to the other facilities and left me wondering if other areas we being so poorly maintained Simple thing easily fixed would leave a better impression , Good and helpful staff Clean and simple room Decent Shower
248594,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Highly disappointed after a long day off site seeing and getting around London to finally get back to my hotel at 8pm to be told the bar wasn t open to residents, The staff
248595,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Drinks in the bar were very expensive though I suppose this is to be expected for the location, The staff were very friendly and even left a birthday treat in the room for my husband
248596,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Hired side bar area for a private function but other guests ignored the sign and kept coming in we had to keep asking them to leave ourselves and some became quite confrontational We feel the bar staff should have managed this better , Location excellent Lovely entrance interior decor Bedrooms very comfortable and clean 
248597,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Everything in the room is cheap For the price you pay per night you d expect a much higher quality of furniture Will not come back, Perfect location
248598,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The bar staff were slow and the prices very expensive The lifts are very slow , The location is excellent The reception staff were very good and attended to problems promptly 
248599,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Poor bar area not part of the hotel proper so closed to residents by 1030pm Breakfast if extra to your room rate is expensive with cooked options charged on top Be aware this is a tourist area with little local atmosphere in the evening , Attractive building near Trafalgar Square Plenty of tourist spots in walking distance for day time visits Polite staff 
248600,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, the room stink small and uncomfortable air conditioning very noise the price too high for what they offer I will never go there again forget it I brought my girl friend to please her for the wk end and she was very disappointed of the hotel I choose , Susanna at the reception was a great host
248601,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, A disabled room should be for disabled people and if we had accepted that room it could have led to any disabled requests being refused I did ask for a room with a bath but also accept that this is not always possible , Location is ideal for central London and the Theatres Hugo was very helpful and managed to source another room after we refused to accept a disabled room initially 
248602,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Where do i start No air in the room one small window overlooking the concrete shaft No minibar for that money I would expect a sauna in there No toilette on lobby area No sofas or chairs or anything on lobby area There is a restaurant behind the lobby but it does not belong to the hotel and it is embarrassing to seat and wait for example your taxi to the airport there Also there is no breakfast exactly because the restaurant does not belong to the hotel , Location the true heart of London USB input for Mobile phone charger on the wall So i didn t have to use the European to English adapter 
248603,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The sofa bed was not very good sadly, The bed was comfortable Guest request facility is an excellent idea Clean Location is brilliant Staff very friendly and helpful
248604,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The staff One in particular on reception Very rude from the moment we tried checking in to which she rudely and abruptly told us there was no reservation in our names even though I had the confirmation with me right up until check out when she lost one of our credit cards then proceeded to tell us it wasn t her fault Wouldn t stay here again on this basis , The location was fantastic Rooms very nice 
248605,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The check in time of 3 00 is not ideal Also bearing in mind the cost not to include breakfast was irritating So went next door to a lovely continental venue and got a great value breakfast , Great location and presentation 
248606,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Nothing, Staff were so friendly helpful I was taken aback really as we met about 6 and all were so nice Not often the case in a tourist hotspot Location cant be beaten Excellent Cafe Concerto next door 6 95 continental breakfast was amazing Portrait Gallery across Trafalgar Sq free so much to enjoy
248607,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Nothing , The staff in Boyd s were exceptionally attentive and enjoyed a lovely evening there after the theatre Check in was well explained and computer checkout so efficient The wifi and gadgets in the room were great it was so clean and organised We will definitely be back for another stay thank you 
248608,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Northing just having to leave as could only afford 1 nights stay, Location was brilliant Staff were really helpful The room was beautiful It was immaculate
248609,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square,No Negative, Ease of check in using a machine The staff were very friendly and welcoming The room was larger than others we have stayed in in London for a similar price 
248610,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, only problem I have ever had is when the water station runs out of bottles and the remote for the tv , The friendly staff the great rooms my free upgrade I do keep coming back 
248611,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square,No Negative, Staff were well informed and extremely helpful Hotel had all facilities that we required Rooms were compact but held everything we required and was clean and extremely comfortable 
248612,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The view we received from our room 632 was not satisfying We overlooked a building site and it was a disappointment Also the kettle in the room was faulty and dangerous It did not have an automatic cut out This meant the kettle over boiled and the button to turn it off manually heated up drastically as well as the rest of the appliance This should be looked at as someone could be hurt by this ,No Positive
248613,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, For this price range basic room needs are missing like fridge mini bar Bathroom is not up to standard , Location is great Staff are very pleasant and always happy to helpful 
248614,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The bed was lovely and big but not very comfortable or well made I was woken in the night by a lot of noise from another guest No herbal tea in the room , The very friendly reception staff and excellent situation 
248615,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Reception staff attitude They did not seem to know what was going on in regards to our room being ready When the room was ready they did not let us know as promised , Great location near to everything we wanted to do Manager was very polite on the phone and gave us a complementary bottle of wine and snacks when we complained about our room not being ready 
248616,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The reception is unwelcomingly small although almost everyone there were very friendly and helpful which gives an impression that they wish not to be bothered The coffee cups in the room are black coloured So please bring your own cups Because it is pretty sure they only rinse and keep the cups back and not put them in a dish washer , It is right in the centre Many places to visit to eat out 
248617,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square,No Negative, Although considered a business hotel this hotel certainly has a lot to offer in addition to its proximity to areas of interest and sightseeing opportunities The hotel is well appointed steps from Trafalgar Square on the left and a short 2 minute walk to the Thames if you head right While the hotel food can be considered expensive there are several good restaurant options including an Italian restaurant near Trafalgar Getting around the city is easy with Charring Cross station a minute away and many tour buses And if you have to spend time in the room rest assured that although the rooms are not large by American standards they are more than adequate with the bonus of free in room wifi and free bottled water Comfortable for single travelers If sharing consider that the bathroom counter space is lacking Although I didn t have an opportunity to meet Matthew who assisted me in booking I will say that he and all who were at the front desk were really welcoming including house keeping services who I had to arrange a ironing board and iron and who were prompt with delivery In all I would highly recommend this hotel for the overall experience 
248618,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Very small room Small bed Only one tea bag milk per person per day no biscuits No atmosphere we didn t use the bar once, Fantastic Location just by Trafalgar Square and close to everything
248619,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, stayed in Lincoln Fields before Tea Coffee snacks available in lobby for all resident In Trafalgar square none available unless business user Doesn t seem fair, location and size of room
248620,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, We were unable to get our taxi to the door of the hotel on Saturday 31 October 2015 as Northumberland Street was closed to some traffic We were told there was a notice to this effect in our lift which we did not see There was no notice in our room on the reception desk or information from the receptionist when we asked if we could leave our bag Your total lack of regard for older slightly infirm customers was very very disappointing , Room was relatively quiet apart from two metal rubbish shoots despatching waste from floors above
248621,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The taxi company used by the hotel is the worst and most unprofessional we have ever encountered The towels were dirty every time The staff had no clue why we had to put a deposit or even that it s called a deposit nor how to hire a valid genuine legitimate taxi service , Good location 
248622,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Not sure if it s because of the room location about every 30 50 seconds you can hear the underground metro passing by Have been allocated the room right in front of the security door each level has that once ppl access the door to take the lift or enter the room area you can hear the door bang every time Hardly sleep at all till all the ppl go to sleep and no underground , The room provides different cables to connect your device Very considerable Good location very short walking distance to underground and the riverbank as well as a supermarket and nice restraurant 
248623,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The shower didn t exactly match the luxury and the elegance of the hotel , Helpful personnel spacious room excellent location comfortable bed quiet room 
248624,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Bar area closed for a private wedding I understand these events take place but some pre warning during my email correspondence would have been nice so we could have made other arrangements With the bar restaurant closed room service wasn t even available , Staff very warm and welcoming good central location Bilge was quick to find a resolution to our issues 
248625,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Reception area too small Staff need some retraining as they appeared to have a standard script but were unable to cope with a question that was a little different Bed was not at all comfortable and pillows appalling , Being so close to Trafalgar Square making it easier to see galleries etc 
248626,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Wi fi wasn t the quickest , Lovely large room standard queen staff extremely welcoming and helpful beautiful foyer Would definitely stay there again 
248627,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Overall we were very happy I wish there were king sized rooms and also safes in the room, Fantastic location and rooms were very clean The perfect spot for easy access to the riverfront sites and shopping Staff were friendly and helpful I would definitely stay there again and have already recommended to people visiting London 
248628,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Only that the room was a little too hot but not overly uncomfortable , Fantastic central location v close to Trafalgar Square Charing Cross walking distance to Leicester Square Covent Garden China Town Oxford Street etc Great customer service and a warm welcome from Susana on reception V pleasantly surprised as price was exceptional Will stay again 
248629,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Service in Boyds restaurant left a little to be desired Breakfast very expensive for what you get We ate elsewhere after first day , Friendly helpful staff Superb location Great pizza at bianco 
248630,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Had no fault really , Perfect location nice ambiance within good service Alas we could just see the Houses of parliament and Big Ben but they were visible The studio was more than satisfactory very good bedding well appointed although the decor was dull and not very creative had a nice walk in shower Very helpful staff Room service was available from other restaurants so you had a full choice and I loved the architectural elements of the old building it was wonderful 
248631,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square,No Negative, Very friendly staff great facilities on each floor for chilled water extra pillows extra tea and coffee etc Room very quiet and incredibly comfortable bed luxurious bedlinen etc 
248632,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, First room smelled of damp 2nd room had bathroom that smelled of sewage 3rd room was good However no safes in room which meant one had to go down to re ration to place things in safety deposit box iPads do t for in tiny safety deposit boxes They suggested a padlocked cupboard that only staff has access to I refused The guest services manager laughed st me and said there was no call for in room safes that is utter tosh A dreadful hotel for which I paid a vastly inflated price Utterly appalling, Reception staff were friendly
248633,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, A very confusing organisation It s not run like a normal hotel and very little information is given to guests regarding dining arrangements hotel facilities and what a guest is entitled to as part of their booking The policy of taking a deposit in addition to the room charge and only refunding it days after checking out is both perverse and unnecessary , Location location location You save so much time and effort when so many of London s must see sites are within a short walk of the hotel 
248634,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The pillows were too large I could have probably asked to swap but it would have been better to have some options already in the room There wasn t much milk in the room so it only allowed for 1 drink which I didn t like My colleague only had one cup in her room and there was no biscuits The bar closed too early on Sunday night Little disappointing , Friendly staff Clean room 
248635,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Could have done with more towels but that s being a bit picky , Location was great Room was a good size 8th floor with views of big Ben Water dispenser and bottles was really handy Usb sockets in room for charging phones All perfect 
248636,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, No one helped us to carry the luggages we got like 4 luggages and there are loads of stairs to climb First those at the main entrance and second was the ones to climb to our room as it situated on a half floor Its totally not an easy job without staff s assistant The staff can have more smile on their faces, Just the location
248637,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square,No Negative, location was perfect for seeing all of Londons major attractions having a kitchenette added value and flexibility staffwere very professional and most helpful a credit to the company 
248638,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Value Have stayed in several places in London and for only a few pounds more you feel like you are getting much better value in terms of facilities luxury and atmosphere For several pounds less you could get much the same as offered by Club Quarters , Location Couldn t fault location for central London 
248639,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The bed was unbelievably uncomfortable We woke up regularly through the night in pain and were then woken up by staff having a very loud conversation in the corridor outside our room We weren t told that the room was on a basement level which meant there was very little daylight Staff weren t particularly friendly or helpful , The location was great 
248640,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Not too keen on the giant pillows and the 2 tea bags seemed a little mean 20 for 2 G Ts London prices I suppose , Friendly efficient professional staff Comfortable clean and practical bedroom with en suite that had larger than average shower 
248641,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Only thing I can fault were the pillows which were way to hard , Location was amazing 2 mins from embankment tube 5 minute walk from Leicester Square Clean contemporary and good value 
248642,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The pillows I don t think I have ever had a single pillow that was so high to rest your head without your neck bending uncomfortably Went without a pillow Two softer pillows so you can either use them to sit up or lay down flat , The room was a good size the shower was easy to get into and to use Toiletries useful to have and very nice to use The location was ideal for getting around and sightseeing
248643,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Single glazing and a small gap round the window meant our room was freezing upon arrival There was a thermostat which we turned up but the fan was extremely noisy so much so it was difficult to sleep , Location was excellent
248644,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Room a bit small for the price Only english plugs but adaptors were available , Very friendly staff Great WIFI conection Cold water machines in each floor
248645,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, We were directed to the Italian restaurant in the hotel for lunch since Boyd s stops serving lunch at 3 pm The server was excellent but the food left a lot to be desired It was expensive and the description on the menu did not really describe the dishes accurately , The location was excellent Appreciated having a kitchenette but there were no dish clothes or dish towels available 
248646,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Only 1 pillow provided for each person on the bed , Ideal location for central London Friendly and welcoming staff Quiet inside the hotel Secure access to lifts
248647,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The room was nothing like the picture it was small there was no bottled water provided and no view at all We had continual noise from either a generator or the air conditioning unit We were also not able to open the windows , The location was good and close to Covent Garden where we needed to be 
248648,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The lack of proper air conditioning made for very stuffy air in my small room , Great location I had a quiet room small but functional except for the air conditioning 
248649,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Room 725 was cold but upon request we were given a space heater which worked well We did NOT get the wakeup call we requested , Excellent location on the only tree lined street in the area Convenient to bus and tube restaurants stores attractions 
248650,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, We left luggage with their concierge during the day and it was lost for around 30 mins when they couldn t find it again it was buried under others in their store room It was found in the end but a bit of a fright , Very convenient close to Trafalgar Sq and Charing Cross tube and railway station We had a room on the 9th floor at the back 910 and it was quiet Quite spacious for London and the shower was large The little kitchen was adequate with a few plates and cups glasses and fridge if required Overall I have no issue with the room
248651,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Jackhammer construction and a staff which serves multiple levels of service makes the approach and check in awkward , This is an outpost in a sea of heavily priced properties Here efficiency triumphs over luxury but it is well appointed There is no better location in London 
248652,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Staff at reception were mostly helpful and friendly but not all and this is what matters the most when you have arrived in a city like London for the first time Also we found the house brasserie pretentious and overpriced , The location was very good for us We were able to explore the city and there were lots of places to eat nearby

248662,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Can hear neighbours Noise during the night from the conditioning system , Good location a few minutes walk to the most of the sights Nice and friendly staff 
248663,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The price is high as is everything in the UK But the location makes up for it , The location was amazing right by Trafalgar Square and just down the block from the Embankment Tube stop The room was big with a nice kitchenette and our own A C for the room 
248664,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, We were three pople in a room and the third person had to sleep on a kind of camp bed which was a bit disappointing considering the fact that we paid full for the third person , Excellent location Comfortable room Excellent shower

248745,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, could have done with a spoon and a small fridge, room was comfy but to be fair looked more like travel lodge than a 4 star hotel saying that location was worth the extra
248746,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, I think their mattresses need to be replaced as they are over used and they need to supervise their cleaning staff as the room cleaness was not for a 4 star hotel We had an unfortunate experience with our first room we were alocted to with the bathroom not being cleaned and the toilet being used and not flushed We did reported it and they apologized for it and we were relocated to a new cleaner room , Location location location the staff Amazing helpful staff especially Mathew the man to look for in this hotel This is my second stay at this hotel and definitely not going to be the last Mathew made sure me and my sisters had everything we needed even the specific room nomber i asked for once it became available The easy and fast check in out I really can t emphasize enough how helpful the staff are A big thank you goes to maria ophillie dan from the reception The location is beyond perfect every major attraction is in walking distance It was my sisters first visit to London and they said if they visited London again this hotel will be their choice to saty I Will come back again 
248747,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Housekeeping maid could be more alert in replenishing consummables , Excellent front staff friendly eager to help went an extra mile I booked the room for many many of its attributes such as location room size and bed arrangement for my family of three free wifi etc etc and among other things in room safe which unfortunately was not featured in the room assigned but was otherwise exactly what I booked for They promised to move me two floors down exact same room on the third day of my 8 night stay On that day full of local activities we agreed to come back to the hotel around 3 4 pm to pack and make the move to the room with the safe by then previous guest would have moved out and housekeeping would have finished the cleaning We returned at 4 pm and were told we ve moved We were a bit puzzled as we have not packed nothing packed and we had unpacked everything upon check in with all sorts of clothing in as many drawers as we could find three people s clothing on hangers snacks and drinks in the cupboard toiletries in the bathroom shoes parading by the door I said let s go to the room and packed as no way we were regarded as having moved We returned to the earlier room and found it cleaned up and cleaned out Concerned to the point of getting worried as though I have taken all my valuables with me in a backpack to go about my day s activity there were medicines and kid s favorite masterpiece of colored drawing the night earlier his Lego set half done and so on so who and how that was done and could anything be overlooked or missing or regarded as unwanted trash Hurried down to the new room with staff from both the reception and housekeeping to ensure that if there should be anything we found missing we would have to deal with it on the spot Voila EVERYTHING I mean everything was neatly placed back into the new room right down to the scrap paper drawing by my little Piccaso The only chore was to unload my stuff from my backpack into the safe 
248748,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, We didn t include breakfast in our booking as the price quoted 17 seemed excessive We enjoyed breakfast at a local cafe on both mornings , The location was super staff very friendly and the restaurant options were great too 
248749,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, No windows too hot not really a hotel room, Very convenient for central London Would be very good for a family or couple on a budget with full catering facilities 
248750,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The offer in booking com stated 63 of the original price but it was obviously fake The price we payed about 160 euro per night was the real price of the room surely not of a luxury discounted room For that price I would have chosen another hotel I wouldn t trust anymore blindly the booking com offers, Location perfect for visiting London walking around

248753,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square,No Negative, Trafalgar Square Club Quarters is a very impressive hotel From the outset I am a great fan of ClubQuarters CQ and stay often in their various London hotels on business trips This was my first stay at the Trafalgar Sq hotel and all the staff and facilities were welcoming and helpful The room was quite large for London standards Superior Queen and this CQ was more old European hotel in flavour as opposed to the more modern style CQ elsewhere in the capital Staff were all excellent Ophelia and Dan in particular at Reception were very kind and professional I certainly would recommend and stay there again But then I would recommend all of CQ in London Standards and Management is high and supportive They care about their guests and it shows because we return all the time 
248754,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, They gave me a room at level 1 it was loud because of the tube passing just by the hotel I m really disappointed about it but since I ve been just one night and I was tired I didn t even go to the reception to tell them They shouldn t do this I also requested during my booking if I could have a room with a window giving on the Main Street and possibly with a bathtub A 4 stars hotel surely does have it especially in January Other than this the hotel is nice and the position is perfect , The room is nice very large and full of optionals 
248755,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Fitness center could be better Might suggest you have an agreement with fitness center across street Perhaps a special rate for your guests , Excellent staff Very helpful on all counts Perfect location for everything Good value Priced right 
248756,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, I made this booking for my 18 year old daughter and her two friends When my daughter checked into the hotel and wanted to pay her bill on arrival a member of staff at reception informed her she would also have to pay a Deposit of 60 which would be refunded on departure I was unaware of this deposit when I made the booking for her The member of staff checking her in then debited my daughter s account for the FULL cost of the booking TWICE by mistake It took from Sunday to Tuesday for the refund to go back into her account This left her short of cash while she was in London and very anxious about when the money would be refunded The hotel also debited her account for for the full cost of her stay a THIRD time when she was checking out and again this took another two days to be refunded to her account I had to make a number of costly phone calls to the hotel to try to sort this error out and overall it caused a lot of stress to my daughter and to me Though I dealt with a helpful member of staff at reception overall I found the whole situation very unsatisfactory I have used Booking com for many years and never had any such problems with any of their other properties previously , Good hotel in good location 
248757,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, I REALLY wish 1 a bag of TEA in the room we got 2 the first day after request and not single one the rest of our stay and NO there were none to find in the guest s cupboard in the corridor 2 towels for TWO even if you are a couple 3 some plastic bags in the bathroom for sanitary pads, the situation and the good isolation silent nights

248868,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The air conditioner was not cooling only working as a fan and an enormously dirty one No bathrobes or slippers , The location of that hotel is excellent Stuff are helpful and nice Our first room was small and with a broken floor air conditioner which was incredibly dirty We were moved to a better and bigger room which had also a bad air conditioner fan mode only but due to it s bigger size it was almost bearable I think 27 28 Celsius at night Also we asked for a fan

248875,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Bad start with a noisy room that made sleep impossible and no help from management However we were given a lovely room the next night and appreciated the free breakfast and snack basket Thank you Judith for your emails and concern We will certainly stay again Help with luggage would improve the experience , Excellent location On the doorstep of Trafalgar Square Charing Cross underground Big Ben London Eye and theatres Can t get better 
248876,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Phone in room didn t work Kept having to use my mobile to ring reception which was a pain and took ages due to having to listen to all the options before it connected you to the right number Room service took TWO HOURS to arrive When it came the fries tasted like they d been reheated in a microwave , good location
248877,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The hotel is dark and the lift is very old In a gloomy London you really wanted to go back to a more bright environment , Short walk to a lot of the tourist spots but still in a relatively quiet street 
248878,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Small bathroom basic room , Location was very good but the room was very basic with a very small shower room don t often get shower curtains in hotels any more 
248879,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, It was very pricey for the room we received but the location was perfect so that definitely needs to be factored in when comparing hotel prices in one of the most expensive cities in the world , The hotel is in the perfect location The suites are nice compared to most hotels I ve stayed at in London

248882,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, The ice machine on my floor never worked and I stayed at least 6 nights I had to go to another floor to get ice daily Asked for non smoking room but upon getting there the first day it clearly smelled like someone previously had smoked And when I opened the curtain I literally saw a couple of cigarette buds on the outside windowsill I got a call about 30 minutes prior to checking out asking when I was leaving If I stayed past that time I would be charged it was noon ish I have NEVER had that happen to me even at MUCH more expensive places I had even asked for a later checkout which again it was barely noon Very unprofessional I would recommend this hotel if you want to be close to SoHo or Covent Garden But if you want a later checkout make sure you confirm the day before , Tesco is on the corner so was an easy walk to get fruits and snacks daily or alcohol small selection but good nonetheless Wi Fi was good and strong Bar in hotel The gym had the essentials elliptical free weights treadmills but quite compact In the room with free weights can t have more than 2 3 people as there just isn t enough room to do exercises properly Which for me is ok since I do tend to travel with my resistance bands so whatever I can t do in the gym I just finish up back in my room 
248883,Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square, Suzanna on Reception seemed deliberately obstructive to letting us have an early check in other members of staff appeared to be afraid of her we re unable to help us in her wake I d called ahead to explain that we were in London taking part in a Breast Cancer Charity s Walk The Walk Moonwalk asked if an 11 00am check in might be possible as we would have been walking through the night ready to drop We were assured that 11 00am check in wouldn t be a problem Suzanna however quite bluntly refused unless we were prepared to pay an extra 40 00 for the privilege Unfortunately we didn t have any extra funds so it wasn t even an option for us We d booked Club Quarters because it was relatively cheap if we d been able to spend more then we d have stayed somewhere better We then had to keep going back to Reception to check whether any rooms had become available yet bearing in mind we d been awake on our feet all night we were dog tired by this time and really unhappy that no one thought to keep us informed while we waited for the regular 15 00 check in time to come around I suspect that Suzanna wouldn t allow any of the other staff to keep us informed even if they d wanted to We finally got a room at 13 00 at 10 extra So she did manage to get a little extra out of us in the end after all Well done Suzanna Your customer service skills capacity for compassion do you credit NOT , Club Quarters would appear to be a bit of a money making machine on the sly They advertise cheap rates to draw you in then catch you out on arrival with extra charges There are signs displayed in the elevators encouraging guests to pay extra for late checkouts which then impacts on new arrivals when they come to check in as the rooms they ve booked aren t available on time leaving the Reception staff free to charge extra for upgraded rooms and or early check ins The hotel was clean comfortable but the whole extra charges experience left a bad taste in my mouth and as a result I will not be returning
