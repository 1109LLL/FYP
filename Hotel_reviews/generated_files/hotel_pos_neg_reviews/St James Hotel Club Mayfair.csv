233609,St James Hotel Club Mayfair,No Negative, Great boutique luxury hotel in a perfect location for folks who like to walk a city My kids are teenagers and were perfectly happy with this hotel but little kids would likely not find much to their liking No kiddie facilities or programs in other words I would recommend this hotel unreservedly to any business or leisure traveler looking for something small and a bit out of the way it s tucked into a cul de sac while still being near to all the good stuff 
233610,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Our room had no working air conditioning You could tell as soon as you walked in the room After telling the bellhop and 2 subsequent calls to the front desk the manager trolls up an hour later with a portable air conditioner and apologises that the hotel is full and this the best they can do His attempted humour stating you re lucky it wasn t last week with the hotter weather let s just say that went down a treat buddy The so called portable air conditioning unit stood nearly 2 metres high and a metre wide I asked Where does the hot air get expelled He said that it s all contained in the unit Upon further inspection it s a dehumidifier that you have to pour water into The unit blew out old cigarette smells and as far as the decibel volume wow I was then offered another excuse that the whole 4th floor was out Liar seems the air conditioning was working perfectly in the hallway Now I know things go wrong and apologies aside they offered us nothing in compensation for the problem No room discount no drink no food no zip We even requested a later checkout and had to wait until morning for it to be approved Another problem to watch out for is the toilet in the bathroom It s raised on a step that juts out further than the toilet seat edge Nearly broke my toe early in the morning As far as the location of the hotel take it or leave it Didn t float our boat Mind you the 2 negronis we got in the alley down the road cost us 60AUD One drink was enough , The bar area looked very classy but was empty every time we walked past 
233611,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Bed very uncomfortable Too soft My wife will take weeks to recover the full use of her back Very noisy rooms No double glazing sound insulation to the exterior and garbage trucks and other heavy vehicles pass through the narrow street at all hours of the night including incredibly noisy and prolonged garbage collection at 5 30 a m Sunday morning Restaurant not particularly inviting and needs to be more open , Service was fine as to be expected in a hotel of this grade quality and price Location cannot be beaten 
233612,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, I spoke with the manager post breakfast We all arrived and the staff simply could not cope Cooked Food ran out and no coordination Shame As this was my birthday breakfast with my family Otherwise a nice place,No Positive
233613,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Parking was so much money Nobody told us it would be so much we weren t even told where the car was We couldn t use the rooftop terrace apparently which was one of my main reasons for booking it A lot of money for something so middle of the road, The girl behind the bar was very welcoming and sweet 
233614,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, They added a non compulsory charge to the bill without telling us or explaining , Lovely boutique hotel with easy walking distance to shops and Hyde park Great room and service with a nice terrace outlook Helpful staff 
233615,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Room service food was ok nothing special yet expensive, The service quality was outstanding and the flexibility and attention was beyond my expectations
233616,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, The TV did not have all the channels working something which could not be fixed in 24 hours , Excellent location quiet but very central and in walking distance to many great spots The room was comfortable the bed very large and professional service was to a high level of attention 
233617,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, The free Handy cell phone to use was a great touch I ve never had before but it was rather slow so I didn t use it that much , Very close the Green Park tube station using the secret back door Close to Piccadilly and lots of shopping food etc Very comfortable room Junior Suite on the first floor Felt very homey yet modern enough Nice bar cafe onsite and lounge Kind of tucked away just off the main cross street made it very quiet and peaceful It you wanted more hustle and bustle just a couple blocks away Close to Buckingham Palace Trafalgar Square and numerous sites other as well Within 1 2 mile was a Post Office we used to send home goodies and a Tesco market I would definitely stay here again 
233618,St James Hotel Club Mayfair,No Negative, breakfast included would have been better and couple of the hooks were actually not available Baloney room and the roof top bar Was told the roof top bar was private only and that the balcony rooms are only if available The room was fine and we slept well There was however a large machine outside of the bathroom that had a loud industrial sound 24 hours a day Was good that the bathroom separated the noise from the sleeping area The location is really good and we did enjoy our stay 
233619,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Too hot room air conditioner not working couldn t open window as outside air conditioning units very loud dark room, Great restaurant comfy beds great location
233620,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Nothing, Ideally located in central London We could walk to every major touristic landmark Hotel staff is very friendly and willing to help with anything Room is decorated with taste The bed was extremely comfortable 
233621,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Nothing to dislike , Very friendly staff from the moment we arrived until departure Excellent location We stay in many hotels and this is one to return to 
233622,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, No adapter none were also available at reception though they managed to find one the next day Breakfast not recommended definately not value pre money better to go to Cecconi s, Perfect location very quiet side street 3 minutes away from The Ritz amazing area for retsraunts and art lovers Friendly staff The entrance price rooms are extremely small opt for the bigger ones if you want to open your suitcase 
233623,St James Hotel Club Mayfair,No Negative, The stay was booked for my parents as a Christmas gift we chose to do this on the date of there wedding anniversary which I notified them off On arrival the hotel very kindly upgraded them from a deluxe room to a suite Thank you so much for making there stay such a delight 
233624,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Rubbish breakfast Poor selection Had to pay extra for eggs and some salmon 7 salmon 12 for 3 eggs ridiculously rubbish continental didn t want any of it They also took another holding deposit of 100 didn t tell me Still haven t put money back in account despite paying cash And advising I ll pay cash on entry NO NOTICE OF HOLDING MORE MONEY IN BANK Very poor Ordered tea to the room Hour and a half went by Rang up Obviously forgot and did it again , Rubbish breakfast 
233625,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, nothing to complain, The location of the hotel is wonderful The hotel is a boutique one so the rooms are nice but not very spacious Very convenient the distance from the tube station green park The room was very clean and comfortable 
233626,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, The only thing I would have added is tea kettle in the room , This hotel was by far the best I have ever stayed in London The room was pristine linens gorgeous overall quality 5 Star The location can t be beat right off Piccadilly without all the noise as its on a private back street The staff were very friendly and super helpful as I arrived in the morning quite early and they were able to accommodate an early check in AMAZING 
233627,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Very small room very dark lights Almost no storage place maximum 3 4 shirts I had to keep most of my stuff inside my luggage In most of the rooms NO shower handset As it was important for me I requested to change room and was told to wait at the room and that in 5 minutes a staff member will come to assist but came after 40 minutes I waited at the room At the breakfast I ordered a veterinarian omelet and asked specifically for no bacon but after the first bite I understood that bacon is one of my omelet ingredients, Great location 
233628,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, The room was way too hot and we were in the coldest weekend of the year even the air conditioning couldn t cool it sufficiently to be comfortable I couldn t leave the window open as our room was near the air conditioning units and it was too noisy , The location is great the hotel is stylish superb friendly staff excellent restaurant 
233629,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, We booked a junior suite and when reached found it too small so paid an extra 500GBP to upgrade to St James Suite , Staff were very friendly and helpful Concierge Toni and Emanuel were so helpful Special thanks to all staff members as they are a superb team 
233630,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, size of the room was VERY very small we ordered room service once and the waiter could not enter the room with his tray , very comfortable bed great location for both business and shopping nice breakfast
233631,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Skip breakfast which is like a scene out of Fawlty Towers the second day after waiting for an hour to receive our cooked breakfast we just got up and left The table behind us had similar problems and received the wrong order three times and it was still wrong Other tables seem to be experiencing similar problems It is a pity that this experience clouds the wonderful warm welcome we received The bar is expensive before they add on 12 5 service charge ,No Positive
233632,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, We had to get rid of the limescale on the shower head and the heating didn t work properly, The bed was very comfy the location was perfect for what we wanted the staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was really good
233633,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Several years ago I used to stay at St James on business sole occupancy but had forgotten the rooms where so small and for two persons room 407 was rather akin to a cabin on one of the better cruise liners For example there was no room to pass between the bed and someone sitting at the dressing table The bathrooms are little more than a closet and in our case the shower head sprayed water outside the bath and flooded the floor Moreover I am in my 70 s and find showers situated in baths problematical Comfort was therefore sadly lacking and not conducive to a relaxed stay which one would anticipate in an high end expensive hotel , Location
233634,St James Hotel Club Mayfair,No Negative, Wonderful bistro atmosphere and food in the evening as well as for breakfast They made fabulous soups salads fish and actually had amazing gluten free rolls for dinner The size of the room was very comfortable and the bed was super comfy Everything was clean tidy and attractive 
233635,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, We booked a junior suite and were a bit disappointed that there was no coffee tea station in the room Also the room was cold , Location is great Room was clean tastefully decorated and furnished and bed was really comfy Staff is very friendly and attentive Nice breakfast 
233636,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, The shower is a little strange just one negative point which is suit an important one very uncomfortable to take a shower with out having a removable part , We loved the coziness and the location The qualified stuff and easy was of arranging 
233637,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, somewhere to sit and chill work the only place is the bar or bedroom a small library room or something similar would be good the desk in the room is small and the TV was over it But this is by no means a show stopper but a nice to have , comfortable and quiet room friendly and attentive staff easy to get around the west end from here
233638,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Room Executive too small windows to the yard not designed to open so no fresh air only aircon noisy Quirking floor In spite of perfect bed the claustrofobic framework and the noise issues as well as lack of proper curtains to keep out the morning sun light AND a gap between door and floor allowing bright light to enter from the hall way the room was never really dark and never really tranquil So although the room would look great on a photo I truely hated it , The bed the duvettes Perfect location Quaglinos and great sushi restaurant within 200 meters
233639,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Nothing it was perfect for what we wanted a pampered break in central London with very professional and friendly staff , We liked everything St James is a top class hotel with a top class feel 
233640,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Lack of facilities But as a business traveler it doesn t matter , Friendly staff They managed to check me in earlier than usual They acknowledged the sense of urgency Many nice restaurants nearby 
233641,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Misleading information Gym is not on the premises and only accessible during week not week end Breakfast is not 18 pounds as stated on booking com It is 28 , Bed was fabulous and the shower restaurant too 
233642,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, The location of our room on the lower ground floor no view and had to close the curtains to get dressed as people in the street could see in No tea or coffee facilities therefore had to use room service which was expensive , The location of the hotel was perfect
233643,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, We wasn t informed what is included in our breakfast with room so we ordered some food and all those orders charged upon check out We didn t mind to pay because all dishes are delicious but we wanted to be informed what is included in the rate which we paid for breakfast normally if it s additionally charged restaurant staff bring how much cost for the orders with bill at the finish the meal But they didn t bring anything ,No Positive
233644,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Staff seemed false and eager to get you to spend your money and tip them of course rather than serving their guests and doing a good job Pretentious Paid massively over the odds for what we got a small room then met with a discretionary charge of 25 86 when settling up BTW the receptionist was anything but discrete about this Waste of money Nothing compared to other 5 star hotels I ve visited , Location
233645,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Very minor point but the ambient light from outside was still visible through the bathroom door , Very personalized service and with a smile Very plush surroundings

233651,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, The only problem on my latest visit was that the guest lift was out of order for the two days of my stay but this is just a small irritation, As a solo female guest I feel secure and safe in this hotel the staff are excellent and I felt very comfortable in the bar and breakfast room on my own
233652,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, The room was a bit cramped , I liked the personal attention of all the staff to the guests they were always ready to help with any problem the location of the hotel is excellent central but on quiet street design and atmosphere are just exceptional Dining room and restaurants were luxurious 
233653,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, In room with a brick wall view Hair dryer didnt work Drain in tub didnt work No outlet in bathroom dor hair dryer , Friendly staff and good location 
233654,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, The slowness of service at breakfast Not a big issue but you asked the question , We were made to feel at home by all the staff The bar staff were particularly friendly and helpful 
233655,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, More staff needed for breakfast slow service team looked a little under pressure due to guests arriving all at once for breakfast X, Checkin out very fast professional and friendly likewise for bar team and doormen 
233656,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, The breakfast organisation seemed a little out of sync Toast with no butter or jam dribbling teapots floors under used tables not swept Breakfast was expensive but very good The unexpected service charges , Very welcoming staff concierge service faultless The room was very comfortable the bathroom was modern adequate and clean with expensive toiletries Breakfast was very good but expensive The lift was bodged with duct tape where some trim had come off the door 
233657,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, The so called executive room we booked was quite a bit smaller then the executive room I occupied last time so I don t think it was the same standard, Friendly staff
233658,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, It was very Cold bedrooms to small moved to a bigger room bedding not adequate flown in from a very hoot country and we were freezing no extra bedding in the room beds to small no kettle in Room Took ages to Get a drink after flying all night had a problem at this hotel this time with bombarded With the staff last thing you need after bad journey all I wanted to do was sleep instead of arguing, Breakfast to rushed not as good as its used to be
233659,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, I booked a junior suite it was a small overcrowded sitting room and a small bedroom Bathroom did not function well Dark and dingy poor lighting Long wait for room service Pictures were not a true representation of what we got and very misleading , Very little to like

233661,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Very bright room at night due to flood lights outside window plus lift noise behind our bed No tea making facilities in the room Very small room and dated decor for the price we paid Will not stay again , Location
233662,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Room was a little noisy this time as it seemed to have a kitchen or air conditioner vent just outside the window , Staff were very attentive and I like the breakfast here 
233663,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, Noisy flush on loo Couldn t open windows in one of our rooms Breakfast not as good as on previous visits scrambled and poached eggs overcooked and waiter rather clueless insisted on listing the components of an English breakfast and then muddled up what was and wasn t requested , Comfortable cosy compact room Convenient for London sightseeing Staff helpful and friendly 
233664,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, There is major building work going on next door to the hotel with loud drilling starting around 8 am on a Saturday morning Not what you expect from a five star hotel advertised as being in a quiet street No information was given about this when I booked through booking com or indeed when I checked in despite saying that we needed a quiet room We also had to change rooms as the one we were initially given was tiny hotel staff handled this well however , Nice hotel and central location
233665,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, very small room and building work directly opposite the Hotel surprised they didn t give us a different room , the staff location beautiful d cor 
233666,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, They added an extra 5 service charge to the bill at check out which was not within the terms at the time of booking They explained that it was for the maids I suspect they don t pay their maids very well and have to ask guests to contribute I wonder whether they will add another 5 for the bell staff 5 for the front desk 5 of maintenance staff and so on Then the hotel wont need to pay any wages The room 201 was not very soundproof I could hear noise in the corridor all day and night , location free wifi
233667,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, I felt that for the room charge in my case breakfast could have been included which it wasn t , Helpful staff Nice building Good room Nice breakfast

233674,St James Hotel Club Mayfair, The rooms were small There doors to the bathroom had frosted glass and the bathrooms had windows which though frosted as well let in an extraordinarily bright street lamp each night This meant the room was never dark and so sleep was not that great , The food was amazing It was expensive but worth it
