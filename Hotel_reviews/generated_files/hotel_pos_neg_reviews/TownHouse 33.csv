472137,TownHouse 33, It was a little far away from the center , The room hat 2 bathrooms and was very very spacious It was everything you could ask for and a lil extra on top Breakfast was very nice at a very big table where you could eat together with other guests and felt like a meal at grandmas Overall very impressed and very satisfied Would totally come again if I were to visit Milan again 
472138,TownHouse 33,No Negative, Everything was ok during first two days than on the third day hotel kitchen lacks eggs for breakfast for our child no one assisted us to pack our suitcases even outside was a shower rain garage is not near hotel 
472139,TownHouse 33, The reception doesnt look like a reception not a big deal really, Location is good Room is clean spacious and the bathroom is great especially the shower Breakfast is good Tv is brilliant so many channel options
472140,TownHouse 33, nothing , All good Nice location and good value for money PS I have made my reservation last minute so I can t be really unbiased Great breakfast not wonderful I will come back 
472141,TownHouse 33, Stylish but impractical water faucets Bathroom corners are a little bit run down At breakfast you might be offered omelette but beware it is extra 5 they don t mention it when you order only a tiny sign at the buffet that easily goes unnoticed says so , Nice less touristy area but still close to central Milano direct line by bus Spacious well decorated rooms Friendly staff 
472142,TownHouse 33, Once we worked out the transport into Milan centre it was a fun trip Can be walked but because Milan was hot not always the best option The room more than made up for the transport issue , The beautiful courtyard very quiet and peaceful The staff were all friendly helpful and attentive The room was spacious especially the bathroom and very comfortable Great air conditioning Delicious breakfast choices too 
472143,TownHouse 33,No Negative, Friendly staff great neighbourhood not so far from city centre The breakfast was wonderful as well I am definitely staying here on my next visit to Milano 
472144,TownHouse 33,No Negative, I loved this hotel The room was beautifully designed and very comfortable The bathroom and shower were lovely I found the staff incredibly helpful and friendly There were lovely bars and restaurants in walking distance We really enjoyed our stay 
472145,TownHouse 33, Location not so conenient Even though we asked for king beds we got two twins conected but not in a good way could be really not confortable, Modern rooms
472146,TownHouse 33, Nothing, The staff was wonderful very helpful Our room was fantastic with a small bottle of wine to toast our trip and the patio and breakfast were wonderful Amazing place all the way around 
472147,TownHouse 33, The shower leaked so badly the room was awash The air conditioning was inadequate The luggage lift didn t work on leaving The hotel is not central Milan when you need 2 trains to get to the Duomo, The staff were very friendly and helpful
472148,TownHouse 33, 1 Complematry water in the room bottle was already opened 2 Public wifi was unusable and our devices were not able to connect 3 The room service kept ordered food dishes outside our door step for a day and a half 4 Room was not made until the end of the day on our first day there , Only the staff 
472149,TownHouse 33, No bar Finding reception on arrival was not that obvious Upgraded to junior suite which was ok Bath small included a jacuzzi which was not connected Oddly a wall mounted shower attachment was provided but was too short to be a proper shower so it was bath or nothing Slippers but no bathrobe Twin beds were pushed together but separated during night which was irritating Coffee and water not replenished after first day Not really a suite No hotel facilities so more of a bed and breakfast , Quiet location Important to note that the hotel is 20 25 minutes walk from the centre however taxis are easily bookable and arrive in only a few minutes Friendly staff Room ok and comfortable Breakfast buffet limited but adequate Outdoor courtyard seating is nice particularly on a sunny day 
472150,TownHouse 33, We were not allowed to turn on the air con apparently due to local country laws for that time of year being March and I was bitten my insects in my sleep because we had to open the window to cool down the room that was too warm when we arrived late in the evening , Great staff and service around the clock went above and beyond let me changed rooms when I was uncomfortable in the first one due to insert bites like mosquitos
472151,TownHouse 33,No Negative, Staff amazing nothing was to much trouble received free upgrade due to issue with hot water in our room Great location easy access to metro Lovely seating area to enjoy a drink after a day of site seeing 
472152,TownHouse 33,No Negative, Very friendly staff clean room good breakfast and easy walking distance to centre of town metro and other public transport Easy access and lift if needed 
472153,TownHouse 33, They do not deliver what is mentioned on booking com and if you want to get what you asked for you need to pay extra, Large double bed means two small beds next to each other
472154,TownHouse 33, Wished the bathroom lighting could be brighter around the mirror , I enjoyed very much the cozy atmosphere without being pretentious Breakfast was very nice as well 
472155,TownHouse 33, Not really professional set up no information in the room about breakfast restaurant opening hours or even number of reception For switching on the TV you need to be an engineer Water installation seems to be a general problem in the house you can only have warm water at the wash basin if you turn the water to max hence setting the bathroom under water partially no warm water no option to regulate temperature in the room, Good location very nice cosy style wonderful garden area around nice breakfast friendly staff
472156,TownHouse 33, Terrible lighting inside the bathroom No room service no bar restaurant available No english channels , Beautiful building nicely located quiet and clean 
472157,TownHouse 33,No Negative, The room was very nice and cosy the hotel was boutique type we managed to get nice dinner at around 22 The only minus was that the parking was far away almost three blocks from the hotel but everyting else was ok Breakfast was excellent 
472158,TownHouse 33, The room was really small Deluxe room two lights were not working and shower did not drain Staff did not follow up or apologize for inconvenience , Breakfast was cosy and plenty of choices 
472159,TownHouse 33, Location It s a long walk to the central area Duomo , Nice rooms Very clean and equipped with everything you need Staff are lovely and very helpful Nice breakfast
472160,TownHouse 33,No Negative, Everything was great the staff at this hotel understood that things change when travelling for business and my assistant was able to coordinate with setting up all details with the front desk and they had it all done correctly efficiently and without any drama This hotel is a great stay for people who have higher expectations on their hotel experience 
472161,TownHouse 33, The only thing which we did not like was the humidity spots in the rooms bathrooms general hotel area with partially already wholes bad smell mushrooms We had 2 rooms in the 3rd floor that does not fit with a price per night of 200 Euros This generally did not match to the rest of the amazing hotel , Amazing hotel in quite central location beautiful garden nice breakfast room great breakfast generally very cosy nice style
472162,TownHouse 33, We liked everything But one improvement would ve been better signage outside There was a sign for townhouse 31 but not for Townhouse 33 Our friend and a taxi driver found it hard to find us, Townhouse 33 was a very comfortable boutique style hotel We enjoyed staying here Comfortable bed helpful staff quiet and Peaceful Nice decor Breakfast had a good selection and the breakfast area beautifully decorated We would stay again Taxi to city centre Piazza Castello to get hop on hop off bus was not expensive A great supermarket is in walking distance
472163,TownHouse 33, A little more food choice at breakfast would have been nice , Hotel room was fantastic spacious and nicely decorated Always cleaned very well each day Location of the hotel was excellent Quiet but close enough to walk to great bars restaurants and the shopping center

472167,TownHouse 33, The hotel is a bit outside the city center and there is not much to do in the area And the closest metro station is at 10 min walk which seemed very far in the hot weather There are bus stops not far from the hotel but one has to understand how and where to buy tickets , Friendly and helpful staff comfortable and large bed quiet room
