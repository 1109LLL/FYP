196472,H tel Pont Royal, We had bad luck Wifi and television was temporarily not working and there was no water in the bathroom They on day 2 moved us from our specifically booked room with a view on 7th floor to to another nice room on 2 floor But still low pressure in the pipes They told us it was an outside problem but more sounded like a wellknown internal problems with their pumps The front personel was professionally serviceminded but the attitude was from people under pressure The hotel really has to get a grip to stay 5 stared even if you to not take in mind the missing Water and wifi problem it seems more correct to say its a nice 4 star hotel , Great location easy to get around Close to public parking basement when we had a room on 7th floor we had a great view to the roofs of Paris 
196473,H tel Pont Royal, Please see above Also they should offer a complimentary bottle of water everyday , There was no internet connection or TV services due to a power outage affecting the street during the entire time of my stay I appreciate that the hotel administration didn t have much to do for this issue but the only thing they offered to me was a free bottle of Evian from minibar They should ve done more to compensate for this problem 
196474,H tel Pont Royal, Layout of our room compared to others of same level was a bit off Had small entry hall which took away from room But still very nice size for Europe , Great location Staff was wonderful Mattress a bit saggy but comfortable Room was nice 
196475,H tel Pont Royal, Sink drain but could have happenedvanywhere, Bathrobes and slippers very quiet room even though it looked out onto big street Nice amenities very luxurious sheets 
196476,H tel Pont Royal, While it is a 5 star hotel and you would expect prices to be high once they have your booking they do somewhat gouge for extras to increase the bill sharply The cheapest bottle of wine in the onsite bar is 50 60 and a bottle of water from the minibar is 9 This may be common in Paris at that style of hotel but be prepared for the high additional costs rather than just focusing on the room rate , Great hotel in a convenient location Walking distance to the tourist part of St Germain des Pr s 
196477,H tel Pont Royal, Actually I liked everything Maybe one suggestion a real cheese plate with more French specialties for the breakfast would be very appreciable , We loved our charming room on the top floor which had a splendid view over Paris We could sit on chairs to admire the view It was much bigger than I expected other comments let me think that the room would be small but it was not in comparison with Parisian standards The staff was very nice and helpful I was very happy because we got exactly the room I asked for The breakfast was also much better than expected Internet was included in the room 
196478,H tel Pont Royal, This place is collectoon of all things not to be liked This hotel sorry hostel is overpriced relative to what you get and ehat they deliver Both from a staff point of view and facilities Stay here just if this place is your only survival chance after a zombie or nuclear catastrophe , Nothing special to be liked at this place 
196479,H tel Pont Royal, This is the first 5 star hotel I have been to that does not have a coffee machine in room Missing my daily hot coffee in bed makes me somehow homesick , Excellent location Walking distances to most interesting places with supermarket cross the street and pharmacy next door Close to the train station to Chateau Versailles Many good restaurants in the neighborhood Rooms are in appropriate size and bathroom are clean and user friendly Staffs are courteous and concierges are helpful 
196480,H tel Pont Royal,No Negative, This is our go to hotel in Paris My wife and I have stayed here many times and love the hotel It has a great left bank location and the staff is great 
196481,H tel Pont Royal, We have paid extra for getting the room at higher floor to have the better view It was not worth paying more We have just seen the small piece of top of the Eiffel Tower , Bed was great 
196482,H tel Pont Royal, I would never stay in room 103 again We could hear everything going on in the room above us When we asked the staff they said it was the cleaning people getting supplies This happened several times a day and could even be heard at 2 and 3am Tough to sleep when you can hear things being slid across the floor and banging etc It is a 1st floor room just above the hotels main entrance In addition to the noise from above and the cars and people on the street everytime an employee or customer stood outside the hotels front door and smoked a cigarette we could smell it in our room We booked the room for 6 nights and dealt with this every night We asked to change rooms and were told there were no rooms like ours available to switch us too I would ve taken a downgrade if it was offered as an option , The bed was fantastic The staff were super friendly Check in and out was a breeze We were able to walk to the Louvre and the Musee D Orsay within 5 minutes train and bus stops were within 2 minutes Get the day passes for the public transportation system Great shops and tons of cafe s were everywhere you looked Super safe area my wife and I would wander the streets at 3am with expensive camera gear and never felt at risk Directly behind the hotel is a church built hundreds of years ago and is immaculate Basically I can t imagine a better location to book a hotel in Paris 
196483,H tel Pont Royal, Staff was not so friendly this time Also my bed was super uncomfortable There were two single mattresses each had a zip to join the two which kept scratching as they were unzipped and mattresses needed to be flipped for these zips not to be on sleeping side Unacceptable for a 5 star hotel really Plus shower curtain smelled quite bad , The view and the location are excellent 
196484,H tel Pont Royal, The rooms are small but that s Europe for you On the other hand rooms are clean with all the comfort you d expect , The location is great staff is professional very hopeful and friendly 
196485,H tel Pont Royal, Staff some are rude and condescending Location only Musee D Orsay is nearby Everything else is around 30mins by public transport Value for money not worth 200 night, Comfy bed clean good wifi
196486,H tel Pont Royal, One light in the bathroom flickered a lot But feel like it would have been fixed if had said something to the staff Only reason we didn t bother was because we were there one night Also on checking in we were told that we needed to make a 50 deposit on the room on card which would be refunded on our check out minus the city tax which I do not remember being on any of the reviews I read beforehand Wasn t too much of an issue but was a surprise , Excellent location Within walking distance of the Louvre Also very near to some great restaurants Hotel has a bit of an old fashioned feel but that adds to its character Facilities were excellent and very modern even though we were only there one night Staff also very friendly Would recommend greatly 
196487,H tel Pont Royal, Bar lacked a bit of atmosphere , Comfortable room Near Seine Easy walk to to many places Blvd St Germain Louvre Opera Rue de Revolution Eiffel Tower Close to metro buses 
196488,H tel Pont Royal, After checking out from hotel hotel s bank kept blocking my guarantee payment for the room for more than 25 days So my credit limit on my credit card was reduced by that amount for almost a month and I could have spent this money for something else during my trip Staff was trying to solve this problem but hotel s bank was delaying the unblocking , Staff is very nice specially to kids and location is good 
196489,H tel Pont Royal, Fitness room has very nice bike treadmill and universal machine but no dumbbells or weights if you re into that Wifi in the rooms was erratic constantly going off and on Most frustrating part of the stay not being able to stay online for simple emails and browsing , All staff members were extremely nice and helpful Location is excellent Rooms bathrooms beddings cleaning services all were terrific 
196490,H tel Pont Royal, Elevator runs to 7th floor with stairs to 8th that could be tricky Our room on 8th was very small There may be other rooms with great views on other floors, Great neighborhood Had a top floor room with a terrace and killer view from Sacre Coure to Eifel tower Short walk to Musee D Orsay
196491,H tel Pont Royal, Not even basic coffee tea making facilities in the room Low speed internet for free High speed internet at a price Both of the above pretty shocking given overall room rates , Location Room 703 
196492,H tel Pont Royal, The balcony had a lovely view but was too small to sit out on I was nice for some fresh air I suppose we envisaged a space at least large enough for a couple of chairs to drink a glass of wine on and paid a premium for that , Beautiful room Obviously small it is Paris But gorgeously set out very clean and comfortable The bar was lovely excellent neighbourhood Very walkable central to attractions restaurants and bars Staff very friendly and helpful 
196493,H tel Pont Royal, The rooms were very small we were given 3 of the worst rooms in the house 1 floor facing street my guess is because we booked thru booking com bad internet, The location and staff friendliness
196494,H tel Pont Royal,No Negative, The only thing which I really liked it was the position such in front of Louvre Palace In general services are very superficial and bar s prices absurdly high Italian s hotels at same price give much much better service No more thank you
196495,H tel Pont Royal, We complained about the smoking of other guests despite it being a non smoking hotel The management obviously could not impose this policy as we had to suffer the smoke that came into our room through the aircon vents all throughout our stay Aside from the smoke smell the toilet was on one side of our room junior suite and the sink and shower on the other side It was not a pleasant stay at this hotel Definitely not worth the money we paid , The proximity to st germain
196496,H tel Pont Royal, We had no negative feedback for this lovely hotel , My husband and I spent 10 days in London and Paris for our Anniversary What a delight to spend our Paris leg in Hotel Pont Royal The location could not have been better Within walking distance to the Louvre Museum D Orsay Notre Dame and even the Eiffel Tower about a 40 min stroll The room was pretty spacious and well appointed with bath robes a hair dryer slippers and well stocked mini bar that we didn t touch spend your money at the cafe s The bed and pillows were comfortable and we welcomed having a bathtub in the spacious bathroom to soak our aching bodies after days of walking around both London and Paris There are a plethora of non touristy cafe s in the area and supermarket across the street if you want to save some cash and eat in The best part is the staff Unfailingly helpful and friendly from check in to check out We felt like we lucked out stumbling onto this hotel and we would certainly recommend it to anyone traveling to Paris it really was a top notch experience 
196497,H tel Pont Royal,No Negative, Julie at the front desk was awesome Warm extremely helpful So was the rest of the staff Location was perfect 10 steps and you are in monoprix Down the lane there is Eric Kayser Few minutes walk to louvre Metro is close by The concierge is super helpful with maps and options The hotel is clean and prompt with their services
