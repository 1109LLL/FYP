342600,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, There were 2 things that I did not expect to find in a Radisson chain hotel 1 During check in I was surprised to find out that hotel not only needs my credit card information but also wants a security deposit of 140 EUR room was already paid Normally I understand why this is happening but here Why exactly this sum though Minibar contents surely are not worth 140 EUR After checkout they didn t release the blocked amount What if guest needs this money in the end of long journey This is totally unacceptable 2 Floor heating in the bathroom did not work properly As I was trying to switch it on all the electricity in the room was out We could not even close the door because there was an electronic lock It seemed to be a common problem as staff was pretty fast with resolving it Still why to implement floor heating if guests cannot use it , Pretty standard Radisson hotel room very nice building
342601,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, 2 problems Staff constantly trying to upsell this happened upon check in at the bar and restaurant bordering on fraud and dishonesty Slow check out waiting for staff to upsell to those checking in , Location
342602,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna,No Negative, We opted for one of the suites and the room was fabulous and very spacious Beds were extremely comfortable and facilities were good I am unaware if there is a spa area or not as we didn t ask Breakfast was the usual you would expect from a European hotel perfectly adequate All staff we found to be very pleasant and helpful even booking the city bus trip for us As a special treat head over the road to Cafe Central for an amazing dessert 
342603,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Very comfortable room bed and pillows Bathroom had a bath tub and a separate large shower Staff was pleasant and accommodating helped us set up a tour went on a three hour segway tour Horst Harrer our guide spoke English was pleasant informative and humorous The hotel is across from Cafe Central simply amazing and also within walking distance of many beautiful places and shops Hope to return and will be looking for
342604,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, At 24 Euros the breakfasts were a little expensive , The desk staff were excellent especially Christoph Tolian He help me set up concerts and get my iPhone fixed This hotel is perfectly located to the attractions in Vienna This is a fine hotel that does everything first class 
342605,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Not having the room vacuumed thoroughly Reception was poor only one member of staff on at any one time, Breakfasts were excellent and so was the location
342606,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Switching off the air conditioning in the middle of the night is crazy We all ending up waking up at 5am gasping for breath , Location style of hotel rooms all great 
342607,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The location is excellent close to shops and amenities The breakfast is very good because it is presented well and variety is good Restaurant and lobby are very well presented 
342608,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, The hotel itself is nice the room is ok but the TV remote did not work we had no kettle we called for one and only then got one the tea coffee bags offered only one of us each flavour We called for the TV remote to be fixed so that the TV would work No one ended up coming to look at it which was very disappointing , Great location close to the mall as well as a well known Cafe across the road A short 5 minute walk to the Hofburg The hotel itself is modern and the ground floor looks very cosy The staff were polite and happy to store our bags outside checkout times which we appreciated 
342609,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Not the hotels fault but construction work was going on outside with a jack hammer going until 7 30pm Deliveries to local stores etc start from about 5am so we were woken early each day by the noise , Very happy with an upgrade to a suite and the complimentary bottle of wine for my Birthday 
342610,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, We arrived in a hired minibus and had to be dropped off a long way from the hotel Minibuses are not allowed in the small street where the hotel is , Excellent location for exploring innere stadt 
342611,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, The houseservice ladies were knocking to clean the room at 8 00 am We are on holidays really At 8 00 After that we put don t disturbe each evening not to be waken up in the morning , The hotel is in the midle of the Ring Very convinient for sightseeing Just 1 min from the subway Not on the road no sound from the cars Very good wifi 
342612,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Error by Booking com which cost us a further 400 euros and we would like this refunded please When we went to check in hotel advised us that it is not their modus operandi to reserve two adjacent rooms so why did Booking com not advise us of this if you had we would not have booked this hotel Our reason my wife s sister is extremely nervous when in strange surroundings and had to be in an adjacent room To make this work we had to upgrade to a small suite and my wife s sister was able to have an adjoining room We await your refund please , Food good rooms good staff good and excellent location
342613,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, The bed was hard with very little give So nights were not as comfortable as all that However a very heavy person might have needed such a bed it s difficult Bed linen was excellent , Brilliant location Lovely staff Very good room well planned imaginative and clean 
342614,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, There was an odd strange reception issue for a 5 star hotel that should not have happened but once the senior management was made aware of the issue they immediately handled the situation properly and because of that I would return to this property again , excellent location especially if you want to be near Stephanplatz but not so near that you re surrounded by tourists 24 7 the room quality was consistent with other Radisson Blu properties I ve stayed at good management response to problems
342615,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Booked a twin room requested 2 beds Given a double for 2 men Moved to another room and given a temporary bed which was too short and narrow to sleep comfortably on Breakfast service was terrible 20 minutes to take an order and a further 20 waiting for for a plate of scrambled egg Charged for extras we didn t not have minibar etc Too much hassle to ever use again ,No Positive
342616,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, We had a misunderstanding with the booking and booked the same junior suite under the same name twice and the hotel apparently didn t notice this or noticed it and thought we needed two junior suits there were two version depending who you spoke to And because of their STRICT CANCELLATION POLICY they still charged us one night because we cancelled the one unencessary suite although half price because we argued for 1 hour in the lobby and we were with a 2 year old fussy toddler On top of it all they had free rooms in the hotel and 3 free junior suits but they still charged us 200 euros to teach us a lesson maybe I really hope they used the money well So that goes for flexibility none And one morning I walked in the room while the maid was cleaning it and she had put the pyjamas on THE FLOOR while making the bed That was disgusting Not too much choice at breakfast and only 1 or 2 waiters when half of the food was a la carte and you had to wait for order So don t expect a quick breakfast here , The bed was comfortable and great location close to the shopping stree only good things 
342617,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Hotel food prices high , Very clean quiet and central location Quality of room very good Room clean and well equipped Staff very friendly and helpful 
342618,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, The towels were not big enough or lush enough which was surprising compared to how high end everything else was , The Hotel is very good It is centrally located you can walk anywhere and if you want to use public transportation there is a metro station 50 meters from the hotel The rooms are big and luxurious The staff is friendly and helpful and breakfast was one of the best I ve had in European hotels 
342619,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, There was no night shift manager We had some complicated situation with staff at checkout that cost us late on our plane We had to wait until morning shift to come to sort the problem , I ve liked location of the hotel I loved the style of the hotel Comfortable room 
342620,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, No issues at all, The hotel was very quiet and clean The bed was very comfortable and the staff very friendly The hotel was central and very handy for the sights A Metro station was close by 
342621,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Nothing , It s a beautiful hotel located at the very heart of Vienna s inner city All the main atractions in Vienna are in just walking distance Front desk staff are friendly and very helpful Rooms are clean and comfortale 
342622,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, 1 There was not included in the price the breakfast no transparency about it it was not mention during booking phase 2 Oblige to live cash insurance 70 euro no transparency about it it was not mention during booking phase, Very good location cleaned
342623,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, A c in the room was not working had to have the window open most of the time Hotel staff did switch heating off and bring me a fan to the room , Great location friendly accommodating staff AMAZING food in the restaurant great breakfast
342624,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, The problem with smell in the bathroom caused but the inefficient ventilation system so that is not a very pleasant surprise in the morning Plus no complimentary water in the room because of the policy Manager recommended me to use the tap water I am surprised they do not charge for Internet ,No Positive
342625,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, There were several noisy events in the hotel which were very clearly heard in 1st floor rooms and 2 nights out of 5 disturbed sleep we did get a rebate for the disturbance but I don t expect that when paying so much particularly poor exchange rate and am unlikely to return, The location is perfect
342626,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, The hotel is very dated It looks like it has not been refurbished since 1970 s It has a 3 star feeling about it It was definitely the worst 5 star hotel we ever saw We could not wait to leave the place as it has ruined our stay in Vienna , Location services s pretty good 
342627,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Expensive for what you get No shower room only had a bath so very difficult to shower Limited shampoos and shower gel No slippers No robes Too much sound and noise as the room was on the first floor and street side The bartender was very rude when she served our complimentry drink and completey ignored me when I thanked her 3 times Expensive breakfast Very small reception Overall definitley not a 5 star hotel , Great location and modern
342628,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Great location close to most of the old city attractions Very comfortable room a lot of space and cool facilities Staff was very nice helpful and friendly 
342629,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, One of their staff was totally unfriendly and did not help us much Also one time we wanted to enter the elevator and there was enough space for me and my wife to enter the elevator but he just looked at us trying to catch up to the elevator and did not even bother trying to open the door before it closes Cold looks in his eyes we did not like how he looked at us or the way he was talking to us We stayed in a suite and the shower did not have a rubber at the edge of the door from the bottom to prevent the water from leaving the shower area and making us feel like the bathroom was hit by a rain storm , Some staff were nice and helped us get a better room Food was nice and clean The hotel has a nice style to it and I guess that is why the hotel is named Radisson Blu Style Hotel 
342630,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, We booked a room on booking com described as double twin share We specified twin share in the comments box When we arrived we were advised that the room was a double and we would need to pay an extra 300 for a twin share room As this bought the total room cost to 1375 it made the hotel less competitively priced compared with others in the area We felt that the advertising for the room was deceptive and misleading and we should have been told at the time of booking that a twin share was not available Next time we make a booking on booking com we will definitely be ringing the hotel to clarify the room type The reception area and availability of staff to assist with checking in and luggage was inadequate The minibar had limited variety The room was overheated and we had the windows open most of the time Overall we were disappointed with the hotel it s more of a 3 5 4 star not a 5 star , The hotel was close to many sites we wanted to see including the Christmas markets The room was modern the bathroom was new The breakfast was fine but not like the lavish breakfasts at other 5 star hotels I ve stayed at Dining room breakfast staff and cleaning staff were friendly and helpful 
342631,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Room got a little warm at night even with the AC on with 5 degrees outside , Incredible hotel and perfectly located Was able to get this room on bookings for 132Euro which is an amazing price for this hotel 
342632,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, There was one staff member looking after check in out as well as operating as the concierge While they were very helpful when there s a line of people waiting there s pressure to be hasty with questions bookings etc , Location excellent close to main attractions within walking distance The staff were very helpful 
342633,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, The room information book was far from accurate Eg we were told that we would get dressing gowns and slippers these were never provided and when we left the reception woman told me that these were in some special suites On the first evening we asked for two more pillows and the hotel did not have any Each day we asked for breakfast in our room On no day did the breakfast provided actually consist of the listed items Somedays there was one of something sometimes no plates etc , The room was warm and comfortable The staff were friendly but not well managed 
342634,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, House keeping could have been a little better Small room Pricey over new year, The room was a little small with a small window but beautiful bathroom Great water pressure was nice Overall very good hotel but stayed over the new year and prices were over the top everywhere Would definitely go again though as was located in the heart of Vienna
342635,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, room cleaning was inadequate finger washing cups bed sheets not changed for four days we had to insist on this to happen carpet vacuuming happened after we insisted the fifth day probably inexperienced underpaid cleaning stuff , very comfy at a keypoint location soft bed warm spacious rooms big bathroom great food rich breakfast polite service ease of payments installments stuff always available 
342636,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, I got a little shocked when I was told that there s no bottled water because you can drink water from the tap but other than that it s okay Please note that water from Vienna s faucets are potable , It was the location that made this property very attractive From the train station it s less than 5 minutes walk and you ll arrive at a picturesque hotel Being located at the city center it allows smooth movement across sights and shopping 
342637,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Advertised room service but not shown in room TV had very limited programmes Housekeeping service commenced at 08 00 so if you want a lie in make sure you put the Do not disturb sign out , The staff were very pleasant and helpful when we asked to change rooms as the one we were given was not up to expectations photographic licence be careful Good free WiFi 
342638,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, The room was not very clean in places that weren t easy to clean and would have taken some effort to clean under the sofa under the bed That s highly inacceptable for a hotel of this standard , A phenomenal suite with great amenities at a perfect location I couldn t imagine a better place to stay at 
342639,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Hotel lobby is all new and very stylish Rooms however seemed rather old and not very clean Curtains looked like they haven t been washed for a long time Overall cleanliness was not 100 satisfying considering it s a 5 star hotel TV was constantly flickering and thus not really usable Nevertheless a good place to stay at when in Vienna but mainly due to its location , Great location with most of Vienna s sights within walking distance Tube station right beside the hotel Extensive and fresh selection of food beverages at breakfast Personnel was very helpful and friendly 
342640,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, They should find a better way of putting up the curtains because it was blocking the airflow from the ac we had to leave the curtain open or the window Room 604, location and excellent breakfast
342641,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Nothing, The hotel is close to the heart of Vienna especially the Hofburg and within 10 minutes of walk along one of the best streets it is possible reach Stephansplatz The staff is courteous and the room is simply perfect 
342642,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, 1 House Keeping In general House Keeping requires a major shape up Room Service leftovers are being left at the corridors for 24 hours observed twice Amenities are not being topped up Rooms are not equipped with traditional facilities for coffee or tea Safe in room 402 is located right above the minibar As a result all items stored are heated 2 Rooms Categories In general I have booked twice the same category 3 2 nights Superior Double Room and was taken by surprise when I have realized after checking inn the second time that there is a major and significant difference between the rooms While room 501 was a small one with a tiny TV maybe 20 mirror style room 402 was twice the size with a large enough flat TV set Price wise I have paid the same which is completely unacceptable 3 Air Conditioning There is NO A C regardless the advertisement We had to open the windows for some cool fresh air I am a frequent guest at this hotel group and I do expect the management to take note in booth topicks highlighted above, Perfect Location Very good breakfast in a cosy dining room fresh spread and a very good service Smiling staff with a true will to overcome problems hickups including free of charge late checkout 
342643,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, TV is too small Insufficient drawers in room No place for suitcases Don t like Nespresso Choice of teas was peppermint or red berries in room No bathrobes no shower cap and impossible to get soap out of wrapping , Extra long bed Looks of the hotel and room 
342644,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Asked for high floor double and got first floor on the corner Has to be the noisiest room in the hotel There is no shower There is a low level shower over the bath which requires you to kneel Staff totally unsympathetic to our issues Blamed it all on booking Com and told us to book directly with the hotel on future Not at all happy with that response Am I being ripped off by booking com , Location was good
342645,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Housekeeping variable but when highlighted to reception they responded promptly, Junior suite was excellent good space and quiet Mini bar and breakfast included in the price 
342646,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, road work in front of hotel had to walk on street and entrance to hotel was a bit of hassle , very convenient location very near metro Hofburg palace walking distance to Graben Kolmart attentive staff 
342647,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, we were not informed about the road sidewalk construction work just by the hotel that started around 6 in the morning everyday beforehand Our room was still not ready after we had a walk around the city and we were given a room that exactly faces the construction although we asked if the room is on the other side and the answer was yes Reception area and staff insufficient Gym very insuficcient , Location
342648,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, When I made check in I got spacious room but it wasn t clean I asked stuff to fix it and they gave me another room it was smaller significant worse room It was too late and I was after 5 hours flight to ask them to replace but i guess it s logic if it s your fault you need appoligise and provide the same or better room It wasn t done In new my room there are a lot of woman long hair in bed in bathroom on the floor everywhere I can conclude cleaning wasn t done at all Once I was in hurry and left my cloths on the floor when I come back only my bad was mad but all room was in mess Reception is separate topic they are busy 24 hours on the phone or just one person is busy with queue of visitors It s 5 stars hotel really On the day of check out I left some medicine in hotel fridge and asked receptinist remind it to me when I come back for luggage in the evening Finally when I was in airport I realised I forgot it and I had to come back to the hotel again Of course it is my fault but I would like to notice it s 5 stars hotel it s not so difficult task to remind I don t recommend to stay in this hotel unclean room very unprofessional reception staff Never again I will stay in this hotel WORST HOTEL IN VIENNA ,No Positive

342654,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna,No Negative, After spending more than a week in traditional European hotels weird showers no air conditioning it was nice to have some American style amenities while in Vienna It s a fairly short walk to most of the major attractions Good English speakers at the front desk 
342655,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, The rooms are not sound proof There is currently building work directly outside the hotel that starts before 7am on week days , The bed was very comfortable and it was air condition worked well 
342656,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, The hotel was a little outdated Mattress was not very comfortable , This was a good 4 star hotel with good breakfast free mini bar Location next to the fabulous Central Cafe within walking distance of main shopping area Room was larger than most European hotels
342657,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, I liked every aspect of my stay , I liked the fact that the staff at the front desk gave me directions on how to find my way around town They also gave travel advice on how to get to Shopping City Sud The hotel was about 3minutes of walking to Hofburg palace and the parliaments The mini bar in my room was also free which was a good deal 
342658,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, arrived very late tired hungry and in pain from combination of arthritis and long haul flying needed food to be able to take meds No food available in hotes except junk in minibar or send out for pizza tried to walk to only thing available nearby mcdonalds I was desperate but couldn t find it and gave up because of pain At these prices a couple of pieces of fruit for new arrivals especially arriving so late would be good I won t stay here again Sometimes access to food is not a luxury but a necessity , comfy bed quiet 
342659,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, i travelled with a colleague Hotel had booked us a double instead of twin had to sleep on camp bed No recompense or apologies The coffee machine has no instructions there is no tea and you have to ring down for milk or kettle So useless and for a hotel of this cost I expect to be able to make a drink in room The breakfast cost is extortionate , Comfy beds location breakfast rooms were nice size Like the groovy lobby and the friendly bar area Good size TV with good selection of channels 
342660,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The hotel was close to my conference venue which is why I selected it The staff is very friendly and helpfull the location very good I enjoyed my stay 
342661,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, The lady working on the reception is not friendly and she gave me very bad first impression but on the other side the other two guys were very helpful and professional WiFi was so weak and the television channels were only the Austrian German ones For example bbc cnn or al Jazeera are not available while taking shower the water will leak a lot from under the door and it s really dangerous because you could slip easy when you will step on the floor , Breakfast was great and the female staff serving in the restaurant were amazing The concierge staff was very helpful Location was convenient 
342662,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Perfect location right in the middle of the city Extra friendly and very helpful staff Awesome steak in the bar when we couldn t walk any more Lovely room and en suite shower Very comfortable bed we slept soundly every night Highly recommend and we would definitely stay here again

342665,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, The carpet was wet in spots when we entered the room as if it had been stain treated The headboard had a tear in it The furniture seemed a bit worn out in the room The shower leaked all over the bathroom floor There was construction outside the hotel This information should be made available when making reservations The street work was being done throughout the night and it was very noisy It was also very difficult to get to the nearest parking garage I understand that there is nothing the hotel can do about the construction I just wish there was a way to know this when booking the room , The breakfast was delicious The staff was very nice and helpful The location of the hotel is ideal The room was large and the extra bed brought in for our adult daughter was clean and comfortable

342668,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Dining facility was extremely poor due to understaff kept waiting so long for our meal we left the hotel and found an excellent restaurant nearby If the Radisson Blu is offering dinging facilities then it should be staffed accordingly waiters and kitchen staff Chefs The delay with our first course was over thirty minutes and no feedback from the staff as to the reason behind the delay it must be assumed that there wasn t any cooking staff on site , The room and hotel location were excellent 
342669,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Nothing to complain Would love to go back tomorrow , Very friendly staff clean and spatious rooms Excellent location in heart of city close to U bahn Never seen honey that fresh look at photo 
342670,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, The bar could have stayed open a bit later for staying guests so we could continue to reflect with more nightcaps onemorefortheditch, Great fresh breakfast buffet with attentive staff who knew our daily drinks orders replenished anything missing immediately
342671,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Had to ask a receptionist to look for bartender because we were sitting in a bar for 10 minutes with zero staff in sight Not much of a view outside of the window just a wall of the next building across the narrow street They offer eggs benedict for breakfast that were a complete joke The egg itself was cooked hard and the whole thing was soaking in a lot of source which wasn t smooth as it s supposed to but rather had small crumbles in it In contrast their omelet and soft boiled eggs made on order are quite OK , Generally nice hotel attentive and helpful staff everything that we ve come to expect from a Radisson Reception was glad to help us with our restaurant reservations 
342672,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The location just opposite The Cafe Central minutes from the Spanish riding school Hofburg Palace Graben shopping area Helpful friendly staff We had a superior room great size lovely powerful shower free mini bar refilled once per day Nespresso coffee machine Good choice at the buffet breakfast Well done Radisson Blu Style Vienna Can t wait to visit again 
342673,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Both couples were given tiny rooms over the bar area Live music followed by recorded music went on till 12 30 at night on the Thursday The bathroom had a glass door about three feet from the side of the bed It was impossible to use the bathroom without waking each other up They did upgrade our rooms the next day however Very dissapointed the restaurant is closed at the weekend ,No Positive
342674,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Cleaning of the room and the supply of towels etc was poor Breakfast is extremely expensive for what is being provided Better to go to the nextdoor Cafe Central , location staff at the front desk is helpful
342675,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, No kettle in the room I had to bother housekeeping room service for boiled water for tea all the time , Great food and service at restaurants Wonderful room comfy clean bed good size room etc Very cosy ambience throughout hotel Modern elegant chic comfort without being impersonal 
342676,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Reception staff was ok but when i got back to Gib realised i had been charged twice for our stay and therefore my account is blocked and trying to sort things out with them was told i would be called back in 5 mins and it has been 2 and a half hours, The service of the bar staff and doormen
342677,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Lack of proper individual control of room temperature meant it was too hot in both rooms that my group occupied Bar area not cosy , Excellent location Helpful reception 
342678,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Nothing that I didn t like , Went there to celebrate my sisters 50th birthday Brilliant location for all the city centre museums and Hofburg Palace etc Staff so helpful and attentive to our needs Quiet room So good I don t want to shout about it or it ll get too popular 
342679,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, The gym facilities were much smaller than anticipated but they were adequate , Located close to the Hapsburg castle and St Stephen s Church Around the corner from the pedestrian shopping streets Well situated for anything you might want to see 
342680,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Definitely not a 5 stars hotel Service was poor we had to ask for the bathrobes and slippers on the second day when we realized although they were part of the accessories of the room they were not provided The used glasses were not replaced for two days I always thought that there is a night round of service in a 5stars hotel In this hotel it was only on the first night and then we had to take the covers and pillows When the ventilation or central heating we never quite understood what exactly it was started at 7am the sound was so strong that it was as if we were sleeping in the engine room The closet was very small and fit for a single room and it was a complete disorder the papers for breakfast laundry papers and sacs mixed and messy and half the hairdryer was missing Obviously nobody took a look after the previous clients had left One shampoo and one shower gel for two persons and the towels were old small and cheap quality , Location is perfect and the superior room was spacious
342681,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Overpriced breakfast Noisy street better take upper floors VERY POOR INTERNET It is easier to connect to the nearest free wifi than to RadissonGuest Please do something with it It simply doesn t connect to credentials page , Good location close to Hoffburgh Palace Cafe Central is just accross the street Everything is in walking distance 5 10 minutes 
342682,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Good location clean rooms good shower that is important for me Near the hotel locates Cafe centrale with good breakfasts Reception desk is friendly and helpful 
342683,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, Not too keen on the walk in shower but everything else was very good , The breakfast was so varied and fresh The rooms were very good The staff very friendly and helpful Location Excellent as well

342688,Radisson Blu Style Hotel Vienna, I chose this hotel after I read many reviews particularly noting about the air conditioners because it is somehow a problem in europe to find a good hotel with a good air conditioning system especially in summer but I didn t expects that I will face this problem in autumn The air conditioner in room 511 was not working properly which caused us interrupted sleep at nights as the room was warm We reported that to the receptionist and he promised to send someone from the maintenance The next day when we had the same problem we talked to recptionist again but this time he said that he cannot do anything about it and all what we can do is to open the windows , I asked for an early check in as we arrived at 7 am after a long journey and the receptionist thankfully gave us the room by 11 am The hotel s location in central within few minutes walk from the main shopping streets and restaurants The rooms are clean and breakfast was good
