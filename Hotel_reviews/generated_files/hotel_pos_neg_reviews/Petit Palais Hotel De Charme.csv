483194,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, We had to check out a day early due to an unexpected emergency Still the hotel clerk at the front desk insisted we d pay full price for the unused night ACCORDING TO THEIR POLICY even though we explained Wasn t their problem they just wanted us to pay for the room whether we d use it or not thanks a lot There isn t even a place in front of the hotel that allows for unloading loading luggage at check in check out and this on a very busy intersection one is always at the mercy of the local police To get to the hotel parking one must drive about 4 blocks into an underground parking structure the hotel obviously has some sort of arrangement with Parking is 20 per day The duomo is a brisk walk of good 15 minutes away and to get to the Brera zone where most of the better restaurants are located its an additional 10 minutes The fashion district is even farther although there are shops nearer they seemed to cater more to tourists All in all a disappointing experience , The room respectively the whole hotel is period style not really old it only appears that way Our room was on the 2nd floor no chance to open a window constant noise from the traffic and passing street cars was deafening until late Room was nicely furnished a bit crammed maybe We even had a small kitchenette with a fridge bathroom was ok too Breakfast is buffet style good selection plenty to choose from coffee is good 
483195,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, The location is about a good 15 mins walk from the cathedral however down the street there are lots of interesting shops , Staff were very courteous and kind Decoration was authentic and charming 
483196,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, Breakfast could be better coffee is great as well , Great location 10 mins walk from Duomo Not so touristic area but a lot of bars and cafes around with locals Charming old building with a small garden and great lobby area
483197,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, The breakfast could be improved but for Italy is ok, If you are looking for an hotel with a lot of charm and atmosphere a very nice and helpful staff then this hotel is for you The location is very central There s some traffic in the street but it s not an issue when windows are closed The breakfast is not exceptionnal but ok 
483198,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme,No Negative, The hotel is in a very good position for walking to the Duomo and the Navgli area and for public transport to all areas of the city and beyond The staff were so friendly and helpful with anything we needed We were upgraded to a suite on the third floor on arrival which was spacious comfortable and very clean There was tea coffee making facilities and a fridge which was nice to come back to after a day out We especially liked the little card left in our room giving the weather forecast for the next day For a city centre hotel it was surprisingly quiet 
483199,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, It is on the corner of two busy streets and the traffic is noisy Double glazing helps but the traffic woke us early , It has a unique charm and is quite spacious for a city hotel in this price bracket It is within walking distance from the Duomo and canal area and has a tram stop outside The breakfast is very good and served in a basement full of character 
483200,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme,No Negative, Charming hotel very helpfull staff delcisious breackfast Location is just perfect 10 min walk to Duomo and La Scala We will definetily come back 
483201,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, They ruined our trip They stole money and sunglasses from the car in the parking lot that works with the hotel And they did not try to help us, They ruined our trip They stole money and sunglasses from the car in the parking lot that works with the hotel
483202,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, Nothing, Wonderful bedding with extra pillows bathrobes slippers if needed Marble floors marble bathroom bar Immaculately decorated Balcony for fresh air to view the city Breakfast with lovely assortment and staff to prepare coffee of your choice Mario Danielle were helpful in every instance Bellman parked retrieved our rental car 
483203,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, Rom had a small kitchenette but it was not equipped no plates etc , The location is very very good only 10 min walking distance from the Duomo but still in a quiet neighbourhood Hotel is cosy full of history staff very friendly polite helpful and welcoming 
483204,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme,No Negative, Helpful and kind staff spacious well decorated and comfortable room with a mini kitchen good location the breakfast with good variety A unique experience of classic glory and elegance I highly recommend it and will stay there again 
483205,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, The bathroom very small Shower not enough even for one person and very week water and not fixed propaply to the wall The restaurant for breakfast in the basement with humidity smell , They allow me for early check in
483206,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, I chose it with photos and a number of reviews but imagine it was not a fair review because I did not write how much the person who wrote the review stayed Because we could not cancel it we decided to borrow two nights with more than 60 000yen rooms per night but the situation and amenities of the facilities none of them were of that quality either , This hotel s good point is only location 
483207,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, Hotel under staff Hotel and all facilities are very old Too many decorations Hotel very stuffy Toilets so old and shower area very small , Breakfast buffet is good
483208,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme,No Negative, Petit Palais Hotel de Charme is one of the best boutique hotels we have stayed in and we have stayed in some beautiful hotels residences Right for when we arrived the being made most welcome by Adrisha I hope I got your name correct to the wonderful surprise of been upgraded to a junior suite Adrisha was the most wonderful guide host full of great information so we were made to feel at home in Milan This boutique hotel is our home in Milan Love Lui Luka
483209,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme,No Negative, The hotel is almost in the middle of Duomo and Navigli area therefore very easy to walk to both The room was spacious so was the bed Very comfy and convenient hotel The breakfast had many options and was ok 
483210,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, The only con is the fact that the hotel is right on the corner of a relatively busy junction Light sleepers might find the noise of traffic disturbing , A small hotel in a perfect location to venture into town on foot Friendly staff Hotel is decorated in lush romantic style which gives it a nice atmosphere 
483211,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, Rooms and furniture certainly need renovation Bathroom shower had missing pieces towels were torn with holes and Kitchenette remained from 60 s Mattress could be hard for many Despite being upgraded to Juinor Suite space was at premium Choose a quiet room as those facing the street could be noisy , Old style common areas Reception staff was nice and helpful Breakfast was okay Location was convenient to major attractions of the city 10 15 minutes away from Duomo Scala Palazzo Reale 
483212,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, The shower looked a bit old and had some stains on the bottom probably due to high usage but otherwise clean , The position of the hotel is perfectly central and ideal to walk around Milan The antique decor is also quite cute and the rooms are very cozy 
483213,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, I think the two biggest downsides were The fact that even though we had a queen size single bed it actually has two mattresses side by side making the sleep very uncomfortable if you re staying in the middle In 4 days we didn t have our soap shampoo or similar items changed at all Unfortunately we were returning quite late in the hotel so I didn t have the chance to ask for new ones regardless it should be a default action for a 4 stars hotel , Very good location rather close to most of the key places everyone should visit Friendly staff good simple breakfast and have to say it an amazing building which sends a constant vibe of a classy old architecture with each decoration in the room 
483214,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, Unfortunately we had loads of mosquitos We never opened the windows so we think they came through the vents The aircon was terrible Way to hot even when it was turned right down by staff and the fan upped , Really lovely place to stay The room was very spacious and cute Staff were very friendly and recommend the the most amazing restaurants All attractions were close and within walking distance 
483215,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, Everything was Wonderful Could not finding anything wrong AT ALL , Attention to detail clean BEST breakfast of the 8 hotels we stayed in Italy over our 1 month trip Wonderful I don t understand how some places in pretty ocean side locations get over 9 ratings when they have poor or no breakfast when this hot gets under 9 should be getting almost a 10
483216,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, We didn t like the attitude of the Indian waiter in the breakfast room He hardly smiles and responds to our requests after some time , This is a very nice small hotel The rooms are very clean and big and the receptionists are very friendly and helpful Plus you feel the luxury when you are served with sliver plates and silver cutlery 
483217,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, We spent a night in a 200 euro suite The hotel is located at a crossroad with heavy traffic day and night The room was relatively small and narrow as the hotel itself As you don t open the windows to the noisy street and you get breakfast in the cellar you ll never see daylight in this hotel When we had a missunderstandig with the reservation the friendly man at the welcome desk did not even try to get in touch with booking com At last we learned that it needs more than a couple of old furnitures in a hotel to have charme Do not expect too much of this 4 stars hotel , Nice an clean little room Decent staff 
483218,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, More plugs in the rooms , Stunning property very comfortable beds big cupboard very helpful staff could walk to all main attractions Photos are truthful We got upgraded to a junior suite with kitchenette Would stay again in this property
483219,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, The smaller bedroom where husband slept had extremely hard mattress and full foam pillow so sleeping was more difficult The TV comes on to Italian station when entering room and we don t even like that in our home The controls for the TV were difficult to figure out and there were no instructions that we found We did not find a local guide book of suggestions in our room which would have been nice The ice machine requires bothering the front desk to get it filled which means waiting if the person is busy , The room was quiet well located large and very well appointed in period works with a private patio in 2 bedrooms and living room Very luxurious Hotel situated several blocks from central city was an easy walk with many good restaurants around 
483220,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, Whilst the hotel was well presented it does not cover its age Having said that this is one of the much better boutique hotels we have stayed in Italy I can image it being a 4 5 hotel in its glory days , A little cute hotel b b a few minutes away from the city center Very friendly and helpful staff The hotel room was very clean and nicely presented 
483221,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, 1 The staff at reception was OK but not the best felt more like interns who were still learning how to do the internal processing at the check in and check out 2 location a bit noisy but bearable 3 with kitchen appliances in the suite it would be good to have at least a couple of forks and knives , Great rooms clean and cozy hotel great breakfast and very friendly staff Close to the city center 15 min lazy walk to Duomo 
483222,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, This has nothing to do with the hotel but we got a cab from the train station to the hotel We only had the name of the hotel not the address The cabbie was very annoyed at us made a big deal of telling us hotel names change so much asked a number of other cab drivers if they knew the hotel One did so we got there fine About 15 Our advice have the address with you as well , The rooms were spacious the bed comfy the reception staff exceptional We were given a place to try for lunch literally 3 mins walk from the hotel Fantastic The location is fabulous We walked everywhere We would stay here again no problems 
483223,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme,No Negative, Staff were fantatistic friendly and helped advise us on good restaurants and places to see Hotel is beautiful and tastefully decorated Our visit was for my wife s birthday and they gave us a great room Breakfast was super plenty of proper coffee made freshly We will stay here again 
483224,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, While the rooms in the ad Jr suite look to be large and roomy that not the case The European shower was small the kitchen area was combined with the sitting area again small I felt cramped , walking distance to most sights Public transport right outside the door Great d cor both lobby area and rooms

483230,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, Very small shower no parking even on street making it difficult for taxis to stop especially in peak hour traffic just felt small as the name petit suggests If you have no space issue its charming, Entrance hall charming decor very helpful staff tram just outside very clean
483231,Petit Palais Hotel De Charme, The room faced onto the street nice in one way but noisy if the doors were opened While I haven t previously used an ironing service in Europe I found 22 Euro s excessive to press a pair of pants and a light top But I couldn t have the crumpled look for La Scala and overall it was great that this service was provided within a couple of hours , A charming small boutique hotel with so much character The room was spacious with a lovely ambience and the little courtyard with its lovely plants and quaint furnishings a delight All the staff were very friendly and most helpful with any queries as well as arranging the airport transfer The location was OK about a 15 minute stroll to the centre and even walking alone at night in the district I felt safe Very good selection for the buffet breakfast beautifully presented and of a high quality A most attentive waitress who greeted me each morning as a most welcome guest
