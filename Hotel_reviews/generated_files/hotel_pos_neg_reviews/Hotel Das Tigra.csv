466637,Hotel Das Tigra, Breakfast wasn t included and price was 20 euros which was a little too expensive in my opinion, Comfy bed with lovely comforters Nicely updated rooms Construction across the street but quiet at night Staff were very kind 
466638,Hotel Das Tigra,No Negative, Locatoin is superb a few minutes to 2 metro station and even closer to Hop on off bus stops and a very nice cafe which serves great draft beers The gesture demonstrated by the whole hotel ie offering complentary sparkling wine and half price in lobby bar for constrution site next to hotel which creates some noice which overall is managable 
466639,Hotel Das Tigra, The wi fi in the rooms isn t great it isn t easy to have conference calls for work on Skype the bathroom needs a better shower curtain room was flooded after a shower The location is very central in one of the more attractive parts of the inner city but the street the hotel is located on is pretty unattractive boring 200m walk to the main road but that isn t the hotel s fault , Great modern 4 hotel with totally renovated rooms rare in Vienna in this category where the buildings are ancient and the rooms of other hotels are old the building site mentioned in other reviews didn t cause any problems Friendly staff pleasant rooms and good location I ve been there twice now and it feels like a home away from home in beautiful Vienna 
466640,Hotel Das Tigra, Across the hotel Something is being built A lot of noise coming from the working place So the hotel cant do anything about it offcourse it really put an end to a good sleep , Large rooms got a sort of upgrade 
466641,Hotel Das Tigra, Some building work going on opposite hotel but the noise was minimal and unobtrusive , Excellent location a few minutes walk from main shopping area and major attractions Room was spotlessly clean great breakfast selection
466642,Hotel Das Tigra, Bench for large luggage was a bit small , Excellent selection at breakfast Room was comfortable and roomy Staff were friendly considerate and even packed a snack for an early morning trip to Salzburg 
466643,Hotel Das Tigra, Perhaps the bar service could have been better but I m just being picky , The location of the hotel was perfect for all that Vienna had to offermand only about 12 15 euros in a taxi from the train station if you catch the airport express train The Spanish horse school and a variety of museums were very close by and many restaurants to choose from in the evening as the hotel didn t serve evening meals The hotel was completely full but still very quiet and relaxed atmosphere The breakfast which we hadn t realized was included in the price was excellent with a good variety on offer and set us up for the day The breakfast room staff were friendly and welcoming especially Sairene who was particularly helpful The Coffee was perfect All in all a great experience and would stay again 
466644,Hotel Das Tigra, I cannot think of anything that could be better , Hotel Das Tigra lies in a quiet street in Vienna Currently they are building a new apartment complex just across the street This means that workers arrive around 6 45 When the windows are closed it will not bother you However the hotel has also supplied some foam ear pieces which I didn t have to use Be aware that the hotel is not very close to the subway it is about a 10 minute walk to the nearest station For me this is fine no problem I actually like that the hotel is a bit away from the crowd I have stayed here many times and it is always a pleasure The staff is always very kind without exception To put it simply this is my No 1 choice when traveling to Vienna 
466645,Hotel Das Tigra, The staff at breakfast were rude and made me feel like I was imposing because of this I chose to eat breakfast out each day which worked out cheaper, The concierge and check in were amazing they allowed my to get into a room early and store a bag late Having travelled alone and arriving after being robbed this was an amazing blessing and it felt incredibly welcoming
466646,Hotel Das Tigra, Nothing really, The front office staff were very helpful at the time of check in and check out They guided us very well to make the most of a walking tour for attractions like Hofburn State opera St Stephan Cathedral etc around the hotel and with travel plans to Schonbrunn and the airport by public transport The stay was very comfortable and memorable 
466647,Hotel Das Tigra, The bar in the hotel while offering 50 off drinks because of the building work opposite could not manage a whiskey with ginger ale and when we asked for Gin and Tonic the bar man took out bitter lemon not tonic However we learned later that he was a new member of staff It would be nice to have a lounge to sit in that is not the main reception area , The proximity to the centre of Vienna was great The breakfast choice was amazing and very tasty 
466648,Hotel Das Tigra, Separate toilet and bathroom in room , Breakfast was very good great selection Room was very comfortable plenty of space Welcome chocolates were a nice touch 
466649,Hotel Das Tigra, Nothing , The local was right in the town centre The staff were extremely helpful and polite We arrived after midnight and the reception was open so we were able to check in without any problems Our room was spacious very clean and comfortable Would highly recommend this hotel
466650,Hotel Das Tigra,No Negative, The hote was in a central location And the room was very comfortable There was a fabulous breakfast included The staff was extremely helpful with directions and booking things for us We would highly recommend this hotel 
466651,Hotel Das Tigra, The lobby was not very welcoming a little dark and cramped , Breakfast buffet was excellent with plenty of choice cappuccinos etc were included The staff were very helpful and friendly they recommended a great restaurant for us and happily booked taxis for us Their English was excellent which was very helpful The beds were comfy and the rooms were spacious and clean The hotel was in an excellent location vey central within walking distance of all attractions 
466652,Hotel Das Tigra, A very small thing shower in a bath but this is not unusual in European Hotels , We were given a suite upgrade from a junior suite for free and the room was comfortable and excellent size Location of Das Tigra very good 
466653,Hotel Das Tigra, Cannot complain about any thing , We loved the central location of the hotel on the Old Town Upon checkin one of the best suggestions was to take a walking tour of the old town given our limited stay period A tour was outlined to us o The map and we covered a lot of ground Also appreciated suggestions for restaurant They very good quality at reasonable prices We were treated extremely well 
466654,Hotel Das Tigra, Lift was very slow and too small for the number of rooms towels were hard and not very absorbent, room was large and spacious location was good walking distance to all tourist attractions and transport links
466655,Hotel Das Tigra, There was absolutely nothing that I didn t like I liked everything And I hope to return , I honestly couldn t say enough nice things about this hotel It was fabulous in every respect I only wonder why its not a 5 as I think it should be Staff were so friendly and efficient The room was quite large and the bathroom was superb Breakfast caters for all tastes
466656,Hotel Das Tigra, Wi fi in my first room simply didn t work luckily I was able to change to another room closer to the router but this shouldn t happen anyway especially as was doing a business conference call , Nice room and great service not as old and pokey as other hotels of similar standard in Vienna The building works didn t bother me too much and 50 at the bar is good compensation 
466657,Hotel Das Tigra, Not the fault of the hotel at all but heavy construction going on across the street with jackhammers starting before 0730 This is a big project and will not be done soon It would be fine if I was traveling on business and was planning to wake early but not so much on vacation , Super helpful staff
466658,Hotel Das Tigra, There is major construction across the street starting at 7 AM but the hotel offset that by offering half price drinks on everything in the bar How about a good bottle of Gruner Veltlinger for only 13 euros , The staff were great and very helpful especially Henry the bartender and the front desk staff Rooms were large and comfortable The hotel has history it is made up of 4 old townhouses that have been joined together Mozart lived in one of them as a 6 year old and then again later as a young man in another All the wall hangings celebrate this fact Location right in the center of old town Breakfast was typical Austrian Germanic a huge spread of cold cuts cheeses salads fruit many breads and scrambled eggs bacon and sausages Something for every taste 
466659,Hotel Das Tigra, The rain However the weather was pretty good Loved Vienna so no complaints, The receptionist was extremely helpful and friendly with good suggestions Lovely room for my daughter Full marks
466660,Hotel Das Tigra, Unfortunately a huge construction site is right in front of the property I would recommend to mention that during the booking Very bad and strong noise , Unfortunately a huge construction site is right in front of the property I would recommend to mention that during the booking Very bad and strong noise 
466661,Hotel Das Tigra, I would only mark the hotel down slightly on value for money as it was quite a high price per night but that is the way of things in Vienna I guess , Really friendly staff very helpful Clean rooms Good choice of food at breakfast 
466662,Hotel Das Tigra, Rooms were hot and AC didn t seem to work There is a building site opposite and nightclub not far away so it can be loud at night , Location is excellent and you are right in the heart of Vienna Bed is very comfy in a nicely furnished room and good quality bathroom Well worth a stay if it can be had for a cut down price 
466663,Hotel Das Tigra, the room is very hot in April I couldn t sleep because the cooling system not working in winter only heating also we open the window but it was noisy till 3 am too much people talking and laughing I think there NightClub down street We couldn t sleep in the hotel I highly not recommend it , Nothing I like except the location and the stuff of the breakfast buffet
466664,Hotel Das Tigra, 1 There s construction going on on the opposite side of the hotel but we didn t experience any noise problem during our stay 2 No ventilation in either the toilet or bathroom 3 The AC was a bit warm I didn t want to open the windows as the street noise may disturb our sleep 4 The pillows were my biggest complaint They were way too flat and fluffy to my liking 5 Very flimsy door card signage It kept flying away whenever we open close the doors 6 Most of the interesting channels were not available in English language , We stayed at this hotel for three nights Superior Double Room Though not the most modern hotel I ve ever seen I was incredibly impressed with the room layout and storage space It s rare to see such a well thought out and functional room these days But Hotel Das Tigra hit all the right marks with the ample amount of shelves tabletops electrical sockets and wall hangers The room was extremely clean with excellent wifi We didn t try the breakfast so cannot comment on that The staff were friendly and the hotel was situated in a pretty central location around 10 mins walk to the city centre 15 mins ride to the train station and around 30 mins from the airport The staff were friendly and helpful We were very happy with our choice and would choose to stay here again next time 
466665,Hotel Das Tigra, Major repair works are taking place in front of the hotel and might last for quite long time Unfortunately the staff gave me a room at the first floor facing the entrance to the repair area Very noisy works started at 5 40am The earplugs offered by the hotel were clearly not enough to ensure a good sleep The WiFi in my room was very slow and required a login each time I tried to access the web , The room was cosy and clean Probably the great position is the best asset of the hotel 
466666,Hotel Das Tigra, noise from renovation next door, Helpful staff in changing my room to a better and less noisy one Not charging for last night even though I checked out very late 
466667,Hotel Das Tigra, Next door building site was really a pain i but the staff made aware of this and consequently I accepted this as just another experience which will dissappear before i come next time , Everything is fine good location for the city centre staff is very friendly and nice excellent but a bit expensive breakfast 
466668,Hotel Das Tigra, It was a bit noisy due to construction work going on However in general no other comments , The staff was very helpful The hotel is nicely located Breakfast was nice though not too much choice 
466669,Hotel Das Tigra, Major problem with the noise from the building site across the road starting before 6 30 in the morning Hotel staff were very apologetic and gave us free drinks but it s outside their control a real shame At least Saturday and Sunday mornings were quiet , Pleasant room large comfy bed spacious shower and clean tidy communal areas

466671,Hotel Das Tigra, There was a construction just in front of the hotel and beside the legislation and all efforts of the hotel team to minimize the noise this was a little bit annoying people revolving rocks at 6 am , Everything was nice and the crew was very helpfull and attencious 
466672,Hotel Das Tigra, There is building works going on across the street but there was no noise before 8am and the hotel compensated by 50 off at the bar and also gave 2 out of the 3 days breakfasts for free Did not affect us is any way , Staff were excellent being both helpful and attentive Location was great and had lovely bars cafes and sights nearby Hotel was spotless and allowed for a very enjoyable trip
466673,Hotel Das Tigra, At best this hotel is a 3 5 star There is construction directly facing most of the rooms The more elevated the room the better but the bystanders that attend what appears to be a bar facing the hotel generates additional noise And the ear plugs provided just don t cut it , The location is excellent It s in walking distance of most cafes and shopping areas 
466674,Hotel Das Tigra, There is no restaurant in the hotel to eat dinner, Very comfortable bed Good location very close to the city center Friendly and helpful staff
466675,Hotel Das Tigra, The street the hotel is in is a bit scruffy not helped by current building works opposite major development however noise from site only apparent 7am 4pm weekdays and not at all on weekends Most guests would be out sightseeing in the day so of no consequence Hotel compensates with 50 discount on bar bill If you are the kind of guest who prefers to loiter in the hotel during the day or to use for a business meeting this would not be suitable, Very friendly and helpful staff Comfortable sitting area in lobby and within walking distance to the main sights Short walk about one block to local cafes restaurants There are more central hotels but this represented excellent value for being in near proximity Please note there is no restaurant onsite and public areas limited To a small bar and lobby Great base for sightseeing Several lifts to all floors Rooms are spacious and modern and up to date bathrooms with walk in showers No views of course being a city hotel Would definitely use again

466777,Hotel Das Tigra, The individual duvets I was not surprised because I had seen this in previews reviews But really single duvets in a double bed Not a good choice and went against comfort even though the bed itself was good The welcome could have been more enthusiastic The taxi to the airport while it s not the hotel s fault the driver did not seem familiar with the bus station and was not able to communicate in English not a flaw in itself but necessary for what we needed to accomplish resulting in him leaving me past the station entrance where I could not see it and telling me that he did not know where I should go I was about 10 meters from the entrance but the moment was very stressful until I discovered that as no one in the street was able to help either It would be helpful if when calling a taxi the hotel could ensure that either the driver can communicate with the passenger or knows where the tourist needs to go for his travel They changed to nicer thicker round soap on the last day of my stay the previous super thin tablets were inconvenient , In general characteristics that you would expect were up to standard room size cleanliness comfort etc A daytime gentleman from reception his name may be Martin not sure was super helpful 
466778,Hotel Das Tigra, Parking was not onsite and a little distance from the hotel Not a major problem but you could at least drop off passengers and luggage in front of the hotel , Although a little tricky to find this hotel is pretty well located and not a long walk from tourist attractions and the main shopping area The service provided by staff was very good professional and helpful The rooms are well appointed and quite large in size Windows open to allow fresh air into the room WIFI coverage is excellent Had breakfast included in our room rate and this was very good Not a massive array of food but enough to provide you with a good filling breakfast I was a bit reluctant to stay here being Best Western but was very impressed overall by this hotel Would definitely stay here again 
466779,Hotel Das Tigra, Parking is a bit far from the hotel and you have to go and park your car yourself The suite we got upgraded to had some issues with the electrical installation we informed the staff I hope they have managed to fix it , The hotel is conveniently located on a quiet street very close to the main attractions of the city We got upgraded to a junior suite which was recently renovated and very comfortable Staff was very nice and helpful Breakfast was ok 
466780,Hotel Das Tigra, The room was too dark with small windows Also the price was a little stiff but I think the location is the main reason , The location of this hotel is just perfect it is so close to the Hopfburg palace St Stephan Cathedral and to the metro station The room itself was ok not too special kind of small and dark But it was really clean and it had everything we needed The breakfast had a very good selection Also the staff was extremely polite and helpful
