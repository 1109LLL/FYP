154088,Grange Clarendon Hotel, very hot in top floor fan in the room but still hot had room service one night very expensive and to have breakfast in the hotel was expensive so we went out for breakfast, location great staff friendly
154089,Grange Clarendon Hotel,No Negative, Well placed property in the centre of London close to the British Museum The Staff is welcoming and helpful and basic needs are dutifully attended 
154090,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The only thing was the price for breakfast which we thought was bit steep as it was 23 so we went elsewhere but other than that I couldn t fault the hotel and its wonderful staff I would definitely stay here again , The hotel was fantastic and the staff were amazing and willing to help us in every way possible and they went out of their way as I had my mum and my eldest daughter who is 5 The location was fantastic as we were near to Great Ormond Street hospital which was the purpose of our stay there but we also were very near to the theatre to see wicked and shops were within walking distance also Our room was fantastic and very clean and fantastic space 
154091,Grange Clarendon Hotel, No air conditioning We thought that it would be ok because was supposed to be in the low 70s high 60s Few days and only 73 and 74 Then 77 78 Few others even with in the windows wide open and there is little air in the room on the third floor It was unbearably hot and we did not sleep well the entire time we were there Staff was nice we ended up getting three fans instead of one and it was still awful Because of that I would never stay at this property or any other non AC property in London again during the summer The lobby is tiny with just a few sets of chairs and a small couch , Bedding was nice bed was comfortable bathroom is huge by European standards Room was clean is the location that makes this place have higher ratings Staff here really do an excellent job they re friendly courteous welcoming and provided anything that was asked they really did a superb job They should all be commended everybody We had a particular maid who did a really nice job with cleaning in the room 
154092,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Furnishings could be updated The room was quite small I was initially upgraded to the executive room initially but changed rooms since this room was in the basement and was not comfortable in the hot weather since it was musty smelling and no AC and no ability to leave a window open since it is on the ground level The hotel was very accommodating with this change , The location was good not far from the train station and centrally located to several parks The hotel decor was very nice Plenty of hot water in the shower Comfortable bed and pillows Hotel provided a fan since there was none in my room I ordered the chicken tikka masala from room service and it was fine 
154093,Grange Clarendon Hotel, the shower doors were hanging off The net curtain in the bath room had a large tear in it The room was way too hot yes we were there during reasonably warm weather but it was much hotter inside our room than outside of it The windows won t stay open we had to jam something under them to keep them open a crack The mattress on our bed needed replacing I kept rolling into the dip created by my husband , very helpful staff great location not far from tube and walkable distance to many places for shopping and sight seeing Good quality toiletries supplied fan and hairdryer supplied tea and coffee in rooms and you can request milk from reception 
154094,Grange Clarendon Hotel, For a 150 a night room not including breakfast we would expect to have an air conditioned room but on a warm humid summer day evening night in London it was not a pleasant experience Room was also quite small so along with the lack of A C we had the overall impression of poor value for money However at a cheaper rate without the uncomfortable temperature in the room the hotel was nice , Well located characterful hotel 
154095,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Room was too hot even with Windows open as there is no air con Also very noisy street , Friendly staff and clean good sized room Plenty of storage which is unusual foe London hotels Close to tube and also to a couple of lovely little parks 
154096,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Air con would have been better it was really warm in the room , The bed was comfy but the room was odd it sloped to one side quite considerably There was no air con but a fan was provided We slept with the window open without much distraction from outside 
154097,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Breakfast finishes at 10am and I think it would be great if it finished at 10 30 11am It would make the stay that bit more relaxing after a night out , When we arrived at the hotel they had overbooked and so upgraded us to their Tower Bridge hotel and paid for a taxi there At the Grange Tower Bridge they upgraded our room added a complimentary breakfast and arranged complimentary taxis to get us back over to the Covent Garden area of town The staff were excellent and I can t rate them highly enough at both of the hotels They were helpful with directions and things to do THe concierge staff in particular went out of their way to assist us 
154098,Grange Clarendon Hotel, No Air conditioning and views were of scaffolding so leaving windows open overnight didn t feel comfortable due to safety as windows are sash windows They do supply a fan in the room but it had limited effect Extra bed was not very comfortable Continental breakfast was okay but a bit expensive , Nn the good side it is well positioned with friendly staff and the room was a very good size They do supply a fan in the room but it has limited effect 
154099,Grange Clarendon Hotel, I had to wait a bit to collect my left luggage but i think that was a one off situation , Great location for theatres British Museum Covent Garden and tube stations Holborn and Russell Square plus for Kings Cross St Pancras train stations It was a nice quiet hotel The room was large and spacious Staff were friendly and efficient Would recommend it 
154100,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The cost of the breakfast was ridiculously expensive 22 for a cooked breakfast and 18 for continental 40 in total just for breakfast Let the stay down a little Wish we d known there was a cafe down the road that offered cooked breakfasts for 7, Great Location comfortable stay So happy a fan was provided in the room Tea coffee and hairdryer also provided Close walking distance of Holborn tube station and lovely sicilian avenue for food and drinks Large bedroom and bathroom
154101,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Some rooms are in the basement and we got onevof those but we complained and got a room on second floor instead I would never have stayed in these rooms in the basement especially as there were some constructions work going on just outside the window ,No Positive
154102,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The room was baking hot The kettle didn t work There was loud conversation under my window until the early hours And there was scaffolding up which had I had known I wouldn t have booked We wanted a nice lie in on our vacation, The location is great and the staff were nice
154103,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The insane noise that occurred for over an hour at 6am Was unacceptable We weren t the only guests to complain Sounded like a faulty macerator going crazy To be honest I had forgotten about it until now and a member of staff ensured us that we would be compensated and given an explanation , The room bed and sofa was very comfortable 
154104,Grange Clarendon Hotel,No Negative, THE GARDEN ROOM ARE LOVELY AND THE HOTEL LOCATION IS PERFECT FOR SEEING THE SIGHTS AND FOR THE THEATERS WE CAN HIGHLY RECOMEND THE LION KING SHOW AND 42 STREET SHOW BOTH ARE FANTASTIC SHOWS TO SEE 
154105,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The hotel was undergoing a face lift and had scaffolding at the front This wouldn t of been an issue but we had workmen outside our room window sanding window frames until 5pm on the day of our arrival and again at 8 30 am the next morning making it very difficult and uncomfortable to shower and get changed We were not informed of work going on at time of booking , The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful although I am still waiting for the general manager to contact me with reference to a complaint I made The hotel was very clean and comfortable and in a great location 
154106,Grange Clarendon Hotel, It wasn t very clean or air con only had a little fan to keep us cool in the heat And was very expensive for what you got , Staff was great and polite was close to train station and shopping mall 
154107,Grange Clarendon Hotel, We were upset because of accommodating us on the basement floor with the view to the stone wall I think guests shall be informed about such possible surprises and be able to choose the room in advance Staff was neither pleasant or unpleasant we didn t catch a single emotion from them during our stay Rooms were quite small and had views scratches on the furniture unsteady table dirty or corrupted ceramic tiles in the bathroom etc Because of the basement floor there was a noise above us specially in the morning from the kitchen I guess our neighbors were also complaining on that Kettle is weirdly placed in the small locker with the wire fixed to it so it s impossible to move it around Hopefully we were spending the whole day outside and used the hotel room only for a sleep Price is somewhat high for the overall quality of service nothing was really wonderful , The hotel is situated rather well Oxford street is in 5 minutes by walk Covent Garden is even more close one can simply walk to eastern or western parts of London Piccadilly line is also in 5 minutes which is convenient for traveling to from Heathrow airport by tube The street on which the hotel is placed is quite and nice looking Rooms are clean and have kettle with tea milk facilities complemented by refreshable biscuits PC and printing facilities in the lobby 
154108,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Room was bettered Well made up but broken doors old TV with difficult menu shower door was hard work and the windows were old and broke, Nice reception brilliant location and friendly staff 
154109,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Only bug for me was free wifi Yes there is basic wifi that is free for light surfing Well it had the speed of pre broadband dial up According to in house info in room there was super speed but charge of 10 for 24 hrs I thought it too steep so put up with basic Might be an issue for some I was a bit miffed at first as one specific criteria for my stay was wifi that didn t freeze every other page , Good location for course in Holborn Very nice well appointed room Staff really friendly very comfy 
154110,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Hotel was quiet noisy at night could hear everything going on next door upstairs and even from the room underneath Room in hallway was not on a sensor so it was on the entire night which made the room light though the doorway cracks,No Positive
154111,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The shampoo was not good It completely ruined my hair and I had to buy a new one from cosco But other than that it was a great stay , The bed was amazing and the service was excellent 
154112,Grange Clarendon Hotel, I was given a basement room where you could hear the tube as a low rumble every two minutes and the heating made a loud rushing sound all night long I was also next to the lift shaft Probably about the worst room in the hotel so maybe not fair to judge the place on this one experience , Felt like a little bit of luxury when walking in which is often not the case for converted town houses that can be creaky smelly and claustrophobic This building sparkled throughout 
154113,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The price seemed a little high but as a person travelling from the north east of Scotland it would be , I liked how close it was to local public transport to major locations The size of the room was adequate to what we needed 
154114,Grange Clarendon Hotel, If I have to pick something the bed pillows could maybe be a little comfier They were ok but a little too firm for me , All superb would definitely stay again Location Staff Room
154115,Grange Clarendon Hotel, We did not have breakfast at the hotel purely because of the cost which was extremely high There are plenty of places near by serving full breakfast at a fraction of the cost e g The Weatherspoons pub less than 5 mins away serves full cooked breakfast at 1 3rd of the price , Quad and triple rooms were very spacious Staff extremely friendly and accomodating
154116,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Shower was not great it was weak and the screen over the bath was broken Hate having long life milk and not enough breakfast tea Lots of fruit teas , Loved the location could walk everywhere The room was spacious and light with a great view Good breakfast even though it is expensive
154117,Grange Clarendon Hotel,No Negative, The location of this property was brilliant We could walk to many different areas which was brilliant so we didn t miss the sights of the city The staff were friendly and helped wherever they could In the room there was a fan provided as it was warm and the window could be left open as the street was not busy 
154118,Grange Clarendon Hotel,No Negative, You could walk to most places in 20minutes We walked to Euston station Covent Garden and Carnany street The hotel is really close to Russell Square garden where there was a lovely cafe for breakfast 
154119,Grange Clarendon Hotel, I arrived at the hotel around 13 00 and the check in appeared to be at 15 00 which is enormously late for tourists Because after a long flight you need to get a shower or change your clothes Since the check in was late it was quite irritating As for the check out it was at 11 00 am which is also very early normally it is supposed to be till 12 00 But you can keep your bags in a safety room till the time you leave the hotel , The rooms were very clean and spacious As for the location it was 3 minutes walk to the Underground and close the British museum 
154120,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Receptionist was very rude to porter infront of a queue of guest checking in Very arkward Bedroom was sooo warm and stuffy turned of radiator and had window wide open Cupboard with kettle in smells really bad, Great location and overal nice Hotle and building
154121,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The ground floor bedrooms facing the road should be put out of commission its the noisiest night and mornings lack of sleep experienced in a long while , The hotel Location was OK transport links easy reach 
154122,Grange Clarendon Hotel, I was upgraded to a King size room on the Lower Ground floor i e the basement The room was obviously underneath the dining room and I was woken at 6 30am by someone walking constantly across a room The bed was most uncomfortable , The staff were friendly I was upgraded to a King size room It was clean and tidy and I had everything that I needed 
154123,Grange Clarendon Hotel, This is very personal but the pillows are extremely soft and flatten too easily Also the floor of our room on 3rd floor was not level so we had the feeling of lying uneven, Location is very good rooms are clean hotel in itself is quiet staff prevenant We have been in one of the Grange hotels in this area before and would return again 
154124,Grange Clarendon Hotel, If I had to criticise it would be that the hotel was too warm, The room was superb The location of the hotel was great not far from the tube and close to the nightlife without it being noisy
154125,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Would have preferred a walk or step into shower No pictures that I could see on website showing bathroom in full so we did not know this until we arrived Cushions and throw on bed in my view could have benefited with a wash , Location 
154126,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Room was small less then the 20m2 said there was no mini bar old furniture In the bathroom the windows where with big gaps between them therefore it was cold The objrcts in the bathroom where poorly maintaned as toilet paper dispenser etc , The staff was very helpful and location os very good 
154127,Grange Clarendon Hotel, They couldn t fit me in for dinner even though we were paying guests and also breakfast was 22 each really WiFi was beyond useless , Location couldn t have been better and room was upgraded for free and so was very large Very good value for money in London 
154128,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Our room was below ground level which wasn t ideal but ok as we only stayed one night , Staff were attentive and beds comfortable and clean Rooms a good size with all necessary facilities 
154129,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The price of the breakfast was too expensive The lights in the bathroom were a little dim Could do with more lighting There was no soft comfy chair in the room Instead all the seat furniture was hard , Everything the room the cleanliness the aspect of the room 
154130,Grange Clarendon Hotel,No Negative, The location was key to me but the room itself and overall condition of the hotel are top level Was very good price quality ratio but I reckon that would not be the case every time very much depends on the time of the year etc 
154131,Grange Clarendon Hotel, I would just point out to the Cleaning team that the orange colour you see in the grout of tiles is old skin pigment so special attention should be given to cleaning it The breakfast was tasty but quite pricey at 23 per person Even the staff member said its 23 is that OK , The room was so much bigger than anticipated and it was nice to have the seating area to relax The bathroom was mostly very clean and the toiletries of a good quality The bed was comfy and we had a lovely garden view 
154132,Grange Clarendon Hotel, It is unacceptable for 4 star hotel not to provide a complementary bottle of water The bath tub door was broken and ventilation system in the toilet didnt work , Located in Central London 5min from Russell Sq station and 10 15min walk to Covent Graden The room is spacious and really comfy 
154133,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Our bedroom was the coldest and draughtest I have ever stayed in i appreciate the was cold outside and the radiator was on at full but it doesn t help matters when someone had opened the window outside our room Seriously it was zero degrees outside someone is either brainless or stupid , The location was ideal for what we had planned 
154134,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Partial to an iron in the room but to be fair we didnt check if that facility was available upon reception , Location was brilliant bed was large and comfortable Perfect for our short stay Nice large bath too 
154135,Grange Clarendon Hotel,No Negative, I asked for a quiet room I was given a room that backed onto the garden but was right next to the lift so I had to endure an unending stream of noisy guests returning to their rooms between 11 pm and 2am To be fair when I finally asked for a different room I was given one and things improved 
154136,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Small rooms but adequate, Great location near British Musuem and walkable from Euston and to Covent Garden Hotel was clean and the bonus of the small rooms is that the windows open 
154137,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Go in room 302 and look at the floor in the bathroom It s so terribly uneven that it falls off almost 2 inches to one side Don t believe me Stand outside and close the bathroom door and look at the gap on the bottom , Room was clean and well appointed 
154138,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The room was so cold that I got a cold That was my main issue but the room was so tiny I live in manhattan so I am use to small space living but this was obsessively small But the lack of heat and insulation in the walls made the room an ice box causing me to get a cold please note my traveling life style probably didn t help the cold either , The bathroom was really nice 
154139,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Have stayed here five tines previously had asked for a room at back if hotel had been told that this was probable given a room at front which is noisy asked for a change of room didn t happen, Location
154140,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The breakfast was too expensive for a travelling family 23 pound each every day That would have coasted us almost 100 pound every morning , The rooms for a four member family was really good
154141,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The noise of other people coming in late I was between the lift and the stairs and I think with only staying a short time everything seemed louder , The location was fantastic perfect for visiting the places we wanted to The staff were nice and room service was great The lift worked The room sizes were excellent and comfortable 
154142,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The shower didn t work very well and made a really loud rattling noise in the pipes The bar facilities were very poor not much of an atmosphere, The staff were friendly corteous and helpful
154143,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Couldn t see any information about how to connect to wifi in room No bottles of water in room Minor issues though , Very nice room next to green space outside 
154144,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Television didn t work room although clean was smelly as if the drains were smelling not pleasant Bar very tiny and breakfast wasn t included in the price we was told if we had booked direct with them it would have been and yet when I phoned for the date I wanted there were no vacancies and that s why I booked with booking com Breakfast was an extra 23 each , Quiet location room was clean tea making facilities in room
154145,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Terrible WiFi low water presure and shower makes noises some rooms in the basement English Breakfast in the restaurants around 6 8pounds , Good localization spacy room for London Hotel is clean but it s definitly not new 
154146,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The room was steaming hot Not even after we told the staff the first morning to cool it down anything happened Moreover they closed the window manager ich we had specifically asked to keep open other guests also complained but obviously in vain The room was in the basement Floodlights lit the room all night no view more noisy Street smelly entrance The rooms are old and dated and and urgently need refreshment The bar is merely a corner of the reception area , The location 
154147,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Breakfast at 23 per person seemed a bit steep when we ate 50 yards away for 15 for two of us , Good sized room we were in the lower ground floor bathroom was huge the location was great for the British Museum and theatre land 
154148,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Bathroom was worn out shower screen broken shabby nets in the bathroom had holes in the sealant needs attention Nothing too serious but just things that should addressed for the price of the room, Location friendly staff
154149,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Not enough room for my complaint , Our room was above the kitchen and we were woken at 05 30 with constant banging which was later explained to u to be from a food delivery being put away in an external fridge I spoke to reception at 06 30 but it continued through til gone 07 00 Reception were not prepared to offer any compensation Management are supposed to be contacting me but I have not heard from as yet 
154150,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Breakfast was 16 each we went to a lovely cafe just down the road and paid this for two Milk portions gone off in room so couldnt have a cuppa in bed , Great location clean
154151,Grange Clarendon Hotel,No Negative, The staff was extremely helpful and did everything for us All of the rooms we stayed in are very nice and everything was so clean Looks like the pictures
154152,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The wall where the hand towels were hanged was not clean you could see dried drops from other guests Room very small however in line with the London standards A 3 25 stars hotel A bit too cold room November 5th , 3 mins walking from Tube station Russel Square sufficiently clean facilities a bit worn out but acceptable 
154153,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Two of the rooms out of three were small Dorothy closes room WAS upgraded we were told but it was very small Service was perfect and staff very helpful ,No Positive
154154,Grange Clarendon Hotel, only issue was that the bath was dirty there was some black object in the bath so I only used the shower, Location price the hotel was generally nice throughout
154155,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Stayed in a family room Pull out sofa bed very uncomfortable definitely needs a new mattress springs digging into you no mattress protectors on beds no spare pillows decor and furniture needs updating Cooked breakfast 27 each needs a good deep clean, Good location friendly staff spacious family room 
154156,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Room very spacious but requiring some refresh e g small scratch on walls, Location is excellent and style of the hotel very good if you like old Brit style
154157,Grange Clarendon Hotel, No A C the facilities were old and smelled the room was below ground level the public bathrooms were gross and check in at the hotel is 3pm , The location I guess 
154158,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The kettle did not work , The room was huge and the bathroom spacious It was really well positioned for the event we were attending The staff were really helpful 
154159,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Check in agent seemed to be judgemental when I checked in almost as though I wasn t classy enough to stay at their property , The location was great The bath tub was huge so it was nice to have a long soak after travelling all day I also liked that they had a lot of tea and coffee available in the room with biscuits to accompany 
154160,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Shower in our room had a large tub and would be difficult for some to get in and out of , Rooms were huge and surprisingly quiet for this area Perfect location 
154161,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Like many overpriced London hotels this one also puts an individual traveller in the smallest attic room they have And that for 190 pounds There were even spider webs between the bed and the wall they probably wait until they can put someone in that room On top of this the room was noisy other guests pacing around in their room was very audible Definitely many negative points on my scale , Location is good if you have to be in the UCLH area 
154162,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The water pipe when taking a shower makes a terrible noise and water control is difficult Needs to be repaired replaced , The location comfortable room clean Nice cozy lobby 
154163,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Too hot Too small Too noisy bathroom fan running non stop the whole time we were there Such a small room you have to turn sideways to get round the bed The kettle sits on the drop down door of a small wall mounted cupboard which is right in front of the room door Small double bed There s a desk which is supposed to sit in an alcove but it s wider than the alcove Nothing to enjoy about this place except it s location , Great location Didn t try breakfast as it was absurdly expensive plenty of lovely places to eat out and about 
154164,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Breakfast was not included in the price, The staff were very helpful the room was lovely clean comfy The location was perfect loved our stay
154165,Grange Clarendon Hotel, It was a very hot night and there didn t seem to be A C however a bit a c unit would subtract from the overall elegance of the room , Lovely greeting despite it being late after the theatre Complimentary upgrade of our room on arrival and lovely smiles all round 
154166,Grange Clarendon Hotel,No Negative, Because it was easy and convenient to deal with in regards to check in and location Plus we booked a regular room and upon arrival they upgraded my girlfriend and I to an executive room 
154167,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The room is always too hot thank God for the fan and kitchen smells came up through the window in the morning Big hole in curtain and no fridge no luggage rack But really no reasons not to stay there , Our request for a quiet garden room was met and it was lovely and quiet And it s a rather spacious room for London Very helpful staff great location nice atmosphere Will be back 
154168,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Almost 30 for breakfast in hotel like this sounds ridiculous 11am checkout Too early Normally it is noon and they give you extra 2 or 3 free hours Half of the fee for the whole week was written off not put on hold from my card upon arrival very unfriendly , Good location clean room reliable wi fi 
154169,Grange Clarendon Hotel, the only issue we had was that the hotel did not have air conditioning and the weather was warm, The hotel was excellent and the staff extremely helpful 
154170,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Nothing the hotel could do about this but the wonderful leafy space in back of the hotel also brought a lot of very loud chatty birds sounded like seagulls but not quite ravens maybe magpies So minimal traffic noise and fresh air but the nature sounds that come with it Was an early wake up call , Great location quiet street back rooms overlook a big green space private garden Room was light and airy A wonderfully quiet leafy place to stay in the heart of London Staff was super friendly and helpful Felt very safe and welcoming 
154171,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The price of the breakfast 23 is a bit excessive for a breakfast when nearby cafes charge under 10 , Rooms very comfortable and clean An excellent location for theatres shops and restaurants 
154172,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The bed was very hard so I hardly slept and the room was under the kitchen so people were walking around until 2 in the morning and started very early , The Hotel was in a nice quite road The room was very spacious and clean The staff were efficient and helpful 
154173,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Didn t like the price of breakfast so we all went out for breakfast If we had known there were kitchen facilities then we could have catered for ourselves particularly as there were small children involve , Stayed at the Buckingham Booked double room and family room The staff were very friendly despite the mix up over the room booking From double room perspective clean good sized room small kitchen facilities microwave and fridge which was nice to have Family room had double bed cot and double sofa bed and there was still adequate room including small kitchen facilities Very good value for money Would definitely book here again 
154174,Grange Clarendon Hotel, No complaints , We really appreciated the size of the room thank you for the free up grade The bed was huge and very comfortable too We were at the front of the hotel and had three windows with thick heavy dark curtains great for a good nights sleep We were thankful for the fan as the weather was warm Loved the location so close to Russell Square which we loved Overall a nice hotel and a very pleasant stay 
154175,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Beds were very hard and room quite small , Beautiful hotel with lovely views Central enough to be close to the shops restaurants and transport links but not to have the noise of all the hustle and bustle of London Would certainly go back 
154176,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Breakfast too expensive to consider when there was an excellent much cheaper caf just round the corner Receptionist was a little dismissive of children , Bed was very comfortable superb location
154177,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The cleanliness of the whole room was awful especially the bathroom The other staff didn t know what we were saying and couldn t even open a cork bottle of wine The bed was far too firm so didn t have a comfortable nights sleep The rooms were too dark and small as could barely get round the bed , The receptions staff were really helpful and lovely to talk to We appreciated having a front view room 
154178,Grange Clarendon Hotel, I booked this hotel for my manager who was staying in London for company business but brought her family as it was during the summer holidays The sofa bed I was told was comfortable was not but this was quickly substituted The reason for such a low rating a customer service at reception was very poor b they did not order a taxi when requested which meant they almost missed their flight and c when a follow up call was requested to discuss issue the manager could not even be bothered to call I will not be booking this hotel for any of our executives and would not recommend it to colleagues or friends either , Location
154179,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Although the breakfast was good the cost too high, The staff were very attentive the rooms were lovely and clean the position of the hotel ideal for sightseeing
154180,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The bathroom was much smaller than I expected The tea coffee drinks facilities were very limited in fact a little frugal , The location was on a beautiful quiet but very central street The staff were very pleasant and helpful Linen was changed every day and the standard of cleanliness was excellent Breakfast provided an excellent start to the day 
154181,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Hot room throughout the night dispite avaliable fan which was rubbish really Outside noice if window open throughout the night , Friendly helpful staff Comfortable bed Good shower

154186,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Ordered room service drinks which were not cleaned from the room for our whole stay Very disappointed with this , Nice room and clean bathrooms Reception staff were very friendly and helpful 
154187,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Although quiet the room was in the basement so quite dark and a bit claustrophobic we ll try for an upper floor next time , We had a quiet room at the back facing the garden It was nice to be in the heart of Bloomsbury in a period building 
154188,Grange Clarendon Hotel, No safe in the first room and also very hot and no AC The bar is bo good , Great location and very accomodating staff The rooms with garden views are very good value for money 
154189,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Food was good but could have been better, The bed was amazing biggest bed I ve ever slept in and so comfy Was upgraded on arrival Nice treat Room lovely and clean decor immaculate Staff very polite warm and friendly Wonderful stay Will return
154190,Grange Clarendon Hotel, There was no dedicated lounge area for having a few drinks upon returning Instead it was a case of sitting next to the lift , Lovely breakfast and the room was clean and well appointed Everything you d expect from a good hotel in London 
154191,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The design of the bathroom looked good but floor very slippy and quite difficult to get in and out of bath shower particularly if you are short and no handles to hold on to , Good big comfy bed Decent sized room

154194,Grange Clarendon Hotel, No restaurant room service only No heating fan control to regulate temperature of the room and I was upgraded to Executive room Asked for a Latte room service but don t do Latte s only regular coffee really in 2016 Water pressure so low it literally took 20 minutes to fill the bath , Good location
154195,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Breakfast for 24 had to walk through breakfast room to exit hotel didn t smell the freshest Pillows were tiny more like cushions, The location beautiful street beautiful building
154196,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The air ventilator in the bathroom ceiling was constantly on and is very noisy , Good room size In room furniture and facilities had no problems All positive
154197,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The decor was a little tired and a little dated but overall the room was very clean large and we liked looking at the interesting prints on the walls The lobby is not particularly elegant But our room was very good overall and the staff was super , The location is wonderful very central on a quaint street near the British Museum Our room was a triple on the ground floor with a view of the gardens behind the hotel We were pleasantly surprised by the lovely view of green vegetation it was late May which gave the room a more charming atmosphere than expected The room was very spacious room number 3 and we were rather sorry to leave We were there 1 night but would have been glad to stay longer The staff was very cheerful and helpful with a pleasant friendly vibe We arrived early and they promptly and efficiently stowed away our heavy bags for us so we could explore London until check in They were very responsive to other requests as well 
154198,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Would have been nice for the rooms to have had A C , The room was very comfortable probably a little tired but still very nice as we enjoyed out stay

154201,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Laundry being delivered in morning and thrown into basement right beside my window Bathroom fan on all night Being charged 2 75 for small bottle of mineral water , Friendly staff Good location
154202,Grange Clarendon Hotel, There was less room at the foot of the bed than showed in the picture It was tricky getting around it and if you were a larger person it would have been difficult With 2 large suitcases there could have been a little more room too They made getting to the desk tricky , The position of Grange Clarendon was really good Easy to access London centre but far enough to be a bit quieter We felt really safe walking to and from the hotel even very late at night The staff at the front desk were very polite and helpful 
154203,Grange Clarendon Hotel, We had a room for 4 and the sofa was was very uncomfortable even for kids The staffs English skills were not very impressive , Location was excellent 
154204,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Heat in reception area of Grange was unbearable Check in a little tiresome as iPads used This is ok as long as the reception staff are prepared to do the work as passing to the guest without explanation can slow down the check in process, location rooms facilities staff all excellent Upgrade given which was very much appreciated
154205,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Not as clean as it should be for a 4 I got very little if any sleep The walls are very thin and every time someone went past my room I thought they were actually inside People constantly closing and opening doors and the noise was an absolute nightmare Would not recommend especially for the price and given that it is supposed to be 4 Disappointed , Location is close to Euston station
154206,Grange Clarendon Hotel, CD player in room but no CDs windows hard to open phoned for room service at two am but only doing sandwiches, Price was fab for centre of london 15 min walk from euston 5 mins walk from tube was upgraded for free to a suite which was amazing friendly staff location great very peaceful for london and slept like a log 
154207,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Hot chocolate sachets would have been fantastic Method of boiling water could be a little dangerous , Bathroom small but perfectly formed and spotless Room request at the back was granted peaceful We were late risers but room cleaned without comment Comfortable bed Couldn t get menu on tv Location fantastic we walked around all weekend except for the boats 
154208,Grange Clarendon Hotel, In answer to what type of traveller young or mature I would not put myself or my husband in either as we are in our early 50s I find this question rude maybe you should put age brackets in eg 20 30 30 40 etc , The hotel was ok there were some stains on the inside of the bathroom door just by the handle and the toilet roll holder was very loose and the toilet roll kept falling on the floor Sorry this should have gone the other side 
154209,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Headline price excluded breakfast which was expensive to pay on the day Not a major issue though as enough places nearby where three of us could breakfast for less than the cost of one at the hotel , Friendly staff clean and relatively by London standards spacious rooms in a convenient like cation for Euston and Covent Garden
154210,Grange Clarendon Hotel, This was the hotel we booked at got there to find we had been put into a different hotel with no restaurant Ordered room service took over an hour to come , Room was on ground floor and spacious 
154211,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Old fashioned bedroom furniture decoration Rather tired looking Needs updating The bathroom was very dark due to poor lighting and the shower was just a trickle , Location
154212,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Would have liked breakfast included for the price Would have liked to know in advance that dinner isn t served at Clarendon Would have liked a bar room rather than as just part of reception My elderly mother was in Room 110 which was a lovely room on its own but had lethal staircase for an infirm person with no handrail so she had to be accompanied down They were going to try and change for our 2nd night but my mother didn t want to make a fuss , Very helpful and polite staff who helped you even before you realised you needed some help eg with outside lift for my elderly mother and wheelchair Nothing was too much trouble for them Extremely comfortable beds and well appointed room despite being a triple room delicious food at Beauchamp Hotel 2 mins walk away
154213,Grange Clarendon Hotel, TV in room was poor WiFi was pretty hopeless kept disconnecting , Big room Big bed Quiet location 15 min walk into town 15 min walk to Kings Cross 
154214,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The milk In the fridge was off and the heating was off in my room when i arrived so it was cold and it took a while to heat up after I turned it on, I was upgraded to a better room
154215,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The noise levels in the rooms facing the street are too high during the night The overall hotel policies are not particularly friendly just try to ask for a later checkout , Location was excellent 
154216,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Bathroom was not clean room was dusty No bottled water in room , Staff were lovely from reception to housekeeping easy to get to impressive building 
154217,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Breakfast is a bt pricey so we didn t eat in the hotel but there are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby , Nice quiet room with all we needed 
154218,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The traffic noise when staying in the rooms at the front of the property We did not have breakfast as we were aware of the high cost by looking at previous reviews It s a shame this was not included in our room rate , Great location for Euston Station 15 minute walk Russell Square tube 5 minute walk and the British museum 3 minite walk Very friendly and helpful staff The two rooms we stayed in were very spacious Staff happily moved us to a garden view room on the second night as we found it quite noisy in the room facing the road The rooms bathroom and public areas were very clean 
154219,Grange Clarendon Hotel, We ordered several room service items including nachos pizza I was violently ill during the night I had serve abdominal pain was throwing up and had diarrhoea My partner was fine and had to spend the night helping me As he never ate the sausages and mash potatoes I am 100 sure that is what gave me the food poisoning even when I was eating it the food looked as if it had been reheated I spoke to the hotel staff in the morning when we checked out after telling them I was ill they still wanted us to pay for the food we ate Only when my partner kicked up a fuss did they accept that we should not I told them I wanted to raise a complaint as the food they have served me had made me ill I was called and told that as no one else was ill there was nothing they could do I told them that they had not dealt with my complaint and I wanted a written response from them I still haven t received any written response from the hotel I wanted the hotel to resolve this issue so that I didn t have to write this review It s a shame they never bothered ,No Positive
154220,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Being underground we did not have the heating on but the room was boiling Being on this level as well meant we did not want to open the windows during the night which was the only problem with the room Ac would have been perfect or a few degrees lower , Lovely hotel with great staff Room was spacous with a large bathroom and a great value for money 
154221,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The room was a bit cold I was sleeping under an extra blanket yet was still cold at night , Very quiet location and blackout curtains My room was tucked away by the stairs which is a big plus for someone who needs a good night of sleep Comfy pillows good size single bed spacious single room compared to other hotels Stylish decor and a modern bathroom High quality paraben free soap shower gel and shampoo that didn t irritate my skin
154222,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Housekeeping knocking too early In the morning followed a little later by a housekeeping manager I think walking directly into our room Room overlooked the road and entrance so was a little noisy Film crew setting up at 5 in the morning was not conducive to sleep out of the hotel s control I m sure , Location was perfect
154223,Grange Clarendon Hotel, It was very noisy the walls must just be incredibly thin as it s an old building I could hear the guy next door do everything, Location and price room was very spacious 
154224,Grange Clarendon Hotel, A little chilly in the room and no obvious way for adjusting the temperature, The location is excellent just minutes away from the underground We received a free room upgrade which was lovely Nice big room Very last minute booking but managed to get a good deal Efficient booking in service
154225,Grange Clarendon Hotel,No Negative, The staff where very friendly and helpful The room we stayed in was all right for just one night it was small but big enough for 2 people The room needs a bit up dating 
154226,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The room standard was extremely small with very little hanging space no shelf space we stayed a week and hardly anywhere to put store suitcases Better for a short stay I think Didn t have their breakfast which is very overpriced many caf s nearby do better offers , Very convenient for British Museum and Covent Garden Soho etc within walking distance We have stayed before and like the area 
154227,Grange Clarendon Hotel,No Negative, Really nice hotel and good location Second visit and would definitely stay again Breakfast was excellent and staff were pleasant and helpful Our room was not as big as last time but just as comfortable Really enjoyed our stay 
154228,Grange Clarendon Hotel, A little noisy from road and people passing at night , I stayed for 8 nights at this lovely hotel whilst my husband had surgery in a hospital nearby I was upgraded to a queen double room from a single Comfortable bed lovely bathroom with complimentary toileteries The room was beautiful location is perfect for me The breakfast was also very good All the staff have been helpful and courteous I would certainly stay here again 
154229,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Room 9 ok if you wanted to be in a matchbox bed well past its sell by date picture of the room on the internet is very misleading Dont book this hotel,No Positive
154230,Grange Clarendon Hotel, No fridge if you want good wi fi you have to pay for it it was cold in the room elevator only to the floor and then you have to go up a narrow staircase, Location is great quiet room staff cleaned it every day
154231,Grange Clarendon Hotel, rooms are not soundproof noisy neighbours can be a burden , location nearby restaurants shops museums and subway stations helpful staff spacious and clean room even if a bit old 
154232,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Single room was small and dark No space to do morning stretching exercises in the room without bumping something wash hand basin drain a bit blocked Internet keeps going off Had option for upgraded internet at a cost of an extra GBP10 a day , Location staff friendly Nice breakfast but at extra cost 
154233,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The room was on the basement and had no natural light only a window that lead to a covered patio full of garbage They offered us to change the room on the last night but we refused because the packing and unpacking would interfere with our plans Although the heaters were disconnected the heat was unbearable and we had to sleep with the window opened in the middle of December We couldn t sleep after our upstairs neighbors woke up because of the sound and trembling provoked by the footsteps I m not even sure if the ceiling is in a safe condition Although it claims to be a 4 star hotel the room didn t have a minibar or even a safe , It was a big triple room
154234,Grange Clarendon Hotel, For a 200 plus triple room I expect more than a pull out sofa bed If it states triple room and you are paying that price it should be a proper bed Staff were also very slow and the lady on reception was also rude at times Breakfast was also far too expensive , The location was perfect for us and it was a very clean hotel 
154235,Grange Clarendon Hotel, We booked the Clarendon Grange hotel based on Booking com reviews but on arrival we were told that we had been upgraded to the nearby Portland hotel We have no complaints about the Portland all was perfectly ok except that if we wanted breakfast we had to leave the Portland hotel walk down the road to the Clarendon which was not ideal , Good location walking distance to theatres close to train stations Friendly staff Good size clean room with comfortable bed 
154236,Grange Clarendon Hotel, breakfast was offered to me at GBP11 but at the end of the stay the manager who extended the offer due couldn t be verified was charged the full GBP23 they could have been more helpful, I got upgraded to a double room at the Portland Grange Hotel so this is not for the Clarendon but Booking com doesn t allow me to rate that so i m doing it here instead it was a great experience 
154237,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Price is not worth what you got we paid 300 for 2 nights without breakfast room could do with updating very dated and dull , Location was good
154238,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Old tired rooms basic bar area very noisy in the morning Got an un asked for early morning call and the receptionist laughed while apologising Very expensive for such a basic room , Location was tremendous

154241,Grange Clarendon Hotel, We were in basement it was too hot in there and no view from the window It would have been nice to been alerted to this when I booked , Friendly staff huge room
154242,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The mattress was soft lacked support and should be replaced The cost of breakfast quoted at 23 per person is extortionate we did not partake , Good location for rail travel into Euston West End and local facilities 
154243,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The wall are extremely thin you can hear everything going on in the rooms next to you and above you , The staff was very welcoming the rooms were well kept and I was kindly upgraded even if I was already benefiting from a good promotion 
154244,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The cost of breakfast would have been 23 per person we opted to eat breakfast out , Location is great for Kings Cross Euston and a quick walk to Covent Garden Lots of attractions close by 
154245,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Expensive stay too expensive breakfast I stayed at cellar level rooms which was depressing Not enough fresh air , Calm nice area yet walking distance to the center Clean and tidy Friendly staff 
154246,Grange Clarendon Hotel, We ordered room service on our first evening I ordered an Angus burger and chips When it came I could not cut it so took the top bread off still could not cut it and noticed how thin it was I tried to bite it but couldn t I phoned reception they apologised I explained it was not an Angus burger and to me I felt it had been a cheap microwaved burger I awaited for a repeat order My husband had finished his pizza so I went down stairs with my plate re literates what I had said and the reception informed me it was on its way and as compensation would I like a bottled water or juice I said no thank you however felt it was not much of an apology gesture I then ate on my own and only had half the portion of chips than before which I left on the plate with the first burger so maybe it should have been a free meal due to the burger not being what was advertised having to re order and eating on my own , Location
154247,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Our room was 1 floor down which made it dark The Wi fi was poor to make it work you had to go premium and that was only 3Mbit s Not so comfortable beds and pillows , The location was nice The atmosphere was nice The staff was nice 
154248,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Noise from traffic and other guests was very loud Tv didnt work Despite asking several times and twice being promised a new remote control would be given to us nothing was done Wifi cut out constantly despite paying their premium fee for wifi When i expressed my concern the receptionist was not interested at all and made me feel that i was being unreasonble, Location was great for sight seeing
154249,Grange Clarendon Hotel, The room I had would be unsuitable for anyone with any mobility problems Room 110 up a narrow twisting staircase which made carrying a large bag tricky , Had a quiet room tucked away at the top of the building Small but comfortable

154254,Grange Clarendon Hotel, Room was very small Bed was very hard The Indian guy working at night was borderline rude Free WiFi was a pain to use because you had to keep reconnecting every hour They wanted you to pay for their upgraded WiFi even though they advertise free WiFi , We stay at Grange hotels quite often and have joined the membership club Like the locations and usually the rooms 
154255,Grange Clarendon Hotel, There was no aircon It was a warm summer day and the room was a bit stuffy I was booked into Clarendon but was transferred to Portland a few doors down There was limited Free wifi but this kept dropping quite often , The location was lovely the staff was courteous and polite
