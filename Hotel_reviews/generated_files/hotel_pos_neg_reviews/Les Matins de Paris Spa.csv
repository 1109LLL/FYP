136840,Les Matins de Paris Spa, Staff war not very friendly E g one of them chewed chewing gum very loudly we had to greet him before he said anything We didnt feel welcome at all Room was a bit noisy you hear when other showers , The bed was very comfortable Late check out was possible 
136841,Les Matins de Paris Spa, more storage in room esp for luggage which got in the way as we went from w c on one side of room to shower sink on other side , bed comfy pool steam room included a wonderful refresher A C good room needed more storage closet staff very helpful Neighborhood very residential with families tourists Lots of cafes bistros with patient helpful staffs Metro nearby
136842,Les Matins de Paris Spa,No Negative, Great hotel in a very nice neighborhood of Paris The corner street is Rue des Martyrs with award winning bakeries and chocolatiers many cafes and stores great Iberian ham shop and also a Corsican deli and a couple of Italian restaurants In fact the area was so nice that we did not stray from Montmartre at all Our hotel room was small by American standards but a good size for Paris and extremely clean modern comfortable and quiet 
136843,Les Matins de Paris Spa, Only thing we did not like was that the room thermostat was on a 3 hour timer Each night we were there we were comfortable when we went to bed but woke up in the middle of the night after the room temperature rose from the air conditioning shutting off We were able to turn the air back on but just the same it was annoying to have been woken up each night , Wonderful friendly and helpful staff Great location Place was very clean We had room with small balcony and enjoyed being able to step outside for some fresh air Room was small but adequate for our needs we spent very little time in the room We used taxis and the staff were able to call us a taxi each time we needed one and the taxi showed up within 5 minutes 
136844,Les Matins de Paris Spa, Not much space for the cloths storage in the room, We stayed in a nice quiet room which was not very spacious but comfortable The bathroom with a big window has all necessary amenities including bathrobes Very good breakfast with freshly squeezed orange juice and a nice choice of fruit and pastry The hotel is situated close to metro 5 min and surrounded my charming little shops and restaurants Highly recommended 
136845,Les Matins de Paris Spa,No Negative, Very helpful friendly staff nothing was too much hassle and spoke good English Great Wifi connection Breakfast had a good choice and the coffee machine was always on to make yourself a cup of hot chocolate coffee or tea after being out all day Room clean and bed s comfy Nice area and not far to walk to metro supermarket near by A perfect start to our holidays 
136846,Les Matins de Paris Spa,No Negative, The location of the property was great The front desk attendants were kind and helpful when we asked for assistance We were able to walk through the neighborhood and get to public transportation when needed The neighborhood was lovely so we did a lot of walking There were many restaurants and cafes near All and all a lovely stay 
136847,Les Matins de Paris Spa,No Negative, Perfect location in Paris with beautiful local shops along the street and a general Parisian culture Located a short walk from Montmartre Sacre Coeur and Moulin Rouge with excellent Tube links to the rest of the city Excellent reception staff Room was perhaps a bit cosy but well decorated furnished Excellent air conditioning was a life saver 
136848,Les Matins de Paris Spa, Our room was near the elevator and the elevator was very noisy , The location was excellent Close to Montmartre and easy to walk from here to the subway 
136849,Les Matins de Paris Spa, The door but these things happen , The only issue we had was the door key The batteries had run out and they struggled over the weekend to get anyone out The staff were excellent throughout nothing was too much trouble and they went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and happy
136850,Les Matins de Paris Spa, There was a slight sewer smell in my shower HOWEVER it did not permeate outside of the shower area , The breakfast and the accommodations were quite good 
136851,Les Matins de Paris Spa, Check in was a bit chaotic as there is only one desk Check in after 4pm is a bit late, Like the size of the room it s decor its facilities and its comfort The room was great value for money The spa downstairs seems nice though we did not test it Great that they could keep our luggage when we arrived too early and that they put it up in our room 
136852,Les Matins de Paris Spa, Now I only stayed ther for one night With that in mind here is my review The spa area was well not a spa The pool was tiny 5 6 meeters long I could be wrong and the hot room as well as the shower in the spa area smelled like mold The only thing I wanted to do after going into this facility for a brief time was to wash up When I talked to the assistant about it he asked me if an other user maybe caused the smell To which I still roll my eyes The next day the pool was not working so I could not check The bathroom at the room had a wet smell to it as well That was fixed the momnet I opened the windows so taking into consideration the age of buildings in Paris that was not a big problem When I arrived I got informed that they did not have big towels in my room so I should try to manage When I asked to use one of the bathrobes from the spa the assistant said ok When I arrived I was informed that checkout was at 12 00 and if I was any late I would be charged 50 euro per hour also 100 if I was to smoke even though I stated that I am not a smoker The above I had to sign in an agreement Something that I found very unsettling since it would be hard to proove I did not smoke after I left the room and the country I was also informed of the possibility to get a breakfast in the room The assistant felt complied to add that the 13 euro breakfast I payed for the next morning because it is in the room we can not bring everything I informed her I will not use this service Overall the breakfast was nice The only thing I found challenging was to find where the plates and cutlery where kept since they were behind a bar and there was no personnel in the room to seek help from , The bed itself was great very comfortable I can feel very comfortable in tiny spaces so the size of the room was not a problem for me The room shower and toilet where clean and tidy The temprature in the room was comfortable The breakfast was tasty It is very close to metro stations There is a killer sushi place near by The assistants helped me finding dinners and other facilities near by and printed train schedules for me 
136853,Les Matins de Paris Spa, They need to remove the work Spa from their name Three times I tried to use the pool or steam room and three times it was closed for cleaning maintenance The first occasion this occured was around 5pm on Friday We had explored Paris and had looked forward to a steam and a swim Neither were operational I spoke to the reception who made excuses that the pool was being cleaned I felt that the pool should be cleaned outside of its published opening hours of 7 30am to 9pm and not at times when guests are told it can be used The same situation on the Saturday late afternoon with neither of the Spa facilities being available to use To top it all off Monday morning the same thing yet again When we book our accommodation and search out and pay a premium for extra facilities like a spa then we certainly expect to use them and get value from them Overall it was very disappointing that every time we wished to use the spa is was not available, Great location and a beautiful hotel 
136854,Les Matins de Paris Spa,No Negative, This is a great hotel and the staff are incredibly friendly A man called Thary I believe looks after you as if you were a personal guest in his house It s why I have stayed there 3 times in the last two months 
136855,Les Matins de Paris Spa, We were attacked and robbed outside of our Hotel The hotel should have been open and it was locked for some bizarre reason I was robbed of my cards driving license and approximately 1 500 worth of goods I was dragged up the street and attacked and hurt badly We had to beg hotel staff to call the police and nothing was done Nor did this member of staff report it to management the next day and we have not received a formal apology I am devastated and anxious beyond belief Horrific stay , Nothing 
136856,Les Matins de Paris Spa, The bathroom drains were smelly the air con in the room didn t work there was dried blood on the duvet and within 10 minutes of us arriving two members of staff let themselves into our room without explanation or apology Be careful if you leave luggage with this hotel I left a suitcase and a small bag of shopping with them to look after while we waited for the room to be ready when I checked inside the bag of shopping the next day I discovered that the small vase that was inside was smashed I spoke to the receptionist about it and she blamed me for not telling them to be careful with it The breakfast was fairly disappointing too Unfortunately not a good end to our holiday as we had hoped it would be , Nice location well decorated 
136857,Les Matins de Paris Spa, No downside for us at this hotel Didn t have breakfast so can t comment on that , Lovely comfy quiet hotel in a great location Pool and steam room an added bonus
136858,Les Matins de Paris Spa, Couldnt fault nothing, Went away with partner for the weekend just gone and had a fantastic time the hotel is really clean and spotless and staff are very friendly The pool is very clean and pleasurable really enjoyed being there was very relaxing The location is perfect as has lots of reastraunts and shops and metro is a 5min walk The beds are so comfy you couldnt help but fall asleep as soon as you get in would definitely recommend and I would certainly be going back there 
136859,Les Matins de Paris Spa, Not as advertised the spa was extremely small and not worth the extra money In my opinion I overpaid by a lot considering the quality of the hotel compared to how it was advertised Blatant case of false advertising and I feel completely mislead,No Positive
136860,Les Matins de Paris Spa, I booked the place mainly for the pool recommended by the doctor to exercise prior to a knee surgery upon arrival I was informed the pool has 15 degrees and expected to have had this information at booking moment the person at reception was polite yet I felt a forced politeness when talking about the subject blamed booking com for this lack of information as he mentioned it was sent to booking com not bathrobe and sleepers in the room in a spa hotel they had and required one in the room yet I was told to go down at spa to take them no trouble whatsoever but expected them to bring them in the room at a 4 stars service a simple change of attitude could increase the ratings of the overall experience , location close to Sacre Coeur shopping area pretty good restaurants close by wine stores fresh seafood cleanliness of the hotel the receptionists attitude at the day of departure
136861,Les Matins de Paris Spa,No Negative, Lovely hotel very clean and cozy Staff are so nice and helpful The location is very good there are many stores and restaurants around Bus and metro stations as well 
136862,Les Matins de Paris Spa,No Negative, Nice Hotel with friendly staff Luxurious room and bathroom Small swimming pool to cool off in after a long day Hotel is not far from metro station 
136863,Les Matins de Paris Spa, The breakfast was not made to order really bad selection and the rooms were tiny hardly room to swing a cat and no cupboards or drawers to put things in ,No Positive
136864,Les Matins de Paris Spa, Not really a critisism but not sure why a cab to the airport booked via the hotel is 65 euros when you can hail one on the street for 50 or pre order one yourself for 57 , Excellent service with helpful staff inc restaurant recommendations maps prompt response to any queries etc both via email and during our stay Comfortable large beds contemporary decor decent shower and all very fresh looking and clean Even a smart small basement pool and roomy steam room if you remember your cozzy which I sadly didn t 
136865,Les Matins de Paris Spa, Nothing, Very friendly and helpfull staff superb location nearby sacre coeur and many metro stations clean rooms and many facilities very good breakfast 
136866,Les Matins de Paris Spa, The price could be a little better The bedsheets not as comfortable as the gorgeous pillows , Perfect for a weekend wellness vacation in the city Rose Bakery and veggie organic cafe just around the corner another bakery with some of the best baguettes in Paris and shops selling fruit and veggies fresh from the market Loved the luxurious shower the plentiful fluffy white towels and bathrobe the layout of the room and the large floor to ceiling windows Has the feel of a boutique hotel without the pricetag Nice hammam and infinity pool downstairs 
136867,Les Matins de Paris Spa, This is an excellent hotel but a few minor things would make things a lot better First a little bit more storage space maybe a few shelves for clothes etc Second providing facility for making coffee in room would be good maybe a hot water maker and coffee sachet Breakfast did not start till 7 00 and the day we left we had to leave for the airport early and none of the cafes has opened So no coffee before we left Finally a clock in the room would be useful , This was an excellent hotel There is a Turkish hammam and small swimming pool which was a big hit with the kids The hotel is small but the staff are nice and friendly Especially Halim Thari and Nicolas The location is fantastic There are at least two superb patisseries down the road on Rue de Martyrs which provided outstanding breakfast We opted not to have the breakfast in the hotel because of this There is also a small Carrefour close by Loads of restaurants all around One can catch the Line 12 Metro at Place St George which is less than 200 mts away But other stations like Pigalle or Notre Dame de Lorette are also close Montmartre is just about a 10 minute walk All in all this was a great place and I will certainly consider staying here again It is not cheap but I felt that it provided excellent value for money There were four of us including my wife and two girls 7 and 11 The 11 year old had a separate single bed The hotel had provided another single inflatable bed for the 7 year old free of cost The room was spacious by European standards and the bathroom fittings and furnishings were of high standard The most fascinating thing were the windows with electrically operated shades They were very fancy As far as I could make out they were also sensitive to rain and close automatically if it rained All in all a great experience 
136868,Les Matins de Paris Spa, The street was very noisy at night until very late so take that into consideration when booking Also very costly for what you get but that s Paris , Lovely hotel with a gorgeous pool and steam room Rooms small but immaculately clean with one of the comfiest beds I have ever slept in Bathroom very small but the shower head was great and the free toiletries were generous Staff very friendly maid service great tastefully decorated hotel
136869,Les Matins de Paris Spa, The pool was not working the week I was here but this is a minor thing compared to what was good about the hotel , Extremely clean modern helpful staff perfect location not too touristy Good value for money Arguably the photos do not do it justice it is a nice boutique hotel with a good feeling when you arrive This is not well captured in the photos
136870,Les Matins de Paris Spa, Quite disappointed that the pool was closed when we visited that was a significant reason for booking here The room is quite tight in space and a little tea coffee maker would have been nice , Extremely clean and neat rooms The staff were lovely and accommodating Great location in a bustling neighbourhood 
136871,Les Matins de Paris Spa, Breakfast was very good yet too expansive And there were NO bacon Also the pool was out of order for 3 of 4 nights The pool was actually the reason why I found the hotel on booking so it being out of order was a clear disappointment , Breakfast was really good Perfect bed Nice staff 
136872,Les Matins de Paris Spa,No Negative, The staff were incredibly nice and spoke perfect English They even listened while I practiced my pretty poor high school level French The bed was very comfortable The room had all the mod cons we required The hotel is located very close to Gard Du Nord Monmatre plus metro stations 
136873,Les Matins de Paris Spa, The night staff were awful well one of them in particular at one stage we were kept waiting 15 minutes outside at night The room had a very musty pungent smell about it similar to burnt cannabis we thought it was just our room but generally the whole floor smelt of it On two of the days the cleaners failed to leave bath towels and when requested from the night staff we ended up having to go downstairs ti get them On the whole mediocre hotel definitely not 4 star terrible night person Would not stay there again , The location was ok It was right in the heart of downtown Paris a stones throw from the Moulin Rouge But there are plenty of cheaper hotels in this location which are of the same standard if not better 
136874,Les Matins de Paris Spa,No Negative, A really warm welcome when I arrived and the room was perfect Not huge but very modern and comfortable The bed was difficult to leave in the morning as so comfy 
136875,Les Matins de Paris Spa, The front desk staff was not welcoming upon arrival but paled in comparison to the rudeness of the front desk reception upon departure The room was not made up during our stay Although it appeared at some point a staff member entered the room to leave a Madeline which I assumed was part of the turn down service they did not attempt at any other housekeeping Interestingly the first night there was no turn down service at all which would have gone unnoticed had the mystery cookie not appeared Upon check out the receptionist insisted we wait in a long line at the desk pay the city tax although we showed her proof that it was already paid on booking com Also the room was extremely small Having stayed in Paris quite frequently in a range of hotels this was definitely the smallest room I have ever seen , Great location
136876,Les Matins de Paris Spa, The WIFI signal was weak in the rooms I had to move room as my phone did not work and there was no space to read the paper or work except the rooms which is a problem if the WIFI or phone signals do not work , The location and modern furnishings 
136877,Les Matins de Paris Spa, Rooms are tiny , Great location Great value Great friendly service
