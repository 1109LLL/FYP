121823,Mercure Paris Place d Italie,No Negative, Staff were super friendly and very helpful Geoffrey and Norine The Metro is about 50 metres from the front door so great for travelling around the city
121824,Mercure Paris Place d Italie, Air Con was not working With temperatures going above 20 degrees it got pretty uncomfortable to sleep during the night Opening the window was not an option since the building is on a busy street , Well maintained clean rooms Friendly staff Good location with proximity to the metro station Good sound proofing despite being on a busy street 
121825,Mercure Paris Place d Italie, One of the rooms we got had a very bad smell Our rooms where not ready on time they did apologize for this but a free coffee while waiting would have been the least they could have done The rooms could be cleaner they start to have an older look and could probably get new carpets or no carpets at all which is always the best choice for hotels , The hotel is near the Metro station Porte d Italie where you have got 3 Metro lines and most of them will take you to sightseeing or shopping places in Paris 
121826,Mercure Paris Place d Italie, The hotel allows people to be with their pets One of the guests left his 2 big dogs in the room and went outside We were obliged to change the room around 11 pm simply because the hotel weren t able to join the guest by phone When we asked the concierge about the way the accept people with pets the answer was they are paying extra money for this This was a ridiculous justification from the hotel Adding to that there is an adhoc market every Tuesday Friday Sunday in front of the hotel from 5 am until 3 pm with the noise and the dust everywhere in the road ,No Positive
121827,Mercure Paris Place d Italie, The hotel does not yet seem to have the right facilities to offer good food via room service so best is to find a restaurant nearby if you want a meal , Spacious room unusual for Paris clean great location 3 min walk from Place d Italie metro station and from supermarkets stores and restaurants friendly staff completely renovated lobby bar
