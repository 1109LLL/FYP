153358,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Nothing, Wonderfully spacious for London Weren t there long enough to enjoy all the hotel had to offer Would definitely return The extra hour for check out was much appreciated
153359,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The bouncer type of guy who works night during weekend he could have been more welcoming as I was a guest who stayed for 2 weeks No smile at all , The bed was extremely comfy I worked so hard and took 2 weeks off in London and the bed was definitely one of the best I ve slept on ever 
153360,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The curtains in our room didn t shut properly and though we told housekeeping nothing was done We had to get the concierge to botch up a fix at midnight And the breakfast offered isn t really good enough for a hotel of ambition , Lovely building big rooms convenient location The staff were obviously proud of the place 
153361,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, I cant think of anything , The bar was pretty impressive they have the original cells from when it was a Court House The staff were brilliant we checked in early so they held our luggage and took it to our room when it was ready The room was a great size we had an upgrade and so clean 
153362,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Having to knock to get in after hours Not cool The reception staff are a little too watchfull of comings and goings Its awkward, The interior is a fantastic remodel of a period public building retaining the look and feel of a courthouse but using fantastic contemporary materials and additions The room was spacious and the ensuite huge Clean friendly and contemporary in a great location in East London 
153363,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch,No Negative, We stayed here as part of my boyfriend s birthday celebration and the staff at reception were lovely and attentive enough to greet him a happy birthday We were given a free upgrade and welcomed with a slice of birthday cake We were given a quick tour around the hotel by the lovely guest ambassador who gave us some history about the hotel The hotel has a great roof top bar spacious and quirky jailhouse bar a games room with ping pong tables and a bowling alley We were looking forward to using the spa swimming pool but unfortunately it was being cleaned when we were hoping to go Our overall experience was excellent and we would definitely recommend and stay again Thanks to everyone that made our stay enjoyable Charlene
153364,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, A few of the little details that make a 5 hotel No toothpaste in the bathrooms 1 tissue left in tissue box 1 receptionist was quite rude and sounded very exasperated on the phone to me ans my sister not good , Our coincierge calan was lovely and the room and hotel were very nice overall but best part is the location right on the doorstep of the nightlife Perfect Also our room got upgraded as it was my sisters 30th which was lovely 
153365,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, A few things took away from the premium experience 1 lengthy attempt at upselling on checking in 2 we didn t have the credit card with us that the reservation was made with which they had requested us to bring this took longer than it should have to resolve it can t be that unusual an occurrence 3 nice pool and spa area but not all the pool functions were working jaccuzzi and hydro fountain were out of order 4 water pressure wasn t particularly good in the shower 5 no toilet brush in the bathroom , Room was great spacious clean tidy and very quiet given its central location Good facilities Can t comment on food as we didn t take any there Staff were generally very helpful and very courteous barring the check in experience mentioned above Room service was quick to bring a spare bathrobe Empty mini bar in the room didn t bother me that much as I had no need for anything but seemed unusual 
153366,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch,No Negative, The staff were real nice The food was real classy and the extra effort made in my room ready for us to arrive couldn t have been better Thank you 
153367,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Maybe need signage around the entrance to the pool to explain you use the room key to gain access We were a little disappointed we couldn t use the roof terrace bar on a lovely sunny evening as there was a private event Perhaps if we had been told about this at check in that would have been good The terrace is also right outside some of the bedroom windows so people can see straight in , Pool area was very clean seemed brand new 
153368,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, When you have a room at the fifth floor facing the roof top terrace you might want to bring earplugs for a good nights sleep, Great staff hotel offers a lot of possibilities from swimming pool and fitness over cinema and bowling to roof top terrace and having a bite in the cell block Staff really helpful and very well informed
153369,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The first day the lift to our part of the hotel stopped working It s a long walk in the heat up to 3rd floor Also it seems a little disorganised with housekeeping and rooftop bar , The lovely pool and rooftop bar
153370,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, In general there was not enough staff for this fully booked hotel Staff were trying there best and more but you could see that they had to rush all the time Indoor pool 1 of the main reasons i booked this hotel was closed for maintanance Rooftop bar another of the reasons I booked this hotel was occupied by a private party so we could not enjoy it Roomservice took almost one hour to bring the food Breakfast buffet was very small and limited and the option of the a la carte breakfast was not clear at all there was one menu hidden at the cash desk and ONLY if people specifically asked for it the staff was willing to show it Whole breakfast room was run by 2 persons and this is absolutely not enough according to the size of the breakfast room If I compare same price quality hotel in for example Tokyo this was truly not good Hope the hotel will improve these points soon , Location of the hotel is nice Shoreditch is a nice and quite place The hotel building is very nice and spacious the room was nice clean and spacious beds were comfortable 
153371,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Rooftop bar was closed for private function with no prior warning to guests this was the reason why I selected this hotel and couldn t use it Asked staff if I could go up for breakfast instead but no luck Was informed the courthouse police station bar was open until 2am but when arriving at 1am it was closed so couldn t use that either , Great location staff were lovely hotel was very clean and great decor and amenities 
153372,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Nothing loved it , I really liked what they have done to the old Courthouse and the Police Station The staff were very welcoming and helpful We had been upgraded so we had a huge room with a separate lounge The bathroom was nicely done the bed was very comfortable and we will definitely stay here again The room terrace was great too It was a 10 minute walk back to the City in the morning Sadly we didn t get time to use the pool which looked lovely 
153373,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The room could have been cleaner the shelves were very dusty and design of the taps meant that unless you have turned them on you don t see the dirt underneath which clearly the cleaner did not , Staff are really helpful and knowledgable The rooftop bar is brilliant for drinks after a long day sightseeing loads of great bars and restaurants in close proximity and overall felt very safe in the area 
153374,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Incredibly badly organised took money from my bank account without me authorising it very rude customer service staff so many better places to stay in london ,No Positive
153375,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Housekeeping was a little forgetful forgot to clear all wet towels one day , This hotel has personality and is located in a great area with restaurants and transportation close by The staff is very friendly and the room was quiet and comfortable 
153376,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Car park was expensive but very convenient, Loved the bath tub with the tv at the end Big rooms and we had cake delivered to our room as it was my boyfriends birthday Very happy with our stay and would come back again
153377,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, All bars wer closed for private functions with no comms from any hotel staff When mentioned staff said yes we are aware Thanks We know you were Breakfast service slow and choice poor Air con either off or freezing For a hotel charging these prices even in London I expect better, Location 
153378,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch,No Negative, The staff were so charming and the room was amazing The bed was perfect and the shower as well The hotel is really beautiful and I love this location 
153379,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Honestly nothing , Staff was great Room was clean Best part was the hotel gives you a smart phone to carry around with you that has data and works great Top notch all around if we go back to London we will stay here again 
153380,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Hair in my breakfast Poor communication Luggage came an hour after we arrived in our room Poor response from management promised a call from the manager waiting still charged full price for breakfast Very disappointed paid a premium price but certainly a sub premium device Absolutely dreadful, Beds were amazing room was lovely Very spacious 
153381,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, All exceedingly good, The hotel was ideally situated for my business trip the facilities were excellent and the staff very professional in there approach to customer service All to often hotels are all about style over substance but on this occasion the establishment was perfectly complimented by its staff Also for a London hotel the bathroom was roomy and finished to a very high standard 
153382,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Sadly the pool was cold and the showers were luke warm We were told they had a problem with the boiler , The staff were all very friendly and happy to help The history of the hotel was very interesting 
153383,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Rooms had no bottled water when we arrived despite it being 6pm Maintenance of bathroom a bit questionable no hot water in the morning Bathroom shelf loose and sloping so useless to put anything on Bar staff didn t seem to be on the ball when we arrived for a party of 16 people at 6 30 despite having prior confirmation from the hotel I had to carry 16 glasses to our table and open our own champagne no great hardship I appreciate but no what I would have expected , Comfortable firm beds Reception and concierge staff friendly and enthusiastic Great bar area and interesting facilities such as bowling alley 
153384,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The bar had a metal clock table which was beautiful but because of drink spillage there was a strong metallic smell which meant we had to move seats The rooftop bar was shut which was a shame The cocktail making was very slow and the same cocktail tasted different each time The manager was excellent at rectifying this however , The gentleman who showed us round was so lovely and helpful We had a wonderful stay and loved the whole theme of the hotel The swimming pool was a great way to freshen us up following the cocktails the previous night 
153385,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch,No Negative, The staff were both friendly and efficient and eager to provide assistance at all times The room was superb with a very comfortable bed and beautifully fitted out The Rooftop bar is a real bonus We did not have the opportunity to try the spa but againn this is a definite bonus for the hotel Highly highly recommended
153386,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, It was a shame to have to close the very expensive curtains during the day for privacy as there weren t any nets or blinds at the large window For a 5 star hotel one would expect a welcome bottle or two of water to be provided especially on a hot day , Excellent location Although the room was at the rear and the view was of other buildings it was peaceful especially as there is a lot of nightlife in the area The refurbishment is of the highest quality and many original features of the building retained There was even a mobile phone in the room so you could make calls within Europe free of charge The internet connection was very good Large on the wall flat screen TV with satellite Large modern shower There is also a swimming pool but we did not realise this before we arrived 
153387,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The only negative was waiting to be served on the rooftop bar took way too long so we ended up moving to the downstairs bar Good choice where we ordered at the bar but the drinks took so long to arrive and even then they brought the wrong drinks Que another long wait , The hotel was stunning having a cocktail in the cells was such a unique experience the pool was amazing too
153388,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Absolutely nothing, Egyptian cotton bedding fluffy pillows friendly staff who could not do enough for us bus stop directly opposite hotel so close to great restaurants and bars
153389,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Also we were told breakfast was included so we went and I wished we hadn t the food was horrible and I wonder how badly you could make eggs and bean on toast then went to check out and was told it was 33 extra for our stomach aches not really pleased with that part , Staff was very lovely and accommodating brilliant location The rooms are beautifully decorated though the open shower room design allowed the water to run into the room might need a lower drain 
153390,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Felt like a budget hotel trying too hard to be something it s not There s quite a grand feeling on entering the lobby but this quickly dissolved Scruffy staff on reception desk when checking out dirty unironed shirt scruffy jeans We were offered onsite parking when we called to say we were struggling to find parking We weren t informed of this charge until checking out 35 for overnight Breakfast lukewarm buffet Atmosphere vacuum in dining room Some nice music would have helped Lobby decor appealing however in room the patterned graphic carpet and black furniture felt very 90 s bachelor pad , Original architectural features in Lobby
153391,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Junior suites have small window against a wall only So we downgraded to a double with stunning city views Small thing a couple of hooks to hang your jackets would be helpful in the room , Very nice city view from 6th floor rooms very nice young and trendy staff
153392,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, If Tripadvisor allowed 0 stars then this hotel would receive it I arrived to check in official time 14 00 at 17 05 to be told my room was not ready No apology and in fact if anything it was made to feel like it was my fault for turning up There were four staff on reception all muttering between them and all who behaved appallingly They were rude unapologetic and even contradicted themselves something another guest behind me at check in stepped in to re enforce as they clearly were also appalled at the way I was spoken to After waiting 30minutes for my room it left me with just 35minutes to get ready for a black tie event I was attending not what I had planned To top it off I was provided with a downgrade to the room I had booked and the room had stains on the carpet and scratched furniture and bathroom The shower handle was glued in place and would only stay on boiling hot it was totally difficult to have a comfortable shower My view was overlooking a dirty roof and a dirty street The night porter was helpful to start with and we ordered food on our return but after waiting over 30minutes for a soda water and a ciabatta bread we spoke to reception and cancelled the order only to have the night porter banging on my door at 2am in the morning telling me he knew I was in there As a female I did not feel safe in the hotel and would not recommend to anyone I worked in travel for years and now work in customer service and would imagine the staff at this hotel have received training in neither The recent five star reviews must be the staff themselves or their friends and we spoke to several other people at the hotel and everyone had something negative to say it was really dissspoainting and the worst part was that they were so defensive and no one would acknowledge how badly we had been treated , Nothing
153393,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The pool was out of order however we were able to use the sauna and steam room The coffee sachets weren t updated the second night of stay perhaps a coffee machine would be better , Very spacious room with a brilliant view of the city Short distance to the underground Staff were very helpful and friendly adding the extra touch for a birthday surprise 
153394,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch,No Negative, Fabulous hotel in a wonderful location The staff were very accomadating Nothing was too much They made us feel very welcome The hotel has tons of history and really is a cool place to stay The food was delicious and bedroom so luxurious and comfortable 
153395,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The staff were extremely rude including the manager There was some confusion with our bar bill due to our large group however before it could be addressed I was chased out of the bar and grabbed by the barmaid demanding I pay the bill Explained we would pay this however they were insistent and continued to be rude The manager smelt strongly of smoke to the point where I had to stand away The swimming pool jets did not work and it was freezing cold and the steam room was not in working order A lovely hotel but the staff need further training Extremely disappointing ,No Positive
153396,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The jobs worth bar attendant who stopped us from access to our bedroom stating it was staff only areas although there were no signs indicating this and the stairs are open for access, Most of the staff Decor
153397,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch,No Negative, Location was perfect for us as we were going to a gig at The Village Underground we walked from the train to the hotel and found we were nearby to all the great bars and restaurants in Shoreditch The decor and history were beautiful staff very friendly and professional and both the main bar and rooftop had a great ambience we loved it 
153398,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Pool facilities showers pool temp accessories all need improvement Rooftop bar should be open more and toilet needs attention and redecoration at rooftop lounge Bar on ground floor needs to stay open later for guests ,No Positive
153399,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Bar staff very slow one member asked for our order then he went off to get someone else as he wasn t sure of what he was doing Breakfast cold , Friendliest of staff Room comfortable 
153400,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, On booking confirmation it said mini bar although I wasn t expecting a full bar A bottle of water would of been a bonus all that was in the fridge was milk for our coffee Also the turndown service was a lovely touch it was again slightly disappointing that one bottle of water and one small chocolate was left for me and my husband to share For the price of the night stay I felt it was a little mean, I stayed for my 40th birthday Front of house staff are very welcoming nothing is too much trouble The bell boy was very knowledgeable on the history of the building Good location
153401,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Checking in was nightmare they messed up all the rooms then tried charging us to put extra bed in Even though we requested twin rooms At 400 a night I would expect more from them Would not stay there again, Nice hotel good location
153402,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Breakfast was cold even ordered off the menu on the second morning and still arrived luke warm , good location in Shoreditch very clean and great staff 
153403,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, There was a leak from the room above into our bathroom but that was fixed quickly , Staff were v friendly and welcoming and upgraded us to a suite Sure we would ve loved the spa if this were a longer trip 
153404,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Only improvement I would like to see is a Nespresso machine in the room as I like an espresso to wake me up in the morning Other London hotels I have stayed at of a similar standard have them so I have come to expect one , Only spent a minimum amount of time in the hotel as we were visiting family living in London so didn t get to use the facilities but the staff were lovely helpful very pleasant and welcoming The room was very spacious and superbly appointed Loved the huge walk in shower 
153405,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch,No Negative, Can t moan at all about this hotel Everything was brilliant Loved the cells that had been occupied by The Kray twins Breakfast was top notch 
153406,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Our skytv didn t work for the 2 days whilst we wer ther and also ther wer no mini bar I would defiantly consider looking elsewhere before I booked the courthouse next time this is the 2nd time this year iv stayed here and we had same problem last time I m really looking to put review on TripAdvisor unless I can get some sort of discount or cheap stay next time Thanks mark, Location comfort
153407,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The pool wasn t working and we booked this hotel because it had a pool The food in the restaurant was not good very bland undercooked and the chicken for the chicken salad taste like charcoal We would eat out next time , Staff were amazing and friendly Very informative and cooperative Breakfast was excellent 
153408,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, If you wanted to do bowling you had to pay and there was no cinema so we couldn t watch a film and the rooftop bar was not open until 3 o clock the Paul was out of order and it was cold in the swimming pool when it opened, The room was ok the bed was nice I had a good sleep
153409,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The room was overlooked by a stairwell on the other side of the building so the room lacked privacy , The hotel was very welcoming and a beautiful building Breakfast was excellent 
153410,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, We were told the roof top bar was open until 11pm but was shut before 10 30pm on a Saturday night The other bar was a shambles the staff couldn t make a Mojito cocktail it took ages to get served and we were charged a lot of money for two cocktails we didn t ask for it seems there was a slight language barrier The room was nice but badly thought out with no plugs where the kettle is No blind on the bathroom window we weren t over looked but personally I would prefer a blind , Great customer service showing us the facilities on arrival We also had a little treat in our room as it was our birthdays 
153411,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, bar is not intimate enough suggest smaller spaces roof top bar closes too early cinema should be available to residents if not being used with double sofas and more relaxed seating in part, excellent room full Sky satellite great shower rooftop bar
153412,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The bed was quite short and I am not a tall person Also there was an issue with the air conditioning in that it would not drop below 17 degrees in our room making it far too hot Other than that the room was fab and service was great The hotel does seem to have constant music playing in communal areas and it can be loud not really necessary at breakfast etc where you might want some quiet time , Shower was good Bar and rooftop bar very good Good service from staff at the reception area Pool was very nice 
153413,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The only issue I could possibly have with my visit to the Courthouse would be when I couldn t get any hot water out of the showers in the spar area It wasn t a major problem as I showered in my room , Stunning Hotel worth every penny I absolutely loved the Jail house bar where the old holing cells remain intact The Banksy s that are painted within are super cool well worth taking a look at We indulged in a few delicious cocktails I had The ball Chain whilst we enjoyed looking around at all of the other pieces of art The rooftop bar has fantastic views over London When we used the facilities in the spar on Saturday afternoon we had the whole place to ourselves Not a single person on the whole floor I highly recommend this hotel will definitely be returning 
153414,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, none of the spa facilities were working when we stayed here extremely disappointing as this was the main reason why we stayed her in the first place they weren t particularly understanding or helpful ,No Positive
153415,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Restaurant was OK and the Guy serving was very polite and efficient but was very inexperienced Also there were things missing which are usually standard at good to top quality restaurants There is sadly a general lack of experienced hotel staff , Ambiance in Bar was superb 
153416,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, De g r reklam f r bowlingbanan p sin sida men talar inte om att den kostar 45 pund i timmen hutl st Inomhuspool allt annat ingick men inte bowlingen The bowling is 45 pounds per hour Very expensive , V ldigt trevlig och serviceinriktad personal Sk na s ngar och stor h rlig tv Bra wifi 
153417,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Parking is available at extra cost Even temporary parking at the front of the hotel is prohibited but there is a small access area to the underground car park so although the staff park the car for you the car is taken down by lift it would be helpful if the hotel sent out detailed procedure to those guests booking a car park space , Top of the list is the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff Without exception they all took every opportunity to greet and assist Room was a very good size for a London hotel at this price Very high quality fixtures and bed linen etc Great en suite Conversion from original courthouse has been achieved with imagination and originality Excellent facilities 
153418,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The personnel at the reception is very friendly and helpful some Concierges however are a bit too obtrusive , The view from the room on the 4th floor was stellar Also many thanks to the reception who went out of their way and tried to make sure that our special wishes were fulfilled 
153419,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, A little noisy at night during the weekend as the street is very animated, Amazing place beautiful building nice area with lots of great restaurants and bar Hotel with very clean and comfortable with spa and rooftop
153420,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Everything, This is a great querky old building with cracture and the staff couldn t do more Close to everything you need Brick lane 10min Shoreditch 5mins Bike shop cafe Great salt beef bagels brick lane Jazz cafes great night out 40inch pizza Really really good worth the 
153421,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Water only just warm enough for a shower in the morning but fine the evening before The music in the bar was awful unless you are Ed Sheeran s number one fan , Great building with interesting history Parking for 35 per night not advertised Outstanding concierge staff Great breakfast Large and comfortable rooms
153422,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Only a couple of little problems Sunday am the shower was just about tepid the same applyied to pool area showers they were cold Saturday evening These things didn t change my overall enjoyment of hotel , The hotel is beautiful just a years since it opened The staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble Rooms spacious with lovely quality fittings well thought out power points for tech ed up guests Would definate return
153423,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch,No Negative, Rooms are absolutely amazing They have a great Size fantastic Bathrooms and rain showers which are never easy to find in the UK always kept very clean and tidy by the staff Staff were very forthcoming and friendly Took time upon arrival to give us a tour of the facilities The Hotel has a great bar unfortunately did not get to try it but it looks amazing and a very nice Spa Area The Concierge is very knowledgable and can recommend all the cool little spots around Shoreditch which is definitely worth exploring 
153424,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Robes could have been more cosy towelling long sleeves No ear buds No water in room, Large rooms Comfortable bar and very nice breakfast room Comfortable room
153425,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Great to have Sky available in the room but disappointing that there were no on demand or pay per view movies I appreciate that this is a relatively minor issue , I loved the huge room and the room service menu was amazing much better than the normal range of dishes on offer in similar hotels Service was exceptional and the pool looked amazing though I didn t get around to using it on this visit 
153426,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, We liked but didn t love our steak in the restaurant There are probably better restaurants in Shoreditch but we were feeling lazy If we stayed here again we probably wouldn t eat in the restaurant but thats just our personal taste and not really a criticism of the hotel , The staff here were excellent It was my partner s birthday and they went above and beyond to make it a special stay We had an excellent room with an amazing room number 617 and they provided birthday cakes and bottles of water The room itself was really nice and spacious and the bathroom was nice The staff members were all really polite and friendly and couldn t do enough for the hotel visitors We enjoyed using the facilities sauna steam and swimming pool It was really relaxing Drinks at the bar were nice Overall we wouldn t hesitate to come back The hotel itself was just a short walk from the tube station probably 5 10 mins and was right in the centre of all the action in Shoreditch Thanks very much to Courthouse hotel for making it such a memorable weekend We will be back 
153427,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Didn t get the opportunity to use the gym and spa facilities , Very attentive staff comfortable and quiet room Excellently maintained I was here on business but this would be a great weekend break hotel 
153428,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch,No Negative, Really helpful staff comfy big beds and a lovely breakfast we only stayed one night but loved it the roof terrace bar is beautiful even in winter Would highly recommend 
153429,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, On arrival I was told I had to pay 100 deposit aswell as the total hotel price this would be refunded on departure I explained this was not explained on booking com On departure the man explained the money would appear in my account same day Later that day I returned to the hotel to aak why my money had still not been returned and the manager explained the receptionist had made an error and the money would now take 5 10days to return back to my bank this was dissapointing I booked this hotel for the rooftop bar I called the hotel to ask if this would be open and they said if it isn t raining Upon arrival the weather was lovely and I was then told the rooftop bar is closed all winter this was very annoying and I would not have booked this hotel if I was told before booking The parking was over priced , The pool and sauna facilities were amazing very warm and relaxing Most of the staff were very helpful and friendly 
153430,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Unfortunately TV in bathroom and hand held computer did not work but as we were only booked in for 1 night it was not an issue We were also asked if our stay was for a special occasion which it was my wife s 6th birthday and was told that something nice could be arranged but nothing was done Just felt that if nothing was going to be arranged then please do not ask the quest that question, The staff where extremely helpful and a wonderful building
153431,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Sound insulation between next room could literally hear EVERYTHING going on next door , Great bed lovely newly decorated room architecture of hotel stunning great staff 
153432,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Only had bottled beer at the bar Nothing on tap , Great gym swimming and sauna facilities Breakfast was really good and really good value for money 
153433,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch,No Negative, The hotel is amazing I d read a lot of reviews previously and had high hopes I wasn t disappointed Very friendly staff and incredible surroundings The styling of the rooms is amazing Even in standard room Much bigger than I expected Can t wait to go back when weather is better and try out roof garden terrace 
153434,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Just the pool water should had been warmer, Everything was fantastic the room their hostility only little let down was the pool it was freezing I still went in but not for long but would have stayed in if it was warmer that was my only downfall
153435,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Breakfast was very poor Cold plates cold food and poorly cooked no toast other than by using a DIY toaster my toast was stolen by another guest and poor service very low grade Not 5 star You can get a much better breakfast for less money at nearby cafes I told the staff this on check out but no response from management to my home telephone or email after five days despite assurances that my comments would be passed on Clearly a hotel that pays no attention to guest s comments We shall not return Here is a tip the nearby Hoxton Hotel offer much better value for money , Friendly and efficient staff Comfortable clean and quiet room 
153436,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Service charges added to all drinks even when you stood at the bar and collected them yourself, The best nights sleep I ve had in a hotel for ages Super trendy hotel with table tennis lush pool etc Lovely friendly staff and very comfortable rooms
153437,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The pictures showed we would have a bath in the room which we didnt We also didn t have any hot water in the shower in the morning The fire alarm also went off accidentally at 7 30am which was not a nice wake up , The hotel rooms were lovely and the service was excellent Great concierge easy check in complimentary late check out and the spa was just right Lovely to have a warm swimming pool 
153438,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Room got hot even with air con on and if we had the window open there was fans outside the room making a lot of noise, They kept the spa open till 12 which was nice And the rooms are a very nice big size Rooms very clean lovely hotel
153439,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The only negative was that in our room there was a large orange pink stain on the floor next to our bed which I hate to say looked like vomit The stain looked to have been cleaned but it was definitely still visible so I was really disappointed about this As we were only staying for one night and had been traveling I didn t want to make a fuss to be moved but I did place a towel over the area , Me and my partner both loved the uniqueness of the hotel particularly the bar and converted cells The bar itself was amazing and the overall decor throughout the hotel really gave it a luxury feel The staff were incredibly friendly helpful and welcoming Best service I have received in a London hotel for a long time 
153440,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, It was a little pricy for 3 nights but still wonderful, Made to feel welcome immediately I entered the hotel thanks to Pierre The swimming pool was amazing The food and cocktails fantastic and the staff polite friendly and helpful
153441,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Nothing everything was perfect, Very very attractive hotel super nice staff and very punctual They couldn t help enough with anything from room service to general questions on tube transport etc plus their positive happy attitude was fantastic The breakfast was beautiful and there was as much as you can eat from a nice healthy choice right up to the old classics full English Location is perfect and it was very easy to find We will most definitely be staying here again Room 317
153442,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Although staff were extremely helpful and friendly it was little bit too much in the breakfast room with a lot of staff watching our every move when eating I can not fault the staff and most people like that level of attention , Absolutely amazing hotel Facilities were great too We were given a tour of the hotel as soon as we arrived staff seem to be very proud of where they work and can not wait to show it off We were given an upgrade which was an amazing unexpected bonus The room was just perfect The pool was also great very relaxing Its somewhere you could go and stay for the weekend and not have to leave the building Can not wait to go back 
153443,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, I found the bed too firm more to with my taste than the quality bed Breakfast overpriced at 15 pp for basic breakfast buffet , Excellent attentive staff Superb pool and sauna facilities Original features to building Attention to detail 
153444,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The TV in the bathroom could only use one channel remote control not working Very disappointed that the swimming pool was out of action as the temperature was too cold Had read some reviews on this previously but thought the problem would have been solved a bit disappointing , The rooms were beautiful nice and warm Very clean and comfortable Staff were very friendly Great location Partners 50th birthday celebration staff put a beautiful complimentary sweet platter in the room which was a lovely touch 
153445,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The swimming pool was out of order the weekend we stayed which was one of the reasons we chose the hotel , The service was excellent the team were very knowledgeable and very friendly helpful 
153446,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Poor lighting in bathroom and the mirror difficult for the shortsighted amongst us , The atmosphere staff it s so good to have professional staff that take pride in their work Good standard of the rooms Combined with it s location a perfect hotel for a city break 
153447,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The pool was freezing in the morning Thought the view would be better Big wall blocking half the view , The history of the hotel The comfort of the room Facilities 
153448,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, We had a family room but only 2 glasses 2 slippers 2 robes although 4 friends checked in but staff were happy to bring more , Staff very friendly and helpful Bed very comfortable and lovely sheets Would recommend Good cocktails in the bar 
153449,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The staff didn t seem to match the maturity of the hotel All very inexperienced and at times not very helpful The bar was also quite lifeless and not very welcoming from the entrance hall , The room bathroom and bed were all very nice The mobile phone you can take out was also very useful even if it was a bit bulky
153450,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch,No Negative, The customer service was quite possibly the best i have experienced in any hotel around the world It s exceptional and i highly highly recommend 
153451,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The staff are very attentive pleasant and want to be helpful but some of them are just not fully trained or able to understand, Generally a very pleasant stay out of the ordinary from the usual hotels where we stay 
153452,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Heating was down for a number of hours when we arrived Was told it would be up and running around 5pm Was still without any hot water until 10 30pm Was offered a 10 discount on my next stay No thanks,No Positive
153453,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Bed huge but not the best hotel bed I ve ever stayed in Milk not refreshed in fridge so couldn t have an early morning cuppa Grrrr Found the hotel lacking in atmosphere but could be down to time if year and not many guests staying there, Very attentive friendly staff
153454,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch,No Negative, Everything was first class from the moment we arrived From the doorman collecting our bags and taking my car to a secure car park to the explanation of the buildings history Would recommend to anyone 
153455,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, I didn t know that when I got there I had to put 100 deposit down which they didn t tell me before Also parking is very expensive and you have to wait 10 15 minutes to get your car back, The staff were very nice and welcoming the hotel is lovely and felt very welcomed
153456,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, It lacked in the finer touches you would usually expect of a 5 hotel In my opinion the hotel is a 4 The hairdryers should be replaced it is one of those awful ones where you need to keep your finger on the button for it to work Our minibar was a cupboard with a bottle of tap water There wasn t even a fridge Tea and coffee making facilities are in the room but I ve been in other lower rated hotels where they have Nespresso machines this would be a nice touch A bath would also be a good addition sometimes a shower just doesn t cut it at a hotel and the robes look like they were made for children so it does lack a little luxury , Attentive and knowledgeable staff Room service food was of surprisingly excellent quality and was delivered quickly Stylishly decorated and impressive building 
153457,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Although some staff were wonderful the hotel clearly lacks a well structured central management that is a must for a hotel that claims to be 5 Some staff are wearing casual clothing or check Facebook on their iPhones in front of guests At breakfast it was all very chaotic and nobody seemed to be informed who should do what One staff member one night even complained to us about long working hours and the lack of motivation of fellow co workers Shockingly unprofessional for such a hotel For the price charged I would strongly recommend other hotels in London , Hotel looks very nice Rooms are modern and new 
153458,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Didn t love the pillows A good pillow selection is important , The staff were amazing We also loved the idea of the converted courthouse The room was gorgeous and so cool We had a great time at the bar and an incredible swim 
153459,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, High pitched sqeeking Noise coming from a laundry room near room 312 was a bit annoying in the night, Location was perfect and the room was comfy Friendly service makes you feel welcome
153460,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Management talking down to staff in front of customers bar menu being very dirty soiled service very slow in the bar when we were the only customers , Location ambience facilities room 
153461,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The water was cold for a brief period but it was quickly rectified , The decor and ambience were amazing the staff were really really helpful and accommodating the location is touch and go for people that drive to this hotel as the parking is quite expensive but other than that it s all round perfect I will definitely stay again 
153462,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The mini bar in the room contained only mineral water That s not a bar , Delightful hotel A marvellous renovation preserving a wonderful piece of history The roof terrace is spectacular with beautiful far reaching views 
153463,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, All pre arrangements prior to visit were forgotten about special birthday room service taxi bookings etc No residents bar available on a Saturday night ,No Positive
153464,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The staff need more training My friends took 3 hours to check in The bar staff couldn t manage a cocktail if it wasn t on the limited menu The breakfast came to our room 1 5 hrs after we d ordered it and was wrong , The beds were great the room was pleasent enough 
153465,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, No fault with the property itself other than it would of been nice to if had a floor guide to hand i e telling you where things were in the hotel bowling outside bar etc The website needed more information i e spa prices bowling prices cinemas prices menus , Staff assistance was always available welcomed every time we walked in Very helpful and suggesting ways to make the stay extra special surprise stay for my boyfriends birthday Got upgraded to a room with a view which was a nice surprise upon arrival Good checking in and out times normally hotels don t give you as much time and the conscierge meant we didn t have to carry our luggage round London all day 
153466,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The room I ordered upon booking com was not the one I was allocated and the hotel appeared to have a different grading of rooms which were not linked This resulted in me paying more for a most basic room No discount refund was offered I also had a friend who stayed in an identical room upon the same night for 70 less feel rather let down by booking com and courthouse ,No Positive
153467,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Towels were not changed daily No information book to look through Shame the roof terrace doesn t have heaters , Great room size comfortable bed fantastic position 
153468,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Shame you had to pay for the bowing, One of the best hotels I ve stayed the staff were extremely helpful and very friendly If you needed anything they would bro g it up to your room strait away Visiting again soon 
153469,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The Staff Too young seemed inexperienced Breakfast was a perfect example of total disorganisation Two girls running around like headless chickens had to ask 3 times for simple porridge request We stayed here last year and we re hoping that the staff issues had been sorted as the Hotel had just opened Sadly it has not Even the Manager looked young There was a private party on the Saturday night and the residents couldn t get served in the bar we got shoved into a side room and forgotten Ended up going out All in all the place needs a focused Management approach or they re not going to get repeat business Shame , Great hotel nicely restored Unusual features making it quite quirky 
153470,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Nothing , Hotel is located right in the heart of the trendy Shoreditch neighbourhood The hotel is newly converted from an impressive old courthouse I paid a bit extra to have a city view room It was very spacious large walk in shower and impressive views across the city I d recommend you do the same I didn t use the facilities but the pool looked good The bed was very comfortable The staff were all extremely helpful and attentive especially Pierre the head concierge and his team I paid for overnight valet parking which was in a secure underground basement Totally hassle free considering how much of a problem parking can be in London I was also surprised how quiet my room was considering we were right in the hustle of the city but I was 6 floors up Great stay and look forward to staying again Would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to explore the great shops of Shoreditch and around 
153471,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Gin and tonic served with warm tonic and no cucumber or lime Waiter looked out of place and didnt speak any English When I went to pay by card he said they would only accept cash Cashier was then very rude , Stylish hotel in great hotel Room and bathroom were excellent 
153472,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The service in the bar was very slow as only one person could make cocktails and the bar was half empty A service charge also got added on which I thought was bad considering we were sat at the bar so it wasn t even table service , It was a birthday treat for my boyfriend and our room was upgraded and cake was left in the room for us I also liked the history of the building and it has been done up very nicely 
153473,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, we ordered 1 breakfast from the menu this took over half an hour so we gave up in the end the tv had no volume and maintenance were not available sat nite , the hotel is lovely with some original features
153474,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, There is nothing I would change everything was excellent , The room was very palatial for a London hotel with seating area and huge bathroom Very clean and staff were very attentive and I would definitely stay again 
153475,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, It is a shame there is not a good restaurant but really just a cafe extension to the bar The rooms are comfortable and clean but they are decorated in that bland grey way of all hotels these days A bit more Shoreditch originality would be welcome , The staff were wonderful polite and helpful The place is interesting and authentic and a very pleasant environment The view from my room was spectacular and great to wake up to 
153476,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The room was a bit cold it would have been good to have some extra blankets I also couldn t find the hairdryer , The room was massive and the bed was super comfy The shower was very good and the room itself was furnished well The bathroom was good too and decent sized toiletries 
153477,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, i called room service at 10 15 service closed at 10 30 it rang and rang and someone just picked it up and put it down again not how customers should be treated at least talk to me if it is too late to order , nice pool helpful concierge comfy bed nice shower 
153478,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, being an old courthouse was special but the main hall gave a bit of a could feeling My room looked out directly to the windows of another block As I was outdoors allday it didn t bother me too much, very friendly staff well equipped room very quiet
153479,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The front of house staff member checking me was dealing with me in quite a rude and dismissive way almost like I didn t deserve to be there It was pretentious I also booked it with the pay nothing until check in but I was told that they took a pre authorisation of the amount for the room and required a further 100 for cover Then asked for id for me and my girlfriend when I asked why it was met with another I m better than you response I ve stayed in far nicer hotels that have cost a lot lot more and equally some that have cost a lot less and this was bar far the worst front of house service I have received I stayed at the m by Montcalm Tech hotel last month and that was much better , Comfortable bed and good shower 
153480,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, More coffee sachets would have been a good touch , Really nice room and nice hotel in general The bar area was a little minimalist and could have been a bit more welcoming Breakfast was really good View looking out over the roof top bar with the Shard in the background was great Staff were great especially the girl that put up with me being an idiot with my room keys 
153481,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Wish we had brought swimming costumes for sauna and steam room It was a shame that the bar area was unavailable due to a function as it has some great features cells converted into booths , Staff were very helpful 
153482,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Very poor service no one answered the phone for room service evening or morning room not available until 4pm rude staff double charge for room service very disappointing , Nice rooms clean and comfortable beds 
153483,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Shower was not terribly powerful and my wife said the toiletries were a bit masculine I thought they were fine , Very good location for making the most of this side of London and a good night s sleep was had even given its lively location 
153484,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Only small issue I had was he roof terrace wasn t open due to the weather Wasn t wet just a little cold yet other roof terraces were open until he vacinity, All of the staff were friendly and courteous The room was amazing and my request to have a room with a bath was no issue for them Absolutely enjoyed my stay
153485,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Food and bar service after 11pm of an evening We were informed residents could not order drinks from the bar after 11pm We were informed you could have drinks in the mini bar in our room The mini bar in our room was empty yes empty this is not the service a visitor requires and we will not be visiting the hotel again , Accommodation
153486,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Really lovely staff but the breakfast staff did not know what they were doing it was painful If they weren t so lovely I would have been very cross it s obvious they need more training , Decor and style
153487,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Broken lift meant it took longer than expected but now I m Just being picky roof top bar closing early but understandable as we were the only table , Absolutely everything wish I stayed there longer
153488,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Staff obviously have had very little training Got ignored at breakfast so didn t have any Room was not cleaned Fridge not restocked Had to make a cup of tea on the bedroom floor as there was only one socket to use Had to buy our own water as they didn t refresh our room No face cloths in bathroom Dirty towels left in bathroom and not replaced Wanted to charge 100 pounds an hour to use the bowling alley No blindoubt on bathroom window where we were overlooked by another buildings window Nothing positive to say about this hotel 5 star what a joke should be related as a struggling 3 star would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless you want your visit to London totally ruined by incompetence , Great location
153489,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, There was no information pack in my room on breakfast times spa visits etc etc The team at breakfast need much more training I had paid in advance for breakfast but everthing appeared to be to order There was an empty buffet station with a few pre prepared fruit salads and a plate of pastries but no invitation to help myself I asked for hot water and lemon instead of tea or coffee First time round I got a glass of cold water and lemon and next time I got a single cup of hot water with lemon on the side I would have liked a pot of hot water and some lemon slices It also would have been nice to be offered juice I did make it clear when I arrived that I had pre paid for breakfast There were 5 people in for breakfast and three staff I asked for bercher museli and salmon and scrambled eggs They were both delicious but I saw them arrive and sit on the side for several minutes as no one seemed to know who they were for Then they were delivered to me at the same time and by then the eggs were quite cold There was no offer of toast to accompany it Looking at the menu what I ordered would have cost me less if I had ordered them individually The waiter and waitresses were very polite but seemed completely uncomfortable in their domain It was a big disappointment after every other aspect of my stay had been without fault If I stayed again I would not pre pay for breakfast on this experience , My room far exceeded my expectations The staff were all very helpful and friendly I was there for a conference and the canap s and evening meal were all without fault The facilities for the conference were excellent The toiletries in the room were of a high quality and everywhere was spotlessly clean 
153490,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Sadly checkout problems where the room had been paid for in advance but there was no record and it was embarrassing for my guests and myself , Very helpful initially excellent customer service from Ylenia She was so friendly and accommodating I booked in a client who was used to very nice hotels We were looked after very well 
153491,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch,No Negative, the proximity to the station the locality and the choice of bars and restaurants in the surrounding area Also like the historical building and the cells which had been kept 
153492,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Breakfast could have run a little smoother but didn t taint the stay in the slightest , Service was fantastic Very attentive and polite Looked after our every need
153493,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Strange I had to put a further 100 down having already paid for the room Absolutely no service on the rooftop bar despite there being 4 waiters , Receptionists were welcoming and knowledgable about the hotel 
153494,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch,No Negative, Absolutely stunning hotel with incredible service The rooms are spacious extremely comfortable and clean The facilities are excellent our room had a huge flat screen in front of the bed an equal size flat screen in the lounge area as well as one in the bathroom We ordered room service it was fantastic We would stay again without hesitation 
153495,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The hotel is very new and still lacks some of the decor that would make it feel more lived in I would suggest having a centerpiece in the main hall with more seating to make it more welcoming Restaurant is not running smoothly yet as the restaurant manager and waiters don t seem to know what they are doing The food is great but I would have liked to see more healthy options The spa is lovely and new but still not fully functioning as there is no staff there Surely all the kinks will be worked out with time , Very friendly and welcoming staff clean and high quality finishings beautiful rooftop terrace with an amazing view spacious room great pool and spa facilities 
153496,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Was promised a parking spot they told me they had plenty returned 3 hours later to be told they where all gone The hotel is slap bang in the middle of shore ditch, Staff don t know what there doing
153497,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch,No Negative, Staff were excellent I left my Laptop charger and they found it and posted it back to me This arrived the following morning Very helpful and could not do enough for you 
153498,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch,No Negative, Room was clean modern and fresh lines The breakfast room and restaurant were out of this world set in an old courtroom Staff were helpful at all times

153500,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch,No Negative, Every member of hotel staff was friendly chatty and comfortable From check in the friendly conversation began which made us feel welcome Miguel showed us to our room and was polite helpful and told us a little about the hotel which is always nice We had a fantastic room with an amazing view room 616 The hotel even put out a little plate of dessert treats with a happy birthday message for my partner which was lovely Room was spacious and well decorated with a comfortable bed which gave us a great nights sleep Room was also quiet enough in the night although I m unsure if that was to do with being up on the 6th floor Location was brilliant Right next to hoxton square and shoreditch high street Bar in the hotel was well decorated with very friendly staff Roberto especially was a superb cocktail maker and made some very good long islands for us in the evening Impressed with the quirkiness of the bar but feel that not enough people know about it yet so the atmosphere was a little lacking However this will pick up in time I am sure Roberto and Roberta looked after us in the bar and we felt very comfortable chatting away to them All in all impressed with our stay and will definately come again 
153501,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Check in nearly put me off completely to the point I wanted to leave before I got to the room View of a brick wall from the room 407 But that s London The shower although it looked good was like a hangover from an old fashioned B B Jump around to get wet Not the sort of thing I expect in a 5 hotel, It was a tale of two halves Check out friendly and welcoming Maybe they were glad to get rid of me Great bed 
153502,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The service at the breakfast was really poor lots of staff just few customers and the service is really slow most of the time the forget what you have asked for really bad experience I would definitely order at the room when going Back there , The room was excellent
153503,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Depending on demand the rooms can be quite expensive got a good deal through booking com The housekeeping could ve been a bit better for a fairly top end hotel only little things that were unnesassry really, Lovely Hotel Good Staff
153504,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, On checking in at reception Staff seemed new to their roles as he was rather slow checking us in I think they may have been in training perhaps Also language barrier bit problematic perhaps our accents Irish confusing for the staff maybe Also main bar needs to be restocked very poor selections of drinks available Informed by another couple that their Evening meal on FRiday at 8pm took almost an hour to be served when this one couple were the only ones in the restaurant Housekeeping let us down as they forgot to restock T tray which had no Tea nor biscuits no coffee in our friends room either, V pleased to get an early check in as requested Staff v keen to help Clean and tidy hotel
153505,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Most of facilities were closed like the bowling lane or the swimming pool while this is the reason why I selected this hotel , Brand new hotel very nice people
153506,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Nothing at all , The staff were exceptional and attentive the venue was a perfect location in a great area communication with the venue before our stay was great and the hotel was lovely Can t fault it and will be back again soon 
153507,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Very bad experience booking in swimming pool closed Staff who are very good are let down by whoever owns this hotel No tea bags in room had lost the will to ask for them small things make big differences , Very comfortable beds very nice staff Food was very good although our order wrong still very good quality 
153508,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Hotel is very new and lacks atmosphere empty bar and lack of some basic amenities eg maps at concierge desk newspapers Some very odd practices like bath mat slippers placed beside bed each evening Swimming pool was out of order during our visit , Really comfortable beds and staff keen to be as helpful as possible
153509,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The restaurant staff although were very helpful I do feel a little training is required fruit and porridge delivered at the same time rather than 2 separate courses , Lovely room Roland in the bar was very pleasant and knowledgeable 
153510,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, The staff were overbearing judgemental and went out of their way to say no Everytime we passed the front desk we were stared at and at times it was very uncomfortable Upon arrival we were shown around the hotel by a lovely guy who showed us all the facilities available in particular the roof terrace with beautiful views I asked if I could go up there to take some photos and was told no problem The next day when I asked to go up I was told no I explained I had been told I could and again rather rudely I was told no by a Manager they had let other guests up previously There were more staff than beds and one of them could have taken us up there Might seem a little thing but what is the point of showing me something I then can t use with no explanation It was a very expensive trip and considered a real treat I was a little disappointed we were not treated better particularly as there were only 10 guests that weekend It really is the service that makes the stay Saying that there were 2 staff who were lovely and helped to redeem some of my disappointment The guy at the desk was great with directions and taking the time to let us know where to go The guy on arrival was great and very helpful nothing was an issue he seemed very embarrassed when we were told we could not go on the roof terrace No robes in the room quickly rectified but a small detail that I shouldn t have to ask for Kettle had to be used on the floor as that was the only available plug point 2 teabags and 4 mini pots of milk Hate that Again a small detail but for the cost of the room the tea and coffee facilities were reminiscent of a travel lodge I would stay again in the hope the Manager uses all the feedback positively and perhaps some of these issues were teething problems due to opening The building really is beautiful the older part has more atmosphere and charm , Beautiful building beautiful rooms 
153511,Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch, Nothing , Brilliant location brand new hotel lovely gym and pool and the best decorated bar I have been too in a long time check out the old prison cell booths from when the hotel was the county courts I had my wine in the Krays cell Lovely staff too Will return next week as I regularly stay in London
