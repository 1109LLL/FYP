48780,The Henrietta Hotel, A few maintenance issues were being addressed Which I m sure have been ironed out now The air conditioning didn t work but portable units were brought to the room before we had realised No complaints really You pay for the location too so it is pricey I think breakfast at least a continental should have been included , Great staff Very comfortable bed Lots of luxury extras in the room Good quality The staff took notice of my email mentioning it was our wedding anniversary A lovely bottle of fizz awaited us in the room and a Congratulatory note
