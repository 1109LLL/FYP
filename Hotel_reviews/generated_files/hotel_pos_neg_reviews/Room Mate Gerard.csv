275588,Room Mate Gerard, There was a construction site on both neighbouring houses However the rooms are soundproof so it didn t bother us as much as it could have Bring tour earplugs just in case The pool and rooftop bar closes at 7 pm It could be open later , The hotel was almost perfect We got a very nice room from the top floor Everything was brand new and worked well There was a tiny balcony to the street but gladly the noise of the traffic didn t bother us The room was quiet pretty and there was everything you need The bed was comfortable and big and the shower was great On the hotel rooftop you can enjoy the sun and have some drinks There is also a tiny pool where you can cool off The breakfast is great and served until noon 
275589,Room Mate Gerard, Very bad internet As I am always working while traveling this was very annoying for me The price performance ratio was a bit un balanced i e for this premium price I expected a bit more of the hotel , Very friendly staff Beautiful bathroom with a wide range of bathroom extras far above standard Mini bar prices more than reasonable far below standard Cool design Very good bed Separate area with desk work area 
275590,Room Mate Gerard, Rooms very dark trying to be too modern Towels where quite worn or not dried properly slightly smell both nights nothing major but not expected for this class of hotel Building work in the building next door from 8am should tell you to be honest not the hotels fault at all but price could maybe reflect that having travelled through the night to be awoken that early Nice hotel the minor details didnt add up thats all, Great Location last min booking 
275591,Room Mate Gerard,No Negative, The staff was absolutely outstanding and friendly Extremely helpful and definitely genuine The place was modern very new as we were informed it opened in May Never stayed at a Room Mate brand hotel before but after hearing it s history from the staff and our experience this will definitely be a top choice for the future 
275592,Room Mate Gerard, Lots of noise from the construction in the close vicinity of the hotel Can t sleep between 8 00 and 17 30 the drilling machine makes it impossible to stay in the room The water from bathroom comes verry hot sudently and you can get burned The light in the room can turn on unexpected Regarding this problems they offered me another room in a different wing of the hotel where I could rest but in my last day of vacation after I reported the problem 3 days behind , Beautiful room with modern furniture Good position
