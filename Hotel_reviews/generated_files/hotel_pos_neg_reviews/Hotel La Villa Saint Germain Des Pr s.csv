132428,Hotel La Villa Saint Germain Des Pr s,No Negative, We stayed with our seven year old daughter in a privilege room 53 which had a sliding door to separate the areas meaning we could put her to bed sofa bed and stay up to watch tv or read It was like having a two bedroom apartment in the centre of Paris The hotel was lovely and in a fantastic location close to the metro which made it easy to get to Disneyland and all the local sights and shopping right in the doorstep My daughter loved that it was just across the street from laduree too so it made it really easy for a macaron fix This was my second stay here and it will not be our last 
132429,Hotel La Villa Saint Germain Des Pr s, Very pricey for what you get Our room wasn t serviced by house keeping one day and coffee tea facilities not replaced Would rate more 3 than 4 , Great location comfy bed good sized rooms for Paris and quiet Staff pleasant 
132430,Hotel La Villa Saint Germain Des Pr s, Room size and bathroom size was just unbelievably small Standard room but still you literally fall into the bed on entering the room I travel regularly to Paris and have stayed at many other hotels in excellent locations but clearly for a better value for money Also if hairdryers in modern hotels still are these weird and old white fixed thing in the wall I get angry The whole room and equipment to me seems not designed from a user friendliness perspective A pity , Nice and fresh appealing design very friendly staff
132431,Hotel La Villa Saint Germain Des Pr s,No Negative, Honestly for the price of 300 euros per night this was well below average The room was small and the bathroom cramped Lots of hotels in this area that are more spacious and better value at this price point 
132432,Hotel La Villa Saint Germain Des Pr s, The toilet was not close to the bathroom so a bit problematic when your baby is sleeping and you have to creep past to get to it in the middle of the night , Breakfast was lovely Helped accomodate our baby with a high chair and being very friendly Junior suite was spacious and great for a family with a small child Location was superb loads of lovely restaurants and cafes nearby Notre dame 15 mins walk eiffel tower 45 mins walk Perfect Paris trip 
132433,Hotel La Villa Saint Germain Des Pr s,No Negative, Great location 10 min walk to the Louvre 15 min to Notre Dame Great macaroon shop across the road where we spent far too much time This hotel is a great base to do all your Paris sightseeing from 
132434,Hotel La Villa Saint Germain Des Pr s,No Negative, We spent the week between Christmas and New Years at the hotel We just loved it Staff was friendly and helpful Room was on the top floor It was very comfortable and quite large for a room in a large city Hotel was beautifully decorated Loved drinks in the lobby in the evening Great location too Can t say enough nice things about it Hope to go back soon 
132435,Hotel La Villa Saint Germain Des Pr s,No Negative, We loved that the room accommodated us and our daughter so well We were having a hard time finding a room that would sleep a couple and then a 7 year old separately in the same room The privilege room was perfect The neighborhood was lovely and the hotel staff was so nice and helpful 
132436,Hotel La Villa Saint Germain Des Pr s, A bit a minus is that a lot of Leisure questions could not be answered by the desk , the area is splendid the hotel small but a very personel reception 
132437,Hotel La Villa Saint Germain Des Pr s,No Negative, Fabulous staff Bent over backwards to help with everything from dinner reservations to organizing an iron Beautiful room and ensuite The breakfast area is especially tastefully decorated and a really pleasant ambience to start the day

132439,Hotel La Villa Saint Germain Des Pr s, Initial reception was a little terse and not super welcoming shower water wasn t contained well within tub one of those European style tubs with a glass half door that didn t seal very well so the floor would flood I am sure there is some smarter way to use it sink backed up a bit but wasn t worth complaining about AC took a while to cool when turned on typical small European room with limited space for suitcases storage Overall nice place though and location was excellent Would stay again for a somewhat more reasonable rate , Great location near Metro lots of places to eat supermarket nearby and walking distance to Seine nice upscale quiet room picturesque Parisian side street view out of French Windows comfortable albeit small beds Helpful and quick upon checkout and when we initially complained about issues with AC 
132440,Hotel La Villa Saint Germain Des Pr s, As an American it s difficult to understand the shower system A bit of explanation at check in would help It would have been nice if the room was a bit larger Difficult to maneuver around our luggage , Location was excellent Staff was very helpful The room was kept very clean Enjoyed the breakfast and the choice of foods nicely displayed Many wonderful restaurants close by don t miss La Caleche 
132441,Hotel La Villa Saint Germain Des Pr s, the value for money is not there rooms and bathrooms too small for the price Bathroom equipment outdated including toilets in the bathroom and not separated Very poor Internet Not even a bottle of water offered in the room after the first night and just one small bottle in the mini bar Except one very professional staff member the rest of the staff is not competent and impolite , Location is great The hotel rooms are clean
132442,Hotel La Villa Saint Germain Des Pr s, No electric outlets in the bathroom and the hair dryer was a hose installed into the wall , Great location and nice staff The room was really pretty There are many cafes nearby and shopping The Louvre is a 10 minute walk and Notre Dame Cathedral is not too far of a walk
