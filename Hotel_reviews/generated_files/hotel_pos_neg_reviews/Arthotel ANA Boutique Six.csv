501491,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, It has g, A nice hotel that is situated slightly off the grid Close to the main shoppingstreet thats true but at the end of it that is quite far from the very city center It is at least 3o min walk to the main attractions but subway and buses are close The interior is slightly worn down but my room was comfy and surprisingly big Very efficient AC which was nice when it was around 30 celcius outdoors I had booked parking in advance so I got room but there were others who had problems with that It had a good price value combo for what I paid but it is rather overacclaimed in the text about it on booking com It is a standard 3 star hotel off the grid with friendly staff and a boring breakfast room with nice buffet 
501492,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, The name of the hotel is not easy to remember taxi drivers has some difficulty remembering the name , Location excellent staff curtieous and helpful good breakfast close to shopping good restaurants nearby especially the Greek one on the street Comfortable bed nice bathroom Steven from Sydney Australia and 
501493,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Check in was very cold without smile There no enough parking space in the garage so I had to drive in public garage , The room is comfort and pretty clean Breakfast is good Hotel is very close to shopping street 
501494,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, There was no rubbish bin in the room the fridge was not working properly part of the curtain was off the rail there was no shelves small large for towels or soap shampoo in the shower room the carpet in the corridors was dirty and finally the small garden was largely overall not too badneglected with old rotten and broken sun beds and mattresses , Location service and staff 
501495,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, The room felt dirty bed sunk in the middle and the walls had lots of marks on them curtains very dated Could do with a good lick of paint on the walls Only one pillow none existent of fridge in 1st room we complained and and was given another room WOULD NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL AGAIN OR RECOMMEND IT , Size of the room Location 
501496,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, It s noticeable that rooms have seen better days we lived in a standard room but have also seen superior room which wasn t much better Furniture needs to be renewed it has noticeable scratches Bathtub didn t have a drain stopper so we could only use it as a shower We were told of a lower price when we decided to stay for 3 more days during last day checkout we were charged much more and it took around 20 minutes for me to handle this situation but we still were charged more than we were told earlier maybe because of misunderstanding or something , Breakfast is great and has smoked salmon definitely recommend D Rooms were very clean Cleaning staff was quite friendly and did their job perfectly Very good location less than 5 minutes of walking to subway which is situated at Mariahilferstrasse a street with a lot of shops and restaurants Other places of interest are situated within walking distance if you re ok with walking for around 30 minutes but that was great for us Internet connection although not very quick but served its purpose for us so we were happy with it Friendly and helpful staff they were happy to explain how to get somewhere and recommended some nice places to go 
501497,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, The hotel is surely not 4 Very dirty see pictures cigarettes on the balcony dirty windows walls cleaning staff in the middle of the corridor so that one cannot pass through The balconies are tiny meant only for security exit Very hot rooms as the a c is not working properly Breakfast is in the cellar is a disaster as already at 9 00 there was no coffee left Personal speaks bearly German is very indifferent The worst stay in Vienna , The location is central
501498,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Some how reminded me of a bunker of sorts And you had better have a lot of nerve if you re going to use the underground parking My travelling companion was not willing to be in the vehicle when it was time to come out She still to this day can t imagine how I managed it without either hitting one of the walls and there was copious evidence of that having happened or pooping my pants So fine cheap parking elsewhere and get there by subway and on foot , Half decent breakfast which is about all one can expect I suppose Good coffee from a dedicated machine which I find is the most important item of all 
501499,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Probably because of the location of my room the wireless signal was weak, The hotel was very pleasant quiet very clean and service was excellent The lobby area was very nice and there was a small garden next to it Its location close to Mariahilfe Strasse and the Ubahn was very convenient 
501500,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Breakfast placement, Place is at the center clean good neighborhood Single room bed is uncomfortable There is no kettle in the room you have to pay 2 for tea or coffee breakfast is good not a bad choice but overpriced

501502,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Talk about all that glistens reception area been modernised and looks okay but the rest of the place is a disgrace The hallway carpets are filthy the walls marked inside and outside the rooms Cheap furnishings and very tacky indeed The garden looks like it has been deserted and is really awful with weeds and old furniture abandoned Very disappointing indeed The china in the breakfast room was 90 chipped I have never seen this in a hotel before The little bucket on the table for waste was badly broken with a sharp and dangerous edge The coffee machine was on a couple of bits of wood and the worktop it stood on had lost its edge so looks awful , Good location close to shopping area Parking helpful Breakfast food quite acceptable

501505,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, The air in the room wasn t fresh and the breakfast was quite low budget type coffey was terrible , Location is very good if you are interested in shopping In addition it is located at a quiet neigbourhood and keeping window open for the night wasn t a problem 
501506,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Carpet was badly marked in corridor leading to our room A tea coffee making machine would have been good , Helpful Staff Good location 5 minute walk from one of the main shopping areas and tube station Just a few stops from the old town where there are plenty of restaurants bars Very comfortable bed Good shower Excellent breakfast 
501507,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Matress was not comfortable Cleaning stuff walked into my room 3 times without knocking because they thought the room was supposed to be cleaned and didn t think I had checked in Pretty uncomfortable Really wanted to use bathtub but was told there is no stopper for the water because the handy guy took it with him was very disappointed by that In general hotel needs refurbishment as many other point out and it is more a 3 star rather than 4 star definitely , Reception staff were very friendly Location was really good 
501508,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Bathroom sink tap broken twice in 3 days smell of bathroom was no good and the Wi Fi signal was poor inside the room , Good breakfast staf is kind and the room had good space 
501509,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, They do not have coffee maker in room Pillows are lumpy and thin like a newspaper Ity is a bit of a twisty drive to get there either by taxi or in your own car Secure parking but the reservation need because are only 5 6 parking places , Very close to subway station and 5 min away to the main central part of the city and Mariahilfe shopping street The staff is welcoming and nice Usual European breakfast included lasts from 7 am to 10 am I recommend to go have it before 9 30 as some products tend to run out There are many things to choose from but for example veggies and fruits were wilted Try the smoked salmon first class There are some bookshelves and a bar in the hotel lobby but we didn t use it Billa supermarket is not far from the hotel Good wifi connection Try for room 410 It is large and loads of windows

501535,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, The worst thing was the bathroom light switch which was outside the bathroom so when one occupant uses the bathroom which is right opposite the bed the other occupant gets disturbed If the bathroom and the bed were not opposite each other it would not be so bad We had an attic room the other rooms might be different It was hard to keep the rooom door open as we entered with all our luggage The carpets especially in the corridors looked dirty The carpets in the entire hotel can do with some cleaning The wifi was not that good , It is Value for Money We were lookng for something inexpensive with breakfast in a good location and this hotel met the requirements reasonably well The hotel was warm and cosy which was important as it was winter Breakfast was quite good bed was comfortable Bathroom was decent The room was clean Location is pretty good as the street Webgasse is directly connected to Mariahilferstrasse the main shopping street in Vienna and everything is easy to reach with the metro 
501536,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, I think that it does not merit 4 star I think it should just be 3 star The bathroom was not lighted well and was dark were the shower was Aside from which there is no shower closure so the water tends to splash out We borrowed some coffee mugs We used it and when we arrived that evening the mug and spoon were not washed We washed it ourselves The telephone did not have any instructions on how to use it So calling the reception or room to room or operator was practically not possible I tried dialing 9 and 0 and all the lower bottons to no avail , The location is good It is near a grocery Billa and at the end of the road is the shopping street It is also near the subways to get to the inner city or old town The breakfast is also good Room rate comes with breakfast You have a good choice is cold cuts scrambled and boiled eggs juice coffee choice of breads and oats They also have a fruit table The staff in the reception were very helpful

501539,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Pillows and bed hard However If we had made a remark directly they could provide us a topper which is good The curtains couldn t be fully closed so a lot of light came in in the morning I think this is room dependent , Friendly and helpfull staff when we arrived to our room it was smelling sigarettes It is not allowed to smoke in the rooms after we complained we directly got a new room Thanks Location very good
501540,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Poor breakfast noisy and very unpleasant way of using the emergency stairs for smoking it was impossible to open the window even if the room was very overheated because the smoke was flowing in from the neighbors , Location is great

501543,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Disappointing that there were no restaurant facilities at all for evening meals Although the overall quality of the food served for breakfast from 7am onwards was Ok including a range of cold meats and cheeses hot food was very limited to smoked sausage and scrambled boiled eggs , The staff were extremely polite and helpful with a great deal of customer focus Room facilities were of a good standard with comfortable bed safe for valuables and underground parking facilities Quiet room with balcony

501586,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, No English speaking channels on tv apart from news No kettle or welcoming water , The location was very good around 350 meters from the Mariahilfstrasse and the underground Breakfast was nice Room was clean and spacious and stuff were helpful 
501587,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Would have preferred a better choice of fruits at breakfast such as berries not fruit in juice and better labelling of foods , Nice clean room Quiet 
501588,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six,No Negative, The staff were very friendly cooperative and helpful Location was superb Ambience was good and rooms were spacious and cozy Overall the stay was a sweet memory 
501589,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Location isn t all that great but also not too bad Very much depends on what you re planning to do in Vienna of course The room was okay and clean but nothing to write home about , Staff at reception was very friendly Missed the breakfast so cannot comment on that 
501590,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, The shower room had a bad kind of chemical smell inside Also breakfast is quite poor , Close to subway interesting stylish room very good shower Very stable and nice internet wifi 
501591,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, As with many European hotels the shower game is weak The towels though clean were ratty and frayed and the shower head needed some serious work The holder and the shower head itself were both broken Not ideal , This is a great location for an overnight or weekend stay because of its central location to all areas of the city Though not spectacular the room is comfortable enough for a few days The breakfast on the other hand is top notch 
501592,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Not clean Unpleasant device One towel in the room No even toilet paper in the washroom Very expensive Unfriendly staff, It is a mediocre building and it is actually not a fair statement to call it a hotel 
501593,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Unfortunately the bad wasn t not very comfortable and the rooms were not soundproof at wall we were able to listen to our neighbors discussions , The breakfast was really good and the minibar consumption was on them 
501594,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six,No Negative, Very good service and comfortable and very clean rooms they even changed the towels every day Really rich and fresh breakfast Very close to the metro station though the city center was rather close also on foot and of course nearby Mariahilfestrasse which is great for shopping I would definately suggest it 
501595,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Didn t get off to the best of starts arrived to check in about 9 30 9 45pm asked if there was somewhere local we could get a meal not too difficult a question for a receptionist to answer I would have thought reply was bit late now no where would be open you could try Greek restaurant up the road they may be open still we discovered next day that there were plenty of places nearby that we could have eaten at Think perhaps that being used to staying in chain type hotels Accor novotel etc etc that the level of staff training is much better at those ok now for breakfast continental well it was er continental cold meat cheese frankfurters boiled eggs well I could knock something together to keep me going but my wife was not impressed free Wi Fi was rubbish, Room was very spacious bright and airy was let down by silly things really beds very narrow and not very comfortable bed lights loose and shades damaged curtains that didn t quite fit the window so let the light in balcony overlooking garden would have been nice to sit out there in the sun if there had been any chairs no coffee tea making facilities ensuite was brilliant clean modern with a great wet room type shower everywhere was really clean though the White walls everywhere were a little tired and needed refreshing some of the hotel d cor was a little strange weird pictures in the breakfast room large pink budda type figure in reception but all in all good hotel good location easy access to metro about 300mtrs on main street just 4 stops to city centre plenty of shops cafes restaurants etc But go and enjoy the Beautiful City of Vienna 
501596,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, I found some minor maintenance problems plumbing lighting The breakfast was not very exciting but it is OK for the category of the hotel To begin with the tables in the breakfast space could be rearranged as they appear today that make you think of a cafeteria rather than a fancy hotel , The hotel is in a very quiet spot of the city yet it is very close to a metro station and to the Ring The furnishing is nice and everything looks new and carefully planned The personnel at the concierge was nice and helpful 
501597,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Internet was very very slow I dont know if it was only during my stay because sometimes network issues happen however I couldnt even dowload 5mb file in email , Everything was perfect at the hotel also location I recommend everyone who travels for both leisure and business 
501598,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Webgasse is not a well known street for some reason , The staff were extremely nice and friendly The room was quiet and nice The bed was slightly small twin bed but everything else was ok The location is somewhat hard to find but it is two blocks from the train station Once one learns one s way around it was very nice 
501599,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, The beds were terrible When you book a hotel you expect to be able to sleep We found the beds were impossibly uncomfortable and regardless of how good anything else may have been I would not stay here again Also the balcony was a fire escape ,No Positive
501600,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, I was satisfied with everything , The location of this lovely hotel is perfect very close to the centre but in a quiet street Staff was very professional and helpful Room was comfortable and clean Thank you
501601,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, The wifi broke down on our first day of arrival which was extremely inconvenient as we struggled to find a store that sold SIM card on a Sunday We asked the receptionist and she said it was because the hotel was fully booked It was not an acceptable excuse and we had to use the paper map to plan tomorrow s trip without a way to communicate with our family and friends Nevertheless it was already fixed on the next day The bed on the other hand was not the cleanest one I found dusts on my blanket so it was not very confortable For the location although there were quite a number of shops on the street right before you make a turn towards the hotel it was 10 minutes away from the Wien Westhbf , Breakfast was nice in general Although it was really full on the first day and we struggled to find a seat at first The room size was great Plenty of space in the bathroom and a separate washroom 
501602,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Shower head wonky No tea coffee facilities in room Breakfast room in basement located in an uninspiring side street , Near Zeiglestrasse U Bahn and shops on Mariahilfe strasse Vienna s Oxford Street Happy staff Nice wine only 2 euros per glass at the bar Balcony doubles as fire escape over looks courtyard Free safe in room
501603,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, room was too warm even with radiators turned off absence of brochure in room regarding hotel facilities, excellent and friendly receptionists good selection at breakfast buffet excellent lounge

501606,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Couldn t work out the heating and was a bit cold and the bed was too firm for out liking , Location was amazing nice bathroom and decent sized room and bed Overall a great stay
501607,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, As coming from UK our group commented that it would nave been much appreciated if there was facilities in guest rooms for hot drinks I e a kettle in the room , Cleanliness friendly and helpful staff and easy accessible to the city centre 
501608,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, This is NOT a 4 stars hotel But a 2 stars very similar to an hostel The photos do not correspond to the reality the hotel needs an urgent reconstraction Everythis is old and dirty The staff is inpolite even don t say Hello trying do avoid any costomer s questions and requiests The brekfast is poor and sad , The location is not excellent situated in a small and dark Street but not far from the metro
501609,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, balcony is almost shared with another room there is some small metal obstacle wish can be easily jumped over so you have to be careful to lock your balcony doors, Breakfast was ok bathroom with heating floors was great especially in winter parking in the garage was conveninent great location nice staff

501612,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, The breakfast was pretty basic I would like to recommend some pancakes and omelet in addition to their compilation , The staff were nice and helpful during our entire stay The rooms were cleaned everyday 
501613,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, We couldn t find the switches for the lamps above the bed so we called the reception and were tersely told to either remove the card and cut off the electricity or to unscrew them ourselves When we complained a maintenance person was sent up and unscrewed the light bulbs It all felt rather unprofessional and in the morning we found the switches which were low down on the wall in an odd spot behind the pillows I guess the hotel also had no idea where their own light switches were Also there was no kettle to boil water I was somewhat sick and it would ve been great to have had a way to make tea Otherwise the hotel was fine , The location was fantastic perfect for going out to cafes bars and shops The room was large and roomy 
501614,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Very dirty walls and flooring in corridors and in our room No room service breakfast Tepid water for tea in breakfast room , Reasonably convenient location and friendly staff

501619,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Internet works but it s quite slow It s close to the train station but not at the heart of the city We usually took the metro to go to the touristic spots It could have more TV channels in English , Good bedroom and bathroom with bathtub Few blocks from shopping streets and metro station Nice modern decoration Breakfast included 
501620,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, I didn t like the girl from the desk in the night that I arrived She was mean wasn t polite at all This kind of attitude can ruin your stay , I liked the girls from the front desk but on my second day They were kind and helpfull I liked the breakfast the location and the design of the hotel 
501621,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Unfriendly staff uncleaned room wall full of dark lines no early breakfast possible no way for a compromise to cancel the reservation or to find a later date some days before because of an strong illness ,No Positive
501622,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Scruffy and poorly maintained hotel throughout I am sure that the hotel was a good quality when first established but since then little has been spent on maintenance marks on walls common areas rooms chips on furniture marks and stains on sofas buttons missing in lift there s a long list Generally shabby , Good location close to Westbahnhof Station and Mariahilferstrasse
501623,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Shortage of restaurants nearby Plenty of caf s though , The location was excellent for travelling by tram bus or underground Not far from main road Ideal shopping location Pleasant walk to tourist area 
501624,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, The ladies at the reception could be friendlier more welcoming After all they are the face of the hotel to the guests The cleaning in the rooms could be more thorough , Excellent location Literally just 1 minute walk from the busy shopping street of Mariahilfer and Zeiglergasse metro station which would take you right to the heart of the city in four stops The lobby is stylish the rooms are clean comfortable chic Breakfast is good and tasty Overall great value for money 
501625,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Our booking had breakfast but in restaurant there is no place to sit and we had to wait When we found the table the waiters just picked the things without realy cleaning Also the hotel had dirty walls broken buttons in elevator The room service does not exist at all and they changed only the towels not sheets The room was cold nobody told us that we must opened alone heating but also with heathing we feel cold The girl receptionist all the time staring at computer and we felt like invisible beacuse she never said even hallo when we go inside or left hotel I realy do not recommend this hotel and I wonder for scores in booking ,No Positive
501626,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, There were small amentities missing such as one use sleepers and bed cover was consisted of two differnt pieces there were no normal glasses except plastic ones there was no boiler to prepare a hot beverage , Location close to public transport
501627,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, It s really dirty in rooms We had to change room but the other was not much better The impression is that cleaning ladies are not very happy and don t give any effort to clean anything Tips didn t make them any happier Besides walls and all the fabrics are dirty too bed cover curtains etc Towels are all old and worn out , We really liked the location it s near shopping area not far from the center and still it s so quiet Breakfast was good nothing really special but good quality and variety Staff at reception and breakfast area was friendly and helpful 
501628,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six,No Negative, This hotel was a great place to stay in Vienna We were happy to understand how cute are the rooms same with photos how great is the location near the Oceanarium most popular shopping street walking distance to old city centre and railway station The staff was very helpful also assisted with the forgotten personal pieces in our room Thanks a lot 
501629,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, With a bit more attention this hotel has a huge potential A bit more smile and kindness bit more and bigger towels and better quality toiletteries the one the hotel provided smelled like some cheap men s parfume in the bathroom a bit more attention to details and perhaps some small refurbishment would make it so much better I opted for an upgrade to a superior room don t do that unless you smoke the balcony offered for this upgrade is ridiculous I would not even call it a balcony Generally I missed those things that makes me feel it was worthwhile to pay extra for going to a hotel compared to renting an apartment , The location is perfect close to Westbahnhof and Mariahilfe str yet in a very silent street The breakfast was also perfect wide variety of foods and drinks The room was ok but nothing extra 
501630,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six,No Negative, Good value for money Very friendly and helpful staff 5 minutes to the underground on Mariahilfer Street Close to the English Haydn Cinema shows English Original Version Films without subtitles

501632,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, We slept in a room that had holes in the bed sheets a mark on the sheets and dust everywhere I am sensitive to dust and at night I had trouble breathing The welcome was by a security guard whose first words to us were How would you like to pay at 12am on a Sumday evening The towels were frayed and hard We eventually moved to another room Staff were very stern and not at all welcoming Overall you feel as if you are intruding instead of being welcomed No late check out available for genius guests , Breakfast was consistent 
501633,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Not the friendliest of hotels Would like to know who stepped out the 5 minute walk to the Vienna Airport Lines At a reasonable pace it took us 15minutes , Was a short distance to the shopping street and great cafe s 
501634,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, The carpet in the room is dirt The bed is small and uncomfortable In the room is cold the heating was at maximum but the heating device was almost cold , The location is perfect and the price for the parking place was ok 
501635,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Shower screen in bathroom very small so water soaked the entire bathroom near slipped when I needed to go to toilet Bathroom smelt like Mould Everytime someone walked around their room it sounded like an elephant , Room upgrade meant we had a better sized room 
501636,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, The staff could be a bit more helpful They were not rude also but they could try to appear more friendly when serving customers , Nice room very good location near Naschmarkt Westbahnhof and Mariahilfstrasse with nice restaurants around

501642,Arthotel ANA Boutique Six, Nothing everything was great, After a bad experience in our previous hotel it was nice to be greeted by friendly helpful staff who went out of their way to accommodate us
