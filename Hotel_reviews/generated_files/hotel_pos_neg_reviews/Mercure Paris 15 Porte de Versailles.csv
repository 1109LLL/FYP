221760,Mercure Paris 15 Porte de Versailles, Poor communication between booking com and hotel as we were asked to pay for breakfast only for me to produce an email which said and confirmed tgat breakfast was actually included, We had the maintenace manager swearing in front of us at reception The next day the lady cleaning the room actually almost forced us out of the room at 11 am so that she could clean I had to stand my ground and tell her to wait as we were getting ready to go out for the day

221768,Mercure Paris 15 Porte de Versailles, I didn t like the fact that there wasn t any airconditoning at all when it was hot and humid during the 5 days that I stayed there The reason being that it s normal in Paris hotels not to turn on their airco units during the so called colder months However it was very sunny and temperature for first two days was over 26degrees In addition to that I stayed at level 6 and I could always hear the water flushing going down Perhaps the plumbing in an old building is pretty bad It was very hard to go to sleep and I had to have my earphones on or put on the music to put myself to sleep Very annoying indeed , I liked the location of the hotel as it was close to where I needed to be early in the morning The rooms were modern and clean 
221769,Mercure Paris 15 Porte de Versailles, The breakfast for the price of 17 euros bread and croissants were the industrial kind not fresh Very few fruits Only two choices of not tasty cheese For France it was a let down It was a 20 minute walk to the exhibition at Porte de Versailles which is tiring twice a day in heels for 5 days , Professional staff helpful very clean hotel and room
