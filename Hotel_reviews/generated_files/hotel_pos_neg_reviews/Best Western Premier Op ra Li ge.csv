259475,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, room s too small first time there was great with a lot bigger room this was the second time and the room was rather small quite disappointing, good location good bed good room condition
259476,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, Our room was tight even though it was only two of us , Breakfast was fabulous many many great choices The staff was excellent helpful friendly went out of their way to make our stay great They are in the process of adding on a courtyard to provide a place to have a drink or read Fitness room very basic Centrally located 
259477,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, Staff and service in the restaurant was not adequate for a 5 star establishment , A well located hotel just off the touristy area in a calm street with multiple possibilities of public transport within maximum 10 minutes on foot from the hotel Excellent value for money for Paris standards Clean modern interior Friendly and knowledgeable staff at the reception 
259478,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, Small room as everywhere in Paris and not very comfortable pillows But anyway will choose the hotel again for the short stay , Nice location very friendly staff Very quite hotel comfortable to stay there 
259479,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, While we would have preferred it closer to the center of Paris it was easily 1000 cheaper for 5 nights and 3 stops on the Metro from le Champs Elysee on a line that had good transfers to all we wanted to see, LOVED the fresh juices everything about express breakfast for 7 Euros We were traveling as couple with grown child and stayed in 2 floor room giving her some independence and space The Staff was friendly and most helpful in English or French Rooms are contemporary clean and comfortable 
259480,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, The hotel staff wasn t attentive enough we waited nearly one hour just to get into our room one of the huge problem is housekeeper didn t clean room properly somehow they didn t even refill the towel or anything room dining has small amount of options first of all by the time you call them to order the staff will tell you that they pretty much run out of everything , Facilities are pretty new with easy access It is a quite location so i didn t get any problem with sleeping 
259481,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, The room itself wasn t very inviting it was basically a grey concrete box with an overhead fluorescent light I definitely walked in and kind went ugh It was also very small The cooling worked but I didn t sleep well as the temperature varied between too hot no cooling and too cold minimal cooling I think The bathroom was fine clean well laid out and not too tiny The shower was nice with one minor flaw it had a shower head you could hold but not mount high enough for your head and the currently fashionable but not enjoyable IMO ceiling mounted wide drip head which I find both wastes water and doesn t have much volume for what does hit you Overall it was all okay but I ve stayed in more pleasant hotels in the area for less money , Clean nice lobby welcoming staff Well laid out and reasonably sized bathroom 
259482,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, They call themselves boutique hotel But this is just a very small hotel In my understanding a boutique hotel is where every room is carefully designed and each room has a complete different concept In this hotel all rooms are the same but have different sizes Our room was tiny and we were welcomed by immediately being asked whether we wanted an upgrade for a bigger room although we thought we had already paid quite a lot to stay in this hotel It doesn t really feel like it s a 5 star hotel It feels like a very expensive small hotel in the center of the city massively overrated but decent and comfortable , The staff was very friendly The hotel was nice and clean It s been very recently redone so everything was in a top state The location was also very central so that we could mostly walk anywhere The bed was amazingly comfortable 
259483,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, No complaints , Nice room clean and comfortable The hotel has convenient access to public transportation We would return to this hotel in the future 
259484,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, The room is very small Didn t check the details of the hotel because it is listed as 5 stars hotel and didn t expect the essential room so small It is more like a very good express hotel rather than a true 5 star hotel , Brand new and very very good location
259485,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, No issues at all with the hotel I was saddened by the large number of beggars in Paris but I suppose this is a sign of the times we live in , All the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful 
259486,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, The night staff was unfriendly and in some instances rude This hotel does not deserve a 5 rating I was surprised they couldn t even bring tea to the room at night because it was the weekend and they didn t have hot water Will not be staying here again can find better 4 hotels ,No Positive
259487,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge,No Negative, Bed was comfy Interior design was spot on Very nice lobby and breakfast area room was not the biggest but was enough due to very good layout in the option of an architect and an engineer D Breakfast was very good with a fine selection of a ready buffet Front desk service was excellent and very helpful If felt really good to stay at Best Western Opera Liege 
259488,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, I have no faults with the hotel only that they should have a bigger bar , The hotel was amazing The room was a great size absolutely immaculate The staff was also very polite attentive Highly recommend this place 
259489,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, Due to recent renovation the room had a peculiar odour As usual breakfast was not included only 3 star hotels give a free breakfast , Staff were wonderful 
259490,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, Room size was a little small No view outta the window , Location was a plus point being a 2 minute walk away from the Metro station and about 20 minute walk from Sacre Coeur The bed was a great size and all amenities were provided in the room Super friendly and helpful staff made the stay an absolutely joy 
259491,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge,No Negative, I really think the hotel has one of the best teams The staff are amazingly friendly and always ready to help you Staying there definitely made my trip memorable 
259492,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, The only downside was there is no food on offer other than a very expensive breakfast While there is loads nearby arriving late after work would have been nice to have a couple of options ,No Positive
259493,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, Rooms was very small Limited storage space Very small restaurant bar area Would question 5 star status , Clean new modern and within walking distance of all the Paris sites 
259494,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, All was perfect, I like all realy amazing place close to all also the hotel is 4 stars but realy should be 5 stars Realy recommen it to all you will enjoy your stay to much
259495,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, I don t know what I could suggest to improve the stay I had The location would be slightly more Central but it wasn t difficult getting to any of the many tourist hotspots I visited , The service was excellent Staff were friendly and extremely helpful I let them know I was celebrating a milestone birthday and they provided a number of treats 
259496,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge,No Negative, The room the bathroom and the bed were new big and excellent Staff was a special chapter every one of them were really sympathetic friendly and ready to help us with everything And the breakfast wow 
259497,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge,No Negative, Great hotel nice and modern comfortable big rooms great shower and bathroom products breakfast is fantastic Nespresso in the room it s perfect 
259498,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge,No Negative, The staff are fantastic can t say enough about how friendly and helpful they were We had an odd suitcase problem and Gary from the front was our MacGyver Breakfast was fantastic and the room was really lovely Will definitely stay here again 
259499,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge,No Negative, The room had windows that look like small holes in a box but the staff and the comfort of the room bathroom and the rest of the hotel made me forget that discomfort I especially liked the staff that is really customer service oriented From now on this will be my hotel in Paris as good customer service in Paris is extremely rare Keep it up A smile goes a long way 
259500,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge,No Negative, I travel a lot And I can say that this is quite simply the best service I ve ever received at a hotel in my whole life These guys won t refuse anything for their customers When I m next in Paris that s the only place I ll stay at 
259501,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge,No Negative, The bed was very comfy Location was brilliant and the staff were amazing The hotel is nice but on the lower end of 5 stars I think Still a great stay though 
259502,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, Staff rude and unpolite Nobody available at the reception at night and had to call the hotel multiple times to get in Nobody available early in the morning for checkout ,No Positive
259503,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, I have bought some fruits and flowers to the room for my wife s birthday and the staff who cleaned the room took them We never got answer of what happened, Very quit hotel clean design and willing to help staff in the reception The room is perfect as in pictures
259504,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, The lobby was very small and could get overcrowded there is no restaurant in this hotel you could only order room service the food was not good , The hotel was very cute the staff very friendly it was very clean it looked brand new The location was pretty good if you like to shop 
259505,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge,No Negative, Positively surprised The hotel is really nice amazing bed good toiletries clean It was great to arrive and see that it was more than expected Only one night so I wish I could ve stayed longer there 
259506,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, Not much would like to have a chance to get back when the roof is completed , We were very happy with pretty much all aspects of our stay the service in particular was fantastic The room was great the bed was super comfortable excellent shower etc but again the staff is what really stood out 
259507,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, There was no hot water in shower and when I spoke to reception at night he promised to let the handy man look at it first thing morning When I tried the shower before checking out it was cold Called the reception and the lady said the manager is saying they cant fix it now Would you like another room That was an hour before check out and i had to use cold water , The overall rooms are small and this is normall in france but the Bed was very comfy 
259508,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, Had a couple of issues with the keys which Stephanie fixed We stayed 10 days and would have liked a breakfast that was more varied each day or each couple of days , Stephanie was great and helped us book many excursions She is a gem 
259509,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, breakfast, location is great 5 min walking to lafayette very clean and new rooms luxury bathroom aircondition is works fine satellite system is good
259510,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, 1 Extremely small rooms and very bad front desk service 2 On the 2nd day we did not get a fresh supply of toiletries 3 The same dirty bath sheet from the previous day was folded and put back on the bathroom towel shelf 4 We called for some one to assist with opening the safe that was never resolved we eventually after over an hour wait resolved the problem ourselves 5 There was no room service menu and it took forever and a visit to the front desk to get one brought to our room from the front desk 6 We called to inquire about transport to the airport after close to an hour we had to call again 7 The food from room service was terrible over priced and certainly not value for money Probably the worst vegetable soup we have ever had 8 No CNN , The stylish d cor and the fact that it is modern and clean
259511,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, Booked superior room ended up in very small superior room Extremely hot They told me the airco does not work because hotel is on central heating For a 5 star expected much more Missed cosy lobby and atmosphere Forced to sit in unpleasant small room Such a shame for a 5 star hotel , staff was friendly but could not do much
259512,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge,No Negative, Very professional helpful staff gave us good guidance on touristic areas food places etc The hotel is 2 minutes walk away from Liege metro station so very easy to travel around 
259513,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, NA, Location was between the Eiffel Tower and the major shopping areas including the must see Galeries Lafayette Hotel room was small comparable to all Paris Hotels but it was brand new with all the comforts for a relaxing visit 
259514,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, The gym is very clean but extremely small one treadmill one ellipstical one bike However I really like that there s a Precor Functional Training Gym FTS Glide I believe The location is rather quiet in the evening this is either good or bad For me good but I can imagine others who want to be on a street with a lot of bars If so this is not for you , The staff was very friendly I appreciated that when I arrived the bellhop escorted me to my room to explain all amenities wifi lighting mini bar safe There is complimentary coffee and tea in the room although they forgot to restock the coffee on my first night second night the cleaning staff accidentally took my second key card I did not eat breakfast here as there are so many wonderful cafes and bakeries just down the street The bathroom is really nice absolutely loved the shower the towel heater and the robes Within 5 7 minutes you can easily access multiple metro lines 
259515,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, I wouldn t say this hotel is a 5 Small rooms not like the photos and facilities were limited small breakfast area doubled as a lounge during the day no proper bar just a corner of the reception desk with bar stools As a result we spent more time outside the hotel not particularly great value for money , Friendly welcome the staff were great at recommending restaurants helping us get settled in Good location 
259516,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, It s quite business y and there isnt much to the hotel except for the rooms i e no nice bar area or communal spaces downstairs Rooms quite small , Clean lovely staff good roof terrace good location not far from St Lazare
259517,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, My room was quite small but it was at a good price so can t complain , The staff were very friendly and helpful It was close to the Liege Metro so easy to get back to the Gare Du Nord Close to lots of nice restaurants 
259518,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, Small breakfast room and not value for the price so much , Location Stuff was very nice but we have got the feeling that its better to check the information about Paris on the internet alone 
259519,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, Bar area could perhaps have been better though we did not personally use this , Comfort and cleanliness of hotel Location very good Staff attentive to any of our needs 
259520,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, The pictures were very well taken since the rooms looked way bigger than they were in fact The manager wasn t very sympathetic when asked about the possibility of an upgrade Was a good hotel but not worth the rate By the same price you find better deals in Paris , Location was really close to the subway restaurants and drugstores The shower was really good and very modern Upon our arrival we were checked in by a super nice staff member don t recall his name but we didn t see him again during our stay He promised is a bottle of champagne but we never got it 
259521,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, Room is too small and no air conditioning during winter Therefore the room feel stuffily in the early morning , Staffs are helpful and friendly Lobby is elegant and the bed is comfortable Bath room meet expectations 
259522,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, A little bit far from the Champse Elessay and the place is good for couples where i was there with my friends The room is a little bit small , Clean and close to the metro station very nice staff 
259523,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, Breakfast is always the same However everything is fresh and tasty Bed is a little bit soft my personal preference , Clean and cozy rooms Coffee machine is a good option When I asked I have been provided with an extra towel Very good personnel 
259524,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, As the hotel is brand new there are a few snagging problems and it was very obvious that someone had been smoking in the room as there was a cup on the windowsill with cigarette butts in it , The entire hotel is brand new so everything is clean tidy and well presented 
259525,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, Nothing Everything fine , Very nice and helpful staff Spacious clean and comfy rooms Value for money great Nice location in quite street Close to Galerie Lafayette Printemps Opera Moulin Rouge etc 
259526,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, Nothing, This was our fifth wedding anniversary so wanted something special the hotel didn t dissapoint in the slightest only 3 months old it was in superb condition with all the mod cons you d expect in 5 star got a great day rate and a free upgrade in a duplex apartment would highly recommend was about 10 mins walk to opera house where you can catch the bus to the airport and about another 10 mins walk to the seine so great position overall
259527,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, Room was very small not like the pictures It is not a 5 star hotel by a long stretch Definitely an average 4 star Hot chocolate from room service was 6 and it was just a tiny cup of powdered hot chocolate This is very disappointing especially in France as they usually do hot chocolate so well The maids knocked on our door at 6pm every day asking if they could clean the room Very strange time to ask to clean your room I was almost overcharged on checkin and I show the girl my booking com document to show her the price She assured me that was ok and I wouldnt be charged more than booking com had told me Then on check out they tried to charge me another different amount Overall quite disappointed with the hotel Its not a 5 star , Nice reception area Good location Comfortable beds and nice bathroom 
259528,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, I will suggest to director of the hotel a bit more attention to the breakfast Not everything there when you go and sometimes you need to wait to refill Breakfast is same important as the rest of the service and the general image of the hotel is more than good Is great But even this is acceptable as staff do their best to help and make you happy , The value for money is excellent Very nice rooms clean the staff polite and professional the rooms spacious the bathroom shower gels and shampoos are in high quality freshly washed towels and many more First time I visited this hotel but I can recommend it for sure 
259529,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, there is no bar inside plenty around the building however , Great welcome and beautiful entree Friendly employees Nice rooms Close to metro Liege and walking distance of Sacre Coeur 25 minutes 
259530,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge,No Negative, Staff were excellent and were always on hand to help plan our day rooms were small but very comfortable Located right next to liege metro station so ease of access to city centre 
259531,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, I would not expect a usual 5 star hotel amenities no turn down service no concierge Last day of our stay the room wasn t cleaned until after 5 pm But nothing that ruined our experience Would come back , Brand new hotel with modern design Comfortable beds clean rooms Staff is very friendly Very good breakfast hight quality products We stayed in a room 311 that has windows on both sides overlooking both the courtyard and the street so there was plenty of natural light Subway station is 2 min walking Really nice location outside crowded areas but still central 
259532,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge,No Negative, Amazing hotel in every prospect Laurent was great at the reception and Sabrina made sure that anything needed from room service was delived quick with the highest quality I would definitely stay again 
259533,Best Western Premier Op ra Li ge, members of staff opened the door and walked in while I was in the room on two seperate occasions on first day I believe they thought the room was empty It did not bother me that much but just a note to management to improve the otherwise great operation , Floraine at front desk was great to deal with and very accomodating Well laid out room that has everything you might need
