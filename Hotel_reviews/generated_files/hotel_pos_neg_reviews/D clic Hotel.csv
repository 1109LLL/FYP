71535,D clic Hotel, Too much dust in the room , Great staff and a funny d coration room really oldfashion with space drawing and light in the floor and ceiling but we all like that The bed was so comfy Location is really good 
71536,D clic Hotel, I had a stargazer room which was very original but small especially the closet For one person and one or two nights it s okay but not for longer and certainly not for a couple , The staff is very friendly and the hotel is in a quiet street The bed was very comfortable 
71537,D clic Hotel, This hotel is almost brilliant but left disappointed Sent message with booking stating arrival time Hot day and got lost arrived 2 hours late was told room was ready Went up to room and it had not been cleaned from last guests After 30 mins was told we had been upgraded Room was tiny but amazing on first impression lights on ceiling and floor space age loo funky paint and lights However 1 Mirror lights remote control one bedside light hairdryer all broken 2 Minibar prices were truly ridiculous 8 for a little pot of nuts 5 for a coke 3 Loo door creaked so loud I had to leave open to avoid waking partner and 4 I would have lived with the rest with only minor irritation but THEY DISABLED THE AIRCON AT NIGHT It was 30 degrees in our room at 1am when I awoke in a sweat The little book in the room had English and French pages for everything but the Aircon page where the French page was duplicated Such a shame could be a great place Declic if you read this get a delivery to room deal with a local food drink place and step up your maintenance , Staff were very friendly upgrade coffee after hotel error really great design inside hotel Location midway between grotty area and arty area Felt safe long way out of centre but near metros Room design was brilliant 
71538,D clic Hotel, Breakfast very expensive Genius benefits Priority check in and free drink Got neither , Liked the location as it was within a nice residential area Plenty of bars restaurants Plus bakery supermarkets Metro only a short walk away We were on the 4th floor room 403 Nice and quiet Staff very friendly Large clean room Hot room but there is a c Large comfy bed Huge bathroom with bath and great shower It would have been nice to have had a plug for the bath We did ask and it wasn t delivered Toilet was separate with no sink Good to have a coffee machine and safe Interesting lighting and decor Would recommend 
71539,D clic Hotel, It was very very themed but that s part of the fun, The crazy interior was super fun I had a blast with all the different lighting options I don t think i ll ever get to stay anywhere as quirky as this again Great location I love the 18th
71540,D clic Hotel, It would be better if the sound proof could be considered for between the rooms , The staff at the reception were really welcoming and helpful while being very professional The rooms are well designed 
71541,D clic Hotel, Noir et blanc suite was just a bit too modern for its own good a degree is required to understand the light switches and I didn t even attempt the coffee machine Quite an experience slightly kitsch and boudoiresque , Staff very welcoming We were upgraded the noir et blanc suite 
71542,D clic Hotel, more light in the room there where some dark spots bathroom and dressing, only a 10 walk from Montmartre very friendly staff lugage store at the last day 
71543,D clic Hotel, A bar would be great to have, Perfect hotel for our stay Clean room nice environment and cosy Easy to reach with Metro The staff speaks English and very helpful 
71544,D clic Hotel, There was nothing we didn t like it was amazing, Very friendly and helpful staff highly recommend hotel declic The lady that does breakfast in the week is so lovely
71545,D clic Hotel, I was expecting the deluxe room to be a bit bigger , The room was just stunning with all the light effects clean amazing shower and confortble mattress Staff really helpfull Great position 
71546,D clic Hotel, Narrow corridors and stairs Too small room at least one we take Toilet is close to bed like less than meter close , Very comfy mattress and pillow Good bathroom with nice shower Very large terrace actually larger than room terrace 40m2 room 15m2 
71547,D clic Hotel, The room could have been a little more spacious , Great bed great location quiet room The style of the hotel is excellent the photography theme Really good choice in the Montmartre area 
71548,D clic Hotel, Nothing negative to say , The Reception staff were incredibly helpful talked us through navigating Paris and made the whole hotel experience a lot better Room was clean incredibly well decorated and funky superb use of LED lighting Plus the hotel is in a perfect location quiet at night close to a great boulangerie and 2 minutes from the Metro You could pay double and stay in a far worse hotel than this 
71549,D clic Hotel, Couldn t get into hotel after a night out as porter was sleeping or do something else, The room was really nice and clean the staff were very helpful in reception nice location very near mont marte will be back 
71550,D clic Hotel, Although not far from Lamarck metro If I were critical I d say the location was a little effort to get to involving climbing some steps with luggage if we took the shortest route, Brand new hotel Very high specification and visually stunning after all each room is a photo studio Friendly professional and security conscious staff
71551,D clic Hotel,No Negative, The place was really nice and the staff was even better Really nice clean place with well decorated rooms and with awesome staff like the receptionist Lauren which she help us in everything that we need it
71552,D clic Hotel, The room was a little smaller than expected Not detracting from a lovely stay but there was the odd banged elbow and stubble toe, Unique and bespoke 
71553,D clic Hotel, No issues with hotel breakfast was expensive so we choose to eat out instead , Quality themed boutique hotel room was well furnished tastefully decorated with a very comfortable bed and a super bathroom All staff were extremely helpful and friendly Set in a vibrant area with plenty of pubs and cafes etc and located close to Metro
71554,D clic Hotel, 18 for breakfast seems expensive but I haven t tried it Rooms are small even the superior double room Especially unfortunate is the lack of shelves in the bathroom You are left with only a few cm space on the sink to put your stuff on and otherwise you are reduced to keep your things on the floor or in the room itself Even in the shower there s no shelf to put the shower products on which is very inconvenient , Very nice design and friendly staff Good location on Montmartre near a metro station and not far from streets with caf s etc 
71555,D clic Hotel, Perhaps more detailed instructions for the heating aircon remote, Great location near Sacre Ceour the staff was amazing and friendly at all times of the day night Bed was comfortable and showers were new and well maintained 
71556,D clic Hotel, I wish we had stayed longer , The staff were amazing We arrived just before midnight and the guy behind the desk was so nice as were all the women the next few days Even though we were clearly backpackers staying 2 nights for a birthday staying in a nice hotel we still felt extremely welcome by all the staff When I booked the room I asked for a specific style room I had seen when I looked at photos and I got it no problem It was probably the coolest hotel room I d ever been in The location was great really close to a metro stop and there was free coffee and tea and little croissants in the lobby
