130667,San Domenico House, It would have been good to have coffee tea making facilities in the room Some of the decor was done a bit cheaply for such an expensive room eg the laminate floor Also it would have been nice if the bath was fully functioning , The staff were really friendly and helpful It felt like a luxurious place to stay really nice decor Good products in the bathroom It was super clean 
130668,San Domenico House,No Negative, The upper room with balcony was lovely and nice that the hotel could meet my request to have this room when booking I look forward to our third stay at the hotel when we visit Chelsea again
130669,San Domenico House,No Negative, People on the staff were absolutely delightful They made sure you had all you needed and on time Thoughtful consideration and answers to any questions you had Even though you only had breakfast in dining area the room service provided excellent and fresh food for other meals which were welcome after a long day out 
130670,San Domenico House, Fan in bathroom didn t work and no mirror in the room at all so difficult to do hair make up when bathroom in use Shower a bit awkward to use and get and out of , Decor was good rood terrace for breakfast good too Bed confortable and staff attentive 
130671,San Domenico House, Not 5 Shower was poor There were no tea making facilities in our room Small details missed like no cotton wool in the bathroom Breakfast not really worth the charge , Lovely location
130672,San Domenico House, No butter appeared with breakfast on both mornings , Quietly situated hotel no road noise and given only small amount of rooms no noise from other guests Air Conditioning superb very very cold just perfect for the 28 degrees it was during our stay 
130673,San Domenico House, The hotel turns off the heated towel racks in the summer If this could be changed it would be nice We use them year round Also no mirror in room 106 makes using the hair dryer VERY difficult , We have stayed here before and love it 
130674,San Domenico House, No Bar or restaurant but plenty in the vicinity, The room was excellent and a small balcony overlooking the area up to the river was an added bonus The staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive 
130675,San Domenico House, Couldn t get Tv to work properly Was probably me and as it was late didn t ask for help , Really friendly place great quirky room perfect location for Sloane Square area functions 
130676,San Domenico House,No Negative, I usually stay at The DORCHESTER however I will only be staying at Domenico with my partner every year now Usually in July Aug and Dec Jan Room 204 a Time domenico house is our new London home The service was exceptional the staff were flawless Thank you all 
130677,San Domenico House, The hotel needs minor adjustments to be made by a handyman or a light renovation It is a pity that lunch and dinner are not served in the breakfast room even a small menu , Very nicely decorated hotel Kind and responsive staff Good room service that includes lunch and dinner 
130678,San Domenico House, for us there is nothing to improve Everything is perfect, Absolute perfection from start to finish The concierge s went over and above extremely helpful and pleasant Location superb 
130679,San Domenico House,No Negative, people very friendly very good service a comfortable room very good location from where to get around London easily We will certainly choose this hotel again when staying in London next time 
130680,San Domenico House, Staff Flexibility for example we had in the booking continental breakfast and asked for English and they made us pay the full price of it instead of the difference Water pressure in bathroom Bathroom size and especially bathtub size Luck of acoustic insulation between rooms, Amazing private balcony with views Delicious breakfast Nice traditional building Very cosy and comfortable
130681,San Domenico House, Nothing , The bed was one of the most comfortable I ve ever slept in incredible service that was always stellar and with a smile the room was beautiful unique and attention to detail impeccable 
130682,San Domenico House,No Negative, This hotel is fantastic It is in a quiet Chelsea neighborhood and a short walk from the Sloane Square tube station Our room was split level so we weren t tripping over our luggage and it seemed very spacious The best part was the wonderful staff They really make it a homey place and were always asking if there was anything we needed We had the continental breakfast included in the rate which was a lovely basket of croissants and rolls with coffee and juice 
130683,San Domenico House, The hotel were not clear about the fact they were going to take a preauthorisation from my debit card for the total amount of our stay plus an additional 84 72 hours before we were due to arrive On checking out I attempted to explain to the female receptionist that I understood why hotels take a preauthorisation however I would ve appreciated a phone call before I arrived where I could have confirmed my booking should they needed to check and given them a credit card from which to take the preauthorisation as opposed to my debit card which is for my current account I couldn t finish what I was trying to say as the receptionist persisted to talk over me rolling her eyes and told me a debit and credit card were the same thing I explained that they weren t and that s why people have credit cards and that in the documentation I received when making the booking it said the hotel MAY take a preauthorisation from a credit card and that no payment is made until checking out I pointed out how I didn t book with a credit card and therefore by them taking a preauthorisation from my debit card without notifying me meant they effectively blocked a considerable amount of money in my account potentially impacting standing orders and direct debits I have in place She persisted to argue with me that a credit and debit card are the same as well as patronise me telling me that I should ensure I have the necessary funds available to cover my stay in a hotel when I make a booking I said I didn t need help to manage my finances that I wasn t paying for the whole group to stay we were going to pay seperately on check out She continued to shake her head when I spoke sighed and looked away when I tried to speak to her I have never encountered such rudeness before when staying at a hotel , Not quite the type of continental breakfast we are used to We expected more than a bakery basket such as cereal fruit cold meats and cheese which is the norm in most hotels offering a continental breakfast 
130684,San Domenico House, Meals and snacks are all provided by room service so it s a little different from the usual hotel with a dining room and bar Also there is only one key per room and no front door key So access is always through staff a little clumsy Because the front door is always locked , Location is great steps from Sloane square and Kings Road The rooms are beautiful Staff are very attentive The decor was marvelous 
130685,San Domenico House,No Negative, Room 401 meant to be higher category and paid for the upgrade was cluttered TV hidden inside old wardrobe too much furniture barely space to move very hot room with the hot weather in London during the stay good staff 
130686,San Domenico House,No Negative, Disappointed sadly Room 402 meant to be a super deluxe room was hot with cluttered furniture tv inside a wardrobe barely room to move and with an ordinary bathroom Staff are lovely and location great but avoid that room It s messy cluttered and very uncomfortable 
130687,San Domenico House, Only one very minor thing was that the guests staying above us got up very early and the floor boards squeaked , The staff were excellent The decor of the whole hotel was wonderful and very italian Fabulous roof terrace and view Great ambience Will definitely be staying here again 
130688,San Domenico House, The ONLY things I didn t like were that the breakfasts were too expensive and one staff member insisted on venting his political views , The hotel and my room were just beautiful and most of the staff went out of their way to make sure everything went well on my trip 
130689,San Domenico House, Breakfast was worst we have ever had basket of croissants not good ones fruit juice tea or coffee 14 each fruit yoghurt cereal all extra at around 3 50 each , Room and location were very good
130690,San Domenico House, The coffee and drinks are quite expensive but it is the West End , Quirky discreet quiet and comfortable Fantastic staff very friendly and helpful Large extremely comfortable bed upgraded to Rm 303 which was huge 
130691,San Domenico House, Small slip ups in service were quickly corrected , The room and the location were both outstanding The room was decorated with lovely furniture and furnishings and the location is perfect being between Chelsea and Knightsbrdge as well as a 2 minute walk to Sloane Square 
130692,San Domenico House, Plastic jacuzzi massage jet shower box Nothing beats a built in shower space with proper rain shower head However this doesn t feature in all rooms where bathrooms are consistent with the rest of the room concept ,No Positive
130693,San Domenico House, The bed was very hard just like sleeping on the floor My back suffered dreadfully and I didn t sleep well There is no bar which is a shame , I have stayed before and this is a real gem of a place Great position and charming staff 
130694,San Domenico House, There wasn t a regular turn down service where water was supplied etc Found it difficult to order drinks in the lounge the staff seemed not to know what was available and where it was but when we did get our drinks it was a delight to enjoy by the fire , Loved the space A real home from home in an exclusive townhouse Some of the staff were incredible going above and beyond the norm very welcoming Presentation and style of room service was delightful with great attention to detail Gorgeous big living room area with fires and warmth 
130695,San Domenico House, No tea coffee making facilities in room The Heat Very difficult to work out the controls as there were no instructions Overhead shower which drenched the floor but not me Everywhere a bit tired and in need of re decoration, The quirky stylish old world atmosphere The friendly staff The comfortable bed The coffee at breakfast
130696,San Domenico House, I stayed in room 106 and it was a bit cold because of the old windows and AC system I complained and was upgraded to a beautiful room higher up 202 I believe , Full of charm Staff is friendly and helpful 
130697,San Domenico House, I like a hot drink at night and I love my morning coffee the bedrooms do not supply drink facilities, The hotel was very opulent and the rooms just lovely
130698,San Domenico House, Staff was not up to the standard of the reviews I had seen on various websites The person manning the front desk upon our arrival at night was borderline rude if not patronizing , Excellent location within minutes of King s road local shops and restaurants A very cute and picturesque boutique hotel in the heart of Chelsea 
130699,San Domenico House, The wash basin in the bathroom didn t have any cold water No newspapers were available on either Friday or Saturday , Attentive staff with a good attitude 
130700,San Domenico House,No Negative, Beautiful hotel with a lovely rooftop terrace over looking London right on top of the Kings Road The hotel is beautiful with a wonderful collection of furnishings it s all in the detail 
130701,San Domenico House, breakfast could be a little bit more high class but hotel and the room is 5 star, very nice hotel beautifull decoration and furniture marvelous room
130702,San Domenico House, Furniture in the room was broken curtains and closet The toiletries did not include a tooth paste nor a tooth brush, The location and the character of the hotel
130703,San Domenico House, As was said in all the comments I ve read bathroom needed update although everything was very clean and in working order We were staying in room 201 on the 2nd floor I don t know what it was but there were constant walking and talking upstairs like it was a stuff room above or maybe just noisy occupants , Location superb Stayed for two days with my husband and a 5 year old Room service was exellent worth every penny Room was clean and spacious 
130704,San Domenico House, Hospitality is below average There is just one staff on the front desk and is most of the time busy The greetings is not their habit When called the reception you hear them mentioning Reception Which was annying and most of the time I could not complete what I wanted and they hang up the phone You will have a feeling that you are on your own Very disturbing , The drinking water was amazing Pure Italian drinking mater The Molton Brown Ammenities were amazing The place give you a feeling of being isolated The rooms are contested and so is the bathroom The shower is not ideal and while taking shower the space is way conjested If you are a couple It might have an advantage because the bed looks like one of those wedding beds The view from window is average as you are having only residential buildings around The door keys are typical keys and you have to drop the key before you leave the accommodation It s some security standard the hotel has The tv screen in room is normal computer screen with two remotes to be used And is way smaller The Internet is good 
130705,San Domenico House, One of the male receptionists came over as being slightly arrogant And the bathroom was disappointing the bath desperately needs to be replaced the paint job they did on the inside surface of the bath was all worn and peeling having a shower also meant drenching the rest of the bathroom , The location and the decor of the hotel and the waiting staff were very pleasant and polite
130706,San Domenico House, Couple of small items its lack of a bar area to relax and have a drink within the hotel and that the room did not have a mirror in in which was difficult for my other half doing her hair before going out , Fantastically decorated hotel with excellent staff very good value for money would recommend it 
130707,San Domenico House, Bathroom too small and in need of urgent repairs Bath tub s enamel paint had peeled right where you had to stand and that had not happened the day or the week before The staff apologised for it and mentioned a delay in planned bathrooms refurbishment but that was it Staff was polite but aloof , Location and decor Room was
130708,San Domenico House, Our room was on the top floor and needed to use stairs Not accessible for elderly or disabled persons , Great location Unique and elegant decor of our guest room the lounge and the dining room Warm hospitality of very attentive staff 
130709,San Domenico House, The price was high but for a special occasion it was worth it , Beautiful room just right for a special birthday treat Attentive staff and convenient for shops and restaurants in Chelsea 
130710,San Domenico House, No complaints at all , This hotel is an exquisite gem like having your own personal home away from home If privacy location and top notch service are important to you this is the best choice in London The well trained staff do their best to create a discrete atmosphere of efficient and refreshingly low key professional service
