226938,Best Western Palm Hotel, MY VIEW TO THE ROOF WITH THE AC CONDENSING UNIT I AM AN AC ENGINEER BETTER FIT A NICE BIG MONITOR AND PROJECT A GREAT VIEW OF LONDON FROM ANY OTHER TOWER EASY TO DO LOL, THE LOCATION AND THE FREE PARKING IF YOU HAVE MANY LUGGAGES ASK FOR A ROOM WITH EASY ACCESS AS SOME CORRIDORS HAVE STEPS UP AND THEN DOWN OVERALL GREAT HOTEL 
226939,Best Western Palm Hotel, The receptionists were rude Our first room had a broken AC so they moved us to a second one and that AC was also broken When we told them they said they turned it on and it was working It clearly was NOT working We had to sleep w the windows open and there were no screens and a on the 1st floor so not exactly safe for two foreign girls , The bartender and hotel restaurant workers were very kind and had good food selections since there s no where else really to eat around the property
226940,Best Western Palm Hotel, It holds party at weekends the wall is so bad to isolate the room from the noise So it is like party just right beside you It is very noisy It is useless to complain because all staffs can do is to say sorry Party stops at 12 o clock at night ,No Positive
226941,Best Western Palm Hotel, Personally I don t really have any complaints Anyone booking should be aware that the free parking is first come first served They look to have about 20 maybe 25 spaces on site I managed to park but I have no idea where else you would park round there if they were full up There were parking wardens everywhere around there Its about 25 minutes walk to Brent Cross tube station and around 15 minutes to the nearest shops restaurants Not an issue for me but it might be for some people , This hotel looks to have been refurbished recently and was quite pleasant The room was clean and fairly modern the room and the bathroom were very clean The shower was decent enough I had a decent nights sleep even with the busy road right outside The wifi at this hotel was excellent as was the wired internet available in the rooms The air conditioning was also very good and was a life saver given how hot it was during my stay 
226942,Best Western Palm Hotel, As there were lots of people having breakfast there was no enough plates and cutleries avail Had to wait for the staff which they provided as soon as they could It was a bit noisy you could hear the traffic outside and people banging doors and running on the corridor Probably need to consider a softer pillows , Staff were friendly and breakfast was good
226943,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, Great breakfast amazing room very clean lots of space comfortable beds electric kettle very pleasant and helpful staff Bus stop 113 about 1 minute from the hotel If we are back in London we want to be accommodated again in this great hotel 
226944,Best Western Palm Hotel, Food let us down We had a meal at the hotel which had to be returned as it had a burnt taste and was inedible Not many restaurants in the area itself Breakfast was ok but I just ordered toast I would stay again just not dine at the hotel , Nice enough hotel room was a good size with triple beds Very good value Staff friendly 
226945,Best Western Palm Hotel, Staff was not friendly when we checked in and hard to move the luggages to the room as some rooms have no lift access , Space of the family triple room is large compare to other hotels in London Bed was comfortable and bathroom was clean 
226946,Best Western Palm Hotel, As a Genius member I asked if I could benefit from late check out The answer was a simple No so basically although there is a Genius sign on their page on booking com they don t provide anything extra to Genius members ,No Positive
226947,Best Western Palm Hotel, Only gripe I have is that the last time I visited I booked the executive room and the shower would not stay up and the shower head kept slipping down Made it a little difficult to shower Other than that the hotel is perfect for what I need , Stay here whenever I travel to London for work Tube a 10 minute walk away so perfect location Rooms are spacious and food is great Had room service a few times and always brought up quickly 
226948,Best Western Palm Hotel, Breakfast was cold had to ask for toast as nobidy came to our table by the time it came we had ate our food Bar was exspensive and staff advised us to order out and we could eat it in the bar Bar area was over run by screaming kids from the private function I would not say this was 4 star Dirty cups and glasses in the room and not much of a view see photo s , Room was modern and large same about the view thou 
226949,Best Western Palm Hotel, There is a car park in theory but it is not reserved for residents and so had to use on street parking I am a single woman traveller and was shocked to be even offered a ground floor room That is not safe I had to insist on a different room it was a very hot night and the room faces onto a main road so not an option to leave windows open as its too noisy The air conditioning was inadequate and took along time to just get the edge off the intolerable stuffiness The mattress was cheap and lumpy pillows hard The tapsystem in the bathroom was so stiff I had to call for help to be able to run a cooling bath There was a large function on but I think that a competent hotel should be able to cope with extra travellers as well as a party , Not much except a tolerably convenient location
226950,Best Western Palm Hotel, Position of the hotel very noisy indeed due to the main road Little sleep obtained Initially staff put us in a standard room instead of superior room This was rectified once we highlighted the problem Food in the restaurant was appalling my daughter and I both left all of our main meals wet carpets in the bedroom not enough tea milk On the second day there were several areas of dried vomit just outside the hotel door this was offensive and should have been washed away , Nothing really
226951,Best Western Palm Hotel, As above, Everything was great I I had to be at all picky it would be the breakfast staff struggled to keep the food out and kept running out of different items so a queue kept building up waiting for various items but when it was out the food was really nice 
226952,Best Western Palm Hotel, The mattress was awful very lumpy uncomfortable Bedroom window was adjacent to a busy main road although it was double glazed you could still hear the traffic all night , Staff were excellent very polite accomadating The room was very clean tidy and perfect for our needs 
226953,Best Western Palm Hotel, We stayed here while visiting to see Adele at Wembley Bar was the smallest bar I ve ever seen 15 80 for 2 archers and lemonades with flat lemonade out of a bottle that looked like it had been there for some time Paid for an executive room this was far from it Half empty bottle of water in wardrobe bathroom smelt of sweat shower looked filthy so was not used Don t even start me on the paper thin bed Would definitely not stay here again Reported issues to receptionist and her reply was oh I ll advise housekeeping Disgusting price for what it is ,No Positive
226954,Best Western Palm Hotel, The room smelt The room was tired especially the carpet The reception area looks lovely but on entering the actual bedroom it wasn t to the same standard The selection and quality of tea coffee could be better I only drink Earl Grey tea and there wasn t any The door to the en suite seemed to be hang the wrong way round so it was a real pain having to shuffle back and forth as there was very little room to move about , I was able to open the window wide to let fresh air in and cool the room down l don t like using air conditioning as it is usually very noisy 
226955,Best Western Palm Hotel, We had been traveling all day and required lunch only to be told there was only panini available So a tuna panini arrived with cheese and onion crisps It was poor In addition the breakfast was barely warm only , The room was clean as was the bathroom The Reception staff were helpful and booked taxi services for us which were prompt 
226956,Best Western Palm Hotel, Breakfast was very poor quality it was all cold and sausage wasn t cooked probably, Staff very friendly rooms clean and comfortable only 15 minutes walk from a underground station with good links to central london
226957,Best Western Palm Hotel, We thought the restaurant at breakfast time was very poor we were a family of four but couldn t sit together We waited 20mins or more for cutlery and cups and saucers We have stayed in best western many times and sadly this was not the best We feel restaurant staff need looking at tables etc were not cleared and reset,No Positive
226958,Best Western Palm Hotel, Private parking was advertised when I got there the gate was across the car park luckily I found a space on the road just got soaking wet in the process as it was torrential rain I arrived at 9 30pm due to traffic and thought I would be able to grab a quick something to eat the food stopped at half 9 and was advised there was a room service menu in the room get to the room no menu had to call reception to see what I could have she didn t even know she had to walk over to the bar area and ask them I ended up with an expensive stale sandwich cut into little triangles the bread had been kept in the fridge and tasted awful there was no bottles of water in the room and she didn t ask if I wanted anything to drink couldn t be bothered calling again so used tap water I had originally paid for breakfast but just wanted to leave in the morning so didn t bother My room was next to big air vents on the roof this was very noisy and the air con was even louder The remote I had to press 5 and 6 times to change the channel there is a sky remote but it doesn t work I stay in the centre of London most of the time for the same price and a much nicer hotel but this time needed to be close to Camden I would not stay here again , After a long drive it was pretty close of the motorway
226959,Best Western Palm Hotel, Room was next to six lane road very noisy It was hell Just awful Breakfast and evening meal below average Mattress terrible Girl told us no other room available at 2 am still awake could not sleep Just not for us Poor service We did get moved eventually and the second room was nice but by then it was too late Experience ruined , Some staff nice 
226960,Best Western Palm Hotel, Our three breakfasts could have been a lot better Only tried them on the first day out of our three day stop as it wasn t good You would expect better for 12 50 each The buffet breakfast was cold namely the scrambled eggs the bacon the mushrooms and the tomatoes the only thing hot were the sausages If you order toast you receive it about 15 minutes after you order it by that time you have finished your breakfast The 24 hour bar was cancelled due to a member of staff not turning up Only operated on the Friday night Otherwise good , rooms were very good clean and comfortable
226961,Best Western Palm Hotel, No issues during my stay, The hotel was in excellent condition very clean My room was again in very good condition lovely en suite shower The staff were very good and always friendly 3 day stay In good location for getting to centre take the bus in by the way Overall I can highly recommend this hotel 
226962,Best Western Palm Hotel, Perhaps the carpet in some corridors could be cleaned or replaced and the road noise was a bit of a pain at times but not unbearable , Friendly staff and room regularly cleaned and air conditioning was a bonus Nice clean towels daily 
226963,Best Western Palm Hotel, The bed was very worn and not comfortable at all the staff were over stretched at breakfast and a lack off tables meant quite a wait, The sausages at breakfast were very nice
226964,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, Modern clean and welcoming hotel Location good and parking available We travelled by train and it was a 25 minute walk in residential roads and then along the side of a busy A road Road noise was not a problem as our room was at the back of the hotel All windows opened which was fantastic in the heat 
226965,Best Western Palm Hotel, bed was not very confortable and small room but not too bad, stagf were very nice would stay there again as it has lots of positive things going for it clean modern and free parking
226966,Best Western Palm Hotel, food wasn t that brilliant I mean to me maybe it s good to Uk standards , upgraded room airco in the room with temperature above 30 more than welcome
226967,Best Western Palm Hotel, The air conditioner from the first room we stayed at wasn t working at all and had to bear with it till the next day during the really hot weather , Pleasant and helpful staff 
226968,Best Western Palm Hotel, The mattress was very uncomfortable It was like sleeping on springs and there was no cushioning I woke up really tired and sore , The room was clean and the air conditioning was very powerful I loved it 
226969,Best Western Palm Hotel, Not much We couldn t hear the busy road and although our room was overlooking the kitchen yard we weren t there for the views , It was clean comfortable and air conditioned The staff was friendly and helpful 
226970,Best Western Palm Hotel, The 24 hour was not open at 1am and we were told we couldn t have a drink as the 24hr bar was closed I queried it being called a 24hr bar and the receptionist said it is a 24hr bar but closes when there are events on Every night in London then Ridiculous, Breakfast was good
226971,Best Western Palm Hotel, Definitely expected more from a hotel rated as a 4 star I think it is 3 stars The restaurant is not great there is nothing nearby the location and the free Wifi was spotty , There is a small fridge in the room and the bar is open 24 hours Once I got moved to a quieter room it was really nice 
226972,Best Western Palm Hotel, A little more parking space is needed , Very comfortable beds plenty of hot drink ingredients fantastic breakfast helpful staff The restaurant meal was excellent as was the wedding reception food Loved the decorative lamps by reception The rooms are well soundproofed from the very busy road 
226973,Best Western Palm Hotel, Although breakfast was really nice it could have been a little warmer , Staff were lovely and helpful I had emailed the evening before out arrival to see if we could check in earlier Although I didn t get a reply until after wr had checked in the hotel were more than happy to accommodate our early arrival Also upon check out we asked if we could leave our car for a while which again was not too much trouble Thank you for a lovely stay
226974,Best Western Palm Hotel, They didn t have info about that we had breakfast included and we had to wait each morning for somebody to check it Bar prices were quite high but you can expect it in London , No problem with changing room as I was travelling with my mum abd sister so we wanted single beds in a room Staff were lovley and happy to help Breakfast was good pleanty of good quality food even that there was a wedding one night and our room was next to a ball room it wasn t as bad as I thought it could be didn t heard anything in a room Location maybe not central but communication was great bus stop next to hotel and about 15 min to tube station by bus 
226975,Best Western Palm Hotel, The breakfast was serving until 10 a m We arrived t 9 15 a m and although we paid the full price for the breakfast there was limited choice and quantity , The bed was comfortable the room was pleasant The water in the shower nice and hot 
226976,Best Western Palm Hotel, The breakfast was optional at an additional 10 00 per head The breakfast was extremely dissapointing with only 1 member of staff topping up on food and beverage The bread rolls were ROCK hard and not edible I had to request on more than 1 occasion for coffee to be topped up Very limited vegetarian options for a hot breakfast I even heard 2 other tables complaining about how dissapointing the breakfast was We ended up purchasing breakfast elsewhere after checkout Parking is on a first come first serve basis but the hotel should inform people that street parking is for residents only between 1pm 8pm There were a fair few cars with parking tickets that may have been guests from the hotel The front of the hotel caters for up to 10 cars if a huge van doesn t decide to take up more than 1 allocated space The back car park can hold up to 10 cars but is usually occupied by vans , The bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed using the powerful shower Comfortable night s sleep 
226977,Best Western Palm Hotel, Breakfast was good but a bit limited Tea was made fresh initially but then they wanted me to take tea from a flask When I persisted they made some fresh for me , Good sized room quiet staff helpful 
226978,Best Western Palm Hotel, I left my coat behind Eventually gig if back but took 3 weeks and loads of telephone calls, Clean and comfortable room although a little cramped when sofa bed erected
226979,Best Western Palm Hotel, Some rooms at the front of the hotel can be a bit noisy and parking can be tricky if you arrive late, Great location for visiting London for work It s comfortable clean and the staff are very good Some of the rooms are worthy of a 4 hotel
226980,Best Western Palm Hotel, Towards the end of the breakfast time the hot food was not up to standard and some tables had not cleared of breakfast plates etc I had to scavenge a place setting for myself and I wasn t the last one in , Very helpful and very pleasant staff 
226981,Best Western Palm Hotel, Yo use the air condition you have to contact the reception The noisy from the road is annoying due to the position of the hotel Moquette in the room Bed mattress is uncomfortable Mirror in the bathroom has a led light that doesn t illuminate the face Light in general not sufficient Service in the morning at breakfast very slowly and if you go there at 6 30 am when is open the different items are not yet prepared fruit salad scramble eggs bread croissants One time I didn t find the set of towels and the beds were not prepared You cannot switch off on the main light from the bed, Good restaurant with a good service Nice shower

226984,Best Western Palm Hotel, Felt a little let down by parking facilities if you can not get in to the car park there are maybe 60 parking spaces for 100 rooms there is NO where to park even to check in no on street parking and no public car park near by As a single female traveler I find this undesirable so won t be back, Nice enough staff helpful Food was ok Clean room Good wifi
226985,Best Western Palm Hotel, Parking is hard if you arrive after all the workmen have knocked off I am registered disabled and have arrived to find white vans completely blocking the front of the hotel and even parked in the spaced coned off which I requested This is the only complaint , I like this hotel for it friendly staff and close proximity to transport links into central London 
226986,Best Western Palm Hotel, Building not well insulated for sound could hear next door s occupants arguing doors slamming and heavy walkers in the corridor outside Location isn t on the tourist trail or near shops but we have stayed on 5 separate occasions it suits us , Good value clean and modern hotel Bar with food was a bonus 
226987,Best Western Palm Hotel, We had no unpleasant surprises , The Palm Hotel is on the main road but we had a quieter room at the back which was good We could use our room from 12 00pm as they had one free nothing was too much trouble The bathroom was newly renovated with our favourite type of shower plenty of towels toiletries bathmat and slipmat if you needed Although the room was double glazed the window would open wide Walking distance Hampstead Heath and transport links to North and Central London Good selection on menu good price pleasant service well cooked well presented meal Excellent choice at breakfast 
226988,Best Western Palm Hotel, the parking was horrendous The reception although they had sent through a confirmation to my mum saying the hotel was happy to charge the card that Booking com had taken on booking Were insisting that I send through copy of the card etc , It was purchased as a birthday present for me and my other half as a treat The hotel was lovely 
226989,Best Western Palm Hotel, The roulette wheel parking if nothing is available out the back or in front , The Staff are very pleasant The room was very clean and the food was tasty I can recommend the cheesecake yum

226991,Best Western Palm Hotel, The bed bad mattress with a topper The food avoid the restaurant The pictures on the website doesn t match real life Food pre made and then microwaved my plate was hot food was cold in the middle , The location close to Swiss Cottage was just what I wanted I also liked the decor
226992,Best Western Palm Hotel, Ok The view wasn t great and there wasn t any restaurants or shops nearby but thats not why we choose this hotel on a regular basis It s great to park here and easy to travel into London by bus and tube , The helpful friendly staff at reception The Parking facility and closeness of London transport The rooms are lovely and great value for money 
226993,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, I must say that we were well impressed by the reception and presentation of the bedroom I asked for the best room available because was a birthday surprise to my girlfriend and we had a lovely birds in heart shape origami on top of our bed with roses and fresh fruit waiting for us I can t say thank you enough for this you made our stay sooooo special 5

226995,Best Western Palm Hotel, I didn t like the number of days it takes for the guest linens or beddings to be changed especially when have a family , The staff were friendly and helpful the hotel was standered but could be improved in terms of changing beddings regularly for guest Overall satisfied Good hotel 
226996,Best Western Palm Hotel, There was nothing that I didn t like , I liked everything the staff the room the view I didn t try the breakfast or restaurant but next time I will 
226997,Best Western Palm Hotel, I stay away 3 nights a week in different locations and this hotel wins the title for worst stay Matresses are destroyed housekeeping have tried by putting folded duvets under bottom sheet Very long wait to check in and for food chicken came out raw so had alternative Had to take key to bathroom as in family room where bedroom door locks behind you colleague locked out of his at 4am I had to move rooms at 11pm due to fault in electric cupboard Was moved to freezing room Asked to speak to manager they d called in sick no one available asked what they d do in emergency didn t know Was assured I would be called at 9am still waiting at 6pm , Access to Cricklewood

227001,Best Western Palm Hotel, Waited 2hrs for food in the evening ordered for 6 people all arrived at different times when it eventually arrived , Location for event at Wembley Family room 
227002,Best Western Palm Hotel, staff not well informed about london just 1 plug adapter in room poor room view noisy at night no london map much walking to reach to metro, cleanliness coffee tea in room bath room hot water decoration
227003,Best Western Palm Hotel, Lack of parking Other clientele mainly groups of builders , Great hotel staff all round good restaurant food prompt room service helpful reception staff
227004,Best Western Palm Hotel, The mattress in my room was quite lumpy My room was at the front of the hotel so there was some traffic noise it didn t affect me but if you re not used to hearing noise or are a light sleeper you may be better asking for a room that isn t at the front, The staff were extremely friendly a credit to the hotel Whilst parking on site is very limited the side street either side has parking you have to pay between 1pm 8pm weird times but that s the notice You have to either use your mobile to phone up and use their automated system or download an app to make payment there is no machine at which you can pay I arrived at 7pm so had to pay for an hour which cost 1 10
227005,Best Western Palm Hotel, The rooms were to hot and could not get air con working Breakfast was buffet and both mornings the food had been sat on the side for a while and was dry the scrambled eggs were solid and had to be sliced to be eaten Bacon so dry it was inedible, The staff were so helpful and the bed comfort Although next to very busy road it was quite in the room

227008,Best Western Palm Hotel, Television didn t work properly Digitial TV was fuzzy and the Sky box would not work at all Also the location of the property on a main road meant rooms on the ground floor had a lot of road noise our room was situated here , Very comfy bed nice room polite staff free secure car parking good travel links to London
227009,Best Western Palm Hotel, Limited parking 2hr max surrounding the hotel On arrival at 3pm parking in front of the hotel and to the rear was full of builders transit vans i complained and the receptionist asked a member of staff to move their car As a lone female traveller I will not be staying here again due to the type of male clientele it made the hotel feel like a cheap B B or Hostel such a shame as everything else was splendid, All of the staff are extremely helpful and welcoming an error with my booking was promptly fixed I was given a lower floor near the entrance The restaurant was a triumph waiters attentive and the food excellent especially the Hake overall for the price the hotel is faultless BUT for its current permanent builder clientele and their leave in their vans trucks noisily at 6am returning to fill up the car park before 3pm and prop up the bar en mass from 6pm Shame
227010,Best Western Palm Hotel, They do not look into request in booking tried to contact them via booking mail yet no answer But when we arrived we had no problem and they even gave us early accommodation what I have requested few weeks earlier but they didn t notice Yet this was offered without me making a problem for ignoring my request they offered it without knowing I wanted it so this turns out to be positive at the end , Location is good Has A Bus stop just in front of the Hotel Rooms are perfect for the price Staff is professional and helpful 
227011,Best Western Palm Hotel, The fact that the springs in the mattress were very prominent Also the fact that the hotel has a policy apparently although we weren t pre warned by the staff nor was this on the website or booking com site to play loud disco music below our rooom till gone midnight When one goes to sleep in a hotel they expect to be able to sleep , The price the reception area 
227012,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, The room was clean and there was parking which was good It was a good hotel for the occasion and I was celebrating my birthday the parking was free and there was wifi which is a great thing to

227018,Best Western Palm Hotel, The room at the front of hotel on street level was noisy overnight with many lanes of traffic zooming past even though double glazed windows were closed Thankfully we can sleep anywhere but it may bother some people There was no hot water in the bathroom sink taps by 10pm but maybe this was a one off, Staff were great and really helpful Shower was wonderful Good location just a 10 minute walk to Golders Green station or taxi for 6 Mattress was fab 
227019,Best Western Palm Hotel, Not quite enough milk and Earl grey tea bags in the room however reception did bring some up when we asked which was lovely of them , We love how close the hotel is the Alexandra Palace and north London night spots

227023,Best Western Palm Hotel, A lot of things cleanliness was not great service at reception wasn t great Constant noise though the whole night even when changing rooms and the bed was terrible Parking was not great, they had sky
227024,Best Western Palm Hotel, The snacks was very expensive 14 for a few grapes biscuits cheese cheesecake U could go buy a whole packets worth for half the price if there were local shops Room itself was quite small, Everything was very clean and tidy staff very polite
227025,Best Western Palm Hotel, The mattress was too soft for us , Overall service at the reception was brilliant Very patient in setting us up with wifi on our iPads and connection to the television

227030,Best Western Palm Hotel, Great day staffs but the ones in the evening were really rude Heating on the first floor wasn t working or they switched off Arrived in the room and it was a twin bed Asked them to make it a double bed they were rude and when they came to the room to do it they put the two singles duvets inside the a double cover duvet It can imagine how good it was , Good price 63 a night I wouldn t pay more for that 
227031,Best Western Palm Hotel, Excellent food at breakfast but not well managed , Been to the hotel several times before Good value for money and well connected by public transport Well furnished although maybe a little minimalistic Friendly small smart bar area 
227032,Best Western Palm Hotel, The hotel is situated next to a busy road If you do want to open the window expect a lot of traffic noise , The room was big very clean with a large comfortable bed The bathroom had a good size bath and powerful shower There was sky tv for entertainment and also a fridge to keep my drinks chilled
227033,Best Western Palm Hotel, Fire alarm was going off when we got there First room we went to smelt of smoke and the window didn t lose properly so we had all the noise from the road outside and a really annoying draft We spoke to reception who happily moved us rooms Then the fire alarm went off again the first night we were there for almost 45 mins This was at 10pm After this we had no lights in our room and had to wait until we had left the room the next day before they were sorted Bed was hard and not very comfy A very forced apology was given by the reception but no offer of any compensation was ever made Almost as if they really didn t care This was a few nights away for my birthday which was completely ruined by the experience at this hotel , Was close to a bus stop which meant for easy access to the city centre 
227034,Best Western Palm Hotel, The landings smelt a little like nursing homes but once in the room it was spot on The lift felt a little juddery slow but I don t like lifts so am not the best person to pass judgement It s a pity you don t appear to be able to access the hotel from the rear car park which would make life a little easier not to mention safer for ladies who may be travelling alone because having to walk around from the side road to the front of the hotel whilst not far could be a little concerning late at night My main gripe has to be saved for the cost of the breakfast because 12 95 for a buffet breakfast I can t help thinking this to be a little outrageous For that sort of money I expect a freshly cooked breakfast especially when you can literally go around the corner and find a cafe which charges less than 5 00 for a cooked breakfast albeit not eat as much as you like but whilst I m no cheapskate when you have three breakfasts to pay for 12 95 each soon adds up to be ridiculous even if breakfast is the most important meal of the day Three breakfasts with a pint of fresh orange juice coffees for less than 18 00 as opposed to paying 38 85 is a no brainer I honestly believe if the hotel were to charge between 7 95 and 9 95 they d see more footfall through their restaurant for breakfast and surely when you re serving from a buffet the more you can get in the better , The parking at the hotel is excellent with spaces lined up on the front of the hotel and more secure spaces around the back behind an electric gate The hotel was nice and the reception staff and restaurant staff extremely polite and helpful The rooms are really modern and with nicely presented and well equipped modern bathrooms A great hotel for the money 
227035,Best Western Palm Hotel, Absolutely nothing we were so well taken care of I don t normally leave reviews but if something is exceptional you just have to say , We absolutely adored everything I travelled with my assistant we had to film in TBN television Studios the next day and even though there was a wedding in the building you really couldn t tell they put us in a gorgeous room there was no traffic to disturb us we had such a quiet and peaceful night The staff was so warm welcoming and receptive and there were uniformed gentlemen there to carry our bags and suitcases We could want for nothing all our needs were taken care of The lobby and room was beautiful I couldn t recommend it enough and I will definitely stay there again 
227036,Best Western Palm Hotel, Dirty sheets broken pillow noisy airconditioning which you have to keep it running all night to keep warm temperature Quite high prices for such a remote location from the city , Nice personnel
227037,Best Western Palm Hotel, The bar didn t seem to be staffed other than when someone from reception called for staff Reception would obviously only do that if they weren t busy checking customers in The rooms aren t well sound insulated from the traffic noise and the water services are very noisy , The bathroom was very nice and modern The marble effect finish really made it look nice 
227038,Best Western Palm Hotel, Breakfast is a little pricey for what you are getting I mostly chose continental and most days there were only apples available as fruit the two cold meat options were always dry which made me think they weren t fresh and the cheese were in awkward packages instead of slices Wish there was a bigger selection for a cheaper price Apart from this all was good , Very clean and very nice staff They have a can do attitude which I really like I ve stayed here twice already and will be doing so more often 
227039,Best Western Palm Hotel, Not a complaint just letting you know There was a bit of limescale in the bathroom around the bathroom sink tap Also I knocked the drain cover with my foot whilst in the shower and it looked like it could do with a bit of bleach , Room was really nice and modern Staff were really friendly I am a light sleeper and asked to be in a room away from the main road which they did and I had no problems sleeping Lovely shower Fridge in room was very useful as well Nearest tube station was Golders Green You probably could walk it but we used Ubers which only cost about 5 Didn t have breakfast or anything there but the overall feel of the hotel was nice 
227040,Best Western Palm Hotel, Very noisy room 206 unable to open window due to air conditioning units on roof unfortunately not able to have air con due to health reasons, Clean room comfy bed
227041,Best Western Palm Hotel, Heating unit was broken which made it extremely loud and made sleeping very difficult Even if it was working properly it still wasn t placed correctly in order to heat up the bathroom which had no radiator in it , Very clean Short taxi ride to underground station 6 Carpark
227042,Best Western Palm Hotel, There was a bit of a funny smell in the corridors on the 2nd floor an smell of blocked drains that had seeped into the bedroon sohad to open the window and turn the heating up once the room was aired it was ok untill you opened the door to the corridor where the smell was very strong Also as I am disabled I found it most anoying to find loads of White vans parked along the front so not sure if there was disabled parking we couldn t find it due to the number of work vans Apart from this strange smell and parking We can t fault the hotel , The choice of breakfast was excellent The staff were very friendly and helpful An excellent location for getting into London
227043,Best Western Palm Hotel, The room was tiny Could hardly get around without hitting something The gap between the bed and the TV which was against the wall was about one foot The bathroom was even worse The water takes ages to heat up so all through my stay I never washed my hands or brushed my teeth with warm water I had to leave the shower running for 15 minutes before it turned warm I did not complain because I did not want to fuss Food in the restaurant was cold when it arrived Not 4 star standards Also the hotel is on the very busy A41 , Hotel reception and lobby area were nice 
227044,Best Western Palm Hotel, There was nothing to dislike, Excellent friendly welcoming staff and free parking in London Amazing and right on the main bus route A bus ride and tube and we were in Covent Garden within 40 mins
227045,Best Western Palm Hotel, If you re in a room which has a view of the main road The cars going by can be a little noisy if you re sensitive to noise Opt for the backward facing if this is an issue for you , This is my 3 rd stay here The staff are super super friendly and very helpful If you re lucky there is parking right in front of the hotel Hotel has always been spotless I went for the executive double which was very spacious and cozy The shower is the best part of the room Value for money is great Amenities in the room are excellent 
227046,Best Western Palm Hotel, The party that shook the hotel and didn t allow sleep mislaid keys calls to rooms from reception at 1 30 am and no water in the morning spoilt our stay However the hotel did defund us and admitted the problems We would give it another try , Initially a warm welcome and despite some room problems first impression was ok
227047,Best Western Palm Hotel, There was only 1 waitress at breakfast which made service a bit slow but she was lovely and apologised to us for the wait for our hot drinks which was only about 15 mins after sitting down Could have done with more people to help at breakfast, Breakfast was amazing room was clean managed to get free parking out the front and the staff were really friendly 
227048,Best Western Palm Hotel, WiFi needed quite some personal info to register and log in so I skipped that Sometimes waterpiping was a bit noisy but after one night you ll be used to that The location was a bit poor After having stayed in quite a few locations in London there always was a pub or underground nearby No pub here and the underground will take a ride in the bus or 15 min walk When coming back at night e g from NYE no buses or taxis anymore at Golders Green so walking is the only option , Very friendly staff always ready to help when having questions clean room hotel and 24 7 room service Reception also 24 7 Next to WiFi hotel has complimentary internet on a complimentary computer 
227049,Best Western Palm Hotel, Sink and shower not working in the morning every day both the rooms booked It is unacceptable not having water in the room when waking up in the morning also considering we booked the best executive rooms available in this hotel We informed the staff about the problem but they were not able to solve this big issue Executive room is not nice looking considerong this should be a 4 star hotel Hairdrier is fixed to the table near to the bed and not possoble to use near a mirror or in the bathroom Hotel is located in a bad area You have to walk 25 minutes to reach the underground station Very unsatisfied about the stay in this hotel Not recommended ,No Positive
227050,Best Western Palm Hotel, Paid extra for an executive room which I thought would have a bath in as it s made to seem like that on the website Shows as having sky yet half the channels don t work bed uncomfortable , Value for money ish 
227051,Best Western Palm Hotel, Scrambled egg is tasteless and our omellete took sooo long to come and it was huge Its good for four people when it came and iver cooked its too brown , Not enough water for morning shower and even just to wash my face before breakfast 
227052,Best Western Palm Hotel, There was a constant loud noise all through the night not just the dual carriageway outside but like a boiler hissing noise Annoying Also when booking I don t know much about London so when it said central to London was I shocked I had to take an uber every time I got off the tube to reach the hotel Yes verymissold on that part,No Positive
227053,Best Western Palm Hotel, Was in room 228 for 6 days From our check in date to checkout our corridor had awful stinking sewage smell which i complained everyday the only solution offered was change of floor What of other guests I was told the plumning pipes were old and being changed thats why the smell I didnt believe it , Location and wifi
227054,Best Western Palm Hotel, nothing to be critical about for what we paid, good sized family room excellent shower sky tv was a bonus very clean free parking great value with breakfast included
227055,Best Western Palm Hotel, Our hotel room was at the front very busy road so could take have windows open for example It is further out of town too didn t realise it wasn t on a tube line so tube then bus then walk , Lively hotel Staff lovely Comfortable stay 
227056,Best Western Palm Hotel, Maybe 12 5 pound breakfast without a cappuccino is not that good also 2 of the 3 juice machine was not working Location is not that good , Wifi and cable provided for high speed Great showers Clean Some variety of tea Good size room Excellent Customer service 
227057,Best Western Palm Hotel, Mattress thin and felt the springs small table and chairs sofa would have been nice for an excecutive suite missused furniture luggage stand used for tv table shower height not adjustable Welcome pack not available had to search for the hotel handbook Room service menu in room very limited basically coffee and cakes no complementary biscuits or snack Could be made a nice excecutive room with a bit of thought but at this current state would class as a basic room , Decent size room
227058,Best Western Palm Hotel, Some of the Buffet cooked Breakfast seemed a little stewed Scrambled Eggs were drying out and Hash Browns seemed as though they had been re heated and were too dry , Very comfortable bed
227059,Best Western Palm Hotel, There was a humming noise which I think was coming out of the aircon Was so bad but I guess afterwards I managed to ignore it and slept , The location wasn t bad and the car park was handy 
227060,Best Western Palm Hotel, Expected the room to be bigger steps down to bathroom bit dubious especially as my partner had had a knee op so had to be careful , Breakfast really good for the price Clean room 
227061,Best Western Palm Hotel, Filthy room broken shower urine on the toilet seat and the room and bathroom smelt of sewage unfriendly staff and mis informed about car parking Rude and unpleasant over all , Nothing
227062,Best Western Palm Hotel, Rate would have been cheaper if we had booked directly through the hotel website Did not realised this until after we had booked with booking com , Friendly staff Clean room Good value for money Not far from central London on tubes Uber 
227063,Best Western Palm Hotel, People from the staff entered the room twice while we were inside the first time without even knocking and the second time straight away after knocking, Very clean comfortable beds and the bathroom was amazing 
227064,Best Western Palm Hotel, No hot water in 2 rooms and for 2 mornings could not be a coincidence Poor facilities basically on an highway so impossible to sleep if you are in one of the room facing the roads 20 min walk to closest tube station although advertised as being close to the tube NOT WORTH THE MONEY THIS IS NOT A 4 STARS HOTEL, Staff was trying to be helpful
227065,Best Western Palm Hotel, The staff were dis organised On arrival they forgot to activate the door keys At breakfast was worse No cutlery no cups delayed tea ran out of tea spoons The room was noisy with cars passing by all night and a sound of flashing toilet was on part of the night My sleep was a nightmare I wish if staff would be trained to take care of guest from entry into the dining room to furnishing them with all their breakfast needs before they go to the next than the current situation where they are more than six but allover following each other with tasks half done , the rooms are spacious and there is good space for parking
227066,Best Western Palm Hotel, Carpark in front of hotel is used by long vans You risk an accident if you try to get in Fortunately they have a car park in the back where you may get in If vans are parked corr ectly Fortunately it is free, Ordered superior kind of room and got one without bath After asking ofr they changed us to one with That was a nice room Nice staff too 
227067,Best Western Palm Hotel, Bed uncomfortable 2 singles pushed together and the mattress was past it s best bedding not changed daily which was dissapointing and not 100 clean air con stuck on cold which wasn t the best as freezing outside, Hotel in good location not far from Golders Green free parking a bonus but recommend getting there early nothing too much for the staff always very polite and happy to cater for all your needs

227070,Best Western Palm Hotel, The windows were quite thin so you could hear some traffic from the main road and the batteries in the sky remote kept running out but these are picky little things that probably only I picked up I loved my stay here and this doesn t affect my opinion in the slightest , It was more like a 5 hotel to me staff were fantastic and the room was beautiful Lovely big showers as well and having Sky Sports in the room was a big plus 
227071,Best Western Palm Hotel, Maybe include breakfast in the deal as the room was quite expensive, The sky tv box in the room was amazing Never had that before Bed was really comfy

227077,Best Western Palm Hotel, The room was cold even when heating was out on When researching the hotel I read that the hotel had parking On arrival I was told the car park was full up and there was no room Luckily I could park on the residential road and was out of hours to have to pay for parking as I arrived very early hours of the am I also had to leave very early so I didn t have to move the car to avoid getting a ticket Also the blankets felt like they had wire I m them,No Positive

227083,Best Western Palm Hotel, The room we were in had four air conditioning units on the roof right outside of the window I had very little sleep which spoilt my daughters graduation at the University of West London the reason for our trip , Nice clean room 
227084,Best Western Palm Hotel, I scheduled a wake up call and they didn t call in , Everything was excellent Attention from the staff facilities clean complimentary coffee and tea taxi ready 
227085,Best Western Palm Hotel, We didn t get a double bed despite paying for a double room The two single duvets we were supplied with felt 20 years old The whole hotel including corridors and bedrooms had a horrible damp dirty smell throughout,No Positive
227086,Best Western Palm Hotel, The one issue that spoiled our stay was the excessive road traffic noise on Hendon Way My wife was unable to sleep at all on Saturday night and unfortunately our room 209 was located at the front of the hotel directly overlooking the busy road I don t think the skylight window had double glazed sound proofing and as we were only staying for one night we decided not to request a room change I also requested a quiet room away from traffic noise when I made the initial on line booking but that seems to have been overlooked , The excellent cooked breakfast was the highlight of our stay It represented good value for money and offered a good selection of food to cater for all tastes Catering staff were attentive at all times

227088,Best Western Palm Hotel, Nothing to improve on really we got a parking space by chance so perhaps more spaces but I feel room is an issue , The room was very clean and despite being on the ground floor room 4 next to the bar area there was no noise at night Beds were very comfortable room clean with excellent facilities Sky TV a bonus bathroom very nice and hot shower very spacious No noise from outside either Location was good just off motorway and for our purpose visiting Wembley a short taxi ride away 15 
227089,Best Western Palm Hotel, room size was small The view was straight at the air con units on the roof , The bathroom was good quality and there was sky in the room There s parking in front of the hotel and a secure lockup to the rear 
227090,Best Western Palm Hotel, It was right next to a 3 lane main road so you could hear the traffic slightly did not keep me awake though , Bed was very comfy tv was great and the room generally was a very nice environment 
227091,Best Western Palm Hotel, A little too far from Golders Green tube station, The evening meal in the restaurant was superb Very well presented and of course delicious Compliments to the chef 
227092,Best Western Palm Hotel, There was a faint smell of sewerage in the halls which should be resolved Thought somebody had cracked a rat but it was still there the second day , Everything was spot on Staff rooms food prices all perfect 
227093,Best Western Palm Hotel, Smelly carpets in the hall ways Lots of unlit steps in the hall ways a step in our room to get to the bathroom unlit at night and dangerous Food expensive and not good quality, Not a lot
227094,Best Western Palm Hotel, Breakfast too dry Location was too far out from London and on a very busy main road Rooms were a little dated and need refreshing , Staff very friendly
227095,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, The over all service Bar tender could do enough for you Picked hotel because of location for following day and cost Biggest thing was the car parking 
227096,Best Western Palm Hotel, The corridor to the room smelled like sweaty feet for the duration of our stay The room could and should have been aired before we arrived it was also a little stuffy and smelly had to leave a window open for the duration , The best sausages I have tasted for a long time and a good selection on the buffet 
227097,Best Western Palm Hotel, The corridors leading to our room smelt dusty and our room smelt like no one had stayed there for ages Was not impressed with the cleaning and I do not believe our towels were changed daily as I put a mark on one and had the same one the next day Breakfast was hit and miss It is a buffet and basically it was luck if you got hot food or not On Tuesday our breakfast was lovely on Wednesday our breakfast was very cold and horrible and no one cared I reluctantly paid 25 for it as our breakfast was not included in our stay We did not have an evening meal or use any of the facilities so can not comment on that The nearest tube station was about 25 30 minute walk away at a general pace Luckily we were out of the hotel most of the time we were in London and only there to sleep I wouldn t stay here again , Staff were very friendly and happy to help on the front desk 
227098,Best Western Palm Hotel, The pillows were awful flat and hard I tried adding another different pillow but then it became too high up for me and still hard There wasn t anywhere to park when we arrived but we were lucky to be able to park on a residential street close to the hotel parking is on a first come first serve basis , The night receptionist was really helpful and the morning receptionist seemed friendly The beds were comfy and the room a good size for two adults I was dubious about how well the curtains would shut out the light as I like to sleep in absolute darkness but they didn t disappoint at all With regards to the location we were coming back from a wedding outside London so it was ok for us but if you are coming from abroad you may want to stay closer to the city and not on a very busy road where the entrance is All in all I liked the hotel modern features but still has old ish decor Very clean and bathroom a good enough size The walk in shower is very spacious and had two different types of shower heads oh la la I prefer showers to baths so this was perfect for me 
227099,Best Western Palm Hotel, There was a smell in the coridor, Very clean and nice decorated rooms So friendly and solution oriented staff Good location although it seems far away from the city center when look at the location there is no problem in transportation you can use both metro and bus to reach the center in 30 min Number 113 bus stops in front of the hotel and takes you directly to the end of the Oxford Street Number 460 245 and 260 takes you directly to the Golders Green metro station in 5 min 
227100,Best Western Palm Hotel, Nothing we did not like Some guests were noisy but don t hold hotel responsible for other guests behaviour , Arrived early staff aware assisted directing us to parking area Waited in reception until room available which was quick 
227101,Best Western Palm Hotel, As a longtime Booking com customer I have noticed that places are not always as good as the reviews lead one to believe however this place was so bad in every possible way I suspect the positive reviews cannot be true This motel is located in the middle of a sketchy neighborhood with nothing nearby I did not feel safe with my family Everything is 15 minutes away walking metro coffee a bite to eat everything The hotel is dark old and had an odor I could write in the dust on the top of the shelves One of our rooms smelled like sewage we complained to the front desk but the smell remained We overlooked the hotel back alley that was cluttered with junk and the staff was kind enough to wake us up talking loudly during their 6 30 am smoke break The beds looked normal until you sat on them several inches of mattress would suddenly disappear under the lightest compression I had back problems for weeks after the visit and had to visit a physician Unfortunately in the rush to leave with three small children we left our Amazon Kindle in the room We noticed it missing as soon as we got to the airport Called the hotel and explained the exact location where it would have fallen between the bed and wall and followed up with several detailed emails Of course the device was never found in the room This horrible experience does not even consider the fact that when my mother was in an accident and couldn t fly we had to fight to get the dates changed until after her recovery I understand no refunds but this should have been an easy exception and they kept the money for the additional day we did not use when we re booked It was just a horrible place all around Not only will I avoid the brand at all costs in the future but I now feel that I can no longer trust Booking com and I will not be using them in the future , The staff at the front counter was courteous but it was a minimum effort and the least of what you would expect here in London 
227102,Best Western Palm Hotel, Decor looks good but f you look closely you realize it is done on the cheap I don t mind the chromed plastic of the fittings flaking away and bending at the slightest touch but the management could have invested a little more in the beds and bedding Bed was sloping and not very comfortable duvet unpleasantly synthetic we kept waking up in the middle of the night too hot under it too cold above you cannot win , Excellent Staff Overall good valu for money you get what you pay for I must reiterate staff are absolutely fantastic and very helpful 
227103,Best Western Palm Hotel, The face expression of a male receptionist who was not helpfull with a parking place , he lady receptionist was very helpfull with assisting to find a parking place when I couldn t find a p place for half an hour 
227104,Best Western Palm Hotel, There was a funny smell in the bathroom which I think was due to a room scent which we dod not like , The staff were very friendly and helpful The bed was very comfy 
227105,Best Western Palm Hotel, At 7 30am there was no water in the bathroom Second floor rooms there s insufficient water head if many guests are showering Staff had experienced this previously We were given a ground floor bathroom for showing , Reception staff were helpful 
227106,Best Western Palm Hotel, Pressure was low on the shower, The staff were brilliant very polite and helpful and allowed us to leave our car parked the following day for a while whilst we visited family 
227107,Best Western Palm Hotel, Very little sleep as noise in the room corridor in the early hours Bathroom stank toilet seat broken When this was mentioned at check out she didn t even acknowledge that we had a disturbed nights sleep Service in the breakfast room was terrible We had to ask for tea cofee no alternatives offered hadda ask for toast Very little Care taken overall and we had to do all the leg work to get the basic breakfast requirements, Clean
227108,Best Western Palm Hotel, I dont like Best Western some of my most miserable nights away on business have been hosted by the brand but this one was actually nice It looks hideous from outside and its full of travelling tradesmen but it is not bad , comfy bed clean spacious room quite nice if you need to stay local
227109,Best Western Palm Hotel, It was a little bit misleading how far the tube station was it was a good 25 30 minute walk up a steep hill, Great stay beds were very comfortable rooms were clean and well equipped sky TV definite 
227110,Best Western Palm Hotel, A bit disappointing having come from a Best Western in Southampton that was much better Room a little small and pokey too hot on the top floor gym reason I booked extremely limited I was also annoyed on check in to find myself standing waiting for several minutes while two of the three check in staff were busy on computers ignoring a growing queue while one girl checked everyone in , Some of the staff were helpful and for London prices it wasn t too bad 
227111,Best Western Palm Hotel, The TV was slanted on the wall and we couldn t get it straight also the Sky remote had no batteries in it Breakfast left a little to be desired very dry beans and eggs , We had room service which was absolutely excellent really tasty Nice comfortable bed aswell Staff helpful and polite also let us leave the car in the car park after we checked out while we went into London 
227112,Best Western Palm Hotel, nothing excellent , reception staff is excellent very help full very kind excellent we will definitely stay again please keep up the standards 
227113,Best Western Palm Hotel, Bed was lumpy as were pillows Very hard to get comfortable Room was big but bathroom was cramped , Location was fine Pets welcomed at no extra charge 
227114,Best Western Palm Hotel, The smell that emanated from my bathroom room 225 precisely, The manager Ivana was great When I complained of an issue relating to a stench in my bathroom she took time to hear me out and even went with me to see for herself and finally gave me a 50 percent discount for the discomfort I hope that the problem will be fixed ASAP And to all the other staff that had smiles on their faces to make our stay more welcoming We say thank you The meal served for the party was sumptuous as well Kudos to the chef of the day 
227115,Best Western Palm Hotel, Location is a little isolated Bar was a little soul less but fine , Staff were friendly room was very pleasant Took delivery of a package for me without any hassle 
227116,Best Western Palm Hotel, Room service was demanding me 2 5 pounds extra for just dropping a water bottle in my room in night I was surprised if I myself take water bottle from reception would be 2 5 pounds and if they deliver it to my room it will be extra 2 5 pounds per tray bathroom As it was leaking as when I took shower a lany from reception came to tell me if I am using washroom correctly as they are having water drops down I was surprised Should be more welcoming with free water bottles in room for at least checkin time but it was not there and was charged separately , Parking is available free of cost that was the best part as we had car and was very convenient for free parking Hotel is good and clean but could be more better if they do some refurbishing with the linen and toilets
227117,Best Western Palm Hotel, Very poorly managed in the dining room in particular plenty of staff but not properly trained or supervised At breakfast when certain foods need to be replenished they have to be told about it , Location and car park also very good for the 113 bus service to the city 
227118,Best Western Palm Hotel, There wasn t much choice of wine and there wasn t much choice of food Location was not the best but taxi service was available from the hotel , Beds were comfy Staff were friendly Pate was lovely 
227119,Best Western Palm Hotel, nothing, Although we were on a business visit we also attended a party and needed earlier access on this occasion to our exec room This was no problem which helped us a lot and the bedroom was lovely big and cofortable 
227120,Best Western Palm Hotel, Paper should be delivered to the room Breakfast menu only present on first day and we were never asked if we wished to order from it Noise of air conditioner unit outside on roof , Position near bus stop giving access to West End Tea and coffee in room but no biscuits Room air conditioner 
227121,Best Western Palm Hotel, No complimentary water in my room because the room i stayed in my first stay in the hotel has complimentary water So when i asked for it i was told it s only for executive room but i thought water is life and should be made available to all rooms in the hotel , Neat clean and has a good location 
227122,Best Western Palm Hotel, Small rooms and the lift and stir case are not straight to the lobby leading to the rooms , The hotel is neat with a good Location and staff It s also conviniet if you may the bus because there s a bus stop few meters from the hotel main entrance along The Hendon way 
227123,Best Western Palm Hotel, Lack of transport links broken air con faulty TV faulty water pressure key cards randomly stopped working on the second day room long walk from reception noisy throughout the night, Very comfy bed gorgeous room helpful staff beautiful bathroom large shower high standard of cleanliness
227124,Best Western Palm Hotel, The shower was very weak I stayed in the same room before and it was more powerful back then Towels had a slight hint of vinegar in scent Air con was not able to be turned on Even though not turned on the air con started to make loud undefined noise for aprox 2 hours which was a little annoying as we could not turn it off Since I am from the city the traffic noise did not disturb me that much unless I watched Tv It was a bit hard to find a decent volume on the tv with all the traffic noise in the background , I loved how lovely the staff at Palm Hotel was Highest attention to customer satisfaction was paid and even trivial request such as heating up a cup of soup in the microwave was fullfilled Very lovery indeed The beds were very comfty and the room was clean The Hotel parking was great too Utram station is in walking distance and a big Tesco to buy some snacks was near 
227125,Best Western Palm Hotel, Bread ran out too soon at the breakfast buffet though , Room was spacious and bed was comfy Cosy hotel and good location Love the lobby deco too Ample parking space 
227126,Best Western Palm Hotel, Car parking When an event on at Wembley car parking is an issue Taxis We booked a taxi for 6 people to Wembley stadium approx 4 miles and it cost us 30 and again on the night a taxi to West Hampstead which is approx 1 mile away cost us 15 apparently prices do increase when there s an event on at Wembley stadium so do check prices before hand , we booked this hotel because it was close enough to Wembley stadium and close to bars restaurants The hotel was good and our room 3 single beds was very spacious and clean The breakfast even though quite pricey was very good lots of choice and variety 
227127,Best Western Palm Hotel, The breakfast ended at 09 30 during the week it would have been nice to see these hours extended to around 10 30, The room we had although small had lots of feature such as a mini fridge and safe with some off road parking but this is a very small car park
227128,Best Western Palm Hotel, A new member of staff in the restaurant Even though I told her that I hadn t prepaid for breakfast but that I had pre authorised funds for payment on my room number I asked her to bill my breakfast to my room She later stopped me leaving the restaurant and told me I had to pay Very embarrassing as I had earlier told her to bill it to my room Which she then proceeded to do The same member of staff served me the evening before in the bar She couldn t work the till and then gave me the wrong change too much Thankfully Rugby fans are generally honest folk , 24h access to the gym Good overall value for this area of London 
227129,Best Western Palm Hotel, Parking area could do to be larger but staff did assist with getting us a parking space within 5 minutes of arrival, Clean Tidy and well updated location made for easy travel to Wembley stadium via a 7 minute bus journey and 10 minute tube staff helped when we arrived without parking spaces available
227130,Best Western Palm Hotel, Unfortunatly other guests spoiled our stay our room was directly above the function room The room had a set of french doors which opend to a small balcony over looking the rear private carpark It was a very humid night so we left the doors open unfortunatly members of the party which was taking place in the function room gatherd in the rear car park At about 2am They acted like children and decided to start throwing bits of left over food through the doors and into our room On check in we was notified by staff of the party and that our room was directly above but me being a heavy sleeper i was not fussed and said it would be fine i think if we would of asked the staff we would of being offerd an alternate room Apart from this incident it would of probably being a pleasent stay , Very freindly staff great selection on the breakfast menu 
227131,Best Western Palm Hotel, I have been staying in many BW hotels and this is probably the worst I was the last one to check in and I got the last room available 009 which is facing the road Hendon Way The room is not very well insulated so you hear cars passing by every seconds SUPER NOISY Staff Aneil tried to help us moving to a different room but at the end he could not do anything electrical issue apparently I have been waiting almost for an hour from 00 45am to 1 45am Despite Aneil s kindness no solution has been provided Also no hear plugs were available In the morning Alberto Duty Manager apologised again and he offered me breakfast which I did not want or 20 discount of 98 which I think it is not enough if you are staying in for 7hours with NO SLEEP If you really want to stay at this BW please avoid rooms facing the road , Unfortunately nothing Never again Avoid room 009 
227132,Best Western Palm Hotel, Not disabled friendly i fell back in the shower screen and hurt myself when booking we stated i was disabled and the parking was first come first served which was no good to me,No Positive
227133,Best Western Palm Hotel, More parking allocated disabled bays not just 2 cones tied 2gether with a note saying reserved 4 disabled We had 2 keep moving the cones ourselves everytime we went out We then had 2 them back across the space 2 show it was reserved Good job I wasn t on my own as I couldn t have kept getting in out of the car 2 do this The major No No was they used the fire exit keep clear space as my disabled spot I raised this at reception straight away only 2 b told it s ok It s illegal 2 block a fire exit but the staff on reception thought it was funny when I told them this I said the door can t b opened fully 2 get out was told people can squeeze through it Very frightening that the staff don t take fire evacuation seriously , Staff couldn t do enough 2 help me with my disability 
227134,Best Western Palm Hotel, Coming home Northern line being closed not the hotels fault I should have checked , All the staff were helpful and friendly Great nights sleep I should have booked another night as we enjoyed our stay so much Thank you 
227135,Best Western Palm Hotel, On this trip to London we stayed in BW twice a couple of days each time On the first occasion we encountered a couple of problems including a smelly chimney from the kitchen which meant not being able to open our window Mentioned this at the front desk and as compensation were told next time we booked we d get a reduction On our return we were given a lovely room But on the second morning the shower stopped mid shower Relocated to another room but horror of horrors we were directly in line of that awful chimney from the kitchen again and this time the air con was simply a joke and couldn t provide adequate ventilation to counter this , I much prefer the warm interior of this hotel to that of the bland Holiday Inn Front desk staff are always friendly happy to lend lend a helping hand As an example we were worried about the weight of our suitcases and mentioned this to the staff as we were checking out and they immediately brought a weighing scale from behind the desk to our car so we could weigh our cases there and then With a car the hotel is ideal in London Free parking with easy access to Brent Cross shopping mall 5 min drive Golders Green 2 min drive and the nearby Finchley Road providing quick access to both central London and other areas Wi Fi is a blistering speed as long as you don t upload large file sizes videos to youtube Then it begins to slow down rapidly I only wish other hotels at a considerably higher price point would learn from Best Western on their Wi Fi policy 
227136,Best Western Palm Hotel, We had to be upgraded to a bigger room as unfortunately the beds where too small in length for my partner who is over 6ft I am 5ft5 and my feet where touching the end We where very pleased with how great the staff where in resolving this but when it came to bed time and we lay on the bed it was essentially two singles pushed together and the crack in the middle was very sharp and hard resulting in us both having to squeeze into the corner of one half , Staff where very friendly and efficient Bathroom and shower where lovely 
227137,Best Western Palm Hotel, Could not connect to free wifi had to take 2 buses to get into London as the whole of the Northern line was down would recommend to stay central Also food drink are over priced, Loved the bathroom beds were very comfy 
227138,Best Western Palm Hotel, Bathroom extractor fan didn t work Only half the bathroom lights worked Only one tv channel worked Shower head didnt work Reported faults but nothing was done On our return from a wedding on the 2nd night found no faults had been rectified Complained to be told maintenance didn t report to work that day Was offered an alternative room but being it was midnight it was hardly practicable , Ideal location for Hampstead wedding we attended Bed was comfortable On checking out was dealt with courteously and given a discount would have preferred to have a fully functioning room for our stay than a discount 
227139,Best Western Palm Hotel, This would be great if I had a car The bus stop was an easy walk but you had to connect to the subway to get anywhere in a timely manner We stayed 5 nights so by the end we had figured out transportation , Nice air conditioned room Great shower friendly staff 
227140,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, stuff is very helpful and supportive the room is comfortable and clean we are satisfied with the bathroom But the location is a little bit far from London centre 
227141,Best Western Palm Hotel, Having to ask for a pot of tea for breakfast and toast as staff kept walking past us , The breakfast choice was really good also room services was prompt 
227142,Best Western Palm Hotel, The shower had issues but none too serious just needs a bit of maintenance Lighting in the restaurant too coloured to our taste , The beds were very comfortable and the room space great Especially when traveling with odd numbers of people this is a welcome benefit Parking space was also provided at no charge and wireless network facilities were available Food in the restaurant was excellent Connection to the centre of London easy 
227143,Best Western Palm Hotel, Mattress too soft , Beds were too soft and I could feel the springs Everything else was brilliant Parking is first come first served so a bit of a pain 
227144,Best Western Palm Hotel, I would not recommend to stay in this hotel or have dinner in the restaurant inside the hotel About the restaurant all meals are over priced the food quality is less than average We arrived to the restaurant at around 9 pm the restaurant closes at 9 30 pm and the last order was at 9 20 pm according to the front staff Staff quality at the restaurant was really poor They forgot to ask how to cook steaks didn t ask any sauce to bring the worst experience at restaurant I ve ever gone The sausage was not cooked properly half rare the spring rolls were very tiny too oily and over priced The reception staff did not speak good English or she had basically difficulty to understand what customer wants I simply asked her I need to have early breakfast earlier than their breakfast serving time but didn t give me clear answer and I need to wait to talk to the male leader or a male manager to arrive The manager was not very polite anyway Car park was too small so we needed to park on the road where very dark and I did not feel safe to park my car there I will never go to the restaurant again , Nothing 
227145,Best Western Palm Hotel, There is an Odor in the hallway and in the bathroom Carpet is old and the upstairs steps are dangerous Almost fell twice, The staffs are excellent and helpful in the front desk and room service Rooms are quite
227146,Best Western Palm Hotel, The shower wasn t working properly kept cutting out no water in room too late to ask as bar closed, The bed was reasonable the room and bathroom was clean 
227147,Best Western Palm Hotel, Was quite a way out of the city and the tube station was further away and up a big hill than it looked Central London was a bus and tube ride away about 40 mins , Staff were very friendly and helpful Spotlessly clean Nice to have Sky TV too 
227148,Best Western Palm Hotel, Noise from road unfriendly staff slow bar service Poor room service our drink was wrong and the subsequent fuss made was completely unacceptable Management need to learn to take responsibility for their decisions and speak to customers rather than leave the blame to the front line staff I will be writing to best western about how poor service was , Nice to have a gym and our room was quite nicely decorated
227149,Best Western Palm Hotel, Location Tube station closed 2 weekends in a row Had to make other arrangements to get around that inconvenience , Good value for the time of year 
227150,Best Western Palm Hotel, A C didn t work and it was the hottest day of the year Parking is very limited and is first come first serve so you have to find parking elsewhere , Staff were helpful room was comfortable but the A C didn t work Good food in the restaurant
227151,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, Excellent shower one of the best I have had during a Hotel stay nice breakfast good selection choice great location just far enough away yet near enough to visit the centre of London frequent bus service with a stop right outside the hotel 
227152,Best Western Palm Hotel, Change in parking policy after booking The ability to park on site is why is booked the hotel and if the clarification had been made before i had booked I would have gone somewhere else The hotel and booking com didn t really care and were very unhelpful as they d already received the money ,No Positive
227153,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, The room was a fair size and the bed very comfortable Stayed here this time last year for Ride London Aircon very effective and opening windows if preferred Fridge complimentary water good toiletries good free wifi secure parking on site first come first served Didn t use TV but Sky box attached Was allowed to check in early as room was ready Helpful friendly staff Very good value for a London hotel Easy to get into London bus stops almost outside and trains 15 20 mins walk On a busy main road into London but this didn t affect my sleep 
227154,Best Western Palm Hotel, Few small problems with electrics etc but corrected once reception notified, Room 119 was lovely Staff were helpful and came straight away when there were problems with TV and electrics Location is fabulous and hotel pet friendly win win situation 
227155,Best Western Palm Hotel, Far away from metro Not in center of London more far away than expected especially at night Nothing around for dinner at night apart in hotel Hotel in front off a roadway Staff not really efficient and customer oriented took them ages to register we booked a triple but never got a proper one wrong information shared etc Low pressure of water the last day impossible to take a proper shower Products for shower and bath for one while 3 , Bus in front off the hotel Getting a quiet room in a noisy environment 
227156,Best Western Palm Hotel, That I didn t get to try out the other services they offer because I was too tired The Hotel location is in a quite place which is good for a good night sleep but not around any shops so it s either u walk to find one or catch a quick bus , Customers service was really good Face to interaction to fix any problem instead of telling what to do on the phone Hotel looks great from the outside and rooms was so nice all the way to the bathroom I loved the robes and slippers provided made me feel like I was at home I also liked that they had sky tv service and was able to watch the standard sky package 
227157,Best Western Palm Hotel, I booked a standard double room we were given two single beds pushed together with two single duvets Very uncomfortable beds and incredibly dark rooms No overheard lighting at all only three lamps Very difficult to do any sort of make up as so dark , Staff were lovely secure parking was excellent and easily accessible with bus stops tube stops near by 
227158,Best Western Palm Hotel, We booked a double room and got given 2 single beds pushed together View out of the window was peoples back gardens and most nights they were having parties and were loud so it was hard to sleep The room was tiny and looked nothing like it did on the internet no where near as modern We stayed for 5 days 4 nights and the whole time we never had hot water in the shower except for on the last day Got told a lot of misleading information and it wasn t in a very nice area Definitely not worth the money , Nothing
227159,Best Western Palm Hotel, Stayed on the 2nd floor no hot or cold water in the morning Management aware of the problem but didn t warn me and gave a small bill reduction Very very frustrating, Friendly staff and welcome Good restaurant 
227160,Best Western Palm Hotel, Only one person was at the reception had to wait around 8 11mins to be spoken to location is the middle of a dual carriage , Clean was really spacious and lovely room
227161,Best Western Palm Hotel, There isn t anything I can write here really The only thing that comes to mind is there was a private function going on and people attending were somewhat rude , Staff were amazing so attentive helpful and accommodating Breakfast had a great selection of food choices and again staff were so good as were on hand but gave us space to eat peacefully whilst still waking up Our room was very clean and had everything we needed we were so comfortable we were tempted to stay another night 
227162,Best Western Palm Hotel, Function room was below us and an event was on from 7pm 11pm loud music and people shouting about not great when you have two small children trying to sleep should of put us elsewhere , Location quick walk to the tube then only a few stops to all attractions Breakfast really good and kept topped up Bar area small but good for chilling in front of the TV
227163,Best Western Palm Hotel, Room had a smell of sick in it Had to get receptionist to spray room and leave windows open all night Very poor I ve stayed in lots of best westerns as your records will show Also clicked Car Park reservation when I got there I was told it was first come first served Not what it says on your web site , Location and Bar area
227164,Best Western Palm Hotel, No water however this was a problem in the whole area Customer service was excellent was given a full refund The hotel was not at fault , Comfy clean rooms 
227165,Best Western Palm Hotel, Shower did not work in the morning and told by staff its because the hotel was full and it would be the same the next morning Totally uneceptable answer 2 days at your hotel without a shower Tv had a sky box only 2 channels worked itv and 5usa was told by staff it is hit and miss Totally unacceptable answer air conditioning faulty no cold air after lots of trying with the controls room really hot and had to open sky light window but the noise from the major dual carriageway was herendous could not sleep both nights Would never use this hotel again or recommend, The evening meal and service was excellent
227166,Best Western Palm Hotel, NOTHING, The beds were super comfy and the shower was amazing and everywhere was so clean and cosey We ordered room service one night and the food was really nice we loved our stay and would come again
227167,Best Western Palm Hotel, On first arrival our room smelt like people had been smoking there was also a big generator outside our room which woke us multiple times in the morning the view from my window was somebodies house and back garden Our second night myself and my partner checked out of the hotel due to a big party happening at the hotel and all you could hear was the music which was shaking our room and lots of people shouting I spoke to reception and asked what time the party ended to which they replied about 23 30 midnight I said ok could you have not informed us of this prior to which he shrugged his shoulders and said your room is right above it He then said you look very tired aswell which I replied I am tired and also not feeling well After then arranging to stay at a family members we went to check out recepetion then said they could offer us another room which was one floor up however the hotel is small and the noise could still be heard They offered no compensation and I still had to pay for second nighy despite leaving at 20 30 I m not usually somebody to complain but this hotel is dreadful I wouldn t recommend to my worst enemy , Good location to go into london we stayed here to go to wembley which cost 15 for a taxi 
227168,Best Western Palm Hotel, Every thing was perfect , The Breakfast so delishius and the beds are so comfy and so clean Been there over 7 times always loved it will only go there not any where else 
227169,Best Western Palm Hotel, The cost of drinks I ordered a lime soda with my meal which cost nearly 4 for a few bubbles in some water and a dash of lime that s a rip off, Very nice clean I have stayed before and will stay again One of the better Best Western Hotels
227170,Best Western Palm Hotel, It was a little way from the nearest tube station but there was a bus stop very close by , Very helpful staff We had a problem with our door and the manager went out of his way to help us and gave us a free breakfast to make up for it The hotel was extremely clean and had good facilities Great value for a hotel in London 
227171,Best Western Palm Hotel, Breakfast was included but the scrambled eggs were solid whereas the bacon and sausage had barely seen the pan Strange flavour fruit juices concentrate Our room was on the ground floor at the front facing directly onto the main extremely busy road and although there was good soundproofing it was very un private Lighting in bathroom awful so very difficult to put on makeup Towels need replacing as they are tired A long walk to the nearest Tube although buses stop nearby , Free parking in a safe compound at the back of the hotel Very pleasant staff on front of desk who were helpful Good and large shower Nice little bar coffee lounge and staff very willing to serve afternoon teas alcoholic drinks etc at reasonable prices 
227172,Best Western Palm Hotel, Restaurant service, The front bedrooms need triple glazing our room was v noisy The reception staff we re very helpful whereas the restaurant staff we re poorly trained and not friendly 
227173,Best Western Palm Hotel, Breakfast was horrible The first day there the eggs were cold the hot chocolate was cold and certainly not up to Best Western standards The second morning the eggs smelled burnt and had a foul odor once again hot chocolate was cold The last morning the eggs were hot but runny at last the hot chocolate was hot I suggest you get a new chef because certainly this one falls below the mark I have stayed in many hotels and never seen a breakfast so horribly I am not one to make a fuss so did not say anything while there but you certainly lost a customer I feel that what i was charged for these meals were atrocious compared to the quality of food ,No Positive
227174,Best Western Palm Hotel, Unbearable heat and stuffiness that couldn t be turned off and the outside air conditioning units were right outside the bedroom window throwing heat and noise back into the room Waiter was ignorant and ignored us at breakfast time and kept us waiting too long for coffee which was ordered when entering dinning room ended up not having any Overall not a good experience and we will not be returning Also an Asian wedding reception on the first night so no where to park which was one of the reasons we chose this hotel,No Positive
227175,Best Western Palm Hotel, Sound of the traffic running along the main road the hotel is situated on But this isn t by any means the hotels fault and the price of the accommodation assists with this , Fantastic location if traveling to London or Wembley The full English buffet breakfast ranging from fruit muffins croissants danishes yougert eggs bacon sausages ash browns mushrooms tomatoes Amazing value set you up nicely for a day off traveling Rooms cleaned everyday on return back to hotel 
227176,Best Western Palm Hotel, Original room was very dark and beds sloped so it felt like you were falling out The transport links are awful tube is a bit of a trek so ended up getting buses and taxis There was a wedding on Saturday night and unfortunately someone thought it was a good idea to fill up the glass recycling bin at the back of the hotel with all the empty bottles from the party at 1 30AM The racket of smashing bottles went on for a good 30minutes and was impossible to sleep through , Jade on reception was vey helpful and sorted out a different room as we didn t like the one we were originally in They also pre warned a taxi firm that we might want picking up from Wembley Stadium so when we called at 11pm the taxi firm knew about us and were there within 15 minutes even though it was horrendous traffic outside the stadium Very clean and staff very helpful 
227177,Best Western Palm Hotel, Bed had seen better days Water pressure so low we couldn t take a shower Car parking limited and on a first come basis Staff disorganised Generally not up to Best Western standards , Handy location for North London
227178,Best Western Palm Hotel, We had a room on the back of the hotel which was quiet The rooms on the front are on a busy main road and would be noisy Car parking is quite limited at the weekend so could be a problem if taking a car , The location was great for taking a car to London and then getting the tube daily It is only a 15 minute walk to Golders Green tube station The staff at the hotel were so friendly and when we had a problem with our child being poorly they were very kind 
227179,Best Western Palm Hotel, Breakfast experience was very poor I travel weekly with work and have to say it has been the poorest experience to date , Lovely hotel clean tidy comfortable Staff polite helpful and welcoming
227180,Best Western Palm Hotel, Quit expensive breakfast but anyway very good and tasty , Bus stop right next to the hotel and tube station was also close Friendly and helpful staff Clean and comfortable room Will definitely stay again if in London 
227181,Best Western Palm Hotel, It s right next to a busy main road into London so be prepared for the constant noise Also the breakfast was poor undercooked and not very warm , Very convenient location free secure parking and very reasonable bar prices Also a newly decorated room The staff tried hard to be welcoming 
227182,Best Western Palm Hotel, Some staff have very poor knowledge of London Use of public transport is difficult hotel located on a dual carriageway, Comfortable bed Very good sound proofing
227183,Best Western Palm Hotel, The kitchen didn t feel the need to read the exact order which the waitress in the restaurant wrote down Bathroom was tiny with an odd flushing system presumably some kind of saniflow type thing as it was at the far end of the extension which didn t flush well at all The corridors were weirdly hot even when the weather outside was not warm at all After a late event I couldn t get into my room I was told by the reception staff that the cards are over sensitive If they are kept anywhere near mobile phones mine was in a small handbag but not next to the mobile they stop working , Staff were really helpful and friendly The waitress in the restaurant was so kind and eager to meet our requirements we were able to chose from the room service menu as well as the dinner menu Food was nice Room was fantastic size with a large leather sofa separate dressing section huge wardrobes I was on the first floor but didn t hear any noise from late event downstairs 
227184,Best Western Palm Hotel, The beds were to soft you could actually feel the Base And breakfast time the 2nd morning we left it a little later and it was a shambles there were a lot of us waiting around for them to bring out more and when they did there wasn t enough to go round So if u want a good fill up with breakfast go early , Overall it was good
227185,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, Our twin room was spacious clean and cosy beds were comfy loved the mini fridge and TV with endless channels Staff were friendly and professional Locations was excellent for us Great shower and Wi Fi Can t wait to come back 
227186,Best Western Palm Hotel, There was a bad smell of drains when we got to our room The toilet didnt always flush properly and the cold tap didnt work on the shower The parking wasnt great as you had to pay before 8pm , Room was clean and staff were helpful 
227187,Best Western Palm Hotel, Parking jeez Not many spaces available so if you are driving you risk parking in controlled street areas If you want to be sure of a parking space pay much more and go elsewhere Bed was orrible felt springs twanging when moving around , Decent sized room for London although I think I d been upgraded Food was good Had parking problems but was sorted by very helpful Reception chap wish I had his name as he deserves a mention Sky tv great quality picture on large screen
227188,Best Western Palm Hotel, Very convenient for those travelling by car but less so for those using public transport Next to N Circular but noise not to much of a problem, Clean and comfortable room with air con and helpful staff
227189,Best Western Palm Hotel, Was all good, Good location easy access to central London Doors in corridor and other rooms could be better Soft closing doors will mean others are not disturbed Otherwise perfect 
227190,Best Western Palm Hotel, All above, We booked a double bed room and had two single beds pushed together Our television didnt work propley The staff was very rube at breakfast time At breakfast I had to ask for a glass for my breakfast juice Then I had to ask for fuit as there was just an empty bowl on the side left Then there was no scrambled egg left so I had to ask for some and I just got fround at by staff Paul in reception was most helpful and told us some good places to visit and kindly ordered us a taxi on the evening 
227191,Best Western Palm Hotel, The hotel looked very old and dull carpet not clean the bed was very uncomfortable i had back pain the next morning Although free wifi was advertised there was no connection mostly the entire time I was there and when I called the receptionist she said they are fixing it but it was never fixed The remote was not working too so I had to change channels manually most of the time , Although a bit far from the city center there are good transportation links There s a lift which is rare in most London s hotels 
227192,Best Western Palm Hotel, The wifi was non existent , We stayed in a three bed family room Nice room nice bathroom Good facilities Air con in the room was fantastic as the room was very warm Staff are friendly and helpful I d read the shower could be cold but our s was always very hot Also we parked without any problem in a very safe car park Fantastic 
227193,Best Western Palm Hotel, Nothing, The staff were perfect and entirely helpful with my many queries an they extended my checkout by an hour free of charge came from a london club i cant praise them more if i could i would 2 thumbs up
227194,Best Western Palm Hotel, Hotel is very close to a big road In the rooms looking toward this road is very noisy even at night , Staff were very nice and room furniture were clean and modern
227195,Best Western Palm Hotel, There was loud music as a wedding was taking place but this stopped promptly at midnight , Staff friendly and helpful Rooms clean and comfortable Excellent value for money Would definitely recommend and stay here again 
227196,Best Western Palm Hotel, noise from function suite after 10pm disturbed us we liked everything else , hotel was clean and staff were very helpful and friendly food was excellent at breakfast and dinner room was spotless and beds were comfortable 
227197,Best Western Palm Hotel, The customer service needs a drastic overhaul the manager is in the wrong job He looks a state and as for his welcoming as I arrived well let s just say I would get better service from a dustbin ,No Positive
227198,Best Western Palm Hotel, Restock the breakfast went to get a croissant s but the had all gone and didn t put any more out , The bed was very comfy good night sleep A very lovely cup of coffee 
227199,Best Western Palm Hotel, Breakfast too expensive, I stayed here with a group of people as part of a stag weekend The hotel is very conveniently placed and the free parking is really useful although the car park could easily be full when you arrive we were lucky The rooms were comfortable and the staff professional and attentive 
227200,Best Western Palm Hotel, We had booked for the free parking but on arrival all spaces were full we had to park in the street and walk some distance with our luggage The view from our room was of the roof at the rear of the hotel , Very clean and comfortable room staff were very helpful 
227201,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, Staff are excellent I had somehow managed to double book a room And they did not charge me courtesy of the hotel manager he sorted things out Would definetly recommend just on friendliness of the people who work there 
227202,Best Western Palm Hotel, Didn t book breakfast as expensive with a 13 year old Most hotels now provide free breakfast for children Also different prices quoted on the day from those online, Attended party also held at hotel so very convenient Delicious food 
227203,Best Western Palm Hotel, The king size bed although conformable could do with a new mattress as the one in my room 112 was almost past its sell by date Everything else was clean and fine , The staff were friendly and check in was efficient As our stay was for business we mainly used the hotel for sleeping and therefore can not comment on the food quality and service as we ate out during our stay The location is fine if you have your own vehicle A good business location as you can park in front of the hotel free of charge 
227204,Best Western Palm Hotel, The air con in our room had broken leaked whilst we were out for the night and made the floor some of our clothes and the bed soaking wet However the staff gave us another room straight away and offered us a free breakfast ,No Positive
227205,Best Western Palm Hotel, There was no mirror which was an essential item to be able to have your hair done properly There came a replacement after complaining but a little 2 late, The shower was nice
227206,Best Western Palm Hotel, Bathroom had a smell to it that was sickly could do with floor mat for getting out of shower as very slippery Don t rate the restaurant food on site for value as mixed grill had more fat than meat on it was more hungry than when we went down to eat better off eating locally , Was very clean rooms were tidy comfortable good staff very helpful good to have a secure car park too Breakfast was good great choice
227207,Best Western Palm Hotel, Nothing, Really comfortable bed Amazing staff really went out of there way to make us feel welcome Paul on reception is a star cleaning staff so polite and accommodating Having a small fridge a big bonus Definitely recommend this hotel
227208,Best Western Palm Hotel, The only thing that could be improved is the hallways could be revamped but other than that I can not complain Cannot comment on the noise as was at the back of the hotel and it was silent back there But considering it is on a dual carriageway there is bound to be noise so if you want somewhere quiet then don t book the hotel and expect no noise , Had a wonderful stay at this hotel 1 week ago I Had read the reviews before I went and I was thinking that the hotel was going to be awful I can honestly say that the hotel was lovely Arrived at 12pm plenty of parking and was able to check in and go to our room which was amazing after a 2 hour drive to the hotel was not expecting this at all There are a lot of reviews saying that it s in the middle of nowhere and the train station is a 20 minute walk Although it s true about the train station there is a bus stop just outside the hotel and takes you directly to the train station all you need is google maps on your phone and you are set Staff were very friendly and helpful and considering parking is free I was not complaining that the train station was so far away especially when the bus runs every 15 minutes Breakfast was great plenty of choice and staff were always there to help and were always bringing out lots of food Room very comfortable and bigger than expecting with a fridge in the room which was a bonus Loved the shower as it was a rain shower and there were always clean towels both nights we stayed there Could not fault this hotel as the price was amazing for the 2 nights we stayed and will definitely be staying here again 
227209,Best Western Palm Hotel, The noise from the traffic and the noisy ventilated heating system on part of the roof made it extremely annoying for the rooms nearby as it seemed to roar all night long Would advise requesting a room away from both nuisances , Beds really comfy breakfast excellent nice bathroom 
227210,Best Western Palm Hotel, The bathroom light did not work but it was not a problem as I was only staying for one night , Easy to find and not to far from train or underground station Also on a bus network 
227211,Best Western Palm Hotel, Fire alarm went off at 6AM Sunday morning also shower was intermittent the hairdryer cut out too , The beds were superb nice cosy rooms Alcohol and soft drinks reasonably priced needed a drink after a long day of walking 
227212,Best Western Palm Hotel, We booked a double room and paid 99 for this but it was 2 single beds just pushed together with 2 single quilts Other people that came with us paid 84 for a twin room which was the same room with the beds apart We booked these rooms on the same booking so the time we booked wouldn t have made a difference to the price , Rooms were nicely decorated and the bathroom was nice 
227213,Best Western Palm Hotel, 15 to 20 minute walk to the nearest tube station but this is noted on the hotel website so just a minor gripe Fire alarm went off at 6 15 am but none of the staff seemed interested Just got an apology note pushed under door , Clean tidy hotel
227214,Best Western Palm Hotel, Have to be better clean bathroom , Location is this hotel the best one for somebody who traveling to London for a shopping Just infront of hotel is bus stop to the Marbe Arch jurney take max 30min by bus From the tube station Golders Green is like 5min by taxi cost max 7GBP 
227215,Best Western Palm Hotel, I was told I couldn t have something that was on the room service menu and the restaurant menu while seated in the bar because it wasn t on the bar menu I pointed out the insanity of this and I was able to have the pate and toast in the bar So it ended OK , The rooms are really lovely very spacious with luxurious showers 
227216,Best Western Palm Hotel, There was a slight drain smell in the room and the corridor which spoilt the overall experience , Location staff good very helpful room clean bed comfortable breakfast ok
227217,Best Western Palm Hotel, Only issue we had was the shower had very little pressure and did turn itself off twice whilst being used Reported this to staff as we checked out and they said they would get maintenance onto it , Room was to a good standard Had everything we needed and would have expected from a hotel Staff were friendly and helpful Only a 10 minute walk from the train station into London 
227218,Best Western Palm Hotel, I was initially booked into a standard double room other reviews have mentioned the dodgy mattresses be warned they really are poor quality you can feel the bed through the springs the Executive Rooms are fine though and I unfortunately had no hot water in the morning of my first night I was upgraded to an exec room for the second night , The bedrooms have been finished to a good standard and the Executive Room I was moved to was very comfortable The food from the restaurant is good and reasonably priced The nearest tube is Golders Green which is an easy 15min walk away and secure parking is available on site 
227219,Best Western Palm Hotel, The bed was uncomfortable the power shower had no power whatsoever the carpet had a funny smell you could hear every single noise that was being made and if your staying in a room facing the busy road goodluck with getting some sleep , The food
227220,Best Western Palm Hotel, Cleaners start cleaning at 8 in the morning I stayed on the first floor where the floor is hollow and the foot stomping by the cleaner is extremely loud Woke me up every morning at 8 , The rooms were clean and the food from the bar was great 
227221,Best Western Palm Hotel, My wife and I think the mattress gave us painful back and shoulder pain Water pump is needed to increase the low tap pressure in the bathroom , Paul at the reception was excellent in his help and friendly manner We were lucky to have an excellent room 201 quiet and spacious Bus 113 was conveniently located outside the hotel to Marble Arch Good LG television 
227222,Best Western Palm Hotel, Showers only temperature was boiling and the whole hotel and room had an odd smell to it plus it s hard to cross the road outside as it s right on the motorway, Nice large bed and theres a gym if you need it fairly comfy and checkout isnt till 12
227223,Best Western Palm Hotel, Got to hotel at 9 15 after long drive option of room service was VERY limited No hair dryer available at all and bed was very lumpy and uncomfortable, Breakfast and staff were good
227224,Best Western Palm Hotel, Booked one room for 2 adults and one 10 year old child But room only had one double bed More information on local travel links could have been better , Room was clean staff friendly and helpful breakfast was good 
227225,Best Western Palm Hotel, Auto ligthing on corridors understand cost effective but due to all little steps here and there our group had a few close calls And we were sober , High standards in all areas
227226,Best Western Palm Hotel, Breakfast very dry and stale at 9am Hotel situated 20 mins walk from local facilities Unable to catch local buses without Oyster Card, Comfy bed clean room
227227,Best Western Palm Hotel, Nothing of note, Although the staff weren t hugely friendly per say they were extremely helpful which is all you need really The bed was amazing as was the shower All you need in a room 
227228,Best Western Palm Hotel, Naff hairdryer Very noisy at about 1 am due to people returning to rooms Not hotels fault but soft closing doors would have helped as lots of door slamming , Friendly staff clean and comfy bed Fridge in room was welcome 
227229,Best Western Palm Hotel, Having our meal and my partner had finished his meal and the waitress took his plate before I had even finished the second evening they didn t want to take our plates and the third was the same waitress from the first evening and again she took his plate before I had finished , Breakfast in the room was lovely Clean towels everyday 
227230,Best Western Palm Hotel, Room very cold all the time until you call and beg them to heat it a little bit Then in the middle of night you should wake up and call again to ask for heathing, Nothing
227231,Best Western Palm Hotel, The showers were extremely cold no matter what time of the day or night you seemed to use them , The beds were so very comfortable and the rooms were a very adequate size
227232,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, Decided to book this hotel due to it s location which was convinient for a night out in Camden It s within 15 mins walk to Golders Green tube station but if you don t fancy fresh air than there are buses available Hotel itself was very clean Room also clean but not spacious Just enough room for a luggage Staff extremely helpful Thank you 
227233,Best Western Palm Hotel, My only complaint is the vending machine It didn t have the most basic drink water , The bed was a bit too soft but clean The hotel has had a very nice refit The corridor had ramps which could be highlighted better as at night The auto lights take time to come on 
227234,Best Western Palm Hotel, The night we ate at the restraunt there was a problem in the kitchen we could hear shouting Our main course was served before our starters and overall was very very poor Hopfully a one off otherwise this place is in trouble , Great bathroom Good staff Comfortable room 
227235,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, Staff were friendly helpful and polite room was comfortable and lovely and warm would stay there again train station about 15 min walk and only about 30 min on tube to central London Only thing we didn t eat at hotel as prices were same as in central London so we ate out 
227236,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, The staff at reception were extremely pleasant and helpful The room was clean and comfortable But it was because the staff were so nice that I would stay again 
227237,Best Western Palm Hotel, That there was a lively party that we were not informed about My partner was told it would end at 12 00 and it didn t it ended at 12 20am , Room and hotel it s self was lovely and the shower was really good 
227238,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, The facilities available were extremely welcome 24Hr bar free access to the fitness centre May not be of use to everyone but to have the option was good to know 
227239,Best Western Palm Hotel, Bathroom had a drain like smell , Excellent staff at reception Friendly attentive and professional They provided tube directions and map printed out a theatre e ticket and helped me with the phone in the room as it was switched to do not disturb 
227240,Best Western Palm Hotel, Traffic so I recommend taking a speaker for ambient noise or earplugs if you don t need an alarm Bed was fairly comfortable but no premier inn Hotel not much to look at outside , I was in an exec double Room was really nice Lovely big shower They have sky which I didn t use but cool anyway and a nice big tv Black out blinds Couple of bottles of water and decaf coffee in the room Safe if you need it Free parking and plenty of it Most importantly I got a great night s sleep with no disturbances 
227241,Best Western Palm Hotel, Maybe including a breakfast in the price but no biggy, Was a lovely stay great location and had really nice staff and a really nice clean room Towels changed and room cleaned daily to 
227242,Best Western Palm Hotel, Oh where to start Mattress was this incredibly soft foam that you sunk into and it was really quite uncomfortable after a while Corridors were quite dangerous I felt They had random stairs in the corridors with lights that turned on to motion sensors but by the time you get to the stair the light still wasn t on I stumbled a few times View from the bedroom The side of a building Pretty poor Heating in the rooms I ve stayed in many many hotel rooms over the years and never had to faff about with the heating in the room It was absolutely ROASTING in the room at night and I tried taking the temperature down Didn t work About an hour later woke up again and opened a window still nothing At about 5am woke up again played with the AC unit and couldn t get it to stay on to blow cold air so I phoned reception who were able to sort it from their main control panel Horrible night s sleep Nothing in the local area Hotel s situated in a residential area and that s really nothing else around Tube station proximity Poor Nearest tube station is a mile away , The staff were really quite friendly and helpful That s about the only positive thing I could say about this hotel 
227243,Best Western Palm Hotel, The parking was a little difficult with the hotel full and arriving relatively late we had to find parking on the road which wasn t easy , The hotel is very modern comfortable and clean The staff were very helpful 
227244,Best Western Palm Hotel, Staff are very rude and slow customer service is inexistent waiting time at check in was 1 hour waiting time for fixing the Safe Cash Box was 45 minutes while the guests came to pick us up and waited in front of hotel in a car got locket out of the room twice because they annulled our room cards because we didn t pay for one bottle of water at the bar we told them to put the water in the room charge etc etc bad experiences never finished and every day was a challenge in dealing with the staff and management of this hotel who have zero clue about customer service Location is also a disaster Avoid this Hotel if you can because there are plenty of other better hotels in London for sure at affordable prices , Not much really
227245,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, Room was lovely clean comfortable with the added bonus of sky Good location Golder Green tube station within walking distance or bus taxi if preferred so access into central London was easy
227246,Best Western Palm Hotel, Beds too small we pulled the mattress off the bed and slept on the floor it was a lot more comfortable then Shower door didn t open fully and not enough shampoo etc Breakfast was nice but wasn t kept hot enough under lamps so half way through already cold , Dinner was really delicious and great value Staff were really friendly Location was great for what we were there for Internet plugged in was really fast 
227247,Best Western Palm Hotel, Woken up early in the morning to the fire alarm going off Only got a few hours sleep Staff did apologies but said there was nothing they could do , Perfect location polite and knowledgeable staff Were also very helpful to order us a taxi 
227248,Best Western Palm Hotel, You can t pay bus ticket with cash so better take Tube but it is not near You can walk there or take short ride with Taxi , Really nice room Easy to get there and out of London 
227249,Best Western Palm Hotel, condition of the room and the parking I also think for the price people are paying breakfast should be included , Room was reasonable but to expensive for what it was Parking was bad on the Saturday night due to a function But I was informed that guest s did not have priority over people that were not staying but were attending the function and was told I would have to park on one of the surrounding streets This I thought was poor considering I had paid 174 pounds for a 2 night stay whilst my wife was in hospital and considering I have used this hotel on a regular basis over the last 18 months and have always found it good 
227250,Best Western Palm Hotel, That there was a wedding party going on downstairs which kept us awake Would ve been nice if we were informed that there was going to be loud music playing when booking so we could ve booked to stay somewhere else and actually got a nights sleep , That there was sky with all the channels in our room and the shower was very nice
227251,Best Western Palm Hotel, the glazing didn t stop the majority of road noise and the Air conditioning was very noisy leading to a disturbed night, The hotel was clean and the staff welcoming with good links to crickelwood train station the room was well equipped and the large double very confortable
227252,Best Western Palm Hotel, Bit of an issue with billing and charging my card without my permission still ongoing , The standard double room is large and generally comfortable Restaurant and bar menus are reasonable and food is served quickly 
227253,Best Western Palm Hotel, Location 20min walk to nearest tube far from central London and on a busy main road Room was overlooking garbage bins Shower didn t work properly and bathroom smelt a little funny Layout of the hotel also a little confusing Bar very small if there s a large group of you Wouldn t recommend going if you re with a group of friends Local area not very nice Nearest shops about 10 min walk too , Room Service Sky Sports HD Clean Rooms 
227254,Best Western Palm Hotel, New part doesn t feel as new as it should Parking can be very tricky if you re late and the bar doesn t have much choice, The gym is essential for us and there is free parking Rooms are a good size with a decent size tele and the bed is huge 
227255,Best Western Palm Hotel, The hotel is on a really busy road very noisy traffic Upon arrival the window in our room wouldn t close so the room was absolutely freezing We asked a member of staff to take a look and they were with us within about 5 minutes to resolve the issue The staff couldn t have been more helpful my biggest complaint would be the rock hard pillows and ridiculously small bathroom the toilet was squashed between a wall and shower not the nicest of spaces to be in Like I say the staff we had the pleasure of dealing with were brilliant although I feel the hotel could do with an update , The room was clean at least 
227256,Best Western Palm Hotel, Phone wasn t working had to ask for room service from my phone They were very kind and call you back And shower was very weak in the morning to the point it stopped , Very big room Lovely bed as well Staff very kind and hotel has great conditions 
227257,Best Western Palm Hotel, It was difficult to get into the car park I told staff at reception when I was headed there and how long it would take me to arrive but they did not monitor my transit and I stood outside the car park for several minutes fruitlessly trying the intercom which apparently did not work I had to leave my car in front of the gate and walk back to reception to ask them to open the gate The bed was lumpy and not up to normal acceptable standard The tv sound was off The was no indication on the phone how to call reception when I wanted to get someone to fix the tv I had to hunt around for the number The shower control was hard to decipher it was engraved in monochrome metal partly occluded from sight and was very easy to miss The check in staff did not note I had paid for breakfast and I was challenged by the breakfast room staff who asked if I wanted to pay I already had The car parking and breakfast altercations were therefore quite embarrassing even humiliating moments not a good indication of customer care , staff were helpful and efficient in dealing with lost property return when I left my mobile phone charger in the room it was returned to me efficiently 
227258,Best Western Palm Hotel, One of the beds was a little lumpy If you arrive late it can be difficult to park in the car park Nearby parking in road was available however , Good value and convenient Breakfast was very good and staff helpful 
227259,Best Western Palm Hotel, The staff during check in made things very awkward during conversation Had to lease with 2 receptionist at the same gunshots to check in Also although I had arrived at the specific time of check in they still had to check if the room was ready Also had specified a double bed but as given two singles pushed together , Everything was as expected and was certainly happy Love the on site car park 
227260,Best Western Palm Hotel, Parking is almost impossible far too few spaces expect to be 5 or 10 minutes walk away The bathroom smelt badly of drains Never got the hang of the heating aircon it seemed to keep switching off Only public transport nearby is the 113 bus , Quiet nice shower beds comfortable Breakfast quite nice 
227261,Best Western Palm Hotel, 1 Very few allocated parking spaces for the hotel 2 Executive room wasn t as big as it was in the picture 3 Better sound proof Windows , 1 Sky Tv available 2 Good bathroom shower room 3 Helpful staff enjoyed room service
227262,Best Western Palm Hotel, The Sat nav took us to opposite side of the dual carriageway using the number , Excellent place comfort large rooms Room service was very prompt Nothing was to much trouble Easy access to public transport
227263,Best Western Palm Hotel, Nothing more than satisfied with the cost and quality of our room , Staff were very helpful on phone and gave us information about transport taxi links etc We booked a triple room and were impressed with the size of room and facilities couldn t fault it Had dinner in restaurant and a very good breakfast in morning 
227264,Best Western Palm Hotel, People being allowed to smoke at the only Entrance available so we had to inhale all the smoke as we entered or left the hotel Also we had difficulty getting into the hotel one night due to having a big van just on the entrance this was left all night and was a fire and safety hazard should a person on a wheel chair required access it would have been impossible or a child s baggy for that matter , Friendly staff well situated for our needs Is well equipped and not to difficult to find Breakfast was very good also
227265,Best Western Palm Hotel, Being in room 205 next to 2 air conditioning units outside the window Someone had smoked in my non smoking room in bathroom , Location for next morning business meeting Value for money overnight spot Sky channels available
227266,Best Western Palm Hotel, My daughter and partner were in room 123 They were constantly woken up through out the night by the phone ringing The numbers which showed up were 009 and 011 We spoke to staff the next morning and apparently someone else had the same problems The stay was a present for my daughters partner for his X mas present as they went to see a show on the Friday This unfortunate incident spoiled the break for them , We were in room 220 and the room was comfortable and quiet 
227267,Best Western Palm Hotel, The walls of the rooms were as thin as paper and we could hear everytime someone walked past our room The hotel was very noisy and we found it difficult to sleep The breakfast was very poor for 12 95 each , The room was spacious and clean The staff were friendly 
227268,Best Western Palm Hotel, Problem with water coming through light fitting in ensuite shower room Lighting disabled no hot water unable to give us another triple room Asked for full refund and was given this for a one night stay , The staff were friendly and helpful apologetic about state of ensuite shower room and that we couldn t have another room Beds were comfortable 
227269,Best Western Palm Hotel, Location is easy enough to get to by car but is not ideal to get into central London as the nearest tube station is a 15 20 minute walk I had also enquired about an upgrade or a complimentary drink from the hotel as I was celebrating 5 years with my girlfriend I did not receive any feedback from the hotel which was unfortunate I understand it is not required nor expected but I felt it would have been good to at least hear back which would improve their customer service , The hotel was modern and extremely clean Staff were friendly and helped us with any queries Unfortunately we didn t get to try the restaurant but it looked very good 
227270,Best Western Palm Hotel, Is in the middle of nowhere for food or seeing anything, Comfortable rooms very quiet great showers has a tiny gym but at least still a gym good presentation
227271,Best Western Palm Hotel, Booking com said this hotel was near Finchley Central which is not true and meant that we had to get a taxi to and from the tube stop The nearest tube to this hotel is about a 20 30 min walk Our door key didn t work when we arrived nor did 2 replacements The staff suggested that we just ask someone from reception to come up with us and let us in every time we wanted to get in I asked for a different room however and we were eventually relocated to a different floor However in the second room a lamp the shower door and the extractor fan was broken , The room was clean and the bed was comfortable 
227272,Best Western Palm Hotel, Had to change rooms as dreadful smell in 1st room 2nd room pleasant but very dark not enough lighting phone didn t work and hard to get temperature right on shower hard to get cold water to work so bath far too hot pretty bathroom mirror but also too dark to see to put on make up or husband to shave , Comfortable bed and very clean 
227273,Best Western Palm Hotel, I got woken up at 6 45am then again at 8 45am and again at 10am I wrote an email of complaint and spoke to guest relations they couldn t offer me anything suitable except for a cup of tea or coffee I said to speak to a manager he said he s already spoke to the manager and they can t understand why I received these phone calls at these times This was very annoying because it was my day off I ve stayed at a hotel to relax I got in from a night out at 3am I wanted to sleep and just continuously got disturbed it was unacceptable no form of reimbursement was offered or anything which I was really unhappy about I could ve stay at any normal cheap b b and received the same outcome, The cleanliness value for money
227274,Best Western Palm Hotel, The website says parking available and no need for reservation But upon arrival I have to parked off street with 20 minutes walk away from the hotel at my own risk The bath room does not have instant hot water for shower The first time took us 12 minutes before the water got warm for my child to have shower The second time took 15 minutes before the water turned warm Although it said in the hotel that it is wifi free there is no access to the wifif from the room and my mobile was blocked from free access I could only use my own network It has very poor parking facility poor supply of warm water for shower and no access to wifi from the room , Newly furbished 
227275,Best Western Palm Hotel, The bed was extremely uncomfortable with springs digging in all night The room was cold Very little parking , The staff were friendly The bathroom was clean

227277,Best Western Palm Hotel, The only thing I didn t like was in my room was a little fridge with glasses in these glasses were not clean and looked like they had been left there for quite some time , The hotel and staff are lovely We arrived to early for check in but the lovely staff were happy for us to leave our car in the car park at back The room was big comfortable and with free parking and only 60 for the night who can complain The hotel also let us leave our car in the car park the next day until later when we were ready to travel home Very reasonable prices compared to other hotels and free parking unlike other hotels It s only 20minute walk to tube station or can walk 5 minutes and get a bus which takes you straight to the tube station There s a shopping centre about 3minute drive away and a 24 hour tesco so the location i would say is good The hotel doesn t look much from the outside but once inside its lovely 
227278,Best Western Palm Hotel, We booked a double room which was obviously a twin with the beds together which was fine apart from the fact that we had two single duvets instead of a large one to cover us both , Staff were very helpful especially about the local area tube station etc Hotel was clean and pleasant Good breakfast 
227279,Best Western Palm Hotel, I arrived and the parking was full and I was told to drive some distance away and park on the road This was at 10pm and I had my baby with me who is just over 5months There was a parking space being blocked by a car so I asked if it was not possible to locate the guest taking two spaces so I could park They tried to find the guest but in the meantime someone left so I was able to park The supervisor did not offer to help me bring my luggage in even though he had seen my baby I struggled myself and checked in I requested a cot but on arrival was told they had been given away My bedroom had a twin instead of a double but I was moved when requested I was told my baby can have a quilt and pillow and sleep on the floor , The room was nice and warm 
227280,Best Western Palm Hotel, The staff had poor use of English and seemed unhappy Customer service and hospitality was one of the poorest I ve ever experienced no service with a smile kind of stuff I ordered a meal it never came after being promised it would arrive I went to bed hungry, The hotel was lovely the rooms were very nice and clean Fitness room a nice touch
227281,Best Western Palm Hotel, We had elderly family members with us and the walk although flat was a little far to the train station for one Next time taxi, Very modern and clean room with excellent secure parking well positioned for motorways and access to London via short train ride

227287,Best Western Palm Hotel, I arrived late evening and found parking was a problem with no Car Park spaces available Had to park in a side road In the room there was only bedside lights and no light over the Desk which made it difficult to work on my laptop , Overall a good value for money Breakfast was very nice with a nice variety of options
227288,Best Western Palm Hotel, having to wait 30 minutes for hot water to come through to room for shower each day , Mr Turk is the best hotel manager I have come across Absolutely nothing was too much trouble
227289,Best Western Palm Hotel, Elements of the hotel appeared to be in need of refurbishment Also poor lighting in the bedroom because of an overly economical policy to save energy Hotel fronts on to a very busy and noisy road , A very comfortable hotel with friendly and efficient staff 
227290,Best Western Palm Hotel, Very very soft bed A bit cramped parking , Good location for our purposes but probably not great unless you have a very specific reason to be on a busy road in the north of london staff were helpful enough parking free without height restrictions

227292,Best Western Palm Hotel, Not didn t like but it would of been nice to have a bath in the room very small point, The staff were extremely helpful On the second day our satellite wasn t working and by the time we came back to the room it had been fixed They also allowed us to keep our car on the car park while we went into London on our last day Lovely room basic but as nice as possible Location was ok 20 minute walk from the nearest tube 
227293,Best Western Palm Hotel, Pillows poor Car parking non existent but lead to believe had one for my stay had to park on residential road and carry luggage back and forth a long distance Told it was first come first served not as per booking com details Ground floor corridor tired Bit of a guess as to how to use 2 x handsets for TV Food slow and limited choice , Size of room Facilities in room good Room clean 
227294,Best Western Palm Hotel, We booked and paid for a superior double and only got a standard double hotel manager did little about it and with a lot of discussion he knocked off 20 Poor as we d spent over 300 in extras too overall pretty poor after what could have been great , The hotel in general was lovely food good and cleanliness great 
227295,Best Western Palm Hotel, Continental breakfast was expensive 9 for a slice of toast and a cup of tea not good at all the cooked breakfast was sitting for a long period and did not look appetising at all, Evening food was good room was clean however there was a lot of noise from people above our room also the shower was leaking and kept dripping all night
227296,Best Western Palm Hotel, The third bed in the room was not of the Same standard as the others The plumbing was irratic Trouble getting hot water The hotel is adjacent to a busy dual carriageway main road Parking totally inadequate with small area and narrow bays , Good value for three people Clean and comfortable room with a good choice of breakfast

227300,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, Room looked astonishing with a perfectly clean bathroom Staff were very friendly and helpful too Easy access to the property Service rating excellent 
227301,Best Western Palm Hotel, A little noisy next to a very busy road but that s what you expect I guess It s just a little to far from the nearest stations but ideal if you are coming down by car from the north as it is near to the end of the M1, Clean and comfortable hotel
227302,Best Western Palm Hotel, Location is OK but not great It s about a 15 min walk to Golders Green tube station or a short taxi ride Also there was large fan on a ventilation duct just outside our room which made some noise on and off so we could not leave the windows open for long These were the only downsides but you can t have everything especially as this hotel offers such good value for money Overall I was very pleased with the hotel , Recently refurbished hotel with very good facilities and helpful staff Good for venues in N London Very good sized rooms for London and very good value for money 
227303,Best Western Palm Hotel, Slight noise from refrigerated unit at 8 00am outside room Better to take advantage of bus service rather than tube , The hotel was easy to locate just off J1 of the M1 Very safe parking facility and we were able to leave the car there all day on the day of departure which was fantastic The staff were extremely friendly and helpful Rooms were spacious and very comfortable 
227304,Best Western Palm Hotel, Central heating pipes in the ceiling room 16 kept us awake most of the night No hot water Sunday morning for a shower Coach team left Sunday morning around 6 00 and woke us up probably where all the hot water went , Staff helpful Great location services to Golders Green cent London

227306,Best Western Palm Hotel, the bedroom was opposite the road and was therefore very noisy It was as if the road was in the room it was very unpleasant something should be made regarding the noice insulation , very friendly staff good restaurant nice breakfast free wifi and parking very well located
227307,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, The hotel over all was very clean the staff were very friendly with a good knowledge of the London and how to get about which helped a lot when it was the first time we have been away in London Over all the experience was excellent we will use the hotel again

227312,Best Western Palm Hotel, Room had a peculiar odour I couldn t shake off Room too hot Creaking sound when you walk or people walk above you , Peaceful and quiet environment 
227313,Best Western Palm Hotel, Unfortunately we had 3 rooms in the space of 3 nights due to unpleasant odours in both the first and second rooms allocated to us The beds in the 3rd room were a little too narrow for comfort , Well appointed hotel within easy reach of public transport Clean and comfortable and remarkably quiet given its location on a busy dual carriageway Excellent breakfast Staff friendly and helpful Unfortunately we had cause to complain about unpleasant odours in two separate rooms The staff handled our complaint well and on both occasions we were moved promptly into a different room Overall excellent value for money We would definitely stay again 
227314,Best Western Palm Hotel, Unfortunately there was a really dreadful smell of the drains in our room and outside our room which did spoil the stay for us , The staff were so helpful and the hotel very clean 
227315,Best Western Palm Hotel, Breakfast very expensive We thought it was included in our hotel cost but on arrival for breakfast found it was not double check first , Excellent location 2 minutes from the bus stop or 1 mile from the tube Good size room friendly hotel 
227316,Best Western Palm Hotel, Additional facilities lacking and very limited late night food options Lastly I went to have a drink at the bar there were 4 people total there 3 at 1 table with full drinks and me waiting for about 45 minutes with nothing , First off excellent wifi coverage nothing will irks me more than wifi available and only in the far corner of the room Staff helpful and told us how get around easily because of the distance 
227317,Best Western Palm Hotel, It was quite hot in the hotel , The bedroom was very comfortable for the price the breakfast was excellent and the staff all helpful Car parking facilities excellent very good value for money in London 
227318,Best Western Palm Hotel, Noise from other rooms was pretty clear through the walls but wasn t anything too bad but would depend on who they were location is pretty dull and on a busy main road but the actual the actual hotel was good, Very clean and modern Was a good distance away from underground and taxis were cheap to and from and easy to find

227321,Best Western Palm Hotel, quite a far walk to the train station, lovely interior bed was so comfey nice spacious room very clean hotel really friendly helpful staff able to check in early without hassle 
227322,Best Western Palm Hotel, We were staying above the function room and there was a wedding taking place No one informed us of this when we checked in The base on the music was too loud and prevented us hearing each other or the tv The music went off at 12 however the incessant noise from 8pm spoilt the second night and due to being on a corridor with the wedding party meant the return to rooms was noisy and we were disturbed until 1 30 am If we had been informed that the function was on we would have made other arrangements for the night as it spoilt the next day too due to lack of sleep We did not feel aggrieved at the wedding party in anyway we just wished the hotel had told us so we could make other arrangements , Location to the motorway Room very clean and well equipped Staff helpful
227323,Best Western Palm Hotel, There was supposed to be a 24hour bar but spirits were unavailable once the bar closed at 11pm I think that was the time If you returned after an evening out you couldn t get say a coffee with a brandy Threadbare carpet in bedroom , Room was very clean and in the main staff were helpful
227324,Best Western Palm Hotel, On a lighter side the only thing missing was a beach we had a glorious sunny few days hotel was a relaxing atmosphere in the guests bar area you step outside and I just thought where s the beach it was a perfect stay, Friendley atmosphere and a warm welcome and the staff helped with every thing we asked rooms were very comfortable and cleaned to perfection and the day after rooms serviced to a very high standard adequate parking space and travelling to the city by bus the stop was a minutes walk to it I can t think of one fault and this is good for me as I worked as a chambermaid in london for over eight years and ended up as a deputy head house keeper so standards mean a lot to me Definetley recommend to friends and family
227325,Best Western Palm Hotel, there was no draws to put ur personel things in we were living out of our case now that s ok if you are only staying a few days like ourselves but not good enough if you are staying longer women need draws to put things in and so do families with young children I would say this is a good 3star hotel but not 4star Cleaners need to clean in the corners of the bathroom, Good location but noisy road we had room in back of hotel which was quiet staff were very friendly would stay there again if the rooms were cheaper
227326,Best Western Palm Hotel, Only thing I found not good was the fried bread was very hard to cut but that could be down to us going for breakfast a little later, Had a fantastic stay the staff and service was excellent as was the food
227327,Best Western Palm Hotel, Didn t stay long enough , Helpful staff especially at reception Mr Turk Convenience of the bar and restaurant A bit out of town but worth the extra few dollars in a cab 
227328,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, The room was extremely good value for money large room with a sofa included which we did not expect and Sky TV some channels although we didn t use any of them the hotel appeared to have lots of facilities including 24 hour bar restaurant and fitness suite Ordered room service and it was quick reasonably priced and the staff member was very polite 
227329,Best Western Palm Hotel, They messed up our reservation and when we arrived they could not accommodate us and we had to wait for an hour before they could find a room The room at downstairs were too noise so we requested to be move upstairs Too expensive food and they add anoter 25 on top of that , friendly staff and clean room
227330,Best Western Palm Hotel, We had a generator outside our room which started around 7am on the first day and then when we took the first shower the shower tray flooded and we had to move room Nobody should have been put in this room due to the generator being right outside the window but they obviously chance their luck here as there is no way this has not been complained about before The property is also a 20 min walk from the nearest tube station and there are no bars or restaurants around I am not sure what constitutes a 4 star but I would not say this hotel is any better than any 3 star I have stayed in , It was very modern in the rooms 
227331,Best Western Palm Hotel, We had been told that a Parking space had been reserved for me close to the front door as I am disabled however on arrival there were no parking spaces and the car park was full so had to park in a side street and walk late at night to the hotel with our luggage and a small child and was advised I could go and move my car later in the night after a function had finished and they had left however that would have meant moving my car in the early hours expensive to eat at the hotel restaurant bar , The staff were very friendly and the beds Were comfortable and it was clean and tidy The free wi Fi was good too

227337,Best Western Palm Hotel, Nothing, Stayed here a few times previously and each time the hotel has been upgraded with more to offer and better quality facilities The free parking and easy access to North Circular and M1 is a great in balance with access to buses tubes to central London

227339,Best Western Palm Hotel,No Negative, The executive double was very large and well appointed The parking was adequate and secure The free wifi was excellent with no codes or login The hotel is a good 25 mins walk or 15 mins if you walk fast like me from the tube and there are buses nearby It is a largely residential area There are shops and restaurants near the station in Golder s Green If I wanted a hotel for London again I wouldn t hesitate to book this one
