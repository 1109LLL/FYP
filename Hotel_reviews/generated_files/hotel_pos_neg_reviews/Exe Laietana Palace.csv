478394,Exe Laietana Palace, THE ONE LADY IN BREAKFAST AREA WAS LIKE A MATRON AND SUSPICIOUS OF US TAKING FOOD CAUSE ON THE FIRST DAY I DID NOT KNOW I COULD NOT TAKE A MUFFIN WITH ME OUT OF BREAKFAST AREA THE MARBLE POLISHER DRILLER WAS A BIT OF AN IRRITATING ONE 2 DAYS WORKING OUTSIDE OUR DOOR THE TV HAD NO ENGLISH CHANNELS WORKING AND THE TECHNICIAN SENT WAS NOT KNOWING HIS JOB SO NEVER GOT TV TO WATCH ENGLISH BBC CNN NEWS OR SPORT, PROXIMITY CLEANLINESS VIBE PRIVACY
478395,Exe Laietana Palace, The room was relatively basic for what we paid for it However was clean and staff were helpful when required , The location was excellent walking distance to lots of the main attractions and easily accessible to many metro stations 
478396,Exe Laietana Palace, Nothing the hotel was excellent , Very conveniently situated walking distance to old part of city and port area The hotel was comfortable very clean and served an excellent breakfast with hot and cold dishes The bed was rather too firm for my taste but the bathroom was very smart On the whole it was excellent value for money and I would stay there again 
478397,Exe Laietana Palace, Actually my bracelet went missing so put everything in the safe cause the staff couldn t do anything and ofcourse the bracelet was never found, Breakfast AC
478398,Exe Laietana Palace, Room was tiny no more than 50 cm around the bed Tiny space to hang and store clothes Old fashioned shower telephone style shower head in narrow bathtub nothing like the photos of the modern showers bathrooms in the web site Cleaning was well below par, Location
478399,Exe Laietana Palace, We were first given a room on first floor facing the street Due to poor phonic isolation and dense traffic was difficult to get decent sleep The following day we were provided with a quite room at the back but when we went back from dinner we were shocked by the awful sewer smell coming from the shower too tired to change room Outcome an outrageously expensive place considering poor standing if rooms When we signaled this to the lobby attendant upon checkout no reaction mere indifference, Location is ideal to start a visit in the old city center
478400,Exe Laietana Palace, On surface room clean but corners filthy Tear in duvet cover Windows dirty inside and out Shower water went all over floor made it treacherous Breakfast only one cereal cheap cornflakes Had better breakfast in a 3 Poor complimentary products Had to ask for a kettle No tea coffee sugar milk offered Bathroom door edge and around handle dirty and sticky , Lovely staff Great location Comfy bed 
478401,Exe Laietana Palace, maybe have a tea coffee machine in the room better beds ours was slightly creaky if you moved the slightest bit wish they had spa gym pool facilities but without it still a great hotel , the location is great Via Laitenna is a prominent road in Barcelona city very close to the beach around 15 minutes walk local amnesties great food close by can walk to sites like barcelona zoo or arc de trimof in 20 minutes the room was lovely spacious and had a great open door window for the breeze to come in had air con aswell 
478402,Exe Laietana Palace, Bed mattress was really uncomfortable The shower area badly designed the water ran out all the time Not enough shower gel and no shampoo , Rooms were small but cost and nice chilled 
478403,Exe Laietana Palace, Nothing at all , The hotel is located on the Laietana 5 minutes walk to the seaside 5 minutes walk to Plaza Catalunia in brief it is very well located within the touristic heart of Barcelona The room was ok not so spacious but definitely not small The bathroom was clean and modern The staff sas helping and smiling The breakfast could be improved considering the price but still acceptable 
478404,Exe Laietana Palace, The breakfast was a terrible disappointment Powdered tasteless eggs and not so good sausages Fruit was fine Coffee was not nice and only available after 730am Needed earlier , Location The staff were nice 
478405,Exe Laietana Palace, As kettle in the room would have been nice in the morning, The views over the roman wall the beds were comfortable staff were kind when husband was unwell
478406,Exe Laietana Palace, The deposit of 25 euros in order to receive the room safe box key I was really surprised With this in this type of hotel It is the first time I gave a deposit to use a safe box and The worst is that while paying the hotel bill before leaving for the airport I forgot to return the key and get my 25 euros back I phoned from the Prat airport as soon as I realized I had the key but in spite I offer to send the key express mail from London and get back my money they said that they were sorry I wander how many people staying at the Exe hotel forget about returning the safe box key I think it is a must for the people at the reception to remind the clients about returning the key Another issue is the importance of having bottles of water available at no charge , The location the cleanliness the friendly personnel 
478407,Exe Laietana Palace, The windows don t close well and you hear the street very loud We complaint but they couldn t change the room There is no sound insulation between rooms and you can hear everything from the corridor The rooms are a little bit small , The fact that was a very clean and modern hotel close to everything 
478408,Exe Laietana Palace, The double room is too small to avoid the 2 floor too noisy and not enough day light coming in , The hotel is perfectly situated right in the heart of the Gottic district close to the port and numerous bars a supermarket is next door the open bus tour stop is 50 m across the street 10 min walk from the Catalonia square to take the shuttle to the airport Friendly stuff comfortable bed clean rooms
478409,Exe Laietana Palace, The breakfast could be a little more interesting At present it is ok but not exciting , Great little hotel in very convenient location Staff super friendly i called asking for a balcony which i was told was not possible as there are very few room with balconies but to my happy surprise on arrival i was given a beautiful room with view on old baqrcelona and two balconies Staff super friendly and helpful Everything was perfect Gracias 
478410,Exe Laietana Palace, The hotel fronts onto a main North South road through the city Parking was awkward even just to get out of a taxi and rooms on the front would be very noisy , The location in the Gothic Quarter near the cathedral was excellent and put most attractions of Barcelona within walking distance Our room was clean and tidy and looked out over the old city walls Breakfast gave a comprehensive choice although the scrambled eggs were pretty rubbery 
478411,Exe Laietana Palace, Shower stalls were set up kind of weird The fixed glass shower door was not secured to the sill allowing the huge glass panel to swing in and out which let water spill on the bathroom floor , Located right in the heart of the old city Barri Gotic Couldn t beat the location We changed rooms and got one that directly faced the old Roman Wall What a view especially when it is lit up in lights Concierge was especially helpful getting us taxis very tough during the rush hours and letting us know when we should be going to various attractions so we wouldn t have to wait in line 
478412,Exe Laietana Palace, There was no place to sit and have a coffee no bar Did not replenish the room I drank the bottled water first day and never replaced Had to ask for toilet roll The staff appear to be indifferent and the hotel needs some TLC as it is generally tired looking , The Location 
478413,Exe Laietana Palace, We arrived from Morocco where we stayed in a 4 star and were treated like royalty We arrived at this hotel hardly greeted not even a smile and the female manager there was just as rude I told the staff how my luggage had been lost they didn t even offer any help Didn t mention is there anything we can do There is a supermarket next door if you need toiletries Nothing We were then welcomed by our minuscule room where the bed was ridiculously springy old and uncomfortable Only to find nothing resembled the photos I complained and they said they had nothing available until tomorrow The next morning I was greeted by a lovely gentleman who apologised for everything changed our room and went above and beyond for us He even phoned he airline multiple times to track my suitcase What was interesting is the rude staff we had initially continued to be rude Besides this lovely gentleman and one other lady our stay would have been completely ruined And it was our honeymoon The hotel is extremely overpriced and is definitely not a 4 star If you are lucky enough to get the only two nice staff when you arrive you will enjoy your stay otherwise good luck I don t know how these people have jobs When we were leaving I said goodbye to one of the girls and she literally mummbled something back that sounded like a groan We will definitely be returning to this amazing city just not that hotel I was reluctant to write a bad review given the man went above and beyond to fix the damage those girls caused however when they Continued to be rude I thought I would hate for someone to experience what we did with them , Great location
478414,Exe Laietana Palace, Would have expected something a little nicer for the price , Very nice and comfortable room clean bathroom great location near Born and Barceloneta beach Really helpful and friendly staff Elevator was a plus 
478415,Exe Laietana Palace, The room is very small but also not comfortable and available amenities do not match 4star European standard We found live ants in the room or ants found us , Perfect location meters from metro and bus station in a middle of the old city and walking distance from many attractions
478416,Exe Laietana Palace, We think the price is a bit expensive and should have at least included breakfast It is a bit noisy since it is on a main road We could hear traffic all night although we kept the windows closed , The room is small but nicely furnished and the bathroom is very functional and clean The staff are helpful The location is very central 
478417,Exe Laietana Palace, This hotel is rated at 4 star it deserves only at 2 3 star It s an old building with old design and old furniture even an old safe which requires EUR25 for a key deposit No fridge and no coffee maker only 1 staff working at front desk no restaurant poor breakfast menu which costs extra We booked this hotel because we trust the rating on Booking com the rating is flawed and the rate is a rip off I will report to appropriate travelling agency about this flawed rating which lures unsuspecting travellers to this facility We come expecting a 4 star hotel and left totally disappointed , Except for the location nothing else 
478418,Exe Laietana Palace, Badly insulated against street noise breakfast wasn t great random hole in the roof where there used to be a light rattling airconditioning fan, Central location very comfortable mattress
478419,Exe Laietana Palace, Too hot in the room Too loud in the night All notices from outside are super loud More than 500 for 3 nights I expected a better room for that , Location
478420,Exe Laietana Palace, The air conditioner was on heat although it was already hot we were at the beginning of April Maybe if we have spoken to the reception that problem could be solved But that wasn t serious problem , I m really recommend this hotel The room was pretty big and the design was lovely The location is excellent and also the breakfast Don t think twice to book this hotel
478421,Exe Laietana Palace, Every thing is awful the room hasn t the value of the money paid The hotel hasn t cooling system the AC system is working for heating only even in hot days when i asked the front desk for that she said you can open the window for ventilation that s was a hilarious answer I spent all the night thinking and confused between sleep in very hot room or open the window for some fresh air enjoying the traffic noise front of my window The TV cable wasn t working probably only one channel safe box is very old model it s open metal key The refuse to give me the barcelona FC package as shown in the hotel website I don t recommend anybody to book in this hotel I spent there the worst vacation i had ever , The staff was friendly and location is good 
478422,Exe Laietana Palace, It was very cold in the room and I really don t like the fact that they didn t have a carpet on the floor I could find hair from the previous bookings thing that I find very disgusting , The location is fantastic is in a great aria of Barcelona Staff was super nice and helpful We had a nice view from the window Towels were clean and the room was pretty 
478423,Exe Laietana Palace, Everything was just enough No more no less Beware of rooms on the first floors towards the street You will feel like the traffic is passing above the pillow of your bed , Average hotel in good location Very nice to be moved from first floor towards the street to a much more quiet room 
478424,Exe Laietana Palace,No Negative, Overall we had a great stay the hotel is in a great location the room was small but fine for 2 people clean and well serviced each day with towels bed linen etc the breakfast was good not a lot to offer on cooked food but a great selection of fresh fruit bread cheese cold meats cakes etc and good coffee the staff were also very helpful a good hotel at a reasonable price
478425,Exe Laietana Palace, Booked a double room turned out as two single beds pushed together After complaining they connected the beds and used double bedding the next day but still two individual mattresses Lighting in room was poor white LEDs do not provide cosy atmosphere , Within walking distance of old town and beach also very close to metro station 
478426,Exe Laietana Palace, The bar in the hotel wasn t working no explanation given On second morning the hot water for tea had a taint of chlorine so switched to coffee which was excellent , Welcome Cava which was welcome Super view from room and bed over Roman walls Bright airy room with double opening on Juliet balcony Firm bed very comfy Capacious shower enclosure with lovely big rainshower head Decent choice of continental breakfast and a good three hour breakfast window to allow leisurely start Central location and quiet at back of hotel 
478427,Exe Laietana Palace, The cabin of the shower wasn t being closed completely so taking a shower was a bit tiring so that everywhere didn t get wet We informed the reception about the situation but nothing could be done , Location is good Free wifi works enough Spacious bathroom 
478428,Exe Laietana Palace, The room was slightly small and the curtains let in a lot of light Add to this also that a lot of light came in from around and below the door to the room then the room certainly was not dark at night Although breakfast was until 10 30 I advise people to get there early as there is hardly any cooked breakfast left after 10 am and the hotel does not refill after the initial amount is taken by earlier guests Although nuts and raisins etc were provided for meusli the only available cereal was just kids cereal Coco Pops , The Staff were always very courteous helpful and kind It was my wife s 60th birthday celebration so I pre ordered for our arrival champagne and 12 roses to be in the room The hotel organised this very well and also put a Happy Birthday message to my wife as well So WELL DONE AND THANK YOU The hotel is perfectly situated for our favourite areas in Barcelona and also walking distance to the Barceloneto beach area Our room 410 had 2 windows with views on the old Roman walls and very little street noise 
478429,Exe Laietana Palace, All good The room was a little smaller than the photos indicated but still suitable for two people , The service at the front desk was fantastic The room was comfortable and clean with a lovely bathroom The location was perfect 
478430,Exe Laietana Palace, The taxi that they ordered for me when I left to catch the aero bus tried to bully me into him taking me to the airport and the fare increased by 3 Euro more than the same journey two days before and when I questioned this he informed me it was because I wasn t Spanish and he refused to give me my luggage unless I paid him what he wanted Very poor service, The staff were really friendly and helpful and the rooms were very clean and comfortable The location was perfect as it is equidistant between Las Ramblas and Barceloneta Beach 
478431,Exe Laietana Palace,No Negative, We had a very nice room right on the top floor of the hotel It was really clean and quiet with it s own little roof terrace Great location for exploring the Gothic Quarter and near the sea Close to the metro for everything else Buffet breakfast was lovely each morning 
478432,Exe Laietana Palace, Nothing great hotel to stay , The professionalism and courtesy of the staff They helped me in solving some request of information for my trip and visit The location of the hotel just in the center is amazing 
478433,Exe Laietana Palace, Scrambled eggs in breakfast are bellow average More toiletries should be provided every day We had to buy toothpaste after the second day Only one small bottle of shampoo was provided every day for two people it wasn t enough we had to buy a large bottle from the supermarket , Location staff s politeness and service room cleaness very comfortable bed We received a bottle of sampagne as a gift for our wedding the first night at the hotel it was really appreciated 
478434,Exe Laietana Palace, quite noisy with the bar at the back and the busy road but that cannot be helped and it didn t affect my sleep Could do with more English channels on the tv , Lovely hotel Clean and comfortable room Toiletries in room was an added bonus D cor was great and I cannot fault the location 
478435,Exe Laietana Palace, Rooms were on the tiny side beds are singles pushed together so most suitable for family or close friends not business colleagues Mattresses are firm and not the most comfortable Wifi is a little spotty , Location was perfect Staff was friendly and accommodating Within walking distance to everything Breakfast was a great bonus to the day Loved the windows opening out onto the ancient walls and having a mini fridge in room 
478436,Exe Laietana Palace, Very noisy not the hotel s fault though as inconsiderate guests I could cope with the busy road as knew about that when booked Damaged bathroom sink cracked shower leaked and obvious water damage to door Requested a double room but 2 single beds pushed together and very hard Bedside lights could not be turned off individually you turn one off they both went off not the best when one wants to sleep and the other person wants to read Also there were reading lights attached to lamps but again don t work individually or even independently of the lamp turn the lamp off and the reading light went off , The location was good for what we wanted to do 
478437,Exe Laietana Palace, The bed was quite hard Could hear a lot of movement from other rooms , The location and the lay out of the hotel We could come and go as we pleased very close to everything we wanted to do The room was comfortable enough also 
478438,Exe Laietana Palace, our room not all was next to a busy road so it was never quiet in de weekend at night , Lovely staff very clean rooms hotel I have been to other 4 star hotels but this one was one of the better ones Great breakfast And also a very nice location close to the metro 
478439,Exe Laietana Palace, There was a sort of generator sound above our room 5th floor that kicked in at about 7am on 1st day woke us up , Location and staff perfect and very clean Would definitely recommend
478440,Exe Laietana Palace, In the room did not worked air control so it was a little bit cold Towels had very bad smell they was clean but washed with some chemicals which smell bad , Locations in the city is very good 
478441,Exe Laietana Palace, I expected and more and better depending on the price and the pictures werw taken from a decieving angles in the pictures one would think that the hotel is so much better than it really is the staff were not very friendly and not very bad the staff in the restaurant were rude and without a hinch of smile , The location was good the good places to go were in 10 mins walk from the hotel And there was a street in 2 munutes walk where there were restaurants bars and supermarkets
478442,Exe Laietana Palace, The neighbourhood was not as close to historical monuments museums etc as we were led to believe Also they didn t have an ice machine Although they did provide us with little cups of ice No airport shuttle although one is indicated on the site , The staff spoke English we don t speak Spanish and were very kind and helpful I left my reading glasses behind and they arranged to have them couriered to me in Rome Loved the staff Room was well laid out reasonably sized for Europe 
478443,Exe Laietana Palace, We rented 2 rooms The one at the front of hotel had terrible road noise The other at the back had a nice view of a Roman ruin but the floor was dirty and gritty in the bedroom and both were small rooms with not enough hooks to hang bathroom bags Shower sprayed onto back wall then drained onto floor , Good location near the places we wanted to visit and to the metro Beds and pillows were comfortable Breakfast was good Very nice and helpful front desk staff 
478444,Exe Laietana Palace, There is no carpet in the room so the floor was pretty cold Maybe it s not significant in summer when it s hot outside but we were travelling in January so we had to turn on the heating in the room and wear socks bring sleepers there no ones in the room The douche is insidious and may leak a little bit on the floor , Location is perfect in Barri Gothic amazing district The room is big enough for two we got standard twin being cleaned every day rather quiet Breakfast is delivious though we ve eaten there only once Hot water comfortable bed 
478445,Exe Laietana Palace,No Negative, The bed was so comfortable and the location the hotel was in was great In a beautiful part of the Gothic Quarter The breakfast was really yummy as well 
478446,Exe Laietana Palace,No Negative, The hotel is very simple but comfortable and centrally located The staff are superb extremely friendly helpful and efficient I will definitely return 
478447,Exe Laietana Palace, The rooms are a little worn out the photos published here must be taken a while ago We stayed at smoking room first floor maybe the situation is better on other floors Unless you get the super genius discount like we did check elsewhere The rooms in this condition are not worth the standart price listed here , Good location Great staff 
478448,Exe Laietana Palace, This place is called hotel but its not a hotel rooms are extremely small that one space for bed stinky lift and lobby staff were not helpful i actually felt cheated because this place is listed under hotels though its a hostel, Only location
478449,Exe Laietana Palace, The room that we got was a bit tiny but family that was across the hall on the other side facing the road had a better room , The location of the hotel was near a lot of shops restaurants and the port for cruises Personnel were very helpful and kind 
478450,Exe Laietana Palace, The hotel lacked the service level we are used to Having stayed in a previous hotel last year the hotel could have offered abit more being a 4 star that it claims to be , The location was good 
478451,Exe Laietana Palace, Room was old sparse and small View from the window was pretty bad 411 Breakfast was typical European and just so so , Location was really good in the Gothic Quarter 
478452,Exe Laietana Palace, the room service menu was very limited There is no outside space in this hotel however plenty of outside cafes in the surrounding area Metro access outside the hotel , The beds were great twin room clean and tidy I asked for a quiet room and this was provided The hotel is in an excellent location Breakfast was good and as a solo traveller the hotel felt safe and secure 
478453,Exe Laietana Palace,No Negative, Great location Just a few mins away from the marina The square etc were all within walking distance Staff were very helpful Amazing shower Perfect for a city break 
478454,Exe Laietana Palace, The subway ran under the hotel Every 10 15 minutes we would feel and hear it going by Other than that everything was fine , The location was great Walking distance to many restaurants shops and tourist areas 
478455,Exe Laietana Palace, Very small room no place to hang anything or put anything away only the barest of necessities no staff to help with luggage , Nice breakfast pleasant staff great location
478456,Exe Laietana Palace, Sercvice at all levels 6 days stay at the hotel 2 nights no sleep noise of the air condition you can hear everything even the neibourgh brushing teeth room was not cleaned when we wanted to rest at 2 00 pm one day they announced works from 12 00 to 3 00 pm on the water but at 10 30 am water was cold and looked loke coca cola fountain When you drop a word at the reception they don t do anything except getting angry This hotel is worth 2 stars maximum , Nothing
478457,Exe Laietana Palace, Shower tube seniors or anyone with leg problems getting over high tube not for you Shower door was terrible water got all over bathroom floor Lighting in bathroom not good for putting on your makeup Small lighting fixtures would be fine if LED lighting but isn t Was a comfortable setting other than that , Location was great as was the staff Staff very helpful in providing directions information on tours restaurants and other information when asked Very easy to navigate to different sectors of Barcelona from this location Not far from city center La Rambla the port and harbor area and many other important sites to see while visiting Barcelona Had a great room with a patio and table setting for two Great view of cathedral of Barcelona Not all rooms are like this Top floor room 607 
478458,Exe Laietana Palace, This is not 4 stars The most unfortunate part of the stay was that the bed was very uncomfortable , The location was great The rooms were small but it was enough space We had a room at the back so it was quiet The air con was also good 
478459,Exe Laietana Palace, Very cold marble floor but no slippers no carpets Many noises you can hear in the night how the water flashes in pipes how the metro trains go underground I guess it s better to ask higher floor to avoid that , Location is perfect The hotel is good value for money Very clean room and comfortable bed 
478460,Exe Laietana Palace, it s more a 3 hotel than 4 the sink was clogged it was a little bit chilly in the room and we couldn t turn the heat on , excellent location close to everything worth visiting in Barcelona friendly staff clean room
478461,Exe Laietana Palace, Would have been nice for breakfast to be included as we felt price was on the high side , Location excellent shower We had room 411 and it was relatively quiet Friendly and helpful staff 
478462,Exe Laietana Palace, Breakfast menu could be more diverse In my shower cell doors did not fully close , Reception girl had a beautiful voice Nice Cosy rooms with marble floor and high ceiling great location of hotel itself 
478463,Exe Laietana Palace, Cleanliness was poor I wiped the bathroom door clean as it was sticky The room was very small and cramped Had to pay a cash deposit for the safe key Barcelona is expensive and the decline of sterling has aggravated the value proposition I did feel however that the value here was at best average given the room size and initial cleanliness , Well located and the room was quiet facing away from the very busy street outside 
478464,Exe Laietana Palace, I use a power wheelchair and therefore looked for an accessible room suitable for for my needs I corresponded in email to make sure the room is suitable and asked whether it s big enough for getting around with a wheelchair They assured me that the accessible room is one of the largest in the hotel and the customers who has previously occupied it never told them that it was uncomfortable for a wheelchair Well guess what When we got there at midnight we discovered there are 5 6 steps at the entrance with some small platform to bring up the wheelchair The platform was too small and I nearly fell off it The chair was heavy so the platform banged on every step on the way up The room it self was dull crowded and tiny not AT ALL suitable for a wheelchair user There was no way for me to get into the bed in a comfortable manner My care giver had to pull and me from the feet in order to transfer me from and into my chair The bathroom was tiny as well and I could hardly manage in and out with the shower chair I asked the receptionist whether the hotel was really 4 stars because I couldn t see anything there that s worth more than 2 5 In the morning after a sleepless night and a dull breakfast I complained to the manager and told him there was no way I could sleep there one more night He was decent enough to call other hotels around though if he were more decent he wouldn t have charged me at all for the first night and not declare he had accessible facilities in first place It was total misleading that ruined my first night and day in the city After several hours luckily he found another hotel right up the street with full accessibility wonderful service AND it came out 100 Euros less for the remaining time Good riddance , Location 
478465,Exe Laietana Palace,No Negative, Rooms are small but we ll appointed with comfy bed and awesome trendy showers Staff super nice and helpful Location next to Roman Wall perfect Like it s on a main Street so you don t have to haul luggage down the old narrow streets 
478466,Exe Laietana Palace, Nothing , Excellent location Very clean and fresh smelling hotel Friendly helpful staff Lovely comfortable room We did have the best room in the house apparently 
478467,Exe Laietana Palace,No Negative, We were very happy with the hotel Staff were very accommodating and friendly The room was compact compared to the hotel we had just come from the night before but it was nice to have a full double bed instead of two twins pushed together and the bathroom was well appointed The location is great close to the beach some great restaurants and the Ramblas Catalunya 
478468,Exe Laietana Palace, No possibility to watch on demand movies which is nice after a long day visiting sites and walking around Only news channels and a disney channel in English I ordered the room long time ago and asked for a quite room but did not get it it should have been possible, The location even though the room was to the side of a busy street
478469,Exe Laietana Palace, The room was extremely dirty and dusty after cleaning the bed linen may not have changed I was itching for days after my stay then It deceased after leaving the room I was afraid I got some parazites on my skin this should be adressed definitely , The staff was very helpful and quick location was excellent 
478470,Exe Laietana Palace, The breakfast had a really poor choice It would have been helpful to if things were labelled as vegetarian e g The cheese and pastries Also the scrambled egg was horrible and served every day Not much variety , The view of the room was lovely and also we were given a spacious room which was very helpful as we had a 15 year old with us The location was excellent really central 
478471,Exe Laietana Palace,No Negative, I believe this hotel is in the Gothic Quarter It has a fabulous location within walking distance to Las Ramblas the beach restaurants shopping post office banks if you need an ATM and money changed metro station and some tourist sites and activities Hotel offers breakfast It s 15 minutes away by metro from La Sagrada Familia Some very excellent restaurants within walking distance including Gilda s and Milk Highly recommend Very accommodating staff too 
478472,Exe Laietana Palace, The room was too small Bed was uncomfortable Overall it was ok but I am used to having more space in the room Also the bedside lights were not working properly,No Positive
478473,Exe Laietana Palace, Sometimes the WiFi didn t work in our room , Staff were very friendly and the hotel was fantastic The hotel is ideally located and the room was nice the air conditioning was great 
478474,Exe Laietana Palace,No Negative, Staff were very accommodating to my requests after reading other reviews asked for room away from the lifts with views of the Cathedral and next to each other as it was my son s 21st Birthday Rooms 309 Twin and 310 Dble were perfect Rooms clean really comfy beds I have a bad back and great walking distance from beach Las Ramblas etc as my Mum can t walk too far 
478475,Exe Laietana Palace, Nil Tea n coffee facilities in room although at reception street noise was quite loud , Location was best in Barcelona central to everything metro marina restaurants shopping perfect 
478476,Exe Laietana Palace, staff could be warmer and more welcoming tbh, overall for the location it was the best thing everything is like ONE moslty metro stop away 10 15 min walk which allows you to explore more your defiantly in the best loaction
478477,Exe Laietana Palace, The fact that the hotel considered that it was acceptable to give us a room with scratched walls an old worn out bathtub a hole on the wall badly covered with some plaster and not even painted a ventilation system that needed to be properly assembled and full of what looked like humidity stains around it a TV that did not work and a complete lack of sound proofing to the extent that we could literally hear the neighbouring couple telling each other good night all this for circa 145 EUR a night In addition the fact that upon complaint the staff could not get us into the remaining available room in the whole hotel because the door would simply not open , The location The fact that when I complained the staff solved my problem and gave us a new room even if not immediately The availability of the staff to solve the problem and the fact that the following day we were given a bigger room with complementary breakfast 
478478,Exe Laietana Palace, The toilet made a loud screaming noise whenever it was used I informed the desk but they said they couldn t send anyone till the next day No one ever came , Great location to explore the gothic district 
478479,Exe Laietana Palace,No Negative, Brilliant location for Gothic Area Cathedral Port El Born Tour Buses Restaurants Immaculately maintained helpful staff even have a scales to weigh your cases

478481,Exe Laietana Palace, Tea facilities in room would be good We also had an issue with leaking air conditioning, In good location room was comfortable and good selection for breakfast
478482,Exe Laietana Palace, However there was no support for shampoo or soap in the shower so my mom who is an old lady had to lean to pick her stuff on the floor TV channel directory was a mees it did hardly match the channels on TV Breakfast was not bad but definitely not at a 4 star level They offer you a picnic pack in case you leave before breakfast time On the day of our leaving we asked for a Wake up call which they seemed to have forgotten fortunately we woke up by ourselves Besides our cab driver arrived a little bit earlier but no one informed us There were no entertainment facilities at the hotel It is a good hotel but too expensive and felt more like a 3 star despite all the marble and nice furniture , Its location was perfect walking distance to the beach in the center of the old town next to a subway station The staff was nice The room was well cleaned beds were comfortable great bathroom

478485,Exe Laietana Palace, Rooms are outdated beds not comfortable you can feel the springs We needed to change rooms due to water from the shower flooding all over the bathroom floor This wasn t possible on the first day when we discovered the issue unless we were willing to take a smaller room without a refund On the second day of our four day stay they forgot to save us a room again so we needed to wait until the 3rd day to switch rooms They did offer to refund one night of my stay but i feel that half of our stay was more hectic than necessary due to this issue Worst yet is that the room we changed from was rented out again the same day and I highly doubt they had the opportunity to resolve the issue Manager Angela was one of the only employees who seemed to know how to properly treat a customer , Location was central breakfast was quite good for the value 
478486,Exe Laietana Palace, The hotel was good for the price but 1 A gold necklace disappeared from the room The staff claimed that no one found it although obviously the only person who could have taken it was the maid The staff made no attempt to help in locating it 2 Handed 1200 euro in cash to receprionist to pay for the room Turned away for a second and the receptionist claimed we gave him only 1100 which he presented back to us Pretty sure he pocketed 100 while we were not looking but we could not prove it of course Be warned , Location is very convenient

478504,Exe Laietana Palace, Sleep quality is terrible due to noise This place is fine if you are young and roughing it out but not a place for adults The first night Friday was a noisy disaster There was a bunch of young lads on our floor who kept making a ruckus I made a complaint at 11 30 pm when I had enough I did not pay a price of Euro 230 per night to endure this Hotel staff are nice but they really need to enforce noise rules better The doors are not noise proof and slam easily and loudly Imagine the noise all night It got better the next two nights but still left a bad taste , Great location good housekeeping room was spotless good breakfast easy access to everything tourist spots restaurants transport We got a nice room facing a monument at the back and the rear of the Irish pub next door The view was actually quite nice Wifi was actually good as its been upgraded This refers to previous complaints on this subject

478539,Exe Laietana Palace, It was noisy at night we had trouble sleeping also the bed was right beside a wall which for me was abit claustrophobic The biggest thing for me was that the reason I booked it was because it stated there was an airport shuttle bus however when I enquired about it I was informed there was no shuttle bus but that they could book a taxi for us we thought that was misleading , It was so close to the center of Barcelona
478540,Exe Laietana Palace, REALLY bad WiFi connection Bad sound isolation towards the corridor , Friendly service location The room was more spacious than I expected Although the view of an ancient wall is not what most people look for which is OK considering the hotel is in the oldest part of the city it is much better and quieter than having your window face a busy street Quiet on that side

478549,Exe Laietana Palace, my room was on the 6th floor next to the elevator which was very audible late at night and early in the morning the window towards an ugly narrow court opened onto a sort of balcony with dusty equipment and allowed little light to come into the room, Location is great the room itself was well appointed

478552,Exe Laietana Palace, The internet connection was poor the reading light did not work and could not be fixed until after my check out when I arrived over an hour later than the check in time my room was not ready the key cards systematically demagnetize and no I did not put them near my phone or anything like that the room cleaning shift was too late in the afternoon so that I had my room not cleaned for half of the day As I travelled for work and had to stay at the hotel working for hours all this was very annoying , The staff was fairly kind and tried to solve some of these issues but were neither very proactive nor committed to have guests needs well attended 
478553,Exe Laietana Palace, no power shower but the one we had worked fine there was really nothing that I actually disliked , The room was great was initially disappointed at 6 floor but views certainly made disappointment disappear Staff were absolutely lovely couldn t assist enough room was clean and adequately furnished Bed was so comfortable with lovely pillows Breakfast was good with plenty of variety
