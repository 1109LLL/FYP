234181,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, There is only hot water in the afternoon evening so prepare for a chilly morning shower , The wonderful welcome from Saeed and Ines at the Front Desk at breakfast was the hi light of our visit They are both fabulous and highly experienced in their London tourist knowledge This Hotel is lucky to have them 
234182,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Room was quite small but it had all that you needed on a short business trip , Friendly staff and situated a short walk from the tube station Good value for money and a nice selection for the continental breakfast 
234183,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, I didn t like that you had to go up one big set of stairs to get to the lift with a pram this wasn t ideal The breakfast area was very cramped wasn t enough space even had to share a table with another family and they had no high chairs available, Staff were extremely friendly Rooms were lovely and clean Breakfast was nice
234184,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Room a bit small for two people, Quiet room great location good wifi connection Room clean and tidy Tea and coffee facilities in the room and 24 7 at reception Good price for money 
234185,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Breakfast area a little cramped Got stuck in the lift between floors twice , Comfortable bed good friendly service quiet room considering the location 
234186,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Curtains didn t pull all the way over the window safe didn t work bedside lamps didn t work no laundry facilities or laundromat nearby, Staff was good location was excellent
234187,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The soft furnishings need updating in the room the shower tray should be replaced as chipped and notice in lift emphasised to say STAND WELL CLEAR OF THE DOOR AS THE LIFT WILL NOT OPERATE PROPERLY , The breakfast choice was good although hot water from machine not too clever and had to ask for table to be cleaned before sitting down 
234188,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Shower was always cold in the morning Not a great start to the day We were there for 4 nights , The staff were very friendly and helpful The location was lovely right across from the entrance to Kensington Gardens A great pub downstairs good food and a great selection of beers Coffee tea etc and lovely cold water always available at reception Good selection of cereals juice fresh fruit yoghurt toast for breakfast Safe in room at no extra charge in fact no extra charge for anything Fresh bottled water supplied each day and refill available at reception 
234189,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Bathroom neded more thorough clean very hard to find as it is not clear from the website that this is situated above shops there is a small sign we walked right past It is near the goat tavern if only the website said this , Comfortable nice continental breakfast aircon modern friendly staff
234190,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Cant understand how the hotel is rated four stars Quite basic Dining area very small No where to park to unload luggage Had to walk a distance , Staff very friendly and helpful Hotel clean 
234191,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, the only thing I didn t like was the spare pillows were stained no pillow cases and the shower dripped for several hours after use but these are tiny points on an otherwise really lovely hotel, Lovely breakfast comfortable room bed was lovely and it was in a great location All of the staff were very friendly too 
234192,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Cold shower in the morning was a bit disappointing but cannot fault anything else, Close to Kensington gardens Hyde park the Royal Albert Hall making it a great place to stay for any events Also the hotel is surrounded by shops bars and restaurants Even so we found it was very quiet during the night and beds were really comfortable to sleep on allowing a great nights sleep after our busy day out and about
234193,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Narrow steps besides always out of order lift Very tiny but clean rooms Needs better beds This is not a good place if you have a heavy luggage , Good location Nice Staffs 
234194,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, No hot water on the morning we left even though I had asked at reception twice and was assured it was ok I think I know when water is hot or cold The lift wasn t working we were on on the 4th floor The walk didn t bother us but anyone with large cases of disabled this was a no go , Situation was excellent right opposite Kensington Palace Gardens and Hyde Park The room was comfortable and clean 
234195,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The bar resturant is very small and if you go for breakfast at the busy times it would be difficult to sit down comfortably Be careful if you have mobility issues as there are alot of stairs and during our stay the lift was not working The rooms are not the biggest with shabby furniture and threadbare carpet in places the shower in our room was small when you re over 6 and 17st , Great location if you want to go to the Royal Albert Hall which is only a 10 minute walk away and close to the High St Kensington tube station Contiential breakfast was what you expect 
234196,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, No hot water for 2 days so i couldn t take a shower I complained 3 4 times and was told to wait 10 minutes or so whilst the boiler was being reset Over 1 hour i waited on Saturday morning and still no hot water so we decided to go without a shower and actually go out Sunday morning was exactly the same To make things worse the receptionist said that this happens a lot and it was down to the guests taking showers all at the same time it a blooming hotel and not a youth hostel And at 340 for 2 nights i expect to have running hot water Seriously annoyed and have logged a complaint with best western to get this resolved ,No Positive
234197,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Stair carpet was dirty and very worn in places This was the first thing you saw on arrival and gave a very poor impression Very noisy bathroom extractor fan turned itself on at 2 30am and impossible to turn off Take earplugs for the traffic noise if you are at the front of the building , Offered a room to use to change into travelling clothes when collecting my luggage from storage 
234198,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The lift had no interior light and a faulty door at reception level used once with the assistance of the receptionist but my wife was terrified and we used the stairs for the rest of our stay as even replacing the light was beyond them I can t imagine what a standard room is like as our Executive Double was so small that it was very difficult to move around the standard double bed Over 50 of the floor tiles in the small bathroom were cracked and the wash basin tiny The bed head furniture was broken the carpet was threadbare in many places including a ragged edge at the doorway What was described as a desk barely qualified to be called a shelf Facilities quoted such as i pad dock Sky TV etc did not exist Given that we were staying a few days after the Grenfell Tower I had concerns about the fire safety of the hotel which has only a single staircase from the only access at street level to the fourth floor I very much regret not giving sufficient credence to the many poor tripadvisor reviews , The continental breakfast was OK the air conditioning and wifi worked but that is all 
234199,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, A few little maintenance bits and bobs to be done in the room but nothing that impacted on our stay, Very friendly staff fantastic location and good value for money
234200,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The bedroom was tiny The bed stretched across the whole room meaning you needed to hurdle the bed to get to the wardrobe Very noisy , The staff on reception were very good and very friendly 
234201,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Room was an attic room with very little head room ended up sleeping the other end of bed due to the roof been so close to our heads Breakfast wasn t great not a great choose and disappointed it was more continental No hot food, Staff were very friendly and room was clean Location was close to lot of attractions
234202,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Rooms really small but ok for a night or two Untidy shower floor needs replacing Dodgy plug on kettle , Very helpful and friendly staff Great location to the Royal Albert Hall Great restaurants etc near by 
234203,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Narrow frontage and first impression going up the entry stairs is not good but once inside everything is done to a good standard Don t be put off , Friendly reception helpful and welcoming Good soundproofing in room facing busy road Discounted price was very good value 
234204,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Some people may struggle with the stairs to the property but wasn t an issue for us , Property was convenient to the Royal Albert Hall Continental breakfast was very good 
234205,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The wifi was unstable at times and wasn t a fan of the continental breakfast provided Cleanliness could be improved some stains were noted on the bedsheets and duvet cover Pillow was way too flat , The staff was very friendly and the location was near to the tube and shopping 
234206,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Was not advised where my room was I was just given my key and told my room number I had to find my own way to my room would be nice if you are told something like There is your key you will find your room on x floor but it was not a big deal really rooms are easy to find Stairs are a bit narrow , The receptionist was fantastic so friendly really looked after me on arrival The staff were very helpful nothing was too much trouble for them Perfect location for Albert Hall When we departed the receptionist carried my really HEAVY bag downstairs Big shout out to Ines
234207,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Air con would only go down to 19degrees in bedroom Stifling in heatwave Air con broken in Lounge dining room Breakfast food is bare minimum Egg boiler broken so no eggs No bread rollsSunday Monday Croissants and pains are not good quality Hotel needs update Has potential to be very good with some money spent on it , Large bedroom for 3 people Large shower room Excellent location for Kensington and buses tube to other areas 
234208,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Dingy room with ripped carpets broken shower door it smelt funny too It was supposed to be a Delux room not sure how it could be called Delux , location bed was comfy
234209,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel,No Negative, Our British Airways flight was cancelled we landed from NY and got stuck in the airport for 9 hours so we booked our stay same day at 5pm and got a really good rate Excellent location 2 min walk from metro station relaxing and cozy mood complimentary coffee and tea friendly staff We had a very long day ahead the next day so they happily offered us a late checkout Overall amazing experience partially alleviated our horrible journey with British Airways 
234210,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Rooms too small and air conditioning didn t work breakfast was a disgrace, We were moved to the Olympia hotel supposedly to a junior suite having 2 beds is not my definition of a junior suite air conditioning did not work
234211,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Small friendly hotel rather cramped but ideal for bed and breakfast when you have other things to do , Excellent for the Royal Albert hall and that area of town friendly and efficient staff Good restaurant next door and nice pub 4 doors up
234212,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, no hot water on the morning of 20 05 17 queried with front desk staff he apologised and said was to do with the night staff not putting the water on overnight No hair dryer in bedroom stated on room details there was one provided also queried with front desk staff and he gave me one to use, room was clean and comfy if a bit small
234213,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, room 206 a little small noisy due to air con plant outside windows bring ear plugs no firm bed pillows if you need support only soft room next to cleaners cupboard again noisy when cleaners in out , good continental breakfast free tea and coffee available all day in reception although no de caff tea which I drink bed very comfy perfect location for royal Albert hall
234214,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, We were due to stay four days at this hotel a good location but dropped it to two Each morning the showers were cold we did say but obviously a problem with the boiler ,No Positive
234215,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Worn threadbare decor and a tiny room up steep stairs Breakfast was stale croissants and pain au chocolate with just tinned peaches and mandarin oranges and cereal to go with them plus Nespresso coffee , Great location opposite Hyde Park and breakfast Nespresso coffee but not much else to recommend 
234216,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Double deluxe room was small and in need of a good update refurb Breakfast was included but not good Lots of steps up to room and house keeping left areas outside of the room cluttered with dirty bed linen etc until late in the day , Good location for what was needed 
234217,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Hotel is run down and rooms are extremely small The most uncomfortable hard mattress I ve ever slept on Breakfast was limited to dry bread and very small selection of other food , Great location 10 minutes walk to Royal Albert Hall and across the road from Kensington Palace gf
234218,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, My initial booking was cancelled even though I called in to indicate clearly that I will pay on arrival On re booking the room got and bed was too small , Very decent accommodation Staff were friendly and helpful Breakfast was great 
234219,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, We had no hot water for washing or showering during the whole stay 2 nights Informed the reception on several occasions they were apologetic and reset the boiler more than once but this made no difference The female on reception said she had only known this problem once but looking at the past reviews this problem has been on going in certain rooms since March Have emailed the hotel and understand that my letter has been passed onto the management team but had no reply yet I have a provisional room booked in October but will keep it like that until I get a suitable reply Would also like the front door secured at night as any one can walk in off the street and head towards the rooms without any questioning as the reception is on the first floor, The locality of the hotel was good for transport links and the Royal Albert Hall The room was ok in size for a couple of days The breakfast was adequate Reception staff were friendly and appeared helpful
234220,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The bed is really really small necessary because the rooms are so small Also not so much hot water , Location is great and staff was nice and helpful 
234221,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Rooms very small and very noisey at the front of the hotel No hot water Breakfast was underwhelming Very overpriced for what you get , The staff at reception were friendly and helpful
234222,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Th hotel needs to be renovated the carpets are wearing the decor drab and the rooms are on the small size The en suite was to small difficult to wash and on the day there was no hot water, The staff where friendly and the location for what we required was fine other than this see below
234223,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Breakfast croissants were stale when we arrived but the waitress did go out and buy fresh ones Glad we didn t breakfast early as that would have been all that was on offer , Such a perfect location Portuguese receptionist so friendly and helpful buses right outside the hotel couldn t fault anything 
234224,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The bathroom was a disgrace neither my partner nor myself dared to have a shower as it looked really unclean the base of the shower was badly chipped in numerous places and the grouting was filthy The sink tap was also very grubby Whilst the room was a special deal I do expect a decent sized room you could hardly move around the bed The fabric on the wall lights above the bed was coming apart and looked dirty The bed was uncomfortable and the mattress had seen better days , I m afraid that I would struggle to find anything that I did like about this hotel From the moment we went through the door it was a disappointment The only plus was a complementary bottle of water We avoided the breakfast 
234225,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, We booked in at 5 30pm and then went out for the evening arriving back at 10 30pm Next morning went for a shower to find that all of the towels that had been in our bathroom and had been folded up unused were no longer there Someone had come into our room in the evening and removed them Took 20 mins and two phone calls to reception for more to arrive making us very late Shower wasn t very clean hairs on shower floor Arrived for breakfast to find no soya milk or gluten free bread which had been requested on booking Hotel said that this information hadn t been passed on So no breakfast Not a great start to the day , Is close to the Royal Albert Hall where I needed to be But hotel was very hard to find 
234226,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The furnishings were rather tired and needed updating The room was very small but adequate for a one night stay The lift was not working and we were on the fourth floor which was quite a lot of stairs to climb , The location was excellent as it was in walking distance of the Albert Hall The room was at the back of the hotel and so we could not hear any traffic noise despite being near a very busy road Breakfast was included but it was very limited in choice 
234227,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The beds were not very comfy and there was no high chair for my child to sit in at breakfast although we did advise we would be coming with a 1 year old , Location was fantastic
234228,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Room was tiny Shower tray scratched very badly noise ALL night from a boiler or air con don t know what it was terrible nights sleep , Nothing much 
234229,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Could do with some work to bring it up to standard Had to use a hand to hold the shower whilst washing with the other as it was broken Towel rail too hot my husband burned his finger Extra chair bed alongside bed so no side table and unable to use bedside light Big comfortable bed but bedding too small just about reaching the sides of the bed and no more , The location 
234230,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The continental breakfast was very poor Had a 4 slice toaster with only 1 side working for all of its guests Gave up on toast in the end Croissants dry and cold Bathroom very dated , The location was amazing
234231,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Carpet was tired cracked tiles in the shower room noisey a c and the bed was too small , Room facilities Staff during breakfast were great helped and were attentive 
234232,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Smelt strongly of shake and vac Bedroom had little moths in it Very poor ventilation , Fantastic location close to shops and Royal Albert Hall and park Friendly staff 
234233,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly helpful staff great location for the tube and places to eat really close just right for our short London stay The web provides all the pictures so you can see what your getting and know where to go 
234234,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Room and bathroom very pokey Shower had big cracks in basin Air con not working so had to open window and was very noisy We were asked for 10 when we arrived as a deposit in case we left without paying for drinks We had problems getting money back next day and were initially told that they could not find the keys to the cash box We have never had to give a cash deposit before, Close to Royal Albert Hall
234235,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The top of the main outside window was slightly open making the room slightly cold and letting the noise from the main road into the room as the double glazing did not stop this This did not stop me getting a good nights sleep and was brought to the hotel s attention to be dealt with for the next guest , There was plenty of choice for the continental breakfast Reasonable size room Heated floor in the bathroom Well located for the West End and Holland Park 
234236,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, the rooms were tatty with ripped carpet and damaged furniture and damaged shower tray I felt dirty being there the entrance to the hotel was very off putting dirty and quite dark, only the location and price
234237,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Small room for the solo traveller globally a little bit too expensive for that kind of hotel , It s a good place in a great area Easy to reach nice staff and breakfast 
234238,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Room was quite dusty and shabby Hot water ran out both mornings of our stay and seemed to be a regular occurance On contacting reception problem was rectified but we had to wait 15 20 mins for water to get hot Annoying delay to start of our day , Location was excellent Everything we wanted and more Continental breakfast very nice and plentiful Bus stop right outside hotel Underground station 10 mins walk away Several good restaurants nearby 
234239,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Lift not working properly could have been an issue for my elderly parents Small room but adequate Full size basin in the en suite would have been good, Good location ideal for the Albert Hall Friendly staff Good Buffet Breakfast
234240,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Don t feel it is secure Anyone can walk in off the street get to bedroom floors without going past reception Stains on cushions on bed Duvet thin and too small for bed Dregs of shower gel in dispenser should have been replaced Hairdryer missing No lift to 1st floor reception Lift to 2nd floor broken V narrow steep stairs easy to slip when carrying luggage , Location opposite Kensington Palace and close to Royal Albert Hall 
234241,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, For the last two days we have had no shower as there was no hot water Room 201 We complained and they said it would get fixed the same day It was not Also the lift got jammed on our floor so we needed to go up to the next floor and walk down to our floor with our heavy suitcases We are pensioners and it was very difficult I think we are intitled to a refund Especially as we had no hot water This was a real case of not caring nobody cared less And this was supposed to be a Best Western Hotel Very very unprofessional ,No Positive
234242,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, No hot water for showers No full English breakfast toaster was broken and the cereal was out of date breakfast was poor, The bed was comfortable and wifi
234243,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The double bed was a little hard for us but some like it like that , It was a nice hotel a bit tucked away if you blinked you d miss the entrance but overall a good London hotel and very well situated for the Royal Albert Hall only a few minutes walk away from it A nice hotel clean rooms and nice staff very friendly The room was very nice we had the junior suite it was well laid out and suited our group of three perfect with a comfy single bed in the alcove section 
234244,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Tiny room No place to move if you put your luggage on the floor One of the mornings there was no hot water I think they had to reset the heater So please make a call to the reception if you have such a problem Slow lift but even having a lift in such a narrow and old building is a nice surprise , Cute little room refurbished with modern decoration Clean A bit too tiny though Kind and helpful front desk staff 
234245,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The bed was extremely uncomfortable honestly the worst 2 nights sleep I ve ever had in a hotel with it being a 4 rated hotel I expected a lot better for the price we paid The shower was very grubby and there was no hot water on the Sunday night All in all I wouldn t return to this hotel although it s in a great location , The location was fabulous for what we needed the staff were friendly and helpful especially when we got stuck in the loft 
234246,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, No complaints with the standard of the hotel But be aware staying here is only really a viable option if arriving by public transport as parking anywhere near would be insanely expensive , Within easy walking distance of High Street Kensington Tube station and Royal Albert Hall which was ideal for my visit Good buffet breakfast included Room was comfortable and well equipped 
234247,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The croissants were extra soggy and one of the three daeven though we were half way through our breakfast a humourless woman started taking things away at 10am on the dot like the butter bread and ham etc however the hotel was clean and tidy and well run ,No Positive
234248,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Some sloppy mistakes like no shampoo in bathroom on day one no large towels in bathroom on day 3 dirty linen left in bedroom on day 3 They need to improve the sound proofing at the front of the hotel Avoid room 402 as it is too noisy to get a good nights sleep , Fantastic location rooms well equipped decent breakfast friendly staff

234251,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Our TV wasn t working Room a bit small but for one night was fine , Location to Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Palace Not far either from the tube so easy to get about London 
234252,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Bathroom could do with a toilet brush, The receptionist was very friendly welcoming with a can do attitude I have requested an extra heater as i suffer from cold extremities and the receptionist was very understanding and he brought me one Oh i loved the fact that i have found a bible in the room Really nice touch 
234253,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, better lighting in the bathroom mirror, Room was warm and comfortable albeit a bit small but as we were only staying one night after a night out it was more than suitable Room and bathroom were clean continental breakfast was sufficient I would stay here again 
234254,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Not much availability at the bar the breakfast was meant to be served till 10 30am But we got there at 10 20am and they had cleared the food , Beds were ok as we only spent one night room was clean with tea facilities bathroom was very clean 
234255,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Not very visible from the road and the entrance with stairs is not the best welcoming The carpet would need to be replaced on the stairs and in part of the room Sadly wifi was not working on my devices , Good position clean minimal room friendly and welcoming staff I did not have breakfast but it looked nice and with a good variety It s in front of Kensington Palace gardens which is great for a quick morning walk 
234256,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Can t beat a full English , Would have preferred full English to continental but what was there was nice Wish my daughter had gone to sleep easier 
234257,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, the bed was absolutely too small which was really unconfartable and made us slepp very bad Breakfast was okee but nothing special , location a bottle of water in the room 
234258,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The lift did not work for the three days we were there Had to carry a wheel chair up and down four flights of stairs Toiletries were removed from our room 2 hours after we arrived The spare pillow was shredded and not fit for use I have a pic , Excellent location Buffet breakfast was minimal
234259,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, A little overpriced considering its a very narrow and old looking entrance with no lift to the 1st floor where reception is so had to carry bags an suitcases up some very old stairs Brekfast was OK but very plain and the breakfast are to eat is too small breakfast server looked miserable all the tim we were there , The location and confortable rooms which were clean and had everything we needed 
234260,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Breakfast dissappointing no facility to heat croissants The rooms had a menu displayed but meals are no longer available a bit misleading, Location great and in general hotel very nice 
234261,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Breakfast rather limited and squashed for space but as it was inclusive in the price no complaints , Great place for a convenient stopover for shopping Albert Hall Comfortable room and bathroom pleasant staff 
234262,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Room to small for two people Bed not very comfortable Seemed to be a damp patch on wall Staircase carpet upto first floor dirty , Continental Breakfast was good hotel situated in good location for our needs Staff were friendly and helpful 
234263,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Staff on the Sunday really pleasant female staff member on the Monday morning was very serious ang looked generally fed up , The view and the room was nice and clean 
234264,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, would have been useful to know car parking could be found in the underground car park of the hotel literally opposite the great western , clean comfy room at a reasonable price 
234265,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, No toilet paper in shower room but we all make mistakes Room was a little small, Location close to Albert Hall and right opposite Kensington Palace well worth a visit 
234266,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, nothing, Bed was so comfy I didn t want to get up early but I had to otherwise I will stay in bed lol room was modern and clean I like the blue light on the floor in the bathroom I like that they have a dental kit quiet the staff was so helpful and friendly I like the shampoo shower gel body lotion smells good location was perfect everything you need is close very close to the park and the underground
234267,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, staff did not help us with our bags The bedroom was too small for two people at the same time The shower room was impossibly small No instructions on how to operate the shower The lift does Not go to the ground floor , The shower room was en suite
234268,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Small room small bed Shabby unfitting carpet Unpleasant smell in room Vacuum cleaner left plugged in on landing health and safety hazard Bathroom in need of a good clean Shower door not fitting well and very dirty, location good
234269,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Continental breakfast was OK but it was served in the reception lounge area with insufficient seating for the number of guests , Ideally situated for the Royal Albert Hall parks museums Plenty of places to eat and drink nearby 
234270,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Stairs up to reception from the street lifts available only once on the first floor Room was small had to edge round end of bed and mounted TV if sleeping on window side and you don t want to crawl over bed but ok for 1 night and had all required amenities , Great location for Royal Albert Hall concert easy walking distance along the main road or leisurely through Kensington gardens Breakfast continental included and more than adequate with plenty of choices 
234271,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The staircase leading up to the hotel is steep narrow and the walls need a fresh coat of paint The rooms are TINY No blowdryer or USB port This is good if all you need is a place to sleep for a quick turn around and not a place to rest or stay in , Location is very good Staff friendly Breakfast is simple but good Coffee maker in room is a plus 
234272,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Breakfast For 180 per night we expected far better Bed to small and uncomfortable Pillows awful and one had no cover on it , Room clean and well stocked and decorated 
234273,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Problems with the room 2 out of 3 nights no power Had to change room just for sleeping and showering No apologies nothing Too expensive for a room you don t even have room to put one bag , Bus stop Right in front 
234274,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Uncomfortable bed hard mattress Small room needed updating Broken shower holder so kept falling off Noisy road, Breakfast was the only good thing
234275,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Was not suitable for us because we had a baby and buggy which we had to carry up a flight of stairs as the lift is not on the ground floor Also the mattresses were noisy every time we moved which startled and woke our baby , Location was perfect 
234276,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Room service knocking on my door at 9am and 10 30am complete with cleaning supplies on the day I was leaving to see if I was checking out when check out is at 11am The curtains in my room didn t meet and so left a big gap I had to unhook them and join them up to the next curtain track to close the gap , Great location Clean Friendly receptionists Nice room overall Comfy bed Quite a lot of choice on the breakfast buffet 
234277,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Room very small for a double and it was difficult to get past the bed They do have better rooms But I guess someone has to have the smaller room and we were only staying one night , Comfortable bed Good continental breakfast included in rate Excellent location with buses outside the door and the tube station only 5 minutes walk Only 10 minutes walk from the Royal Albert Hall 
234278,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Shower door needed a bit of manipulation back onto its runner as it has seen some action although showeroom itself was clean and modern , Location for Albert Hall and shops could not be better Nice simple breakfast included Good firm bed I really liked this place for a cheap option to rest your head 
234279,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, It was cramped with uncaring unhelpful staff tired and not cleaned well Plastic bag over the spot where the smoke alarm was or should have been says it all It was good previously but don t stay more than a day or so now , Position
234280,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The entrance was a single door from the street immediately followed by a steep flight of stairs with no notices at the bottom to show where reception was By the time we found reception we had dragged our cases up the stairs not a good start , Room standard was ok for an overnight stay No frills but we were not expecting any 
234281,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Being in my mid 70s no lift on ground floor was very worrying for me luckily a very kind gentleman took my suitcase up 2 flights to the lift Room was really tiny had to turn sideways to get on other side of bed , I liked the location very much being a fan of the Royal Family I found it so exciting to be stood at the gates of Kensington Palace 
234282,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, 1st impressions count for a lot and the expense of a new entrance stair carpet would not be wasted While the Seraphine offers enough for a 1 night stay beyond a small breakfast room there are no facilities outside your room Had I not been traveling alone and on business these might have contributed to lower rating , Spacious clean and comfortable room real value for the price Location is superb Despite the name it is actually 50 yards from Kensington Park a little longer walk through Hyde Park to Oxford Street and buses into Trafalgar Square leave from across Kensington High Street Staff are extremely welcoming 
234283,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, One only small criticism was the extractor fan in the bathroom didn t work and so got a little muggy in the room after showers etc , Nice room great breakfast was just what we required at a good price 
234284,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The room was small I had requested 2 beds but we only had one That wasn t the fault of the hotel since we booked through an agent so I wouldn t fault the hotel for that, I liked that the room was very clean the staff were so nice friendly The location was perfect right near Kensington Station
234285,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Stairs as you entered , Good location well equipped room ensuite comfortable bed everything sparkingly clean tea making facilities Breakfast more than adequate pleasant lounge etc Staff very helpful 
234286,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The street noise Not so clean room and entrance staircase a bit of tidying would be good , Good location near to the shops restaurants and tube friendly staff
234287,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, First impression was that carpet was dirty and worn Gentleman behind the desk was very rude when we arrived and printed the signing in form and put it in front of me to sign while speaking to a taxi driver the whole time Breakfast was basic and coffee machine pretty hopeless for volume of guests One morning there was not enough tables for guest and some had to go away and come back later I asked the lady at breakfast a question and she didn t understand me so why do they put on the website that they speak our language Room was compact to say the least and not a decent light for shaving or makeup , The location was excellent near tube station and many tourist attractions
234288,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, First it is not 4 hotel I do not thik that it is even 2 hotel quality The rooms are very small There is not enough room to put the suitcases Hotel is pretty dirty and carpets are very much used There is not elevator from the grand floor to the reception which is located on the first floor Breakfast is very simple and always something is missing We asked for the fresh rolls which were missing and we have got few days old and totally dry Do not go there , Location is good just oposit Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace It is not from the tube station Quiet place 
234289,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, I booked the hotel in January had email and debit card confirmation on arrival presenting my debit card I was told I also needed ID why if so why was this not made clear at the time of booking I had to pay cash which I had some people may not it was made clear no cash no booking in not very good,No Positive
234290,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Something has gone wrong the rooms were not as clean as normal and maintenance seems to have stopped Not good broken toilet and dirty shower and both really easy to fix Come on management you are spoiling a good hotel , I love the location and the small compact rooms suite me very well Quieter than some of the bigger hotels in the area but expect some noise its London
234291,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Bit of a drain smell in bathroom but a couple of puffs of deodorant and gone , So central staff friendly and lots to have at breakfast and great coffee 
234292,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, As before just need some little upgrades, Nice clean room free water only downside quilts and pillows need updating that said it was only for one night Nice reception guy
234293,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, the single room could have been better configured as there was very little room at the end of the bed to get to the wardrobe kettle etc as the tv was on the wall at the bottom of the bed , Clean tidy and in a good position for where I needed to be the double glazing was more than adequate from the noises of the main road below
234294,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The room was very small and the bed far too small couldn t sleep The breakfast was very poor OK for a one night stay only , The location was great with lots of local facilities Fine for a short stay only 
234295,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Had to wait to check in for around 10 minutes as the woman manning the desk couldn t speak English but eventually the manager turned up and took care of things Also the lift seemed very slow , The hotel was ideally located for my purposes clean tidy and well equipped 
234296,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Nothing not to like, Excellent location close to the Royal Albert Hall 1 2 mile Across the road is a NCP 38 24 hrs cheap in this part of town High Street Kensington tube 1 4 mile away Room perfect Staff very helpful and courteous Value for money 
234297,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, There were no socket adapters in the room Once requested in the reception I was told to go and by one myself as they gave all adapters to other guest The room was tiny just to fit the bed , Really good location Underground station shopping area restaurants and other sight seeings within walking distance Good sound isolation in the rooms 
234298,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Having come in the room at 5am we needed to sleep before our journey However we kept being interupted by housekeeping to find out when we were leaving Next time we should use the do not disturb sign , Staff were very nice and extremely helpful The room was clean Breakfast was basic 
234299,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The hotel was very expensive for the quality of the room and it advertised for full breakfast yet it was cold continental breakfast, Didn t really like anything
234300,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The shower had what looked like a baby gate round it which was impossible to shut therefore it leaked all over bathroom floor, It was close to the Royal Albert hall
234301,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The hotel did not have 2 pounds change to return on my cash payment There are stairs between the street level and reception , The location Near bus stop Kensington high street has many good shops and restaurants 
234302,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, I stayed here 4 years ago but boy thing have happened since then rooms are very worn out the bed was small and not comfortable the shower was leaking in the bathroom and they didn t fix it during our stay worst thing was that we couldn t sleep well and that s the primary use of the hotel room right the doublebed was smaller than 135 centimeters in width and 180 centimeters tall my boyfriend is 190 so his feet didn t fit in the bed service and breakfast is also so so so overall really poor choice don t stay here , the location
234303,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Single bed uncomfortable poor reception on Tv as I only stayed 1 night didn t say anything about it lift not working part of our stay clean, Breakfast very good staff pleasant location good sin
234304,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, We stayed at the seraphine 5 years ago it was all very new some areas are looking a little tired now ir shower trays some of the carpets furnishings but overall a good hotel, It s a good venue great that the Ncp carpark is just opposite in the palace garden hotel
234305,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, be consistent with the continental breakfast I had to ask for bread on two occasions and there was only boiled eggs on the saturday other that that it is a nice little hotel , Excellent area staff very polite our room 101 was cleaned every day and fresh towels it is a little on the small side but we were not in it that long It is getting dated and a bit worn now ready for some tlc this is the third time here but may stop somewhere else next time
234306,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The old and a little scary lift and the stairs on the ground floor not comfortable when you have a heavy luggage, Very good location excellent staff and comfortable rooms
234307,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Being really picky the narrow stairs and carpet in the communal area was a little worn , Great value rooms modern clean and comfy I had a quiet room at the back and slept well did not here a sound from other guests 
234308,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, I booked a double deluxe room Was on the 4th floor LOTS of stairs to climb Nice sized room however went to use the bathroom and the toilet was full of someone elses urine As I went to flush it was clear that the mechanism was broken and someone had attempted to poorly cover up the damange as it fell back into the wall never to be seen again I called down to reception and the gent very quickly changed me to another room however this room was much smaller so small I couldn t swing a cat and no discount was offered As I was travelling on business I was carrying some important documentation went to pop it into the safe to find that it was locked the idiot before me had clearly not left it as instructed So the poor receptionist had to come up AGAIN to unlock it for me But again he did this quickly and apologetically From here the theme just continued Both sink and shower refused to drain and when I eventually got them going it was at a snails pace and the shower doors were hanging off the runners and almost impossible to open close The room was utterly freezing and duvet was far too thin for winter without extra blankets provided etc Went downstairs for some drinks with a friend to be met with a bar that had no tonic no ice no suitable glasses etc for the Gin and Tonic that I required Warm gin and lemonade in a brandy glass is what I ended up with I dread to think how the cocktails were produced The highlight for me however was the little guest in the bathroom Mr Cockroach I took great pleasure in deliberately ending his life in the white shower mat so that the staff had evidence of his existence In the morning while checking out I listed all of the above to the receptionist who like a darling gave me the drinks that I had had in the bar 15 or so free of charge as an apology As mentioned staff were exceptional but let down greatly by the disrepair of their building , Reception staff were exceptional Very helpful quick and apologetic Such a shame that they are let down by the disrepair and poor housekeeping staff Breakfast was basic but was included in the price kept hunger at bay until lunchtime and the location was great 
234309,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Nothing in particular if I had to find fault it would be that the corridors and stairways needed hovering , A fantastic deal through Booking com for a good quality hotel in a perfect location 
234310,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, People mentioned stairs but this was not an issue for me they are narrow and one flight even from the street to reception but worth climbing if you are able to , All lovely bar reception area easy to relax in everyone friendly continental breakfast everything fresh room clean nicely decorated modern with plenty of plug sockets in the right places D and location great pubs bistros on the doorstep D
234311,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Shower base could do with refurb as very chipped No lift to first floor where reception is though is one to other floors , First find the door opposite Garden Hotel Small but perfectly adequate and clean in a great location sums this place up 
234312,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Rooms too small and air con makes noise when you turn it on Not a good selection for breakfast and when you slept on the bed it felt like lying on concrete, Prime location
234313,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, We selected a hotel with parking because we were travelling with a car By this we understood thwre would be a secured parking at no extra cost When we arrived the hotel was difficult to find locatef on rhe main road difficult to stop and unload and it transpired that there was no car park I will not use booking com again as I feel we were mislead on this point and it caused us extra stress and cost On top of this it appeared that the hotel was a best western it was not clearly advertised These hotels are notorious for poor breakfast service and sadly the Seraphine lived up to its reputation If you want a cooked breakfast don t forget to order the day before The receptionist will not mention this Finally although the room was clean and we ll provided with TV and tea making facilities I m convinced I heard mice squeaking near my bed If the receptionist had bothered to ask me I would have told him But he didn t so I m telling the anyone who wants to hear it ,No Positive
234314,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Grotty entrance hallway and reception doubling as breakfast room Didn t feel secure entrance is a doorway Not sure if CCTV was in place , Location
234315,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The room was very small only really any good for one night Not really worth the 170 odd we paid , The room was very clean and the bed very comfortable 
234316,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, very old house rooms renovated but not looked after noisy room to the street very hard bed shower not working as it should very small bathroom Minimum of clean it s absolutely not worth the price breakfast very simple couldn t enjoy it , Good situation good transport facilities by bus and underground
234317,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Not great for guests with mobility issues though due to steep narrow stairs , Fantastic hotel secreted along Kensington high street Lovely room nice breakfast 
234318,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Rooms were very small and no lift from ground floor but these not a problem for us , Rooms have everything you need and are clean and comfortable Great location and staff were lovely 
234319,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Room was small shower pan was worn stair carpets were threadbare TV was small and only had Freeview service despite advertising to the contrary and many channels were missing which required retuning which wouldn t have been possible using the remote control provided , Excellent air conditioning underfloor bathroom heating powerful ceiling shower and a comfortable double bed Very fast wired WiFi Internet access and plenty of well placed power outlets Breakfast served till 10 30 at the weekend and check out at midday 
234320,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel,No Negative, Location near Kensington High Street tube station buses across the road Room for 3 was a decent size The room was very clean 15 each way for a Black Cab to West End
234321,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The Single Rooms are very small so if you suffer from claustrophobia think again about booking this type of room Luckily the room did have a large window so it didn t feel like a box Security in the hotel was lacking in my view as anyone can walk off the street and walk up the stairs to any hotel room Plus when my room was cleaned the door to my room was not shut properly and anyone could have walked in and taken any of my personal possessions When I complained to Reception all they did was say sorry and that it won t happen again you have been warned , This hotel does have a good location and only takes a few minutes to walk to from the Tube station Kensington High Street The room does have everything you require and look for in a hotel room from coffee tea making facilities to a good working shower and storage although not enough to put a suitcase away 
234322,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Wasn t a problem for me but the single standard room is quite small , Location and staff were fantastic The location was absolutely perfect The hotel is right on High Street Kensington and is minutes walking distance to the HSK tube Kensington Gardens Royal Albert Music Hall etc Its a boutique hotel and the rooms are nice modern and clean My room was quiet well equipped and even had a partial view of Kensington Gardens One caution is that the single standard room is very small and probably not a space you d want to spend a lot of time in The wifi was super fast One of the strongest connections I ve ever had at a hotel One of the best parts of my stay was my interactions with Anadit at reception He was professional sharp sweet and funny He did everything possible to make my trip nice I had a business meeting that I was a bit nervous about and he had me laughing so much that when I d left the hotel I d felt great The meeting went very well I plan to stay there again next time I m in London 
234323,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel,No Negative, Convenient for visiting the Royal Albert Hall Nice gentle stroll to the RAH Bus stop outside with easy access to Central London and St Pancras Breakfast continental but adequate Staff very friendly 
234324,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, No fridge Room had rubbish left in it when we arrived Fan in bathroom didn t turn off Lights in bathroom flickered Not enough plugs and not near the mirror Too much furniture so no room to get into bed Keys didn t work often Lift was exceptionally slow , Beds were comfortable
234325,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location very handy for visiting the sites of London We went to the David Gilmour concert at the Royal Albert Hall which is only about 10 minutes walk away
234326,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Difficult to find and when entrance found greeted with musty smell and threadbare stair carpet so not a good first impression Room very small and bed sheets badly creased and marked Breakfast choice limited and poor quality I expect much more for 150 per night , Location excellent Next to some really good restaurants 
234327,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Hotel is looking a little bit tired Too many frayed edges and dirty carpets Smallish room deluxe double was needlessly provided with a two seat sofa which was rammed up against the bed and was therefore unusable and made getting into bed difficult , Lovely position on Kensington High Street opposite an entry point to Kensington Gardens Very handy for the Royal Albert Hall Kensington Palace and Museums Good restaurants within walking distance Good wi fi connection 
234328,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Breakfast was a total disappointment very limited options The bad point of it being in a busy part of the city is that there s a LOT of noise during the night and you might not get your sleep Apart from helping with the suitcase on the stairs the staff seemed quite bad humored , Bedroom was very clean and comfortable and I don t mind it being small since I was just there to sleep Very well located and easy access 
234329,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel,No Negative, Very convenient location The room though small had all that we needed for a short stay and was very clean There was a problem with the lift and the staff worked hard to overcome any difficulty for us Very good price 
234330,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The two stories of stairs that you need to climb before you reach a very narrow reception area The lift that goes up from reception has no oxygen flow and moves at a pace slower than u can walk The rooms are extremely small and have no fridge facilities It s basically like staying in a shoe box Perfect for one level up from a backpackers place but never if you want to enoy your stay or if you are travelling with children Only good thing I have to say is that the staff were very helpful and welcoming , Location
234331,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Room quite small for 2 people Stairs to Reception would be difficult with heavy luggage , The price Amazing value given the location Breakfast included very good Room well appointed especially the bathroom
234332,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, If you are lucky you will meet only friendly and helpful staff most of them If you are not lucky you will meet rude staff so you will never stay again there , Excellent location 
234333,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The hotel smelled musty and is in need of a bit of a refurb in the public areas The reception is up a steep flight of stairs and would not be accessible for anyone with impaired mobility Breakfast was like something from the 1970 s and should be avoded, The location was brilliant convenient for Kensington High St and the parks also for the museums and the Albert Hall The room was air conditioned and clean if slightly basic We were on the fourth floor at the front and it was noisy but not unbearable Best advice would be to avoid breakfast which was fairly awful and to find one of the cafe s in the area 
234334,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, The only negative I can think of was that the reception was on the first floor and accessed by a narrow quite steep set of stairs which would be awkward if you had much luggage , A small but perfectly formed hotel Staff were really polite very attentive and helpful The room was small but very clean and the decor and fittings were tasteful and looked new 
234335,Seraphine Kensington Gardens Hotel, Staircase carpet shabby, Well fitted out hotel small rooms good continental breakfast lovely staff Difficult staircase to reception but staff will help Lift to other floors Great location Don t be put off by first impressions
