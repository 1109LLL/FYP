62503,Hotel Indigo London Paddington, We ve been twice in a short period The first time the double room was really tiny we could only open the luggage in the bathroom The second time the double room was PERFECT With the necessary comfort to move in the room and to manage our luggage which had several pieces at that time , The staff s friendliness and attitude towards finding a way to resolve any inconvenience was unique I would like to come back to this hotel not only for the location which is exceptionally favourable but because of the staff

62522,Hotel Indigo London Paddington, Incomprehensible design of shower fittings Delay in temp change of water so you can t tell if you have moved the mystery lever correctly or not Management should try to get a quick shower in there when exhausted from travel and in a hurry Hand shower handle is slippery chrome hard to control when hand is soapy Massive weight of many extra throw pillows and fabric decorations on bed requiring them to be put on floor nightly blocking window access if put beside bed These are annoying and space filling and of no practical use Make them go away Just buy pretty duvet covers Bed is too high for shorter guests You should not have to rappel down the side in the dark Test it with someone 5 feet high before you buy more I would still come back but , Staff Excellent and generous full English breakfast Size of deluxe room Closeness to paddington for heathrow express in morning no taxi needed

62530,Hotel Indigo London Paddington, The food at dinner was not great my husband s birthday burger had an over toasted bun to the point that it crumbled at the first touch of a knife and the chips would have been lovely if the kitchen staff hadn t mistaken sugar for salt although it was a possible attempt at a new trend in chip vogue sugary chips were not to our taste My fish was edible but the special batter was somewhat tasteless All in all not a great birthday meal for my husband but the service was friendly nonetheless , The room was really well equipped with free bottled water which was an added bonus the staff in the hotel were very helpful and very welcoming

62535,Hotel Indigo London Paddington, The lack of a business center but you can use for free the one from the other hotel operating in the same building but on the other street entrance , The building the rooms the staff the proximity to the tube cafes restaurants and the Paddington station connection to Heathrow by express train Basically from the airport to the hotel is a 18 minutes trip including the walking part 
62536,Hotel Indigo London Paddington, staff not particularly responsive Mostly I was extremely upset that despite an advance booking we were placed in two basement rooms with no windows The room amenities were good beds great etc but we should have been warned by either Booking com or the hotel that we were booking dreary basement warren like rooms In fact the front desk person told me that the rooms were light and airy That is a joke Were not given any compensation or any assurance that we would be listened to We stayed at two other hotels in the city during our stay and preferred both , good location near tube and Paddington Station in a nice neighborhood of London Room amenities are nice and the travel ipod that they give you very helpful 
62537,Hotel Indigo London Paddington, The breakfast was very disappointing I feel the food was off poor quality and for the cost of this hotel I would expect a proper buffet breakfast or full English not three little hot lockers all the utensils for these were also mixed up which made my partner feel very uncomfortable as she is a vegetarian and wasn t sure what had been used for handling meat The breakfast area was also very small with everyone being cramped up and struggling to move about We also found some of the staff to be very unpolite when we first go t to the hotel we were made to wait for 20mins before being helped and whitenessed some very rude staff , The room was very nice and comfortable both room and bathroom were kept very clean The shower was also fantastic with lots of room It is fairly easy to get to by underground and is only a short walk away from Paddington Station A couple of the staff where very polite and extremely helpful we found these staff to be the evening and night staff

62575,Hotel Indigo London Paddington, The room is called a standard queen If you read the fine print this means a bed can vary from 151 cm to 180 cm In fact ours was barely 151 and we were given the smallest room on the entire floor For the cost despite being in London it was just far too small and the bed was no bigger than a N American double bed Finally be VERY careful about billing I checked my VISA bill immediately on return and discovered that I was double billed once for the day I arrived when they are only supposed to take an imprint and again on the day I left I have written to the hotel to have one of those charges credited to my account , The room amenities are excellent Despite the room being not quite 100 sq ft they managed to pack in everything one could want Espresso lots of teas kettle hair dryer ironing board and more And the staff were always helpful and friendly The location is particularly good if you like being close to Paddington to take the Heathrow express and to visit Kensington Gardens among many other superb places of interest

62579,Hotel Indigo London Paddington, The room was much smaller than it appeared in the photo We were traveling with three suitcases and two carry ons and there was no room at all to put our luggage When a hotel is listed as four star you also assume there will be little ammenities such as a shower cap , The best part of the hotel was the location Very central to everything we wanted to do and an easy hop over to Paddington Station
