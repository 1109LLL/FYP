396824,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Nothing, Very good located hotel with pleasant and calm terrace good located hotel with pleasant and calm terrace for some rest after a busy day with nice view over harbour and Barcelonnette The swimming pool is more a big bath but Ok to refresh yourself Rooms are nice clean big enough for 2 person good bed and have all needed facilities While the front rooms have a nice view on the harbour it is a little noisy from the street We had a superior room on the back of the hotel connected with an internal open area very quiet room The breakfast is relative expensive but very good Everything what is available is not visible but the waitress is very helpful with informing you what you can get For sure we will come back 
396825,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, We had to stay in a nearby hotel for one night due to air conditioning problems but the staff were very apologetic and helpful in moving us, Breakfast was amazing Staff were excellent
396826,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, I didn t like the lighting in the hotel Black walls in corridors and bathrooms made it hard to see anything Too much contrast from a bright bedroom to dark bathroom It was hard for the eyes to adjust , Very comfortable beds location was great and staff very helpful 
396827,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, We thought 22 euros was way too much for breakfast , Loved the art in the hotel and the bed was very comfortable Toiletries included toothbrush and paste and even a shaver and gel in the bag as well as orange and cedar smelling shower gel body lotion shampoo and conditioner The shops and beach were a short walk away as were restaurants and supermarkets The plunge pool and seating area around the bar was a lovely place on the top floor and all the staff were very helpful including helping us print off our boarding passes and booking tickets to Sagrada Familia 
396828,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Die pool war einfach zu klein The swimming pool is just too small to swim , We did not eat there bcs there is plenty of more convenient places outside Hotel breakfast was however more luxurious it seemed and it was a buffet We were getting up too late too which is why we did not enjoy breakfast 
396829,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, one suggestion we have would be in regards to breakfast We thought we would try breakfast at the hotel on our first morning in Barcelona Sadly we were a little let down as the food did not impress Small variety on the menu and after ordering our hot meal which arrived after 20 min it was not a hot meal at all we were left with over cooked eggs and bland tasting food for 22 Euros per person it was not worth it at all we sadly didn t return to breakfast However this would not determine the fact of if we would return on not as we most definitely will Can not thank the staff enough for their professionalism and willlingness to help , My partner and I stayed at H10 Portvell for 4 nights from the 6th July 10th July 2017 We would like to write to management and advise them how pleased we were Absolutely blown away by the exceptional customer service from Joel at the front desk as well as the x2 ladies blonde and brunette hair sorry we forgot their names All 3 staff members went above and beyond so much local knowledge recommendations and advice about what to do in Barcelona So friendly and welcoming they made us feel like we were at home All 3 staff members have made our stay at H10 Portvell probably one of the best stays we have ever had in any hotel We are on an 7 week trip We can stay without a doubt this has been the best hotel so far 
396830,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup,No Negative, The hotel is well appointed with a modern low key boutique vibe which was what we were looking for The staff is very attentive and helpful and nice touches such as champagne in the lobby The hotel is in a perfect location to enjoy the port beach and easy access to major city destinations I will definitely stay here in for my next BCN trip 
396831,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Just found the bathroom shower area very dark But we managed Not much area to put your toiletries and makeup , The breakfast was very good Rooms modern and comfortable Loved the way you made things so special for my sisters birthday Staff very friendly and accommodating 
396832,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Not enough light in the bathroom shower and toilet , Very convenient location across the road from a hop on hop off bus stop and a few minutes from the metro station Also close to the redeveloped port area and boat trips and walking distance to El Born and the Gothic quarters Very nice hotel with very helpful staff Cava on arrival Beds very comfortable and very clean Lovely breakfast with plenty of choice Rooftop terrace a bonus and a great place to start the evening with a cocktail Also a short walk from Barceloneta beach 
396833,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup,No Negative, Lovely rooms with huge bed brilliant view from rooftop terrace great location near Metro station lots of restaurants nearby friendly helpful staff Within walking distance of Gothic Quarter La Rambla 
396834,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The breakfast was a little overpriced at 23 per person Especially when you re so close to bars and restaurants you d be daft to pay that price We didn t get breakfast at the hotel and even had breakfast on the beach one day which cost 25 for the two of us with the best view in Barcelona , The room was a lovely cool haven when the heat outside had reached heights of up to 34 The room had everything we wanted and needed including a view of the port although we were on the 1st floor so didn t get to see a lot of the port The trip was for my wife s 30th Birthday and I d asked for some champagne to be in the room when we arrived It was really easy to communicate with them beforehand to arrange and they d added some extra chocolate covered strawberries and chocolate cake along with a note to say happy birthday when we arrived in the room We also received a little note from the cleaner wishing my wife a happy birthday as shemust have noted the Birthday from the cards we put up The rooftop bar was incredible especially for the San Juan celebrations on the 23rd June the bar stayed open after hours and we had the perfect spot to have a glass of wine and watch the fireworks although we did get bitten a few times after sitting up there for a little while Overall it was a lovely stay and I d definitely recommend to friends and family
396835,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup,No Negative, The staff were incredibly helpful The roof top bar over looking the port was great The plunge pool provided much needed refreshment During my stay it was my birthday The hotel kindly left a cake along with a bottle of champagne to celebrate A great touch to top off a great hotel 
396836,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Roof top pool small but needs to be kept cleaner , Location with easy access to the old town cafes bars Marina Close to hop on hop off bus stop Pleasant roof top bar Quiet inside the hotel Friendly and very helpful staff 
396837,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, I would like a door on the bathroom Main criticisms are terrible lack of any storage 6 coat hangers and two small drawers for two people is no where near enough You have to live out of your suitcase the room would benefit from a chest of drawers at least Also the bathroom is SO dark we had very little outside light, Staff were very good extremely helpful and pleasant Excellent service room cleaned beautifully every day Great shower as long as you don t mind the dark Rooftop bar is very pleasant the room was modern and clean Great base for the beach and port area and la rambla is 15 mins stroll 
396838,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, I disappointed that the not inexpensive cost of a room did not include the price of breakfast which was available at an extra cost of 23 Euros The general decor of the hotel was very dated including the drab carpeting This did not warrant the relatively high cost of the hotel I booked the hotel after searching for hotels in Barcelona with a swimming pool The small plunge pool on the roof stretched this definition somewhat , Staff were friendly and helpful Bedrooms were spacious The location was also good 
396839,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Bathroom lighting was a little dark , Love room bath extras water cookies upon arrival cava upon arrival Staff was extremely responsive helpful Bed comfortable room quiet at night Liked upstairs bar pool area Location was great 
396840,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, A room with an outside window would have been much better , All Staff were extremely helpful The breakfast facilities and presentation has to rate as the best I have encountered 
396841,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, No USB port on wall socket for phone charging The room I stayed in was very small Sound proofing was not good at all and was woken up several times by door slamming water usage in other rooms room cleaning next door etc , Location 
396842,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Cleaning staff a bit noisy Walls a bit thin Sheets kept getting untucked , Staff were very helpful and friendly Roof terrace was pleasant Staff were very helpful Room was clean and wifi was good Location was very suitable to harbour and eating places 
396843,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, There was nothing we didn t like Was sad to leave, Our rooms were amazing with a Juliet balcony and beautiful views over the port We loved the layout of the room and the shower which was pure luxury It was great to have a Nespresso machine which was replenished every day as was the bottled water The breakfast had a good buffet variety and they also take your order for a cooked breakfast The hotel is clean fresh and smart looking and in a great location for the beach restaurants nightlife transport and much more Wonderful roof top terrace with a plunge pool but we didn t have enough time in our itinerary to spend as much time up there as we hoped Every single member of staff we dealt with was brilliant in every way and always had a lovely smile
396844,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Some minor work undertaken to roof top pool however we recognise this required completion prior to the peak summer season , Accommodation breakfast and cleanliness all first class Good position for city and beach 
396845,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup,No Negative, Very nice and warm welcome by the staff We have had a room with a nice view on the harbor with some attentions welcome drink chocolate on the room 
396846,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The only disappointment was with the view from my room I would highly recommend getting a room with a view which looks onto the marina , Beautiful view of the marina Port Vell from the roof top bar The staff were very helpful with guiding me and my partner to attractions and activities in Barcelona The location is perfect for going to the beach or walking to the city to go shopping or sightseeing 
396847,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, That the roof top bar was booked out for 2 events during Saturday and Sunday all afternoon till 7pm when we returned from a day out walking and exploring we had to sit in reception for a drink no access to the roof top pool bar this was why we booked so we could continue to sit and enjoy the view very disappointing and unhappy with not being told on arrival Notification was placed up in the lift and reception after we had left each day to go site seeing we did get given a free drink for the inconvenience but paid a more expensive premium for the facility that we could use till Monday Should not be advertised as having the facilities if they block access to the guests , Staff were brilliant and happy and extra helpful 
396848,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Nothing, Fabulous choice at breakfast All and I mean all members of the staff were excellent friendly welcoming and competent Best I have ever found and I have stayed in a lot of hotels 
396849,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, nothing, The room was great very clean and the bathroom was new The room had a nice small balcony you could see the harbour and boots The personal was very friendly and the bar at the rooftop was inviting The so called fitness room has only 1 ergo meter and one treat mil So nothing for people who want to do some sports Overall I would definitely book this hotel again Also the inner city and shops are only 5 minutes away 
396850,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Having to leave after such an enjoyable experience , We were very impressed with the staff and their attention to detail Every member of staff was courteous considerate and charming The roof terrace was an extra bonus
396851,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, We didn t have a view our room was on the inside the room was still nice though We just kept the curtains shut so we didn t feel overlooked by other rooms,No Positive
396852,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Taxi fare was really expensive not hotel s fault but just mentioning it , Staff went out their way to arrange an early check in for me and in general were extremely friendly 
396853,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The second room 101 on the ground floor is opposite the public toilets so that was not appealing or appropriate, First room we stayed was fantastic Hotel was very helpful in finding an available room for a second night Staff were exceptional
396854,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Get a room looking over the water if you can but its not the end of the world if you can t In house food is limited and rooftop pool small but we didn t plan to use it anyway , The staff were very helpful and the location is excellent beside the marina and on edge of Gothic Quarter Great value really enjoyed staying here great access to many prime attractions and restaurants Rooftop bar is a bonus for a drink with a great view The fresh sea air round the hotel is great after a warm day in city 
396855,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, That I couldn t stay longer , The staff are probably the best and most friendliest staff I ve ever experienced Made us feel really welcome and made our stay in barca all the more special
396856,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup,No Negative, The view to the marina from our balcony was excellent The bed was very comfortable and the staff were always on hand to help A very short walk from the Gothic and Ramblas area of Barcelona It s a very short walk to the beach 
396857,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup,No Negative, The hotel was very nice The staf was nice too but they had forgot to clean my room They had done the bed nice so I did not notice before late when I was going to bed that the room was not cleand up The sheets were not changed from the last person and when I went to the bathroom there was still a used toothbruch and used body shampoo and other stuff in the shower it looked like the cleaner had not been informed that the room had a new guest Its a shame because the hotel was actualy nice and otherwise clean The food was also good 
396858,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Nothing not too like excellent hotel if I had a comment it would be regarding how expensive the breakfast is I find 23 euros PP for breakfast very expensive in a 5 star hotel let alone a boutique 4 hotel , Excellent Staff was upgraded to a better room Very clean and amazing location 
396859,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Nothing , Everything location is the best at the harbor the beach barceloneta and the city center Everything is literally on your doorstep comfy bed Finallyyyy I ve found a hotel with a comfy bed in Barcelona even the big ones like 4 points Sheraton and NH hotels have hard beds Not this one comfy and big wifi worked fantastically on my iPhone and iPad bathroom is nice very big shower very nice staff accommodating and with a smile all the time near my favorite brunch place brunch and cake at sea I ate there every day very nice rooftop with little pool yes it s not big but duh it s on a rooftop Also comfy deck chairs on the rooftop I ll definitely be back here 
396860,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, No air conditioning in the the rooms due to it apparently being winter But the room was too hot and we couldn t sleep We asked Reception they came up put ventilation on but that didn t do anything Hence we slept with the door open which was very noisy and then let in mosquitoes and we were eaten alive that night ,No Positive
396861,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, I suggest offering better detailed maps of the Barcelona area especially of the Gothic District , Great experience The hotel was located right on the marina we enjoyed views of the yachts and boats from our small balcony The room was very clean and orderly The staff was very friendly and made some excellent recommendations for nearby restaurants And finally we loved the small rooftop it had a small pool and lounge chairs We used them to enjoy the wonderful Barcelona sun 
396862,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, To put it frankly if you need to take a dump your partner will get to experience the noise in HD since there is not a proper door on the toilet more a swinging door This can easily be solved by switching the shower or tv on , Incredible staff super friendly and helpful Amazing location Beautiful room Would definitely come back to stay here 
396863,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, dark design of a bathroom nice and impressive but sometimes not practical , great location generous breakfast very helpful attentive staff and welcome drink of Cava while checking in All what is needed to make your stay great either business or leisure 
396864,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The bathroom facilties were great but because it is opened planned it didn t feel like you got much privacy when going to the toilet Unless your really comfortable with who your staying with that was my only point that I wasn t to keen on Other than that minor niggle all was great , The hotel is in a great location by the marina Close metro links a short walk to la ramblas The hotel was lovely the staff couldn t do enough for there guests The room was clean enough space great shower comfy bed pillows 
396865,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Nothing Everything was just perfect , We loved our stay H10 is highly recommended The staff were helpful and friendly the room was confortable and clean Wonderful place to stay Barceloneta and metro few minutes walk from the hotel 
396866,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup,No Negative, Great location at a reasonable price Could easily walk to the Gothic Quarter Las Ramblas They had little cookies waiting for us in the room when we arrived and the staff at the counter were all very friendly 
396867,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup,No Negative, The attention to detail the champagne and birthday cake at breakfast for my wife s birthday and the champagne and chocolates delivered to our room later the same day made it extra special for my wife 
396868,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Nothing, Location is great It is quite central right on the historical port very close to the beautiful Barceloneta region and beach Walking distance to all tourist attractions Staff is very kind helpful very professional Their suprise for my birthday was so thoughtful and made me happy Room was comfortable Good design of bath WC Shower was great I advise a room with balcony from upper floors for the view 
396869,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Can t think of anything Maybe some might not like that it is so close to the harbour road but the traffic didn t bother me at all , Fabulous location rooftop terrace gives a direct view of the yacht harbour 
396870,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The breakfast was a little steeply priced The food was all good but the choice was just not there Next time I ll skip the breakfast and eat in town , The staff were extremely helpful and friendly The wifi connectivity and speed was excellent 
396871,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Lack of English channels on TV dark shower strange bathroom setup No kettle Not in centre of town , Sparkling wine on reception free sweets Friendly staff V modern decor
396872,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, I asked as a special request that we had a sea view as we were away for my husbands 50th birthday however the view overlooked scaffolding and two fully laden skips as building works were ongoing next door Breakfast was plentiful although a little pricey 23 euros each only had this on hubby s birthday Many cafes around offering croissants and coffee for under 5 euros overall would return again , Ideal location close to the harbour with many bars and restaurants within easy reach Room was clean and tidy with clean fresh towels and bedding on a daily basis Amazing bathroom with a large shower Staff were very helpful and informative 
396873,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Although the toilet cubicle has its own door there was no door between the main bathroom area and the bedroom meaning that you are fairly exposed when in the shower or drying off outside the shower if the person you re sharing with comes too close I was sharing with my mum and also often holiday with friends so they should really add a sliding door for privacy , The staff were all so welcoming and helpful The rooftop terrace was fantastic 
396874,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Breakfast at 23 Euros , Excellent location on the harbour front The front of house staff were excellent helpful and with always a smile on their face But the best part of our stay was the shower the best ever it complemented a very modern and stylish bedroom 
396875,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Temperature in room was too warm not controlled during winter months Nice room but looked out into other rooms so no view and no breeze to cool the room , Great friendly and knowledgeable staff Best shower ever Location was good for restaurants shopping and lots of sight seeing Really good breakfast with plenty of choice 
396876,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The room was far to hot and air conditioning was off for the winter Our room was to hot to sleep Opening the window allowed the mosquitoes in to feed Such a shave our trip was marred by this uncomfortable room and lack of sleep , Location was great close to city centre Room was well equipped and very clean Staff were friendly 
396877,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup,No Negative, This hotel has one of the nicest staff I have ever seen Everyone super friendly and nice The food is amazing there and the breakfast wow I was impressed Also love the roof top bar so cute Location is just amazing A 
396878,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Too hot Air conditioning not on as stayed in November but room temperature never below 23 degrees too hot to sleep , Staff very kind and helpful Loved the bathroom Loved the special touches glass of cava on check in free upgrade to standard room 
396879,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, the room we had had no view, The location was perfect Staff were very friendly and couldn t do enough for you Glass of cava on arrival Bottle water in room every day
396880,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Is was very expensive for what it is There was a lot of building work going on which woke me early very morning I complained but nothing was done , The location
396881,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Nothing, This is a class act Great modern hotel across from the Port Vell Great staff Unbelievable amenities The shower is to die for And don t forget the rooftop pool and bar Great breakfast spread Absolutely gorgeous 
396882,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Staff at front desk not the friendliest Rooftop terrace is a nice feature but not enough seating and bar service was fair Pool even smaller than it looks in photos , Near many restaurants modern rooms 
396883,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The roof terrace being let out to corporate customers and being 75 or 100 shut of to normal guest s , We enjoyed the hole experience from when we entered the hotel to when we left staff great clean and very tidy and location was great we did not eat there for breakfast or dinner as there are some great bar s cafes just outside where you can sit outside and people watch The one thing about this hotel was one reason for booking it is that it has a roof terrace with plunge pool and bar which turned out to be a disaster as most of our stay it was closed to general guest s as the management had let it out to company hospitality booking s gave us the impression that the normal guest mean s nothing to H10
396884,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Nothing really, The Location was excellent and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful We thought the Breakfast choice was really good and service top class Couldn t really praise this Hotel enough 
396885,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The hotel doesn t hav a gym eventhough they said so , The breakfast was a wonderful feast The hotel is close to the subway station and bus stops The view was wonderful 
396886,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, In Room service was very very poor I had a hamburger thought one can t do much wrong Meat was dry bread even more dry It came with chips instead of french fries don t know why Taste was old The salad was fresh but the dressing came in a tiny plastic bottle and tasted very very much after plastic The additional souces like ketchup came in small packages without perforation to open only with teeth This has been one of the worst in room dinners I ve had in a very long time I have to say this was absolutely inacceptalbe for a hotel in this price range rating , Breakfast was fantastic not only good choice but also good quality of products Location was good Staff was always helpful and friendly
396887,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup,No Negative, Attention to detail from staff was lovely a nice glass of cava on arrival and a surprise gift in our bedroom for my birthday Would definitely stay again Great views over the harbour too 
396888,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup,No Negative, The entire staff was very helpful upon greeting helping us with rental car and directions We came in early and they got us into our room so we could sleep since we took a Red eye 
396889,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Bathroom smelled musty Dark tiles so unable to see if mold present No luggage racks available with very limited space for 2 people females to put belongings , Staff were very accommodating Provided lots of directions to locations with maps and clear routes to get there Great that coffee and tea included in room Beds comfortable 
396890,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The basic rooms needed a bit of attention Plugs were coming away from the wall the shower door didn t close properly and there was a very damp smell when we first arrived but nothing major Room was still comfortable , Staff were very helpful and the breakfast was amazing Couldn t have asked for a better location great views from the rooftop bar Also received a complimentary bottle of Cava for the girlfriends birthday which was really nice of them 
396891,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Nothing, Lovely room overlooking marina Warm welcoming staff The shower was superb We didn t have breakfast so cannot comment We did enjoy the rooftop bar and some excellent cocktails 
396892,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The staff from housekeeping was not each day to clean the room , The position of the hotel close to the beach to the Port Vell to the old city to the famos Rambla The blonde lady from the reception and the boys from the top bar very nice helpful but don t all the staff with the same atitude 
396893,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Pool could be bigger and deeper but we had a great time , Great staff friendly and efficient Amazing location and rooftop views Smart and clean decor throughout with very comfortable beds 
396894,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, I can t think of anything Great experience , Very friendly staff Upgraded us for free to a room with a view of the water The property was great I ll definitely stay there again and encourage my friends to as well 
396895,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup,No Negative, Lovely hotel to finish off a great 3 weeks in Spain Good location to everything choose a room with a view to the harbour it is lovely Staff where very friendly especially Josu on our arrival
396896,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The roof top Terrace bar was not as good as last year the worst Mojito ever no RUM and service was so slow Last year we used the terrace very day this time only twice Room was not serviced until 6 00pm on one day and not service properly There had been a leak from the shower at some point and the vinyl was damaged would have expected this to have been replaced in a 4 star plus property , The excellent breakfast choice
396897,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup,No Negative, The pool and bar area was really nice staff very friendly When I go to Barcelona again I will defiantly stay there again I have also recommended it to friends
396898,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Nothing we will be coming back , Excellent location close to the beach and the bottom of Las Ramblas Very friendly and attentive staff which sorted out a small issue we had quickly and efficiently whilst keeping us informed Roof top plunge pool and sun area were fantastic and a really good place to relax and get away from it 
396899,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup,No Negative, Staff was exceptional They went out of their way to be helpful and accommodating One example of many We flew to Rome for the day came back around 1 00 am We wanted to sit on the terrace and drink a bottle of wine The terrace was closed but they opened not only the terrace but also the bottle of wine that was purchased elsewhere for us Need I say more 
396900,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup,No Negative, Staff were great we got married earlier in the trip and they laid a bottle of champagne choc strawberries and a hand written note on our bed on arrival to congratulate us 
396901,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Everything was perfect no faults, The hotel was first class The location was perfect for access to the beach and the city The rooms were a good size and very clean 
396902,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Everything was perfect , We really enjoyed staying at this hotel and I highly recommend you to stay at H10 port vell hotel if you decide to go Barcelona The staff is very welcoming friendly kind and helpful They are well trained and always show their excitement and happiness to help you The receptionist made a nice surprise for my nephew when he knew his birthday date He left a small peice of cake written on the top Happy Birthday Mohammad big bottle of juice on the bed and lovely words wishes card FREE The cleaniss variety food for a breakfast facilities and terrries are Excellent Thank you H10 port vell hotel for making my vacation relaxing and enjoyable 
396903,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, We paid extra for a room with a view of the port but in reality as we were on the first floor it was a view of the car park We were very disappointed by this as it was one of the reasons we booked the hotel in the first place , We received a very friendly welcome with a glass of cava and a token for complimentary drinks in the rooftop bar which was a nice touch The room was spacious and modern The bed was really comfortable The location is excellent A fifteen minutes walk to the beach or Las ramblas 
396904,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Huge group of hideously foul mouthed misogynistic and selfish English lads on a binge who made the rooftop bar a revolting place the first 2 nights after 10 minutes the first night we ran for it to a much nicer option but given this was one of the attractions of the hotel very disappointing They ran riot in the hallways until 4am Mercifully we had one night without them and the rooftop was transformed into a lovely spot for a drink , Great position with lovely harbour view noisy with windows open but not a big issue Comfortable bed and very clean room Nice rooftop area Pleasant staff Close to gothic quarter and beach many lovely squares and cafes nearby 
396905,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The lighting in the shower was a little dim but the shower head was huge and loads of pressure, Location was perfect close to the beach maremagnum shops loads of restaurants and hop on hop off bus A 10 minute walk from the busy Las Ramblas and close to the gothic quarter The hotel was spotless and the view from the roof terrace was amazing Lovely cocktails on the terrace which also has a small pool Staff very helpful Each room has a coffee machine but since we are not coffee drinkers they happily provided us with a kettle for tea Breakfast a little expensive but well worth it 
396906,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The Air Conditioning at the room was not working well I called the reception three times throughout the night and yet it didn t get fixed or cool down the room so we couldn t sleep all night in the boiling heat Yet I still paid a lot for just one night of no sleep at the hotel , The location was perfect by the port with a lovely room view The furniture and vibe at the hotel was quite modern 
396907,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Cleaner woke us up being very loud banging things around and Hoover banging against door and walls Then barged into our room without knocking 1st and done this twice the same morning A simple knock on door would have been better , The staff are very helpful and polite Loved the rooftop terrace fabulous views over the port Bedroom very modern and clean Coffee machine is good liked having an iron and safe 
396908,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Our room was very close to the roof terrace and the loud noises meant I didn t get to sleep until 12 30am on the Saturday night The other nights were ok , We enjoyed all aspects of the hotel that we used The staff were very helpful in getting us taxis and helping with our very heavy luggage 
396909,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Nothing in particular maybe more tourist brochures in a stand might be nice , Top location near trains city tour buses beaches old city right opposite harbour many nearby restaurants markets Comfortable bed and spacious room fantastic shower Helpful staff and complimentary champagne Great rooftop lounge bar area with plunge pool and views over harbour 
396910,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup,No Negative, The staff were super helpful and gave great advice on where to dine etc One staff member even walked us to a restaurant as the directions were a bit confusing 
396911,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Nothing could have been improved, The staff were absolutely faultless Amazing Could not have asked for better hosts I have stayed in the best hotels in the world the staff at H10 were unbelievable every single one 
396912,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, My only complaint is the noise I was on the 4th out of five floors and the Saturday night crowds outside were loud and stayed up basically all night This is not the hotel s fault it s basically what you get in Barca at night in the summer on the beach , Very friendly staff perfect location near the beach great price comparatively nice rooftop bar and pool
396913,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup,No Negative, The staff were extremely friendly and very accomodating They recommended some fabulous tapas bars which weren t expensive and ones which you felt the locals frequented Our room overlooking the marina was spacious and well kept The hotel is in an extremely central location between the Gotic Qtr and the beach We would recommend this hotel 
396914,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Lighting controls took time to work out Parking was 500m distant and expensive for a motorcycle, Location was excellent a few minutes walk from Born district and all waterfront bars etc very comfortable room with great view over marina Helpful and friendly staff at reception
396915,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Although the hotel was very well appointed our personal preference meant we did not like the dark colours around the hotel mainly the corridors , The staff were very helpful as my husband has an eye problem we needed a change of room one with more light The staff accommodated our wishes and placed us into a more suitable room The roof terrace was lovely 
396916,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The weather could have been better , I think this is a fantastic hotel We had a nice designed room with a great view of the harbour The location is perfect with top class tapas bars and restaurants just around the corner The breakfast is definitely among the best ever nothing was missing So I can strongly recommend this hotel if you re looking for the best in Barcelona 
396917,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Rather than a coffee machine in the room an electric kettle to give you the option of coffee or tea would be preferable , The Staff were excellent so helpful especially Reception staff Everything worked in the room although it did take a little time to work out how the lighting system worked 
396918,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup,No Negative, Offered complimentary welcoming drink on arrival Told room would be available earlier than expected Given room upgrade great with balcony and view of marina Roof terrace very pleasant and relaxing Breakfast more than expected with great service Staff spoke good English and were very helpful and friendly

396921,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Our room opened into a narrow light well meant it was quite dark and warm , Lovely food terrace and pool Fantastic location and the staff were excellent 
396922,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The floor was not cleaned properly The middle part was only cleaned and the rest was left dusty, Excellent facilities and good location Breakfast was jummy and staff couldn t be more helpful so it s a shame that room cleaning let them down
396923,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The rooms are poorly designed with too few drawers and masses of the space given to the loo so the bedroom wasn t very big No room remaining for a couple of comfortable chairs Really irritating big sliding door which we seemed to be forever having to slide backwards and forwards across the wardrobe drawers access to the safe and the coffee and tea prep area , Location was great Super view from our room overlooking the marina
396924,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Only the price , The position of the hotel is perfect Directly across from the port 200m from Metro and 200m from La Rambla Open top bus tour stops opposite No shortage of cafes bars and restaurants 15min walk to the beach Great view from the roof top terrace

396927,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, A little more storage space would have been good and a hook or two in the bathroom to hang a bathrobe Also the electrical switches should be labeled somehow , Staff was kind and accommodating We arrived before check in time and the receptionist offered us a capucchino and a comfy place to wait till our room was ready Breakfast was excellent 
396928,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, the room we had did not have a widow to the outside but to courtyard i don t like that the breakfast is crazy expensive 23 Euro you can get a breakfast and coffee for 7 Euro around the corner its like they charge because they don t want you to eat there so don t its NOT worth 23 Euro , the location is great
396929,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Would have liked a room with a view but still a comfortable room , The staff were very friendly and helpful in all departments Breakfast was very nice and plentiful Bar on the 5th floor is lovely 
396930,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Could be a bit lacking in atmosphere in the bar area, Staff extremely helpful and friendly They left a bottle of cava and cake in my room on my birthday
396931,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Just one thing On the Saturday evening there was a Barcelona versus Madrid football match and some of the fans staying at the hotel were a bit noisy in the early hours of Sunday , The warm welcome the cheerful staff the facilities in the room TV hairdryer iron ironing board 
396932,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The room was far too hot on the first night 28 degrees and could not be adjusted We were told by staff to open window on second night but noise was unbearable Rude neighbours in adjacent room kept a party going from11pm to 7am with multiple visitors It was a really bad experience , breakfast was fine welcome with cava was good

396940,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, I think it was a bit too price for the size of the room I had a room with a view to the marine and the beach but the hotel is located in front of a main road and it was too noisy to open the balcony door and let it stay open Quite when closed though you wont hear a sound , Very clean and tidy Very kind staff Nice breakfast served by kind employees Modern facilities very close to the beach and the center 
396941,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The view into a side street was disappointing but I know that hotels usually reserve the best views for the double rooms , The roof terrace with a scenic view of the harbour The bathroom with the most up to date features spacious and leaving nothing to be desired The right kind of mattresses that give you a good night s sleep without any spine problems Staff extremely helpful and friendly at all times 
396942,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, Every Thins was good with this hotel Best value for money but it could have been so much better if they gave me the same price for tours The tours that I bought was more expensive than the real price but generally they helped me a lot for discovering the best sights of the city thanks to the reception , Hotel has great location just Few steps from Barceloneta Metro Station Barceloneta is nice And Is Great Place for stay all of Staffs were so respectful And so kind Reception was so nice she was so helpful and so kind and She granted extra time for helping me to discovering the the most sights of the city she also reserved for me all the places that I have Choose to go The breakfast was so good and they also give menu for hot breakfast for Omlet and etc I will surely come back again at this hotel

396950,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The size of the room was appalling There was less than a 20cm gap from the end of the bed to the wall to walk between There was also a wall mounted tv screen so we had to bend over the bed to get passed Unbelievable , Fabulous breakfast

396955,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, The electrics in our room gave us some trouble one night when the only way to turn off the lights was to take out our room card Side effect to the card being removed was no air conditioning and as the hotel faces the road too noisy to open doors Reported situation at 9am the maintenance man came and reset the fuse box eventually 2pm Had a similar problem with TV Sort out those issues and its 10 out of 10 Had to ask for our room to be serviced at 3pm , We had a Lovely room which overlooked the marina Excellent location for beach or town Loads of bars and restaurants nearby Shower room was different all black and mirrors but the shower and water pressure were excellent It was my husbands birthday whilst we were there and they delivered us a cake and lovely bottle of cava which was a lovely surprise Wifi brilliant Would definitely stay again
