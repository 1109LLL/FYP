275233,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, As you enter there is a strong sewage smell The bed was very uncomfortable lumpy and hard it was an old mattress Only one pillow that was thin and lumpy I asked for another but was provided with the same kind The check in woman stayed on the phone during my check in and disregarded me as a nuisance No one told me about the room or facilities The room was really small This is only a 3 star hotel , The evening bar cafe man was pleasant and helpful 
275234,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Nothing to do with the hotel but the parking situation is kind of strange Parking signs weren t very user friendly And I think it s on purpose Also you have to get a parking voucher from a metro kiosk before you park which could be no where near your parking spot Look into this before you travel there by car , The room was well furnished the bathroom was excellent and the location was perfect The room was larger then my Berlin and Prague hotels combined And the staff was amazing especially Elizabeth she was very helpful

275240,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, There is a gap between the windows and the curtains which leaves a fair amount of light passing through to the room At night time the room was illuminated by the inside yard lights and at dawn the room is filled by daylight The beds are not comfortable cheap mattress with springs that you can feel , The hotel staff did assist nicely to change the room The hotel decoration is particular but nice 
275241,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, I wouldn t class it as a 5 star hotel however in comparison to many 5 star hotels I have stayed at It s more closer to a 4 star The bedroom is a bit tired looking and the beds are the quality of a 3 star hotel unfortunately , I liked the bathroom and the room was ok had everything you needed I liked that it was a walk in shower and the bathroom was modern The location wasn t the best but it wasn t the worst either it was close to a station

275244,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, If this would be a 3 star hotel it would be perfect but since this is a 5 star hotel my expectations have been higher Poor breakfast with completely no service 1 person at the reception with long line not easy to find since the entrance looks more like some office building entrance , Perfect location nice room

275249,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel,No Negative, The location of the hotel is excellent as it is close to the principal museums There are tram stops next to the hotel and the centre is at walking distance The staff was very friendly and helpful Buffet breakfast was good but perhaps a bit on the expensive side If I go to Vienna again Levante will be my first option for a hotel 
275250,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Our room overlooked a very busy main road and it was noisy However it didn t bother us too much Regarding bedding we found one pillow too flat with not enough support and two pillows too high Otherwise the room was fine The bathroom was very nice , Upon booking I had requested a twin bedded room for my daughter and myself but upon checking in none were available Actually I doubt whether there were any in the hotel This meant that a staff member brought in an extra single bed which meant there wasn t much space left in the room Breakfast was very good 
275251,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Crowded dining place understaffed and overall below average breakfast loud heating bad quality pillows a lot of missing accessories that should be in the room of a 5 hotel A disappointment , The location is really good and the staff at the check in were nice and helpful

275269,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Little bit noisy room due to the windows facing the street This hotel ranks itself as a 5 star hotel but my impression was it is an average 4 star hotel Dinner in the restaurant was below average at a high price Expensive parking of 25 EUR night in Astoria Garage , Good location to the historical part of Vienna Overall cleanliness Interesting interior design Check out by 12 00 We could keep our car in the garage after check out until late afternoon
275270,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel,No Negative, Beautiful hotel located very close to everything Subway was close by as well so getting to and from the airport was easy as well Aleksandra and her staff took care of my gf and I and went above and beyond to make our stay very enjoyable We would definitely stay here again and do recommend for anyone visiting the beautiful city of Vienna 
275271,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel,No Negative, Perfectly quiet in the centre of Vienna easy walking access to most attractions English Theatre just round the corner and handy cafes for breakfast and other meals so sadly did not try hotel breakfast Complimentary apples and fresh water jug and glasses in reception Wonderful staff Great room for reasonable price Not a complaint but there were no tea or coffee making equipment in the room We collected hot water from the hotel restaurant and had our own tea bags in the room so English 
275272,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, It is not really a five star hotel The decor is slightly dated the windows which are facing a busy street are not sound proof single glazing and the duvet and pillows are made from synthetic material not feathers No conditioner among bathroom supplies , Very helpful staff great location can walk to the major attractions around also very near the metro stop Nice bathroom 
275273,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The bed sheets were rough we had a rash after 2 nights No toilet amenities so we needed tooth paste they said they would but never did , Location reception and the bar

275276,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, I was freezing in the room old windows leaking cold air in inefficient and noisy heating system apart from sauna fitness room I saw no other extra service which would justify the 5 stars Hotel seems understaffed Claimed services valet service cosmetic service etc are available when you work for it queue and declare need at reception well in advance Only one staff member at the reception at all times multitasking At breakfast utilities were often missing I had to wait ask the staff to bring clean mugs cutleries Superior Single room had the basic of the basics amenities Actually just mediocre quality soap shampoo body lotion but no shower cap no cosmetics kit no toothbrush and toothpaste no shoe polish only a bare sponge or even a pen only pencil No free mineral water or anything complimentary upon arrival This is max 3 stars service Maybe I am wrong but I also suspect that they call all their single rooms Superior only one pillow too soft and flat to sleep on Cleaning could be more careful I noticed that the bed decor cover was dirty I placed it folded on the floor in the hope that the cleaning staff would replace it Instead after cleaning I found it thrown on the back of the chair without replacement Some bread crumbs remained 2 days on the table after one day s cleaning I intentionally did not remove them myself overall I am disappointed and will not return The Hotel seems obsessed with the design art side the lucky guest is offered to buy expensive art items that decorate the room and seems to put less effort in giving a service worthy to 5 stars I have left them extensive written comments at the end of the stay and have not received any reaction since , good location for Rathaus X mas market very kind and helpful front desk and technical support staff good though not 5 star breakfast useful average laptop sized safe available in room did not use it myself but there is some sauna spa and fitness room free to use 
275277,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, That was the worst stay I ever had in my life The stuff are too rude they charged me 200 euros because i smoke in the room and I m not smoking They convinced me that the will just block the amount from my credit card till the investigate and once I checked out the deduct the amount I have tried to contact them and they never reply back The room is too small and it smells bad but I think that s their strategy to force guests to pay the smoking penalty even if you aren t smoking No one from the management their only one person at the front desk and he s not professional at all Based on my stay I don t recommend that hotel at all you will spoil your stay , Location is nit bad
275278,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel,No Negative, The Hotel was conveniently located by the tram and underground station It was also only a short walk from the shopping area and the museums On arrival the staff were very welcoming and helpful The rooms were superb and great value for money The breakfast was varied and again the staff were very welcoming 
275279,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, No lounge other than dining room bar to sit in A bit far from centre of Vienna but accessible by ubahn at Rathaus station u2 and a bit further to volkstheatre on u2 u3 lines Great restaurants were a taxi ride away, Good quality good location convenient to ubahn Gym sauna Food adequate but good small local restaurants nearby
275280,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel,No Negative, Poor cleanliness long black hair from former guests in bed and in bathroom Mattress fune on one side but completely laid through in the other side 
275281,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, More choices for breakfast for the price of 16 euros per person would be great Coffee from a machine was not great , Housekeeping was very responsive to additional needs Desk personnel were very helpful 
275282,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The hotel was meant to be a 4 5 star I would say it was a poor 3 star the beds are lumpy we left the room at 10am the cleaner was outside the room after we left she restocked the mini bar and then did no cleaning when we return at 3 30pm she decided she would like to clean the room obviously she was waiting for me to tell her it didn t matter I went downstairs for a bottle of wine they wanted 48 for a local wine the cheapest was 32 just a little high the hair dryer couldn t have dried a tea bag not as there was one or a kettle the TV had 4 news channels in English but did have a small selection of normal films for just 15 just over priced poor comfort very disappointing, The location was good
275283,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, when we came back in the room 2 pm it was not clean We have ask the receptionist to do the cleaning after cleanin the batroom was not clean well During the room s cleanig we wait in the reception for 30 minutes , The position the Hotel is very god Near the Netro station and in few steps is possible arrive in the centre of the City Under booking you can use the garage near the hotel very good The breakfast was good
275284,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, we booked a superior double room but when we checked in they gave us a very small room that was really for a single we had to insist to change the room and then they gave us a bigger room but with no bath tube then every day something else didn t work first the hot water then the t v and then the heating the breakfast is expensive, good location pretty room
275285,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The 2 main reasons of choosing this hotel was its central location and free parking close by we set these two options on the booking com website To our disappointment we learned upon our arrival that the parking we thought was free cost 50 per night and there is a cheaper option if we want to walk for 10 minutes and drag our bags We could not set the room temperature as high as we wanted to even after the maintenance crew came and fixed something , Great breakfast Helpful staff central location
275286,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Although I had early check in they tried to tell me that it s a favor from their part In three days of my vacation I received only a tiny soap and no shower gel Of course it was a five star hotel Breakfast overpriced , Excellent location close to most of the atractions of this beautiful city 
275287,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel,No Negative, Very good location the hotel is 10 minutes walk from the City Hall and there is a metro station right across the street Rooms were clean and spatious enough Very good breakfast The staff were very nice and helpful

275289,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, It would be nice to have tea coffee making facilities in the room , The staff was helpful and friendly they helped us with every question we had Breakfast was really delicious and had a lot of choices Rooms are spacious has a huge closet for all your stuff The bathroom was really clean though it could have a few more amenities like ear stick bathing cap some cotton and sewing kit 
275290,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Not a good heating system very noisy in the night and inefficient Dirty carpets on hall with heavy smell , Excelent location free parking place in weekend the roumanian bellboy very helpful nice room confortable bed big bathroom 
275291,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The only thing I didn t like was the frosted door to the bathroom It looks lovely and would be a great touch to the room for a couple but as I was staying there with my mum it felt a little awkward Other than that everything was fantastic , The staff were the most friendliest and helpful staff we have had the pleasure of meeting so far on our trip My son became very unwell nothing to do with the hotel he was already showing signs on the way there and ended up having the height go to hospital and the staff went above and beyond to help us with a taxi to the hospital warming baby bottles for us helping carry food to our room and even asking the next day how he is going Also a special mention and thanks to the door men and the restaurant workers for being extra friendly and super helpful The hotel itself was very comfortable clean and in a perfect location It s a short 2 3 stops on the tram to the city centre and the tram is basically outside the front door 
275292,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Room was too hot and couldn t make controls work slept with window open , Staff helpful close to the Christmas market trams and metro close by too 
275293,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Would have been nice if there had been facilities to make coffee or tea in the room or even just a bottle of water on offer for the thirsty guest , Very nice boutique style hotel Bathroom in particular was great with a lovely shower and almost instant hot water 
275294,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The rating is absurd My room was rather s with a small and hard mattress on the single bed WiFi break down several times Was OK for the price though 65 Euro , The spa isn t planned very practically but is nevertheless a great thing to have in such a central location The hotel is located on a busy road in a no man s land area between the city centre and the 8th district but is well connected with public transport and close to attractions such as the Parliament the City Hall the Burgtheater and the Museumsquartier all in walking distance 
275295,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The wifi regularly disconnected at the most inconvenient times e g online with airline to add baggage wifi disconnected at time when payment was being authorised or was it , Breakfast was very good particularly the omelettes Hotel reception staff friendly extremely helpful and attentive Hotel was convenient for Public Transport and great Christmas Market at Rathaus 
275296,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, We had a lot of difficulty in controlling the room temperature it was often too hot or too cold and was very hard to find a middle range which meant we regularly resorted to opening the window with the heating on full blast The bathroom of this suite was an awkward galley style which was very long and narrow with dual sinks The shower was powerful with easily adjustable heads and water temperature was easy to control WiFi was somewhat patchy around the hotel and often prone to dropout in the room but the speed of connection was not slow and there was a shared user pass for everyone staying , We stayed in a junior suite room 109 This had a pleasant view over the courtyard and was a good sized room with decent room decoration and artwork There was a complimentary fruit bowl and bottled water on arrival The breakfast buffet was acceptable with an average choice of food eggs done on requests and very good coffee The staff were friendly and helpful and spoke good English 
275297,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The staff were helpful with showing local attractions but a number of issues raised with the front desk were not addressed Double bed was two singles together which made for a quite uncomfortable sleep, The location of the hotel was very good close to transport and a number of key attractions
275298,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, very noisy climatisation in the room extremely noisy just above bed and unable to heat room at maximum power speed and outside wasnt too cold I guess during freezing nights in room will be extremely cold Expensive breakfast 15 euro person expensive restaurant downstairs, Very nice stuff and helpfull great central position
275299,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The heaters in the rooms could not be adjusted perfectly and they heated the room so much that we almost boiled We hat to keep the windows open to balance the whole thing , It s really in the city center and at a walking distance from the nearest underground station The hotel was comfy and the staff were really helpful

275302,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Glass walls and door for bathroom and WC makes feel uncomfortable however The hotel has put blinds on the glass wall between the room and bathroom which is good , Very good breakfast We had a room with a view to a yard ut was quiet and we could keep window opened at night 
275303,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Very small room The bed come with only one side table Breakfast very simple Rooms did not have the basic amenities such as ironing board iron coffee machine or kettle When we complained about that to the receptionist he was very argumentative saying that some customers don t want to have these things in their room They provided us with ironing board and iron and took it back in the day after They provided us with kettle that was smelly and we couldn t use it Wifi was not stable , Location Ali The concierge 
275304,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Our room was just around the corner from the registration desk which I felt was a bit weird The room had a bit of a smell musty or faint sewage like smell and an air freshener was used to mask this which made it worse We got used to the smell eventually , The room was very spacious We liked the water closet toilet sink which was separate from the shower stall Wifi was good Breakfast was good The gym and sauna were good 
275305,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, During the check in I had to ask to show me all available rooms of the same type As it often happens they tried to put us to a room worse than it was shown on booking , Great location
275306,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Rooms did not come with amenities such as ironing board and iron When asked the first time staff was fine When asked the 2nd time staff was rude and said there are many other guests who need the ironing board and iron We would not be able to use at the time For a 5 star hotel I would assume every room would have a ironing board and iron WiFi was super spotty When asked why I was kicked off after multiple times I was told was to wait and then the front desk hung up AC did not work and was asked to leave the windows open Our room was over the courtyard and was super noisy at night so it was hard to get a good nights rest We were told that the AC kicks in at a certain temp Funny on our last night the most chilly night our AC was blowing super cold air I do NOT recommend this hotel There are PLENTY of other options that will provide much better service ,No Positive
275307,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The stairs leading to the reception Although a note at the entrance advises to leave luggage at the door to be picked up by staff At the time of arrival we could not see any staff to ask to get our luggage Also at night one of the hotel guests was on a wheel chair and his son has to carry him over the stairs I think a small lift needs to be installed as part of disability rules , Cleanliness
275308,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, We booked 2 nights and only had 1 full day there and we had to wait until 2pm as they changed our rooms some did not get to see any of Dublin this was a massive Inconvience and would like some sort of compensation for the wasted money and flights ,No Positive

275311,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The shower could have been better given it s supposed to be a 5 hotel It was a double headed shower but when you use the hand held shower the over head shower drips cold water on you which isn t great if you re trying to keep your hair dry , The room was nice and the bed was comfortable It was a good price for a nice hotel booked last minute 
275312,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The WiFi disconnected at times Not enough TV channels in English only some news channels , The location is great close to public transportation and about 15 minute walk from the city center The staff were welcoming and very helpful 
275313,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Extremely rude staff at reception They blocked me from using my room account which I did not want to use anyway so I did not care then asked for my passport in case I used it I replied that I could not possibly use it as I am blocked and so I want to keep my passport After 20 minutes they realised but not before rudeness them murmerring under their breath and general inhospitable behaviour , Decent location and clean hotel
275314,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Wasn t kettle in the room for making coffee tea also mineral water, Services was excellent and the room is well cleaned Breakfast was fantastic
275315,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, the size of the lift is small and there is only one you cant get two people and their cases in The room lighting switches are confusing I ended up sleeping with some cove lighting still on The breakfast at 15 euros is expensive try the Caf Elies just up the road its only 10 euros for an English breakfast with two coffees , The design is contemporary and comfortable and very well appointed

275320,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, This hotel promotes itself as a five star hotel It is not Four star european would be acceptable Air condition was noisy The rooms quite small , The location is not bad The price is relatively low but do not compare with five star hotels compare with four star hotels 
275321,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, I can t think of anything I did not like, Location is spot on the room was luxurious and breakfast was just amazing When back in Vienna I will certainly come back to this hotel
275322,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Internet is a bit slow so Skyping is nearly impossible No coat rack and only three hangers in the wardrobe was a bit annoying Cushions are too soft and not firm enough to support your head No coffee machine in room and coffee is too expensive at the bar , Got a small chocolate every day Room was quite comfortable with a nice shower

275326,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Didn t like the blind on the bathroom window seaparating the bedroom No matter what we tried lights on off you could still see in Very impractical with an older teenage son The twin beds were very close together and the pillows were very flat , Hotel a short walk from the metro Very quiet location 
275327,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel,No Negative, Staff were extremely friendly and very professional We arrived 3 hours before checkin and were allocated our room within 20mins The hotel had an excellent location close to the Parliament and the Rathaus Underground was a 2 minute walk There are supermarkets restaurants bars etc very close by Breakfast was continental but enough choice to suit most people The rooms are a reasonable size clean and comfortable and the airconditioning works well which is required in the hot summer months Thank you to the staff of the Levante for a lovely stay 
275328,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Nothing, We have stayed there only for a night after our wedding ceremony Everything was awesome staff cleanliness service etc There was a staff with bottle of sekt fruit table and sacher torte when we got in the room They also made a special table for us for breakfast with flowers and sea stones and everything We were speechless Shortly everything was amazing and perfect Special thanks to manager 
275329,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Short version Badly trained nervous and sloppy staff with no decision authority Bad financial administration Uncomfortable beds Long version I changed the room through booking com They didn t do the change properly so I ended up with the cheap room for the high price When I complained they didn t listen to my idea of a solution with the result that I had to change rooms halfway my stay For every change on booking com they made a reservation on my card without releasing the old one Result was that I could not pay for the room Rather than deciding to solve this later the receptionist tried for half an hour to solve it without any other result than me nearly missing my flight The staff is clearly not up to its task and had not enough decision space to solve problems they got visibly nervous when asked a non standard question and I had to ask twice for simple things like an iron , I liked the staircase going round the elevator 
275330,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, No kettle in the room The bathroom door had broken much earlier to our visit and not replaced by them We realized this late in the evening after we had unpacked etc ,No Positive
275331,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Could have been just our room being that it was in the corner facing the courtyard on the first floor but Each day from the break of dawn until midnight we heard loud bass from the sound system in their courtyard restaurant Funny enough it was only soft jazz music The bass was simply too strong and must have reverberated into our corner I hope they can fix that , Location was good and we liked the fresh fruit and chocolates left for us nice staff
275332,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The single room is very small The gym is rudimentary very basic The 1 piece of soap 5cm sq supposedly is for basin shower use uuuuhm maybe 2 miniature soaps should be provided , Staff are excellent Very good location Breakfast very good open daily 07 11 The internal open courtyard is a very nice option 
275333,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Only one thin pillow no others available No tea making facilities in room restaurant completely disorganised for breakfast it was do it yourself and find out yourself no assistance as to where things were Restaurant in evening chaos waited half a hour for menu no follow up with regard to dessert or coffee had to wonder around to find waiter food not great totally uninspired favourless,No Positive
275334,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Very limited TV offering WiFi is horrible , Rooms are large comfortable and clean The hotel is very close to many of the major attractions of Vienna and at the same time not subject to the daily bustle of tourists 
275335,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Would be good if the gym had Dumbbells The air con couldn t be adjusted We had an adjoining room and could hear the room next doors Skype convos at 10pm each night Rather annoying, Beautiful 5 star hotel Nice size room and bathroom with modern finishes 
275336,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Bed is terribble Batroom us too old Strip running in the gym is the worts i soo in my life When used that you can broke something , Hotel is silence Good for rest 
275337,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Everything was ok I must be honest and tell that I did not try the spa and the restaurant therefore my judgement can not be complete , The location is simply unbeteable being very close to 2 metro stations The staff was very helpful when I needed the room to be made up at 12 00 and when I needed a taxi 
275338,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Restaurant is okay stairs with 8 10 steps is bit weird but butler bell boy will carry your bags book on Expedia instead of booking com, The courtside room helped cutting down the noise as most hotels suffer from it If you re a light sleeper or live in a home which is mostly silent it s good Services etc are average Restaurants is okay with not many choices but venture out and don t forget to reserve a table 
275339,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel,No Negative, Check in wasn t until 3 but the concierge was able to get us a room earlier I also was surprised by the heated floor in the bathroom And the location was great A short walk from the train station and surrounded by public transportation 
275340,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Everything just perfect, Excellentt room and breakfast friendly staff clean good location Great value for money next time in Vienna I will book same place
275341,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, We asked for late check out and they couldn t tell me it s possible till it was to latye for me, Very nice empleeys helped us with every Q we had we recieved great bad for our baby and electric kettel all you need is to ask Amazing breakfast 
275342,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The first day my room was not cleaned before 2pm breakfast was better the first day lounge is to small menu in restaurant is pour This is not more than a good 3 stars hotel, Good holiday hotel
275343,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The high price of breakfast when you eat muesli 1 croissant and 1 coffee for 25 , Everything was great I just wish that they include the breakfast with the room cost It is the only minus in this very chic and trendy hotel few steps from the subway station 
275344,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Good facilities and big room, The single room is very very bad very small without any facilities I have to change my room and pay a lot of money extra The suna and fitting room is very small Massage is not available if you want they should Call to other places and often the don t come
275345,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Shower was terrible We couldn t adjust the right temperature and top shower was droping the water consistantly , They allowed me to park in front of the hotel and it was free of charge 
275346,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Nothing for now, Very comfortable room Warm room Very helpful staff especially when we needed to go to a nice restaurant for an evening Clean and very well kept Great design We felt very happy 
275347,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Maybe an English speaking entertainment channel on the television would ve been nice But that s all apart from that it s a fantastic hotel , I found it a beautiful property The staff were so helpful and couldn t do enough for me A special thankyou to the Najib he made me feel like a Prince with his exeptional service and manner 
275348,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Charging my card on a reception desk at arrival to the hotel after I already payed in advance the room Somebody don t trust me Come on you have my adress my number of card already so don t make some pressure unnecessary It would be nice to have lemon slices for the tea by the hot tea water boiler Breakfast could be better for the 5 stars hotel , The suit was wonderfull Every detail was superb I liked it very much The position of the hotel was perfect for me as I went on ice skating at the Rathaus Eistraum I ll come back for sure 
275349,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The shampoo and shower gel in the room were pretty bad , The location of the hotel is great most sights are within a walking distance Breakfast was good 
275350,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, the bed wasn t particularly comfortable there were no tea coffee facilities in the room though we did not pay extra to have the breakfast at the hotel , the room was fantastic the staff were friendly and the restaurant was fabulous food drinks style
275351,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Shockingly uncomfortable bed What with the one pillow per person allocation , Lovely hotel Great location Friendly staff Shockingly uncomfortable bed What with the one pillow per person allocation 
275352,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel,No Negative, The location is immediately behind the parliament building and well within walking distance of the center of the city There is a parking charge for your car which is 25 Euros per night but that is common in European cities The buffet breakfast was lovely and even included champagne and orange juice It is possible to order French toast and Omelettes from the chef but there is plenty of great choices without this
275353,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The only small detail that was a little stressful was the light switches They were so many at the door and at the bedside table that it took a while to properly understand which one to use , The staff at the reception was very nice and helpful Bed was comfortable and the room had a good soundproofing 
275354,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, I was in first floor room 104 every morning I felt dry nose lips we find out the last 2 days that whatever you leave on the table it is full of dust in morning We can t know from where this dust is coming as it is winter and windows are closed We suspect from the heating ducts I had no time to complain when I left the last day as I was in a hurry but this problem has to be solved for future guests ,No Positive
275355,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel,No Negative, Great location near City Hall and Parliament with metro tram and bus in 2 min walking distance The staff is very friendly the breakfast has plenty of choice there is a small gym and wonderful art all around the hotel and in the rooms Modern facilities and enough space in the room 
275356,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Its a nice hotel but i would say it should definitely be a 4 not a 5 hotel , Good location Within 5 10min walking distance to main landmarks like Parliament Rathaus and Christmas market Imperial Palace museums It s superb location Comfortable beds 
275357,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, I believe that there should be more pillow options in a 5 star hotel as the ones in the room were as flat as pita bread Bed was not the most comfortable either However our stay was very good overall , High ceilings in the room create a very spacious feeling Bathroom is also very nice It is a quite new and modern hotel Location is very good especially if you re in town to visit Christmas markets 
275358,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel,No Negative, We arrived to Vienna early in the morning but we didn t have to wait till the afternoon to check in The hotel staff was really helpful and kind As it was the first stop of our honeymoon they surprised us with a suite instead of a standard room red roses to my wife some cakes and champagne Thank you guys we really enjoyed our stay at The Levante Parliament 
275359,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Location a bit of a distance and not much ambience , One of the reception staff was a bit negative when we asked about restaurants and brunch places we wanted to go to saying it would be difficult to get a table as it would be busy and suggested we walked along tourist areas and tried our luck rather than showing us on the map where these were located or offering to call and see if they could get us a reservation In the end we found one of the places ourselves and managed to get a table too 
275360,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Access to the hotel is just the staircase making it small handicap friendly Our room was large but the bathroom and toilet was very cramped and should have been given more space It is impractical with transparent doors to bathroom and toilet in the room that is meant to be shared The cleaning was lousy and the sheets were holed and worn Light dimmers were all defective and the Internet connection was slow Breakfast was decent but for 180 Euros per night we expect more comfort and more value for money , The hotel is centrally located close to Rathaus and Volkstheater subway stations We got a large room and were quickly checked in by friendly staff at reception One of the days we had a good dinner in the hotel restaurant 
275361,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The hotel had already charged for the room when i booked yet they insisted on taking a payment for misc when we were going to stay for just a day wasn t impressed with that , The room size though the view was blah The storage space was good so was the sitting area had a storage box and bathrobs which we didnt use yet The place is close to rathus station The breakfast was ok just that they had an option to make the eggs the way you wud like it so that was a plus 
275362,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel,No Negative, In one word perfect in any occasions Best position nearby everything in Vienna lovely design of interiors Couisine should be better in that price you can go to the much more luxury restaurant but good taste average wines But from me side hotel will obtain 10 10 I m satisfied at all 
275363,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, location sucks and if you arrive late or leave early there s no possible way to get coffee or something to eat for a 5 star hotel it s really bad to not have at least a coffeemaker in the room, super nice staff
275364,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Fitness centre equipment is very limited could have provided a few sets of dumbells or kettle bells , Staff is very good efficient friendly and always very helpful Sauna looked really good but I didn t use it 
275365,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, No tea making facilities in room, Great location lovely sized rooms nice shower and bathroom breakfast wide variety of choices staff helpful and knowlegable
275366,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel,No Negative, Perfect location within walking distance of many of Vienna s must see jewels Quiet with tastefully appointed rooms and some super local cafes make this a hotel we will return to again and again
275367,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, I complained about the laundry and the housekeeping in general It was fixed immediately Manuela was amazing but I shouldn t have had to mention these issues in the first place I queried a bill in the restaurant and the waiter walked off Walked off In the middle of a conversation Unbelievable , Proximity to museums theatre opera
275368,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, A bit pricey should have included breakfast for the price It would have been nice to have an electric kettle in the room , Great location friendly and helpful staff clean and new furnishing We had a great stay 
275369,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Room No14 has no view at all and the windows face a wall it is very dark The room had an unpleasant smell On one day we had left the room at 9 a m came back at 3 p m and it was still not cleaned Then came the cleaning lady and asked if we want it to be cleaned The breakfast is very expensive , The location is very good 
275370,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Most appalling was the condition of the floor in the room it was visibly dirty The bed was uncomfortable and did not constitute a mattress It made sleeping difficult The room was extremely even by Euro standards small i believe I was assigned a room smaller than what i signed up for And the price of US 2400 dollars for 6 nights was ridiculous for the size lack of cleanliness Also breakfast was not even included, The location of the hotel is very good allowing for easy access to city sites and transportation 
275371,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, It s a medium walk to most of the Viennese tourist attractions Not a bad location by any means and very convenient to the metro but you might want to consider something a little more central if you re planning on packing a lot in to your stay , Friendly accommodating staff lovely feel to the whole place great breakfast overall a very pleasant experience
275372,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Had requested a double and a twin 3 months in advance and got 2 doubles which meant one of my party had to sleep on a fold up bed , Good location trendy design 
275373,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Room not serviced every day or late when back in the room Glass doors on toilet and shower room not leaving much to the imagination which isn t good when just on holiday with a friend Electrics need looking at complete power out first morning and some lights worked some days and not others Our views was almost as if we were in a basement ie it was a brick wall and with the lights not always working it felt dark Only 6 coat hangers and small hanging rail which isn t good for 2 females for 5 nights It was OK , Very friendly helpful staff Clean and tidy modern hotel in a good location 
275374,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The name Valante Parliament is very misguiding Also in picture instead of front of hotel there is a picture of parliament Why Very very misguiding Very little staff Only one for check in check out or concierge I will never visit Vienna because of very uncomfortable stay , Nothing 
275375,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, This is no directly conected with hotel but Wiena is turned upside down by trafic works mostly on main streets without any sugestion how to find your destination My GPS was gone crazy We were just circuling around about one hour in total trafic nightmare Also parking is to expensive 25Eur per day is far to much If You have more time to investigate you can find appartments with free parking , Hotel has great location Every important historical item is nearby also there are many nice restoraunts and fast foods with normal prices Staf is helpful nice and smiling 
275376,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Bad management attitude Rooms are noisy poorly insulated from other rooms and from the corridors not worthy of a 4 standards For half the price you can stay in excellent 3 in Vienna with not bad location neither Definitely will go back to Leonardo rather than the Levante next time, Locations is excellent
275377,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, we had 2 rooms One room No 413 had ants crawling in the room The last night the second room No 301 had a electricity issue we had to wait several hours until to be able to sleep Finally at 2pm we entered the room without any air condition The temperature was 37 C and we were not able to sleep The hotel was not able to give us another room They said there is one room No 414 which is free but the door lock has a problem The hotel director was only able to deduct EUR 20 at first but after arguments he raised it to EUR 50 By the way he did not want to speak to us directly but communicated with the receptionist only He argued that it is not their fault but due to technical aspects they do not find it necessary to compensate with more The breakfast buffet is at budget level quality The dairy products are displayed in room temperature imagine that you want yogurt and eat it warm the cereal is of cheap quality and the coffee machine stops often due to low capacity and people need to wait and call the staff for assistance Also there is always something missing on the table If you ask for coffee cups it comes without saucers and spoon You need to ask for napkin or if you have omelet the fork is missing etc etc The hotel is not really a 4 stars quality level and definitely not a boutique hotel We did not enjoy our stay at all , Location of the hotel is at a walking distance to Museum Quarter was excellent 
275378,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, Room and mini bar fridge was a little small No jug to make coffee in room Aircon was not cool enough, Great location Close to the Museum Quarter Great breakfast
275379,The Levante Parliament A Design Hotel, The location somehow far from the Center The entrance of the hotel comes with high stairs, The staff
