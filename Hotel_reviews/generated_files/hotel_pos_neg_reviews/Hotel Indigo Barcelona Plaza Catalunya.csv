331289,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, The deal turned out to be too expensive Everything was extra Bottled water etc better to stay in El Born where it looks like the true Barcelona and only come to hotel indigo section if you want to shop expensive stores and be charged 4 times as much for everything , Very clean Very good room service food 
331290,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, no parking offered you have to park in other place you can t unload the luggage since its on a taxi road strange car access, Nice Staff Perfect and Huge room super clean beautiful decoration excellent location
331291,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, The room was made to look modern from the images but in truth the place felt dated There was scratches and cracks all over the wood surfaces in the room The bathroom was awkward in shape and size being very small with limited surfaces to place toiletries or hang items of clothing The worst thing was the lack of electric sockets around the room which led to laptops tablets camera battery mobile phones competing with a coffee machine kettle and desk lamp on the table in the bedroom There was a socket placed half way up the wall above the sofa which presumably was once for a flat screen wall hung tv where I was able to suspend a charger from when desperate , Location was fantastic for public transport to key tourist attractions and awesome for shopping districts The daily top up of water and fruit juices in the fridge was also much appreciated 
331292,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Could hear the metro from our room and they wouldn t move us without us paying extra for a better room The window looked out onto a wall and the air conditioning did not stay on so the room got very stuffy ,No Positive
331293,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Nothing the rooms were super maybe a little bit narrow but more than acceptable, The Reception staff were exceptionally helpful to me at a time when we were victims of the BA systems failure fiasco Thank you very much 
331294,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, room servicing was erratic the face cloth was not replaced nor were complimentary sweets and biscuits , reception staff were very helpful in recommending restaurants and things to see 
331295,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, The value you pay for standard room is not worth it I don t recommand standard room You need to pay an extra to get a window on street or a window on the swimming pool otherwise no window on outside low luminosity ventilation was not working in bathroom small room, Very friendly staffs Very well located
331296,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, The location was wonderful Had a family emergency at home The staff went out of their way to be helpful Can t say enough good things about the staff 
331297,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Internet codes were obsolete every day and needed to go downstairs to get new ones When you need to work in the room a good internet is very important , The room in general the tea coffee water all the compliments that make your stay feel more at home 
331298,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, There was building work going on next door pool side which spoilt the view and was noisy Also a fire alarm went off at 02 00 in the morning which distrupted our sleep , Bed was very comfortable and the staff laid petals on the bed for our special occasion and gave free upgrade Staff weee very friendly Comp drinks in room and little sweets Location fantastic 
331299,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Rooms are a tad small but that is to be expected for Europe, Very comfy rooms very friendly staff Steps away from Pasieg De Gracia street and Metro Great location 
331300,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Room is super small can t even put our luggage properly room with no day light which is not feeling cozzy or comfortable service is very superficial you can t feel any welcome breakfast is disappointing not attend to human need nor not stylish in decoration Will not come again or recommend to friends, Location is convenient
331301,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, Fab location only 5 10 min walk to Plaza Catalunya but far enough away from the hustle and bustle Beautiful rooms and great staff Would definitely stay here next time I visit Barcelona
331302,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, the lady who works on night time was so rude and impolite person she didn t help me about anything also told some bad words about me in Spanish to her colleagues that isn t professional and made me really sad , only the location was perfect you can walk to the main square of the city most places to visit were available easily 
331303,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, A small excellently located hotel within walking distance of the city centre The staff were friendly and ultra helpful providing brilliant recommendations and helping to arrange trips Would definitely recommend to friends and family
331304,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, We arrived late at night and didn t actually get the room that we booked but a lower quality room Were offered the type of room we booked in the next morning after having complained but this kind of room issue is not what you want when you are on business ,No Positive
331305,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, No facilities worth mentioning Sorry that s not a gym No spa Pool closed Room tiny Not great bed No turn down service No bath Thin pillow Just very disappointing for an Indigo Needs to drop price or increase the standard of the hotel Understaffed , Staff were friendly Great location
331306,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, There was nothing not to like everything was excellent, Everything was perfect rooms lovely food great staff helpful Beautiful hotel with the best barmaid ever 
331307,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Air conditioning could have been colder but still wasn t bad Is just stayed at 16C Maybe I just like my room really cold but wasn t cold enough for me, The staff was really attentive if you ever needed anything very nice and honest people Always in a good mood
331308,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Check in was incredibly difficult with a vehicle and the price for parking was not advertised like most other hotels in Barcelona and extremely high 35 EUR per day Room smelled strongly of weed after we were out for a day and it was so small there was barely room to walk around the bed , The location was comfortable
331309,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Bed was too soft although we asked for a firm bed Bad smells coming through the pipes in the bathroom The checkout policy is absurd 11 am I asked the desk person Anna Ch for a late checkout She was quite rude and said we could only have a large checkout for an additional fee of 30 euro She did not bother to mention the IHG late checkout I had to go to the manager the next day who mentioned the IHG late checkout of which I did take advantage , Location is perfect
331310,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, I dont really like the bathroom the shower make a flood almost a half of the bathroom , Great location and friendly staffs The room is quite big and spacious They also provided a pleasant compliment orange juice candies cookies Would come back for sure 
331311,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, the floor in the shower is not low enough causing water to spread across the bathroom , The quality of the hotel was excellent Staff were very friendly and helpful on every occasion Very beautiful room clean well equipped has all the information you need They also have a beautiful pool area stunning in the night time x
331312,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, The spare bed was very uncomfortable just a cheap put you up couch no room to swing a cat Our room didn t cater for 3 we had two of everything We were charged more than was quoted very expensive for breakfast drinks etc everything had extra tax added Never enough milk supplied to make coffee room very small for the huge price paid Photos advertising this place were very deceiving pool and lounging area were very small no atmosphere loungers very uncomfortable , Leaving 
331313,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, The entrance took so long and they need to check everything even though i paid the whole amount I thought i did but they had promotion and they only took half a money from my account for cancellation reason which is not that bad but the whole checkin process was too long Good breakfast menu clean and in a good location , Best location in Barcelona
331314,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, We liked everything about this hotel , Massive super comfortable bed fantastic shower Gaudi designed room cute pool with palm trees helpful reception Snacks available anytime of day and tasty Location near to Catalunya square very handy for airport bus and tourist information 
331315,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, The gym is right on the sun rooftop Impossible to use in summer time because there is at least 50 C inside Swimming pool it is actually super tiny more for kids playing , Location was great Very nice staff Big room 
331316,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Can t fault it so there was nothing we didn t like, Friendly and helpful staff nothing was too much trouble I can t praise them enough Cleanliness of the whole building was great and the facilities were excellent Breakfasts were yummy with plenty of choice and we had dinner at the restaurant one night and the quality and value was brilliant Location is really good you can walk to the La Rambla in 10 mins and there are some nice restaurants within a stones throw of the hotel 7ish Euros will get you a taxi to the port area if you are feeling lazy and a similar amount will get you to Park G ell Finally the rooms we had two double rooms ours over looking the pool and our daughters over looking the main road both were well equipped good showers comfortable beds and spotless All in all we can t fault it and would book again in an instant
331317,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, There were music speakers on our sun terrace that playing music that was not to our taste but there was no obvious way to switch this off The pool didn t open until 11am the following day so there was no opportunity for an early morning swim before checking out , We booked a night here during a week long holiday in a nearby coastal resort so that we could explore Barcelona The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly We ended up being upgraded due to room availability and had a sun terrace with a four poster bed style sun bed on it It was absolutely gorgeous but made us less inclined to want to explore The pool and sun loungers downstairs were lovely and got quite a bit of sun despite being surrounded by tall buildings The shower was really good 
331318,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, The maid service stole 200 euros out of my zipped backpack next to my bed The staff did nothing about it Not even a complimentary breakfast Literally they did nothing ,No Positive
331319,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, However be careful with some notes on Booking com proposing that the reservation could be modified and your credit card would not be charged while booking In fact this was not true Card was charged and we had to pay for an extra night that we did not need after all Misleading communication form Booking com and lack of service here from Indigo Disappointing , Great location impecable front desk reception customer oriented personnel in general and very good quality price relation 
331320,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, No counter space in bathroom The upholstered furniture in bar area needs to be recovered or replaced it looked dirty and didn t match Parking available but a little inconvenient although that s probably the best they can do in a city that large , The bed was amazing the room was big and actually had a long bench that would fit both our bags Large bathroom 
331321,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, Room was well decorated clean and beds were very comfortable The hotel is in an ideal location for exploring Barcelona with excellent links to public transport and central Barcelona Great selection of breakfast options plenty to choose from to suit all dietary requirements We stayed at this hotel to celebrate a special birthday and were lucky enough to be allocated an upgraded room Would definitely return to this hotel if I was to return to Barcelona 
331322,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, They need a concierge Staff was nice but didn t have a great grasp of public transportation options , Very comfortable bed outstanding location nice upscale contemporary decor good towels great shower free water bottle Very nice breakfast IF included in room price 
331323,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Wifi access was really slow Shower overflowed Breakfast choice was very poor , Overall comfort of the room Receptionists very friendly Location was perfect Loved the outside swimming pool and terrace 
331324,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Our room was originally upgraded and after one day we were required to change rooms We returned from sightseeing one day at 3 30 and the room had not yet been cleaned , The location was excellent and the staff was friendly and responsive 
331325,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, We had a room which was quite small and literally looked into a shaft The view from the window was that of the wall and window approximately 10 feet away in an internal shaft This meant that the room was very dark and we could not enjoy the views of the city or anything else for that matter The room smells very musty and I wonder if it has not been used for a while Staff told as they were full and we could not be moved I think it would be fine to come here but not booking a standard room as we did A real shame for thehotel , The Hotel was reasonably well appointed and the rooms were nicely decorated 
331326,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Really tiny detail there were 2 of us in the room and the cleaning staff only gave us 1 regular Nespresso pod and one decaf Maybe make sure to leave 2 of each for rooms of 2 people Really not the biggest deal but something to think about , Room was very comfortable food was good drinks were amazing The folks at the bar made us incredible sangria and tapas Staff were friendly an helpful Lots of nice freebies in the room like a Nespresso machine and pods biscuits juice tea and chocolates 
331327,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, There was a small problem that I could not find any word better than the word excellent to describe this lovely hotel I am really satisfied , As a frequent traveler I think this is the second or third time in my entire life that I describe a 4 star hotel as excellent Location design staff cleanness you name it Everything was perfect 
331328,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, I tried using the kettle to make tea and the kettle was not clean from inside Asked the front desk lady to have it changed and she said they would Unfortunately it was never changed , Location was convenient
331329,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, The springs on the sofa bed mattress were too prominent We were disappointed that chocolate and biscuits were only left on arrival and not replaced each day It would be much better to have fresh not powdered milk , The decor was fun and very Barcelona The staff were very friendly and kind especially to the children The beds were comfortable and breakfast was great especially the coffee The location was fantastic 
331330,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Breakfast could have more vegetarian options Also restaurant menu could have more children s options and vegetarian choices, Room was clean Complimentary drinks was a good treat each day 
331331,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Had to ask for breakfast to be refilled despite being an hour from finishing Bad drain smell in bedroom which was sorted when mentioned , Bed was really comfy bathroom was nice Staff were very helpful Great bed on the balcony which would ve been fantastic in the heat 
331332,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Hotel took money out of my account without my authority Booked Deluxe double room but got basic double room on arrival After a complain my room was exchanged for the right one the one I paid for , Location is really good All must see nearby 
331333,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, not quite sound proof and each room has somewhat perfume flavour maybe it s better to Just keep room clear , perfect location 5 minutes walk to plaza catalunya rambla gracia convenient to take aerobus and tourist bus and kind staff help to change room when requires high speed wifi is also provided
331334,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, One very slight issue was the noise from adjacent rooms We could hear the children next door through the walls , Friendly staff excellent location great breakfast and bar area very comfortable beds and a nice touch to have daily refills of bottled water and fruit juice in the deluxe room fridge 
331335,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Nothing like that , Awesome place Happy to go once again especially the restaurant supervisor though she dosnt know English she served will and good dishes
331336,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, The hotel room Zero natural light as the window faced one of the building s walls and the key card holder to turn the lights on broke so I was left in the dark twice Funky sewer smell when the windows weren t left open Buzzing circuit breaker in the room I was really looking forward to staying here and after seeing other rooms might consider coming back but would definitely request a room with an outside view , The only thing better than the location was the staff and hotel vibe Incredibly helpful friendly and fun The bartenders and the music playing in the halls were Awesome 
331337,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Found it quite noisy early in the morning with kids running in the corridors early and cleaners round early, Location was fantastic staff were very friendly and we got a free upgrade for our room which was great 
331338,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, Great location for shopping sight seeing 5 mins from Plaza Catalunya easy walk to Guadi architecture near local bus stops too Modern hotel small relaxed 
331339,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya,No Negative, We loved everything about the hotel really clean and modern fantastic staff can t wait to go again we would recommend this hotel to every one young and old 
331340,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, breakfast was only average quality but ok , Good location for city and close to subway stations nice and clean room gym was fine staff at reception were very friendly 
331341,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, I dislike that the hotel charged me one night of hotel on my credit card even though I stated I prefer to pay by cash Even though they did a refund for me I still lost some money due to exchange rate Also it is true I read somewhere that there s smell of drain but this can be resolved by just closing bathroom door all times and keep aircon running , Cute looking room decent location 
331342,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Somewhat bit expensive, Location perfectly central operability as the room is well organised and has all needed equipments cleanliness breakfast is complete and well presented and delicious
331343,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, The room is small with only walking space round the bed There is no light through the window which open to a small courtyard Room felt like a cell , Good location for the city centre Friendly staff Good breakfast
331344,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Didn t have any dislikes , The location is awesome It s a 5 10 min walk to many restaurants and bars It s also within walking distance to Casa Batllo La Rambla shopping and other sites BTW the restaurant Obama s is a must The hotel is well maintained and quiet although located on a busy street The staff is friendly courteous and always on duty We would definitely stay at Hotel Indigo again 
331345,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, They charged for room before we got there as we were paying cash on arrival So had to wait for money to be transferred back into account which was annoying as money was there in account for spending so was left short on my stay , Location was perfect

331348,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, We tried the lunchtime menu one day as on paper it sounded as if it should ve been a lovely three course meal It wasn t it was really bad which was unexpected given everything else at the hotel was so good I would recommend eating elsewhere , Staff are very helpful and very polite The sun terrace balcony on the sixth floor rooms is excellent The pool although quite small is lovely along with the sun lounging area It s only a 5 min walk from the hotel to the top of La Rambla and Placa de Catalunya A lovely hotel and worth a visit 
331349,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Rooms booked through Booking com especially on the first floor where I was are a disgrace for a 4 star hotel They re dark tiny and practically windowless I was given an upgrade for twenty euros and the room was much more up to standard Do not accept these small rooms for such a big price , The hotel and staff are fabulous 
331350,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, Only two things we didn t get a replacement water every day just most days and the AC blew directly at the pillows of the bed making it a guarantee that we were going to wake up with dry sinuses , The staff pool and facilities were great The helped us rent a car for the day and the business was very easy to work with The hotel was a huge help there 
331351,Hotel Indigo Barcelona Plaza Catalunya, We had dinner in the restaurant but we re a bit disappointed with the food so next time will choose one of the many restaurants nearby , I From the minute I walked in the doors and saw how beautifully decorated the hotel was I was delighted Our room though small was beautiful The bed was divine the bathroom well appointed The pool area and dining area are beautful I will use this hotel again when I m in Barcelona A short walk to Placa Catalunya Fabulous
