302169,The Mirror Barcelona, Didn t love the shower not being with the bathroom and the bath was small I would expect bigger bath for a superior suite with a terrace for the money paid I paid extra for a suite with an outside terrace expecting this to be on the higher levels It was on the ground floor with high walls like a prison around which I didn t expect so we couldn t really enjoy the Terrace Rooftop pool was a complete let down My partner and I went up twice and it was full of topless women and because it s so small it was awkward and too personal I left within seconds Unless there are only two people up there it s just too small to enjoy lounging by th pool , The mirrors everywhere Loved the breakfast and the blonde lady in the mornings We also recieved a complimentary cava as it was our anniversary which was surprisingly and very nice Cleaner was very thorough and I have no real complaints re the room 
302170,The Mirror Barcelona, Nothing was dislikeable , This hotel was superb Nothing was a problem for the staff The bed was so comfortable that the night was a great sleep We had to check out early in the morning in order to get a taxi to the airport the team made this easy by printing our checkout details for the time that we needed to leave Little things just made our stay perfect 
302171,The Mirror Barcelona, No sink in toilet or shower Small room Expensive The all white and mirror look dont fit my taste and show marks of use , Clean Good bed Nice location near good restaurants and more Very kind and helpful personell who speaks excellent English 
302172,The Mirror Barcelona, My wife s phone got stolen at the hotel s Cafe seating in front of the hotel and when explained the incident and asked if they had cameras outside the answer was oh this happens all the time And no comers outside sorry , Neat and not so big room very minimal 
302173,The Mirror Barcelona, Breakfast service was lacking if you came later Most of buffet empty even though breakfast served until 11am I had to ask for many items some of which refused Shame because the food was lovely, Very comfortable bed
302174,The Mirror Barcelona, We thought that the breakfast was pitiful until we tried eating in local restaurants instead then for the last couple of days we returned to breakfast at The Mirror which was better Nevertheless the breakfast service was poor , The hotel was spotlessly clean but we never saw any staff cleaning or making up rooms The reception staff were very friendly and helpful The hotel design was modern to the extreme but we liked it Although it is outside the main tourist areas we walked to those in 20 30 minutes Longer distances we took taxis twice and they were cheaper than we had been led to believe There are some very good restaurants with close walking distance but not for breakfast 
302175,The Mirror Barcelona, The shower bath was a little dangerous Quite a high wide ledge you had to step over to get in and out which felt dangerous when the bath is wet as you could easily slip Be careful , The hotel is very well located Easy to walk to from Diagonal metro station and has lots of great restaurants in walking distance but doesn t feel like an unsafe or too busy area Modern boutique hotel with mirrors everywhere as expected from the name with a comfortable bed We also appreciated the seating area in the room 
302176,The Mirror Barcelona, If being picky coffee tea facilities within the room would be beneficial , The Hotel was very contemporary and breakfast was very good The staff were always very helpful when we asked for directions and also advise recommendations as where to eat 
302177,The Mirror Barcelona, Breakfast was not that great and quite expensive , The staffs of the hotel are respectful helpful and courteous to mention Matias and Oliver from the front desk 
302178,The Mirror Barcelona, the menu in the restaurant was s little strange maybe it s just me BUT Have look yourself The house keeping in the bedrooms was questionable , The bed was comfy The angels dotted about the place were interesting 
302179,The Mirror Barcelona, Slightly over priced but may have been because we booked a little last minute Breakfast was also quite expensive for what you got but not too bad , Fantastic hotel really cool and super modern Great location and not to far from the main attractions Staff were really nice to 
302180,The Mirror Barcelona, nothing, hotel was very clean and staff very friendly and gave us a late check out as flight in evening the room was a little more expensive than other hotels but well worth it 
302181,The Mirror Barcelona, Both the shower and toilet had little privacy It was a bit weird being able to see someone else take a shower The toilet door was also glass and not sound proof , The breakfast was really great It had a variety of options The bed was really comfortable and the bed clothes were changed every two days There were also great channels on the TV
302182,The Mirror Barcelona, I didn t like the false jazzy atmosphere of the restaurant and the outfit of the employees On my opinion it doesn t fit with the rest of the hotel , Unique design Good location Go to the rooftop and enjoy the view 
302183,The Mirror Barcelona, Wi fi was slow sometimes Breakfast was very basic for the price charged from what I saw so we ate out every day , The hotel is at walking distance from most famous places and we took the metro twice in 5 days just because we were feeling lazy Many excellent vegan restaurants caf s and organic shops around There is a card activated door separating the lift from the rooms on each side so it s very quiet since there aren t random people talking in front of your room Beautiful minimalist decoration Very friendly and proactive staff I will very likely stay at the same hotel if I visit Barcelona again 
302184,The Mirror Barcelona, The airconditioner s wind is just hited the pillow area on the bed sometimes feeling was very could and uncomfort Hope they can adjust the wind to blow to other area in room , The Mirror Barcelona is located in an very convenience area I could walk go to any interesting spot in Barcelona within 3 km or take metro just two blocks L5 L3 It was quite silence in room The breskfast was also tasty even here servicese sparkling wine druing the breakfast The staff is friendly and helpful 
302185,The Mirror Barcelona, Breakfast prices are high and one can do better eating out The area is full of bars cafes , Excellent location friendly staff and a great price It s also rather stylish which is a plus All in all a comfortable place to stay 
302186,The Mirror Barcelona, Nothing at all I have been staying here for 5 years now and will continue to stay here, Excellent Staff gave the best recommendations Great breakfast Super comfy bed Excellent location as well
302187,The Mirror Barcelona, The room decor of all white and mirrors looked better in the pictures than in real life Breakfast was still good but not as good as other Spain hotels we stayed at on the trip where they were excellent The location was at the edge of the sight seeing area of Barcelona , The room having a balcony was a pleasant surprise The welcome when we arrived and the escort to our room were top notch The glass elevator was novel and fun The bed and pillows were comfortable The boutique aspect of the hotel was different in a nice way 
302188,The Mirror Barcelona,No Negative, Lovely modern design with decent sized clean comfy rooms and it s just a stone s throw away from an array of good eats boutiques plus a few minutes walk to the Diagonal metro station and the hip trendy Gr cia enclave of bars restaurants in the neighbouring district 
302189,The Mirror Barcelona, The rooms where definitely not clean I got toilet paper in the toilet that was dirty I approached the reception to have it changed and told them the room wasn t clean Still noting happens The glasses we had used the day before where not cleaned or removed Ended up having many glasses in the room The pool was so dirty they didn t clean that area at all Which is a shame since it s a nice place , The breakfeast was good and specially the guys working there were really Nice 
302190,The Mirror Barcelona, The pool is not very nice The rooms are held in white which shows usage quite easily , The Location is great The staff is very friendly and helpful 
302191,The Mirror Barcelona, Difficult to keep clean as everything was either white glass or steel Look past that though and your ok, Room design was great and all the mirrors added to fantastic feeling of space
302192,The Mirror Barcelona, Soundproofing was not as good as hoped or advertised could hear a lot of what was going on in neighbouring rooms which is very much unwanted noise in my opinion The choice of an all white design means a very challenging environment for housekeeping and unfortunately the impression of cleanliness was not great Probably no worse than most other hotel rooms in the world but in these rooms every speck was easily visible , Great location in a very nice district close to the Gaudi buildings in a great shopping district and on the Granados street which is full of wonderful places to eat Close to Diagonal metro and buses stop a few blocks away Rooms were very light interesting design very comfortable bed 
302193,The Mirror Barcelona, Room overall cleanliness could be a lot better This is especially essential because of the all white and mirror design and decoration of the hotel Perhaps regular soaped mopping of the floor and wiping the leather coverings in rooms might help The sink and bath in my room were also not draining off properly But the staff and I collaborated to unblock the sink drain , I enjoyed my stay It was different comfortable Overall a notable pleasant experience 
302194,The Mirror Barcelona, Maybe if a window could open in our room it would be better , Everything was great the location was good near of metro and good restaurants Staff very helpful and friendly room were very clean every day and clean towels were available It was great 
302195,The Mirror Barcelona, Staff, I forgot some of my clothing items behind and I contact the hotel management to send them to me Unfortunately some of them went missing especially the most expensive ones I reported the matter to the hotel and requested to speak with the hotel manager but my request was not granted It is so disappointing that some of my items were stolen under the care of the hotel but more frustrating that nothing was done about it and the manager never contacted me Though most of the staff I interacted with were really nice but the action of the hotel management about my missing items was appalling 
302196,The Mirror Barcelona, Shower had clear door that opens to the room which is not so good when you have teenage kids , Fantastic staff Rooms very clean spacious and a very modern design Highly recommended 
302197,The Mirror Barcelona, Nothing , Excellent location Most helpful staff their recommendations for restaurants they also booked them for us within walking distance from hotel was top notch 
302198,The Mirror Barcelona,No Negative, This was simply the perfect stay Didn t think Hotels like this at such competitive rates still exist Should rather keep this for myself otherwise next time the Hotel is fully booked and or rates will go up 
302199,The Mirror Barcelona, The pool Needed a good clean green algae isn t a good look Was really looking forward to using the pool but was a little disappointed by it as it s such a nice hotel Also Breakfast could be doing with abit more variety for 18 , The bed was AMAZING super comfy like sleeping on clouds The room was INCREDIBLE the view was superb 
302200,The Mirror Barcelona,No Negative, Hotel is located just in 3 blocks from one of the attractive avenues of Barcelona Passeig Grassia where all branded shops are located It also take 15 minutes walk to get to one of the most busy and crowded by tourists place Pl de Catalunya and Les Rambles Helpfulness of hotel staff and details they provide to your queries worth to pick this hotel for your business or leisure in Barcelona 
302201,The Mirror Barcelona, Too many mirrors but I guess that is the name of the Hotel , Beautiful rooms and very clean Staff were very friendly and specilally the lady who handled the kitchen went out of the way to provide some decent food within the limited menu Breakfast was also ok 
302202,The Mirror Barcelona, Rooms are opened with TWO slide doors with a card What happens is case of fire It all looks nice but very claustrofobic High price as for such small spaces , Lots of mirrors in the room Very nice people at the reception Fantastic sculptures with angel wings Very nice artistic feeling 
302203,The Mirror Barcelona,No Negative, Trendy boutique hotel in a nice area of Eixample close to Avenida Diagonal and to many good restaurants and caf s in the adjoining streets Large well appointed room with a very comfortable king size bed and a roomy walk in shower with hydro massage functions not to mention all those huge mirrors everywhere you look There is a small pool on the rooftop Wi fi works very well and there is a flat screen TV even in the toilet for those lonely moments when one might get a bit bored A word of praise for the friendly helpful and very professional staff from the good humoured people manning the 24 hour reception to the discreet efficient and non intrusive cleaning staff 
302204,The Mirror Barcelona, it is not clean The room is completely white which looks great but therefor it has to be really clean you could see hair and dust everywhere on the floor and in the bathroom The Pool on the rooftop is absolutely tiny , great design great interior great location staff is very friendly and helpful as well flexible
302205,The Mirror Barcelona, No room service provided after 11 pm sink is outside of the bathroom pool on the rooftop terrace is the size of a tub , Convenient location and excellent breakfast
302206,The Mirror Barcelona, Roof top and roof top swimming pool was very small and not taken care of at all Hotel is slightly overpriced , Great location Very helpful staff Comfortable and clean rooms Interesting design concept 
302207,The Mirror Barcelona, Nothing , Exellent stuff very helpful and nice beautiful Room on 9 floor with Stunning Barcelona view nice swimming pool on roof fantastic lobby mirrors everywhere
302208,The Mirror Barcelona, A group of particularly demanding guests who seemed to think they owned the hotel and that the staff should be at their sole disposal , The Croissants were fabulous and the lady in the kitchen superb It s a great base for a weekend trip 
302209,The Mirror Barcelona, Breakfast variety could have been more extensive only continental available, Comfortable clean quiet room with balcony that had the sunshine all evening Great location within walking distance of las ramblas and the beach Rooftop pool is small but pleasant and gets the sun late into the evening Staff were really helpful during our stay 
302210,The Mirror Barcelona, there was shockingly no tea and coffee facilities in the room and no soap dish so i bought one i think for such an expensive room there should have been a breakfast included in the price , i loved my room incredible view i particularly liked the staff especially patrick he was excellent in every way and helped me with every request in a very professional and helpful way and the young man who bought me toast when i was unwell the location is brilliant
302211,The Mirror Barcelona, Nobody can say anything negative abput this hotel, IT IS A BEAUTIFUL HOTEL SPACIOUS ROOMS TV ALL CHANNELS EVEN TV ON THE WC CENTRAL THE STAFF INCREDIBLE
302212,The Mirror Barcelona, Having stayed here more than 10 times by now I d say that some rooms would definitely benefit with some refurbishment, Always one of my favourite places to stay in Barcelona Great location service and the overall style of the hotel 
302213,The Mirror Barcelona, No dislikes , This was our second visit to this hotel The staff are brilliant Polite friendly and super helpful They suggested brilliant tapas restaurants locally helped booking taxi s and even let us keep our room for late checkout which was brilliant as we had a late flight 
302214,The Mirror Barcelona, nothing, everything was ready also needed an early check in as came off a cruise ship emailed me they would try they did and also prepared a to go breakfast for an early flight Staff was very helpful gave me instructions where to go and saw that a taxi was there when i needed it 
302215,The Mirror Barcelona, Pillows were not too comfortable , I really liked this hotel nice and small but with luxury feel Very comfortable room and location is perfect The hotel looked brand new and very clean Bed was really comfortable 
302216,The Mirror Barcelona, The pool was not heated shower smelled mouldy sauna was just a hot room toilet door was glass so you partner can see in , Rooms the mirror theme is very pretty Staff always very helpful Location easy to get everywhere and taxis were cheap Restaurants so many everywhere we asked staff their opinions on where to eat and they were great Beds very comfy
302217,The Mirror Barcelona, Nothing was perfect for what we wanted , Super place great location out of the way of the huge bustling crowds Very quirky but very comfortable and a good place to stay Some lovely bars and restaurants close by We didn t get breakfast but the only thing I would say is that 18 seems very high when there are lovely local delicatessens round the corner where you can eat for two for under 10 
302218,The Mirror Barcelona, I had a very early flight and could not get a coffee at reception despite the presence of a functioning nespresso machine According to receptionist he is not allowed to sell coffee before 7 am , Location is really good room was spacious and comfortable
302219,The Mirror Barcelona, The roof terrace is a lovely little sun trap but is just that little and the photo of the pool is misleading Would be better as a hot tub , We had an excellent 4 night stay Staff were very attentive and room very clean The robe and slippers were a nice touch Additional security door which requires key card entry to get to your room made you feel safe and noise was rarely an issue We could not fault the breakfast everything was delicious and replenished instantly by the staff The breakfast is expensive unless you opt to add it when booking which I would highly recommend Diagonal metro station is within easy walking distance as well as many lovely tapas restaurants on streets parallel to Passeig de Gracia Overall an excellent choice 
302220,The Mirror Barcelona,No Negative, Could do with a coffee maker in the room and I thought the breakfast was expensive if it was 10 I m sure twice as many people would have it Apart from that the hotel was fab 
302221,The Mirror Barcelona, We liked everything it was Amazing , The staff were amazing and very attentive the room mirrors balcony the view the lift everything about the place was perfect 
302222,The Mirror Barcelona, Absolutely nothing , We received a free upgrade on arrival The room was enormous and absolutely beautiful The staff was respectful and polite It was amazing that almost the entire hotel room and also most of the lobby was covered in mirrors You really feel special here 
302223,The Mirror Barcelona, Quality of food for room service isnt up to other aspects of the hotel in my view It was a little disappointing , Excellent staff great location comfortable rooms absolutely love the breakfast My second time to stay and I will be back I really do recommend it 
302224,The Mirror Barcelona, No tea or coffee facilities No water in the morning No gym Felt it was overpriced for what you got although I did like the hotel it wasn t value for money breakfast is a total rip off and all cold Go next door instead as cheap as chips and lovely coffee, The room was a good size The shower was good The bed was comfortable Staff were nice and always said hello Nice area but about half hour walk to la rambla 24 supermarket around the corner Needed as no water given 
302225,The Mirror Barcelona,No Negative, The Mirror was central to all attractions shops etc The staff were friendly and very helpful in booking excursions giving directions etc The beds are really comfy best I ve ever slept on whilst on holiday If you like a shower rather than a bath remember to ask on booking as my room had bath with a shower attachment where as our friends room had a walk in shower that was more like a jet wash but what I would have preferred had I been given the option although having said that after pounding the pavements of Barcelona a hot foamy bath was very relaxing Breakfast I felt was overpriced and was mainly continental hence we booked bed only and went next door during our stay to a lovely restaurant where they fell over backwards to get as close to a full English as possible Overall an enjoyable trip and I wouldn t hesitate to return to the Mirror WHEN I return to Barcelona 
302226,The Mirror Barcelona, Unfortunately the room cleaning service we were there 4 nights always forgot to put shower gel in the room we always had to call the reception to get it And the last day the floor was left uncleaned and since it is a white floor it looked really dirty other than that truly a wonderful hotel , The decoration the friendliness of all the personnel at the reception and during breakfast Wonderful hotel We will go there again 
302227,The Mirror Barcelona, the room structure isn t perfect shower and bathroom doors are milky glass meaning you do not have complete privacy also room windows cannot be opened , the room was beautiful and clean very quiet well located and very kind and helpful stuff breakfast was very good 
302228,The Mirror Barcelona, The breakfast is rather expensive there are lots of places nearby where you can go for less The bathroom products were not always refilled , Friendly staff at 24h reception Nice concept with mirrors everywhere Metrostation nearby 
302229,The Mirror Barcelona, minimalist room some people from the staff a little bit confused hard to convince them that the first night was payed before check in , good location good breakfast
302230,The Mirror Barcelona, No tea facilities for a morning cuppa, The hotel is fantastic quality all the linen was good The shower was great and the hotel was so so quiet its a little bit out of the centre but it s easily accessible by taxi or the metro for a few Euros will definitely be going back
302231,The Mirror Barcelona, We loved the size of our rooms and the modern decor Everything was very clean and the staff were very helpful and accommodating We were very pleased with our stay there and would definitely return on our next trip to Barcelona ,No Positive
302232,The Mirror Barcelona, Construction noise from next door resulting in moving to a smaller less attractive room given the inconvenience I would have expected an equal or better room given the class of hotel Disappointing , Clean functional rooms
302233,The Mirror Barcelona, The replenishment of the breakfast buffet food items crockery and cutlery was slow as was the cleaning of used tables but that affected late breakfasters For the early ones everything was in place , Location in an elegant district easy walking distance from the Metro close to many restaurants and bars was excellent Reception staff were all very helpful The room size was comfortable for a multi day stay and everything worked
302234,The Mirror Barcelona, I left an item of clothing I emailed the hotel a couple of hours later explained exactly where it was and if they could post it back to me I would pay for the postage they emailed me back saying they couldn t find it what a lie as I knew exactly where I had left it i replied to there email saying that within a couple of hours of me leaving they couldn t find it And only the housekeeper went in that room to clean it what s that tell you , It was a very nice hotel
302235,The Mirror Barcelona, swimming pool needs to be a lot bigger or re made it can just about fit one person only but everything else made up for it , fantastic location great restaurants nearby all within walking distance Buenos Aires was a favourite no shortage of cafes supermarkets bars etc swimming pool is way too tiny no point of having it rooms are amazing very clean staff very friendly 
302236,The Mirror Barcelona, The room cleaning team got tired after the third day of our stay and only changed some towels , The room It was so high tech and just like in the pictures We were excited to see what each button in the room did 
302237,The Mirror Barcelona, Apart from the solarium there s not much in the way of facilities outside the room The bar is tiny and right at the hotel door Not inviting And the balconies in the rooms look at other buildings it s that kind of area after all Be warned that the rooftop pool is VERY small and shallow and the views are more buildings The Nespresso coffee machine is a nice touch but as there s no milk and the cups are espresso cups it s no use for many guests , The most comfortable bed ever Breakfast was good and the solarium and sauna are a plus The rooms are spacious and the design is nice and modern Everything was very clean The complimentary robe and slippers are a nice touch And they provide you with a big variety of quality toiletries 
302238,The Mirror Barcelona,No Negative, Really upscale funky hotel with mirrors everywhere High tech look was very neat and layout different from any other hotel I have ever stayed in This hotel is not for ultra conservative people as it is very different but for those looking for a new type room adventure you must try it out Loved it 
302239,The Mirror Barcelona, Bathroom and toiled without good ventlation that clears out all air, Cleanses include white decoration Mirror based style Very quite and not so far from la rambla st 
302240,The Mirror Barcelona, There s nothing that I didnt like about this hotel it was fantastic , This hotel is probably the best hotel I have stayed at Ultra modern clean fantastic staff great location and it has a sauna roof top pool I didn t try the breakfast but I am sure it was lovely too 
302241,The Mirror Barcelona, The bath shower is in the same room as the bed Getting in and out of the bath shower may be a problem for less agile older people The pool is more like a large hot tub and very shallow Oh and your room number is on the floor in front of the door We took a while to find it Toiletries are in a white container with a lid on them next to the sink Took a while to find them as they are not near the bath shower , The bed is incredible as was the shower WiFi was very fast The staff were very accommodating especially those at breakfast who really go out of their wat Breakfast was not included in our rate and was delicious Not worth paying 22e for as there are plenty of cafes nearby The room was spotless if a little too modern for us personally 
302242,The Mirror Barcelona, Quite a long walking distance from the town centre, Nice modern hotel beds were really comfy and staff were friendly
