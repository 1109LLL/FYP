432956,Hotel Garbi Millenni, Do not take room 511 The air conditions units are above it and very noisey There are no full size cups for tea just espresso cups with no coffee and no milk The rooms are very small and the cleaners would come and chat outside the room every morning at 6am The cleaners also didn t really clean very well We also had purple stained towels our first night It really feels like a 3 star not a 4 star hotel , Really great staff Very cheery and helpful 
432957,Hotel Garbi Millenni, The only problem which is the smell of the sewage We got a room and it smelled so bad I think room 301 but the hotel management moved us to a better room , Great location Subway just one minute walk from the hotel Staff were friendly and helpful Beds were comfortable and nice bathrooms Breakfast is good but not included in the price of some of the rooms so pay attention to it 
432958,Hotel Garbi Millenni, Room 401 stank toxic septic tank smell Moved room but had to endure a toxic night Hotel is dated and lifts need a good cleaning Major works going on outside hotel July 2017 which guests should have been warned about Staff were lovely though when we went to advise about the room the front desk man wasn t the friendliest and seem to know that room 401 was problematic ,No Positive
432959,Hotel Garbi Millenni, one of our rooms had a balcony and 1 didnt i prefer a shower cubicle rather than shower over the bath but still not bad facilities by a long shot , The man working on the reception desk during our stay was helpful beyond belief Taxi s were on strike across barcelona and we had to travel an hour out of barcelona to our second destination Clueless we asked for help and he looked into all alternative travel arrangements organised and explained the metro system to us looked at hire cars for us and gave us train bus and metro times to get us to where we needed to be Can t be any more complimentary about the service the hotel overall is great for the money and we enjoyed our stay 
432960,Hotel Garbi Millenni, There was a sewer problem outside but the smell had found its way to the room and stayed all night The internet connection was not strong enough We were placed in a room which was only just big enough to swing a cat ,No Positive
432961,Hotel Garbi Millenni, Very small room and bathroom Views on the back looking straight into a school and vice versa No on site parking offered discount of 10 on nearby parking but you have to pick up discount voucher before continuing to the parking However if you arrive at the hotel from the street where the hotel address is it is impossible to stop in front or near the hotel, Location near enough main tourist areas
432962,Hotel Garbi Millenni, They truly need help in their management skills I was given 30 questions one afternoon when coming back from the beach as if they were suggesting I weren t a guest there but some transient Trust me I wouldn t pretend to stay there if I weren t Then when I was leaving the desk guy who helped me hail a taxi actually watched me struggle with my luggage as opposed to helping me I ve received more help from strangers on the street It was the rudest thing I d ever experienced Will not be going back I d rather pay more and get human decency in return ,No Positive
432963,Hotel Garbi Millenni, we are staying in a triple room 1 double bed and one single Just one discomfort we felt that the double bed was not a accurate double bed they joined 2 single bed to make a double bed That was an uncomfortable some time ,No Positive
432964,Hotel Garbi Millenni, Shower could have used a new shower head possibly adjustable There was some extra sheets incase we were cold And option of a thin sheet would have been good ad it was very warm , The staff were very polite and spoke very good english while very happy to help with our questions about the area The hotel was a fair price and rooms clean We would defiantley return if visitng barcelona again 
432965,Hotel Garbi Millenni, The maid staff kept talking about us in Spanish We both speak Spanish lol They didn t like that we slept in till afternoon We tipped every day but that didn t stop the gossip The hotel was nice The room was small The location was ok though a bit far from the action It was over priced , Clean rooms Very nice front desk staff 
432966,Hotel Garbi Millenni, Over priced Travelled alone and initially given a very small double bed in an extremely small room At in excess of an average of 160 per night this was unacceptable Requested a refund to reflect the size of room but offered an alternative twin room instead Will be visiting Barcelona regularly and will hesitate to use booking com again instead deal with any hotel direct If the price was reasonable would consider this hotel again , It was clean 
432967,Hotel Garbi Millenni, Expected a little bit more from a 4 star hotel some coffee and milk would have been a nice touch This is more of a three star hotel Bed was a bit too lumpy for me sorry, Location of property was good only 10 minute walk to the centre of town
432968,Hotel Garbi Millenni, Room quite warm and ac didn t really have much effect So had window open but busy road outside hence a bit noisy , Friendly and helpful staff Beds and towels changed daily 
432969,Hotel Garbi Millenni, The room was very small for the 136 Euros paid No kettle safe didn t work the location was 10 minutes from La Rambla but if I d been staying more than 1 night I d have complained about the size of the room ,No Positive

432973,Hotel Garbi Millenni,No Negative, Comfortable and clean rooms Ideal base for touring the city or going to a football game 15 minute walk to Las Ramblas and quick 10 minute taxi ride to Nou Camp 
432974,Hotel Garbi Millenni, Mostly the room was hot and stuffy The air conditioning was very weak almost pointless We had it on for 3 days and made little difference to the heat in the room The fridge made a constant ticking noise that was very annoying There was a stench like a dead rodent which possibly came from the drains outside The windows didn t lock to shut out the street noise although that would only make the room hotter , The room was clean 
432975,Hotel Garbi Millenni, Poorly cleaned especially floors were dirty There was no complimetary coffee tea water in the room and the minibar was empty , Pillows were good Location was really good close to metro and only a few minutes from the center of the city Small markets and restaurants located next door
