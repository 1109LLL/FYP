335562,Pol Grace Hotel, Waited over an hour to check into our room although we arrived just after 14 00 Unfortunately saying sorry repeatedly saying it s your first day doesn t make the experience any better ,No Positive
335563,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, Very clean smelt amazing when you walk in Staff very helpful huge thanks to Zola who was a true gent and helped me order a delivery pizza one night 
335564,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, Wonderful location in a residential area far removed from the hustle and bustle of downtown where tourists abound The three of us including our 92 pounds dog were warmly greeted upon arrival Multilingual and friendly staff Bright and comfortable room with large bathroom Being a light sleeper I much appreciated the premium quality of its mattress A lovely buffet for breakfast gluten free bread available upon request which includes a range of cheeses cold cuts scrambled eggs cereals and juices of all kinds is all set up in a tastefully decorated dining area on lower level A definite return on our next stay 
335565,Pol Grace Hotel, The room had a window to the street so it was quite noisy even at night We had some payment issues caused by a hotel system but the staff was very willing to handle those situations and successfully solved them immediately , The best check in ever information about hotel as well as Barcelona must see offer for a reservation of restaurants The black board at the entrance with recommendations for brunches dinners festivals etc we tried some and it was so good Very helpful and friendly staff Shared hangout area at the reception with a bookcase and free water loose tea and coffee Modern desing and light furniture Really big double bed with big double blanket 2 pillows per person Room cleaning every day Great location for us still in the city close to public transport but not in the crowded city center Breakfasts available on daily base demand even if you book only a room Good and stable wifi connection 
335566,Pol Grace Hotel, The view from our room was an office block , The hotel is in a really good location so easy to get into the centre and lots of towns nearby with amazing restaurants and bars The room itself is kept very clean there is a big bed and beautiful bathroom There is also a lovely rooftop terrace with sun loungers and tables and chairs
335567,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, Hotel with a cool relaxed atmosphere Great location with good transport links and local restaurants Staff were friendly and helpful Free coffee and water was very much appreciated 
335568,Pol Grace Hotel, No cupboard in the room The hangers were fixed on the wall where all my clothes were visible during my stay , Customer service The lady at the front desk Paula if I remember correct was indeed took any opportunity to assist Always was ready for an extra mile Breakfast was good though not great Coffee tea in lobby is great touch Room was rather small but was comfortable and had all I needed and super clean The definite plus in this hotel is the warmth of the team who make you indeed welcome I likely return to this place if I visit Barcelona again 
335569,Pol Grace Hotel, Bed side USB sockets if that is our only worry it shows there was nothing really to complain about , We travel extensively and we have been fortunate to stay in hotels all over the world and have even been spoilt by butler service on occasions However never before have I experienced such a genuinely warm welcome by a hotel Paula was our main point of contact and her kindness and attention to detail knew no limits It is true that this is a fun clean funky hotel and feels that little bit out of the ordinary it is true that the location is superb right next to metro station and close to facilities restuarants etc But it is true also to say that the warm and sincere welcome makes it even more special 
335570,Pol Grace Hotel, Something they know about No shelf or location for soap or shampoos in the shower cubicle other than the floor Not all that important but apparently the architect didnt like the idea Easy to change and I am sure they will before too long Also air extraction in our bathroom could be a little more efficient foggy mirror , It has a friendly boutique style atmosphere in a modern smallish hotel Located very close to a hub in Barcelona s excellent public transport system so being a little very little distant from the more popular areas is no real drawback Staff are excellent at reception in the breakfast restaurant and in servicing the rooms 
335571,Pol Grace Hotel, The window was broken and almost fell out of the frame on me and because it didn t lock properly the AC wouldn t work until I finally figured out how to forcibly close the window the AC only comes on if the window is closed Nothing that can t be fixed The only actual problem is that the street outside the window is quite noisy , The bed was amazing large and very comfortable and the shower had lots of pressure Breakfast was varied and tasty decoration was great and relaxing Staff was super nice Very nice hotel 
335572,Pol Grace Hotel, The hotel could be closer to the main attractions as you have to take the metro to reach Placa Catalunya or La Ramblas Nothing else can be flawed, The hotel was modern and had a trendy feel Service was fantastic and the room was spacious enough for luggage etc The hotel is around the corner from the metro and just 3 stops away from La Ramblas 
335573,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, Quiet room with good air con Staff were very helpful and friendly Breakfast was also very good A good location near plenty of bars and restaurants in the Gracia area of Barcelona

335575,Pol Grace Hotel, 1 The rooms are very small and have to be renovated 2 The air conditioner in our room was leaking 3 The canteen has no windows it s on the 1st floor , 1 Super friendly and very supportive staff 2 Tea and coffee for free 24 7 3 The hotel is located very close to a nice old area of Gracia district where you can find a lot of restaurants and small shops 
335576,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location as next to Metro station into the centre but within walking distance of Gracia and it s facilities Pleasant lounge with coffees and teas available all day 
335577,Pol Grace Hotel, The room was a perfectly functional for a quick overnight stop off but I wouldn t have wanted to stay any longer The width of the room was the size of the double bed which made it claustrophobic The air con wasn t working and the window wouldn t open so it was very hot and stuffy and I slept very badly as a result , The room was modern cool and very clean Staff were very helpful and friendly with great knowledge of the local area and recommendations for dinner for a tired traveler I booked a single room which came with double bed and the bathroom had a bath and shower 
335578,Pol Grace Hotel, The terrace wasn t available because of construction The bathroom was a bit small, Friendly helpful staff The breakfast was decent and the room was super clean 
335579,Pol Grace Hotel, 1 member of stafff was unhelpful and didn t have a great attitude but everyone else was super friendly and complemented the up beat vibe, Loved the fresh complimentary tea comfortable seating bed linen and towels shower good location for Gracia bit of a hike into town but still very accessible by walking bus or metro
335580,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, if i thought the location was perfect just at the exit of two main metro station the moment we got in to the hotel starting from the interior design the reception staff We got after midnight and Cesar was very welcoming and super nice and of course the amazing room Breakfast was splendid very nice high quality food selection Defiantly recommending it for couples

335585,Pol Grace Hotel, The air conditioning didn t work the window only opened a crack I was hot uncomfortable sleeping which wasn t nice , The vibe was nice relaxed homely
335586,Pol Grace Hotel, I didn t like the fact that the Double room had 2 beds rather than 1 but this was just a minor niggle Regarding the area because it is in a more local neighborhood it was difficult to communicate with staff at local restaurants cafes etc outside of the hotel as they had little to no English I also found some the locals to be quite rude and stared quite a bit All the Taxi drivers were extremely rude and no consistency with prices This is more a problem with Barcelona and not the hotel Also Pickpockets are rife in the tourist areas , Staff were extremely helpful and friendly They had an exceptional knowledge of Barcelona beyond typical tourist hoptspots Hotel had a nice modern feel Location to the Pl Catalyuna was only 7mins by metro Area felt safe
335587,Pol Grace Hotel, Would prefer to have a full length mirror Sliding door for cupboard can be a little stiff but not big issue Toilet did not have clothes line for basic laundry and also no face tissue which we just bought it in nearby supermarket , Location was easy to find Check in counter was acceptable even though casual Coffee and tea on the house 24 7 breakfast optional at 12euros croissant were tasty Staff were all friendly especially Cezar he s a know how Always a pleasure talking to him My mum and I love the bedsheets and the length of the pillow We stayed on the 6th floor and it s very peaceful 
335588,Pol Grace Hotel, The free wi fi is techincally free but they extort a like on Facebook out of you for it A like should be because you genuinely like something not because you are trading it for something you should have received anyway Nobody charges for wi fi anymore it s not 1999 , Comfortable clean very nice Excellent location 
335589,Pol Grace Hotel, Position of the room with a small non transparent window no view outside because of this Missing a small table to place the luggage on Missing shower cap , Large bed with quality soft sheets Coffee and the for free Clean and modern facilities 
335590,Pol Grace Hotel, The single room was very small the window was opaque and almost no light or sun The room was next to some room service storage and was noisy There was a noisy door elevator stairs that every time made that noise was like a baby was crying , Needed an hotel in that location at least that worked well 
335591,Pol Grace Hotel, Metro station is far 5 10 minutes walk, Recommended Great place clean bed very comfortable staff available 24h for any needs silent place underground train station very close usefully for connecting with placa Catalunia I ll be back 
335592,Pol Grace Hotel, at check out sunday they had a huge line it would have been better to have more staff during that obviously very busy time Luckily I wasn t in a hurry, previous to staying at the hotel I asked how to best get there and got an immediate very nice and detailed response The hotel is more like a boutique hotel Arriving there feels like staying with friends its wonderful Very nice and smart design clean and friendly and educated staff Check in was fast and easy very helpful with restaurant recommendations etc Room very nice with complimentary water and apples good sorted mini fridge sufficient amenities and the possibility to regulate room temperature it was very cold those days so extra heating was appreciated The breakfast which we took one day was very nice and prepared with a lot of care They have a lobby with self service tea and coffee which is very generous 
335593,Pol Grace Hotel, poorly soundproofed room 306 we heard our neighbors conversations and the drainage, the shower is great cosy clean room free coffee tea auf water in a big comfy lobby
335594,Pol Grace Hotel, The AC was named t working so it was a little hot However the staff provided a fan which helped , The location was perfect not touristy and close by transit if needed The Gracia area is full of history and has a ton of local shops and restaurants to explore

335599,Pol Grace Hotel, The metro station is right next to the hotel but you have to calculate 20 to 30 minutes every time you need to be at a central location , Very comfortable quiet reasonably clean extremely helpful staff and very modern design 
335600,Pol Grace Hotel, We had a room at the back of the hotel the window was made of matted glass so you can t look out Also the breakfast room is in the basement there you share a large table with other guest which was fine as it wasn t very busy but it gives it a bit of a hostel like feel , The room was spacious and clean The bed is huge and very comfortable They present it as a design hotel So the lobby is layed out like a cool hang out There we could enjoy a loose leaf tea or a nice coffee Lots of models stay in the hotel so there are always extremely tall good looking people walking around with makes it feel like you re on a movie set 
335601,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, 2nd stay at this hotel in less than 1 year still a nice place to stay in BCN for our convenience consulate not far close enough to VO cinema plenty of restaurants in the surrounding area close to diffferent public transport services Room 214 offers sufficient living space for 2 people and is pretty quite Can t tell about the breakfast we didn t have it at the hotel Personnel kind and welcoming Shower water pressure is extreme we both liked that 
335602,Pol Grace Hotel, Booked room was not available but easily made up for by a complimentary breakfast , Breakfast was excellent with a wide range of cooked and cold foods Reception was very helpful 
335603,Pol Grace Hotel, Air con in room was broken which made the room SO hot Once we opened the window we then couldnt really sleep due to how noisy traffic and passers by were Curtains are really thin also so it feels like people can see in if you have the light on and it is light during the night due to street lamps Breakfast was lovely the selection however the hot section wasnt kept heated We were the first down in the morning and it was already cold couldnt really enjoy totally cold egg sausages mushrooms etc I d also say it s a bit pricey 12 pp, Amazing location 2 metro stations just round the corner which are so easy to use once you get the hang of where they go Lovely restaurants and cafe s down the same road Staff are so lovely and really helpful especially Cezar he welcomed us and gave us ideas and tips on our stay Reception area lovely very unique and edgy free tea coffee and water etc Rooms lovely huge bed and always spotless Breakfast provides a wide selection of things and always kept topped up Would highly recommend 
335604,Pol Grace Hotel, Welcoming drinking water shall be on during our stay i e everyday not only on the first day , The room is comfortable and relax with spaces 
335605,Pol Grace Hotel, Breakfast could be better the variety of products was quite big but there was no infrastructure to keep warm meals warm cold eggs or sausages ar a bit of dissapointment, Personalised room and many pleasant surprises individual approach Quitness Location was perfect too
335606,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is in a great location away from the touristy center of Barcelona but well connected by buses and metro Recently renovated with a modern feel friendly staff links to art and photography Good variety of restaurants in the area I strongly recommend this hotel 
335607,Pol Grace Hotel, Cleanliness of the room could be improved I Hope bathrooms will soon be refurbished with showers instead of tubs that is the only down point in this hotel , Staff is great and complimentary drinks in the common area 
335608,Pol Grace Hotel, The walls are thin and it s hard to sleep in the morning with all the people walking past the door Big up to the cleaning lady who opened our door at 9AM on a sunday in Barcelona Rooms are pretty small , The location is great in San Gervasi 10 minutes walk to Vila de Gracia Very convenient as every taxi knows Plaza de Molina The hotel is design all black and white with classic records on the wall 
335609,Pol Grace Hotel, For part of the night we had the heating on thinking it was the air conditioning The room was very hot and street noisy with traffic in the evening too noisy to open the window We asked about the a c oh it doesn t work and Staff kindly moved us after a couple of nights to the cooler side of the building which was slightly quieter , Friendly helpful staff Good breakfast large room bath shower Only 2 stops on the Metro from Placa Catalunya Gracia itself is a nice family friendly area with little plazas lots of cafes etc

335611,Pol Grace Hotel, One afternoon we went back for a small rest One male cleaner was just finishing our room After he left we took a shower In about 20 mins two female cleaners opened our door without knocking when we still had no clothing on Lots of screaming as you can imagine The day after we put do not disturb sign on our door they still came to clean our room When we came back the second room card was gone so we had to inform the hotel They were very concerned and made no fuss about the lost room card The above two events together made us feel like there was no privacy no sense of safety Our room has a extra door which is not sealed and probably leads to the neighboring room a bit freaky AC as lots of people mentioned is way too warm and no way to adjust the temperature Too hot that one can not sleep well in the night , All the staff we met in the hotel were friendly and helpful They helped us booking restaurant Free coffee in the lobby Private parking is easy to use 
335612,Pol Grace Hotel, abit far from the center we had to be under the ground allot, the staff at the reception desk are very helpful and friendly we loved them all especially paula who welcomed us and zola
335613,Pol Grace Hotel, Bed poorly made stinky bathroom grease stains on the bed stand feet stains on the bed frame We had to take our wet wipes to clean it ourselves , Nice location nice staff
335614,Pol Grace Hotel, Everything is perfect Don t change anything , I loved each minute spent in this extraordinary and beautiful hotel The room was absolutely stunning I felt like I am in my own room at home Location is fantastic If you want to explore real Catalan life go and walk around Gracia you will find a lot of cafes shops patisseries The staff is so helpful and customer oriented Big thumbs up for Cesar who is such a professional that each hotel should have their own Cesar He gave us so many good tips on how to spend our holiday even more interesting Thank you Cesar so much for your amazing hospitality If I come to Barcelona again this hotel is definitely my choice

335616,Pol Grace Hotel, Wish the room would have had a propwr window that you could actually see through our window was for some reason covered so you couldn t really see outside unless you opened it , Good location and good valie for the price enjoyed the breakfast every morning and staff was friendly
335617,Pol Grace Hotel, It s written about free parking without booking it But that isn t true When we arrived parking was full Although it costs 20 day , Everything was good Clean and comfortable room tasty breakfast 
335618,Pol Grace Hotel, The sink in my room seemed to be clogged Water drained slowly But it didn t bother me too much , Excellent location So close to Pl Molina Station and walkable distance to Fontana Station Lots of caf s and grocery stores nearby Safe neighborhood and out of the touristy areas but still very easy to reach to the touristy ones Took me 25 mins to walk at a moderate pace from the hotel to Av Diagonal along Gran de Gracia street if you keep walking you eventually get to the strip where all the high end designer brands are Staff was friendly and helpful 
335619,Pol Grace Hotel, Lack of bar at the hotel so you could sit down and have a drink in the evening , Everything fantastic experience staff were friendly and unlimited free coffee

335621,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, The Pol and Grace Hotel is a very pleasant place and you feel comfortable the moment you enter it The staff is not only very friendly but also tries to help with everything The rooms are modern and well equipped 
335622,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, There is nothing negative to say about this hotel and the staff were extremely friendly Whilst the location is about 20 mins walk from the city centre it is next to the Metro and the walk through the lively street is enjoyable The room was extremely clean and the bed very comfortable and the fact there was free tea and coffee available at any time was a bonus
335623,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, Pol and Grace is an adorable hotel In reality it looks even better than what it is shown in the photos All the people that work there are caring calm and helpful I loved the aroma the place had it made me feel very peaceful and relaxed The room was very comfortable clean and decorated with taste As the other guests have mentioned there is delicious coffee tea and water in the lobby available all the time for free As coffee lovers this detail made us very happy The food that was offered for breakfast was fresh and tasty The only thing that I would suggest to the staff is to try and keep the scrambled eggs and sausages warm during the whole breakfast period The area is very quiet and beautiful There are metro and bus stations near by We preferred walking and it was very easy to get around Getting from the hotel to the famous Park Guell took us 25 minutes by foot If we ever have the chance to be in Barcelona again we would look for no other place 
335624,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, Staff extremely friendly and happy Good selection for breakfast Clean throughout 2 minute walk to metro where you can travel anywhere in Barcelona from 
335625,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, Good location in a good district outside of the hustle and bustle of the city center comfortable and easy 20 min walk to Passeig de Gracia The staff was so friendly and welcoming Lobby was comfortable and the self service bar is a great idea 
335626,Pol Grace Hotel, Nothing Agree with some other reviews that it would be nice to have chairs and tables on the roof terrace that we only found on the last morning , This is a fab hotel Great location right next to Molina metro Modern and clean room with a big bathroom for a city hotel The staff at this hotel could not be nicer and it is very clear that customer service and satisfaction is high on their list of priorities We really enjoyed the breakfast each morning and we felt there was plenty of choice The tea and coffee in the reception area is a nice touch and there are lovely wine glasses if you are like us and like a bottle of wine in our room in the evenings Fridge in the room also helped with this A great stay cannot thank pol and grace enough 
335627,Pol Grace Hotel, Breakfast could have some more hot items, I have already begun to ooh aah about Pol Grace to my friends Being an architect there was a lot to be appreciated From the informal comfortable setting checkin desk being just a designer table was awesome Tea Coffee vending machine free in the Lounge area Books Artwork and Souvenirs for sale inconspicuously Room Decor we had an old portable tv as a display item Most helpful and courteous front desk staff I could go on Location in close proximity to Metro Train
335628,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, Excellent choice for those travelling either for leisure or business on a tight budget The area is safe and you can easily reach the city center on foot it takes approximately 30 minutes Alternatively you can take the metro it s only few stops away from Catalunya Square 
335629,Pol Grace Hotel, Location could be better but it s not that bad at all still not too far from city Center , Staffs are really friendly and very welcoming Rooms are so clean and fresh with a huge comfy bed 
335630,Pol Grace Hotel, too hot in the rooms even we have closed the heating the room was too hot the air conditioning did not work, nice decoration of hotel rooms very confortable bed close to metro station free coffee tea very friendly staff 
335631,Pol Grace Hotel, The window didn t have a curtain only shutters that were a bit difficult to close , Great hotel with big clean rooms and comfy beds The staff is super friendly everyone has a good level of English 
335632,Pol Grace Hotel, No cons , Ir is a four star exellent plase which has a warm atmosphere and pefect petsonel They will tel you where to go what to do and what not t do There is breacfast wifi and all you need The price is good I have bern in many hotels around europe and this is the best so far RECCOMEND 
335633,Pol Grace Hotel, Although there is unlimited access to tea coffee in the lounge area they don t have any in the room Iron has to be requested for heating function is basic bathroom looked tired and not as clean the bed is a generous size but it doesn t have a duvet simply had a thin cover like a bed sheet which I thought was odd Breakfast very basic indeed not worth paying for I was surprised it had such a high rating I personally wouldn t return and it s not a 4 star outfit it s a 3 star venue at best Transport links are good but away from all the key places Overall it was an average experience , General decor in the eating area was pleasant and the staff were welcoming on arrival 
335634,Pol Grace Hotel, The only thing that annoyed us was the poor soundproofing of the room Early in the morning we could hear conversations and doors banging I feel that in a touristic season that could be a problem , Very close about 80 metres to 2 metro stations Placa Molina Sant Gervasi In only 10 minutes you arrive at Placa Catalunya Nice and quiet neighborhood Really nice and smiling staff A very clean modern hotel definitely a good option We would surely stay there again 
335635,Pol Grace Hotel, Wi Fi speed is too slow , Near by metro station bus station shopping stree and the bed is soo big and I slept comfortable Bakery store coffee shop every where 
335636,Pol Grace Hotel, For a person who likes to walk the location won t be that good but you can use the metro station so it s not a problem , The helpful and friendly staff all of them were great The air conditione system like all Barcelona hotels in winter been switched off but they gave me a fan and it did the job The Room so clean and i liked that each room has it own theme
335637,Pol Grace Hotel, I wasn t expecting much but I just didn t think it deserved the price we paid during offseason Rooms were pretty cold AC wasn t working properly , Literally 1 minute walk away from a subway station Rooms were clean Staff were nice 
335638,Pol Grace Hotel, The breakfast it was poor They didn t replace eggs bacon croissants etc , The bed shower were good and the room quiet Internet worked quit good too The location is good near the metro 
335639,Pol Grace Hotel, Not much problem but it would be good if there were more varierities at breakfast, All the front office staff were amazing especially night shift responsible Zola they were always willing to help and answered our questions in a friendly manner Concept of hotel general situation about facilitiy and rooms were all amazing We also liked the free coffee tea and water service at reception We can definitely decide to stay again in our future visits 
335640,Pol Grace Hotel, Stayed for 5 nights breakfast time became very busy most mornings during our stay The staff were normally very helpful and kept restocking the food there was just one morning when things did not go so well guests were waiting around for food drink , Asked for quiet room and got one Very pleasant modern and spacious room with a large comfortable bed Situation was very good near to public transport for Barcelona centre also close to local shops bars restaurants and within walking distance of Gracia 
335641,Pol Grace Hotel, Nothing really Hotel was very good for our purposes , The staff was really helpful There was a minor problem with the installations that required their attention and their response to it was wonderful Congratulations 
335642,Pol Grace Hotel, It would have been great if they d had a nice roof terrace The space is there but it has no tables and chairs to sit and relax , The location was away from the tourist areas so nice and quiet but also very easy to get to the Ramblas The bed was huge and super comfortable Free tea and coffee in reception was great too 
335643,Pol Grace Hotel, I felt it was slightly over priced as it is more of a boutique hotel then a luxury hotel This was fine with me just thought the price could reflect that a little bit more Bed linens were a bit rough and bed a bit hard But overall still slept quite well so can t complain too much , The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful I loved the location The area seemed calmer and less touristy then other parts of the city yet there was still alot of great cafe s restaurants and shopping near by Super close to the metro and easy to reach all sight seeing areas by metro or by foot The hotel had a nice relaxing feel to it I felt comfortable hanging out in the lobby and enjoying the complimentary tea coffee Loved the unique boutique feel of the place 
335644,Pol Grace Hotel, Hot breakfast items were not great Scrambled egg was cold and rubbery Traffic noise was a bit loud at times but not too bad, Nice large size well decorated room Staff super friendly and helpful 
335645,Pol Grace Hotel, Noise noise noise Supposedly soundproof rooms but all we could hear was the traffic and people in the street as well as the corridors and rooms above and at the sides The linen was dirty and bath towels were so old they had holes in them , Location and staff were friendly 
335646,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, Very nice modernly designed hotel without useless luxury warm reception extremely friendly staff everything is fine room breakfast lobby service Thanx 
335647,Pol Grace Hotel, You have to take care of the guests peace happen disruptive drunken guests Breakfast can be better more rich for the price Overall I would recommend , Best in the hotel are the ladies from the front desk Hotel for the money the average a little tired but very comfortable beds and clean The problem is parking and charge for it Service very nice Caesar nice helpful guy 
335648,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, It was like being home away from home The staff Julian Paula Cesar and the rest of the staff made our stay comfortable They were very helpful and accommodating We love Barcelona
335649,Pol Grace Hotel, Few more tv English channels and some movie options , Staff went above and beyond to help Cosy yet contemporary feel Free coffee The most powerful shower I have EVER used I couldn t even handle the full force Metro right outside and a good range of restaurants 
335650,Pol Grace Hotel, I still wonder how this could be a 4 star hotel It is the worse I have ever seen and overall a 3 star hotel would be much better It was lacking cleaning the toillet had dark spots the tub was with mold the bathroom floor was not wet clean for long There was not enough light in the bathroom so it was hard to shave your legs or put on some make up There were so many things missing to a 4 star hotel including the gym We have booked this hotel room because it was bigger than the average rooms in the other hotels but we were surprised to see it was actually much smaller I believe they count the bathroom area while the other hotels don t basically we had 50 to 100 cm around our bed and that was all The amenities were awful I ended up buying my own shower gel I will never book this hotel again and I would also advise everyone to stay away if they expect to get a 4 star comfort It is simply not fair , The only good thing was the free coffee in the afternoon and the friendly stuff The loby area has agood vibe 
335651,Pol Grace Hotel, They provide coffee all day on ground floor but not having a kettle to make my on in my pjs at night or early morning is a miss , Staff room and overall hotel is great 
335652,Pol Grace Hotel, The hair dryer very simple not enough to dry properly , Situated in very nice and quiet place Around nice restaurants and bars where you can eat breakfast and not only Undegraund just around the corner Close to Gracia Center 
335653,Pol Grace Hotel, Breakfast selection wasn t great but maybe appropriate for 9 We found better choice by heading to the supermarket cafes on the same street , The location is excellent On a non touristy quiet street on the fringe of the Gra ia region Very close to 2 metro stops Pl Molina Fontana which serve the main tourist spots of Barcelona 30minutes walk to Park G ell Room was modern clean quiet and spacious enough for 2 people Bathroom wasn t particularly modern although completely adequate but I sense these facilities are being updated Staff were very friendly and helpful I ll definitely return to Pol Grace when I m back in Barcelona

335655,Pol Grace Hotel, Breakfast is very expansive with regard to the options just outside the hotel two of the night shift receptionists were very unhelpful and gave us a feeling that we are bothering them actually this is why we couldnt buy train tickets from advance and had to pay almost double price at the train station shuld be noted that they were exeptions , The STAFF was AMAZING so kind and considerate asking questions not just for politness but really in order to know you and the service they give you for plannig your evening or even your whole week and many good recomandations for food and acrivities ALEXANDRA and ASTRID were the best receptionists we ever met the best of the best kind warm and very helpful we like every thing the room so nicely decorated the price so fair and pays off the location just next to a wonerfull neighborhood the last fortress of local Catalans in center Barcelona and above and beyond all THE STAFF as we noted above

335666,Pol Grace Hotel, Poor wi fi in the room Boring breakfast very poor choice Construction works that we could hear each morning bad sound isolation , Located in a very authentic district actually the area is known to be occupied by millionaires at a distance from major touristic lanes Coffee facilities in the lobby you can make a take away coffee when leaving the hotel in the morning Nice design Helpful staff

335670,Pol Grace Hotel, The size of the room was a little small for 3 people I would not recommend it for a long stay if you are more than 2 guests , Reception staff breakfast location

335682,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, Location is great right on the edge of the Gracia area which is a real local suburb of Barcelona Loads of great bars and restaurants on your doorstep Metro station literally 30 seconds from the front door Super super friendly staff probably the most outstanding feature of this hotel Modern rooms relatively simple Does the trick perfectly for a weekend

335686,Pol Grace Hotel, My room was smaller than expected and noisy from the cleaning staff that has a closed side by side with my room , The cleanliness of the room the breakfast served until 11 00 and the staff 
335687,Pol Grace Hotel, We walked in and there were two insects in the bathroom not a really big deal The bed was very creeky and was so loud it would wake me up so I had to try to stay still when we slept The safe wasn t working either and we were really didn t have time to wait around for it to be fixed so we locked out important belongings in our suitcase On the last night the Internet wasn t workin get My husband called reception who explained to keep trying it might start working Not satisfied with this I called back and was told that the problem had been reported but they could do nothing else Apparently their internet worked because their computer was connected to the Internet via a wire but the wifi wasn t working Ok I was annoyed but not the end of the world I went on to ask for some more water we had received a bottle on our first day but it hasn t been replenished I was told it was a welcome gift and if I wanted anymore water I had to come to reception and use a communal tap or take the bottles from the ridiculously overpriced mini bar I asked whether wifi was a gift too As that only seemed to work properly for one day Not sensing the sarcasim the evening receptionist was incredibly rude and did not try to solve the issue at hand I told him I would be writing a negative negative review and he didn t seem to mind A word of warning to the owners employ staff with some compassion and business sense A small bottle of water costs you pennies but the refusal to supply anymore water remember this is a 4 hotel has made me remember all the other faults on this hotel post a negative review and ensure none of my family or friends never return , The location was ok The night reception person was great when we checked in It was relatively clean 
335688,Pol Grace Hotel, Terrace needs to be utilised only place to chill out is in the foyer , Bed really comfy and breakfasts great Good location near a train line Very helpful with my gluten free food requests 
335689,Pol Grace Hotel, Breakfast too expensive 10 euros per person Our room was half the size of the one they gave to our friends at the same price and you should assure you first not to be given one at the first floor because rooms there are unavoidably noisy , Coffee and water for free almost 24h 7 If you forget something that you need for your toilet a brush a nail file etc the staff will provide for it with no extra charges The atmosphere of the place was in whole fresh and very easy going 
335690,Pol Grace Hotel, Everything was wonderful except one little tiny thing the hairdryer He was really low , I really liked this place The hotel is located perfectly for sightseeingtours Not far from Park G ell You can reach the next metro station just in one minute The staff was really nice and helpful Really liked the furniture in my room Very luxury and cozy 
335691,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, I needed help with forgotten stuff they help me instantly and with fairness The stuff answered my email very quick and with care thank you
335692,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, lovely hotel in a nice quiet location with easy metro access What I most loved was the helpfulness and willingness of all the staff to provide useful information suggestions when asked Loved my first time in Barcelona and really enjoyed staying at this hotel x
335693,Pol Grace Hotel, There isn t Coffee automat in the room , Location is super Nearby very good transport to city centre airoport beaches Breakfest room bathroom wifi in room staf all were good 
335694,Pol Grace Hotel, Nothing , Location comfort spacious bathroom massive super comfortable bed amazingly quiet given the c ntric location very warm ntimate place We will use it again 
335695,Pol Grace Hotel, None, Wow Highly recommended Great staff Simple but very classy decor Neat and clean With Boudoir Breakfast is simple but palatable Walking distance to restaurants grocery shops and to the gothic area Very quiet neighborhood A very unique place to stay
335696,Pol Grace Hotel, It s a good location as its next to a metro but you ll have to pay double to transfer to other metro lines , Felt right at home The experience was really great the staff was really friendly and willing to help at all times You can ask them about restaurants and things to do 
335697,Pol Grace Hotel, This boutique hotel doesn t compare to any other 4 star hotel we ve stayed in The facilities resemble maybe a 2 3 no proper facilities really at all I had emailed for a double bed and it was confirmed This was not the case on arrival and it had to be changed The bed was 2 singles pushed together and thy didn t fit together properly So I ended up falling into the gap most of the night which may sound amusing to some but I can assure you this was not a recipe for a good nights sleep We were awoken at 8 am by very loud banging and drilling as there is Major Building work going on right next door in fact was right across from our room and vein with earplugs the noise was beyond acceptable There should be a warning on the website as if we would have known about the noise we would never have booked this hotel I kind of f el like we have been a little duped , The reception staff during the day were very welcoming and helpful 
335698,Pol Grace Hotel, Rooms very small Definitely not a 4 star No sound proofing for both outside construction and corridor noise Housekeeping just opened the room while I was sleeping without knocking and opening the door that was double locked When complained the reception could just say sorry as if it the everyday thing Guess outsourcing untrained people is a reason Not value for money for this hotel , The reception staff very friendly and helpful Would go the extra mile to help which these days is forgotten in many 4 5 hotels Only suggestion would be to have additional staff at noon which could ease the pressure on the team 
335699,Pol Grace Hotel, wifi connection sometimes bad but okay very near to metro station but need to move everytime to go tourist spot, cozy and neat room helpful staff nice stay
335700,Pol Grace Hotel, It was our third stay in this hotel In the past we was very satisfied and recommended on it Unfortunately this time we were disappointed very much We got a small room without closet It was very uncomfortable , The Design is wonderful and original 
335701,Pol Grace Hotel, The room was too small The breakfast was ok , It was clean The staff were great The coffee of the lobby was great and you could have it anytime there was a metro station right next to the hotel and you could reach wherever you want to go 
335702,Pol Grace Hotel, Breakfast seemed a bit expensive so we opted out , The whole vibe of the hotel is amazing Loved the complimentary coffee machine And the bar Lounge area was very relaxing and the rooms were very cool Definitely recommended Pol Grace to friends 
335703,Pol Grace Hotel, Most of the rooms had shaded or non transparent Windows which makes you feel claustrophobic I have never seen any hotel s window like that For the price that is not acceptable and if they wouldn t have changed the room I wouldn t stayed there even if I had to pay for another hotel I would have been gone But my freinds endured it but unhappy Plus the hair dryer was just a blowe Over all I would not go there again , The location was good and the fact that it was few meters from metro was great 
335704,Pol Grace Hotel, Paper thin walls had lots of noise Facility has no climate control It is all or none for the building so we were roasting for days because it was cool outside , Great beds very helpful and friendly front desk staff 
335705,Pol Grace Hotel, Room has a poor view window can not be opened so you have impression that you are pretty much isolated , Fist of all hotel has great location Beautiful part of the city not so crowded with tourists located very near to the metro and bus station Also it is nice walk if you want to go to la rambla street Hotel staff is also very helpfull 
335706,Pol Grace Hotel, Bathroom could be better and a bit more cleaner Also more breakfast options needed for non meat eaters , Room was good and the hotel was nice quirky 
335707,Pol Grace Hotel, The room was like a prison very small for a 4 stars hotel and the price it sucks the Internet didn t work in my room I don t know how come this hotel is rated 4 stars I wouldn t give it more than 2, It was clean
335708,Pol Grace Hotel, The level of service was quite variable and there were a number of occasions where request were not followed up There were no coffee making facilities in the rooms , The decor and layout of this hotel is original and delightful and the location is excellent The communal seating arrangements for breakfast are fun and the food is great
335709,Pol Grace Hotel, Traveling with 3 children and specifying it in the order form you would expect to get adjacent rooms even if the comments failed to show a specific request didn t happen only after much deliberation did we get rooms on the same floor and a next day move to a closer room that was smaller that the original we had or at least felt that way A breakfast itinerary posted on the elevator s mirror during the night and state clearly that breakfast was until 11 AM all 5 of us saw it when we returned from the football game around midnight was wiped clean the next morning and the staff claimed it was removed during the afternoon it wasn t and that the breakfast had ended at 10 leaving us helpless when we came to eat at 10 30 remembering that the post said 11 , some of the crew were very helpful nice clean relatively big rooms located 1 minute from the metro station and a few nice coffee shops and restaurants
335710,Pol Grace Hotel, The way the handling of payment was a little strange in that even though Booking com said the hotel could take up to 30 from booking they took it the day after we arrived from a card I didn t want to use therefore leaving the rest on balance of leaving Would have been better to confirm discuss on checking in Seemed to be some difference in between the hotel and booking com on the actual booking details They ran out of the DIY cocktail making items once such as lime etc That s it , Just the fact it was a different feel to a hotel much more independent and different Loved the relaxed feel of the lobby and reception with it s free coffee tea and cocktail making DIY area Great relaxed seating there too The room was so relaxing and the bed one of the most comfortable we ve ever slept in in a hotel Everywhere was very clean and the staff very friendly 
335711,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, We had a lovely big and clean room with a babybed inside The Hotel is exactely as it is shown on the Pictures perfect The Hotel is located just some few meters away from a Metro Station The area around the Hotel is very safe and nice The staff is very friendliy and helpful The breakfast is delicious with a large selection of Food Just great 
335712,Pol Grace Hotel, It is classed as a 4 star hotel and says that the rooms are sound proofed but yet the pillows were so soft it was pointless even having them and we could hear the people in the room next door talking and when They opened and closed their door our room shook Then when we asked to change room the staff said they would come and tell us if it was possible but never came to tell us The room was so cold and when we asked to ow to turn the heat up they told us it wasnt possible as its an old hotel on one system and so from March to October it is set to cool and can t be changed The vending machine was empty every day of our 5 day stay If this was a 3 star hotel I d be ok but we booked and paid for a three stay and this is anything but , The breakfast was nice The room was clean
335713,Pol Grace Hotel, As with all hotels in the city there is road noise and noise from other rooms but once I had ear plugs in I was ok Hotel issue wall mounted hairdryer in the bathroom was useless for my long hair so I was pleased I brought my own , Good location for train journey out of the city Room was spotlessly clean bright and well lit which is rare in hotels nowadays I loved the quirky design with each room having a different theme Really comfy bed The shower had great water pressure Good selection for breakfast Staff friendly and helpful 
335714,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, Everything was great the location is perfect the room was clean and well designed The staff was very welcome thank you Caesar all the other 
335715,Pol Grace Hotel, The wifi was so so I lost connection several times and had to reconnect There was no gym in the hotel although we knew that before so we only have ourselves to blame , Very responsive kind and helpful staff at any time of the day both in the lobby and over internet The hotel was beautifully decorated with lots design The restaurants nearby were good and the general area that the hotel was situated in had a very nice atmosphere 
335716,Pol Grace Hotel, While the single room is spacious the shower towel seemed smaller than standard size and overused Bed frame has sharp edges this could hurt if you fall against them , Spacious single room 
335717,Pol Grace Hotel, we paid for 3 breakfasts but stayed just 2 nights something wrong it was not pleasant stuff wasn t nice and friendly, very nice hotel and interior
335718,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, In fact everything The hotel is adjacent to the metro and in walking distance from Gracia where you can find nice restaurants The staff is very helpfull The rooms are nice large clean and well equipped This was the third time that I stayed here and surely it will not be the last one 
335719,Pol Grace Hotel, Pricing I booked with you No de reserva 930 254 336 a rate of 679 incl breakfast we had one breakfast less minus 10 50 so the total should be 668 50 But the invoice without the extras for drinks but I had to pay 773 50 what is 105 more than the price offered by booking com Asking why the price was so different the staff told me that the room pricing is not fix but related to the occupancy of the hotel I find this is a very strange politic and wnat to ask you if you can contact the hotel for a refund of the 105 overpaid the room prices have been 102 102 144 138 and 193 , good breakfast
335720,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, Pol Grace is my home away from home in Barcelona The hotel is cozy and inviting that staff was professional and friendly the rooms were comfortable and clean and its location was safe and easy access to all the treasures that the city of Barcelona offers 
335721,Pol Grace Hotel, I couldn t get the safe in the room to work But I didn t call reception and ask for help either That s it It was a very good stay , The tea centre in the lounge The lounge A very comfortable bed Nice hot shower Good sized bedroom Very clean A bottle of water and apples in the room

335723,Pol Grace Hotel, Lots of noise on both nights with loud doors lots of guests speaking loudly Only downsode of stay , Great location and breakfast was fab Huge beds and very friendly staff 
335724,Pol Grace Hotel, Walls definitely too thin you hear well the neighbors if they speak a bit loud A bit expensive for what it is , Good location far from tourist crowds but close to Gracia and metro stations nice lobby and very friendly personal decoration is modern and clean huge bed free water tea coffee apples 
335725,Pol Grace Hotel, Wifi was very slow at times booked a triple room but was more like a double with an extra bed in the corner not much to do in terms of hanging out at hotel, The location was great right next to metro the hotel is very modern ten minute walk from gracia which is perfect for shopping and bars restraunts etc
335726,Pol Grace Hotel, At times it felt the hotel was understaffed for peak periods at most two the front desk , For the price the room is new and clean from the bedding to interior decor each room has a motif such as the 1982 World Cup for room while the breakfast buffet includes a variety of fresh fruit cheeses and breads Staff sincere and like many Spaniards capable English speakers Also good location in a residential area and once learned easily reached by subway 
335727,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, We had an excellent stay in Pol Grace hotel The staff is really nice and they make you feel welcome Room is spacious and nicely furnished Location is convenient and the neighborhood is nice We will come back again for out next visit in Barcelona 
335728,Pol Grace Hotel, Missing the fact that there was no bar or restaurant to have a snack outside of breakfast time , Georgeus design and very comfortable Steps from metro station easy to get to Staff very friendly 
335729,Pol Grace Hotel, Soundproofing of the corridor area was not so good and when people checked in late and were not considerate of others the noise can disturb your sleep , Pol Grace is located within a 25 minute walk to the city centre The staff are extremely helpful and even offered to hold our luggage and allowed us to park our car in the secure parking area when we arrived before the check in time Although a little way out of the centre the walk is easy with lots of interesting things to see along the way Breakfast each morning was very good with lots of choice from cooked eggs to fruit and yoghurts 
335730,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, Location is great just 2 minutes from the metro station breakfast is excellent staff is incredible helpful and the small details from inside the hotel makes you feel like home 
335731,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, Staff was so helpful and gracious I mentioned that I was celebrating my engagement and when we arrived they had decorated the room with balloons and love quotes Very memorable The hotel is a comfortable place with lots of areas to sit and visit outside of the room Perfect neighborhood for easy access to metro and great restaurants within one block 
335732,Pol Grace Hotel, it was good breakfast but not as expected compared with the level of hotel they should upgrade the breakfast and add more verity of food all other things are perfect, i liked the smell in the lobby i still remember it very very clean hotel very organised modern comfortable and in quiet place not far from the Pla a Catalunya The staff is very friendly and young energetic youths they are very helpful too this hotel gave the trip feeling like home highly recommended for economic young and solo travellers not the type of hotels for families with noisy children 
335733,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, Everything was exelent We were there before the holiday so the price was also good Liked very much the modern design It is not in the center but the metro is next to it A very nice area cafes and restaurants around 
335734,Pol Grace Hotel, For the price there were nothing not to like , The hotel appearance was modest and modern Its location is great not in the central of catalunya place but close enough to enjoy all the city have to offer The subway is literally a minute walk from the hotel entrance and there are a few restaurants and stores in the immediate areas Overall great stay great hotel 
335735,Pol Grace Hotel, I expected much better quality toiletry from a 4 star hotel instead of the stuff provided Should ve known to bring my own shampoo and conditioner , Easy access to transportation not in touristy area more local feel of Barcelona
335736,Pol Grace Hotel, I think that the breakfast is expensive regarding to what was offered on the table And the rooms are not as sound proof as it is written , The artistic atmosphere of the hotel The stuff was great too Really loved our stay there Hope that we can go back sometime 
335737,Pol Grace Hotel, We stayed on the first floor and could hear guest walking down the corridor late at night early morning The noise did not bother us too much as we were heavy sleepers but might be an issue for light sleepers However I would stay at the hotel again due to the friendly staff convenient location there s a few patisseries located down the same street near the hotel , Friendly helpful staff The breakfast buffet 10 pp had a good selection with homemade granola The hotel is located within 1min walk from Pl molina metro station very convenient to hop on public transport and travel around Barcelona city We arrived on New Year s Eve and received complimentary glass of cava which was a nice surprise The hotel lobby was open design it felt like we were staying at someone s home which was a nice feeling The dining area was meticulously designed to give a contemporary atmosphere for relaxed dining 
335738,Pol Grace Hotel, They gave me two individual beds put together and not an actual queen or full size bed it was very annoying , Location It is very close to the FGC and Bus stops that take you directly to the heart of BCN 
335739,Pol Grace Hotel, Room was too warm AC not on in winter and had to open window at night which then made sleep difficult because of road noise Staff provided a fan the next day which was useful , Close to metro in a mostly residential area with decent eating places around 
335740,Pol Grace Hotel, Generally I was satisfied with value for money regarding Pol and Grace , Quite good location to access main touring sites in Barcelona Near the hotel there is excellent Japaness restaurant named Usagui 
335741,Pol Grace Hotel, It is definitely not a 4 star hotel bcz you expect a larger room a water heater boiling machine an iron especially when you plan to stay for a long time The bathroom lack the basic ear cotton hair cover tissues etc and the hair dryer was not good very weak , Very good location Near a metro station Value for Money
335742,Pol Grace Hotel, The location is close to the Metro but you should transfer trains for going to many famous spots, This hotel is great People are very kind and reply all of questions very fast if I go to Barcelona again I will use this hotel again 
335743,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, Personal touch got free water and two apples I m a sucker for those things Like the post its and the different small details Homely place would like to stay there again when I go to BCN 
335744,Pol Grace Hotel, Not much The only down is that the place is a bit far from the city center but we preferred that to be honest to explore the real Catalan streets of Barcelona And if you are not a walker type the metro station is just 30 meters away , A very clean and kinda new hotel with friendly staff They give pretty good advises 
335745,Pol Grace Hotel, there was only one thing there wasn t a microwave that s only because I like my things redhot , There was always somebody there if you needed anything the staff were really nice and smiley and the waiter for breakfast couldn t do enough for you And there are good shops around and plenty of places to eat and we are near a tube station 
335746,Pol Grace Hotel,No Negative, The Staff was extremly friendly and the Hotel itself was super stylish and clean They even surprised me with a birthday surprise Thank you again dear Pol Grace Team 
335747,Pol Grace Hotel, Bathroom tub could have been cleaner There was no info on the hotel in our room how to call front desk or wifi code We would have loved to see get buy a brochure with the story of the hotel It was clearly and nicely described on the hallways and breakfast area but we didn t have enough time to see it all There s an idea , Location decoration the overall feeling and staff was great Breakfast Having a nice lobby area with tea and coffee 
335748,Pol Grace Hotel, Bad wi fi asked for queen bad got twin which was annoying Air conditioning was easy to handle No other facilities Coffee machine only worked after breakfast , The location right on the tram metro Rooms and hotel was clean and simple 
335749,Pol Grace Hotel, Price But Barcelona acc is expensive, Staff so so so nice Very helpful and will bend over backwards for you The two girls at reception we re great Location 15 minute walk from La Rambles Breakfast Style The chalk board on what to do see in Barca great idea
335750,Pol Grace Hotel, That I had to come back to Moscow , It s a very cozy suitable nice and bright place feels like home and very fashion Loved this place and definitely will come back Stuff is also great very nice people there re always ready to help you 
335751,Pol Grace Hotel, We thought that the room was a bit dirty and overall even though we had a good time it was a bit too expensive , Te room has a very comfortable size and the wi fi was great The location is convenient right next to the Subway 
335752,Pol Grace Hotel, we got a room on the first floor very close to the lobby Definitely not the best location for the room as pedestrians from the street were able to look in Go for higher floor , Very close to the subway modern design underground parking comfortable bed
