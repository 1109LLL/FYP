501153,Strandhotel Alte Donau, nothing All good , The breakfast was excellent The property is only 5 mins walk from train station With good free parking onsite close to public transport you could go forget your car Billa supermarket right next door big shopping mall 10mins walk 
501154,Strandhotel Alte Donau, Proximity to the main road for some of the rooms could hear traffic noise when window was open , Very good breakfast very nice bathroom spacious accommodation good location outside touristical area close to the river very close to the airport bus shuttle and 5 7 minutes work to the underground station 
501155,Strandhotel Alte Donau, No elevator No dinner available Room style is not my taste The location is 2 sided you are close to the water BUT the street is loud and the area is not that nice , The staff were extra friendly and always asked if we needed anything They were very considerate of our young children as well The room was very large and super clean Fresh towels daily 
501156,Strandhotel Alte Donau, Wifi connectivity could have been a bit better it did drop out on occasion Reconnects quickly though , Fantastic clean and well maintained Located very close to public transport Great staff who were friendly and helpful Has a warm and cosy feel to it one feels very cared for Breakfast superb 
501157,Strandhotel Alte Donau,No Negative, We had a very nice stay at this hotel which is very conveniently located just outside the centre of Vienna The staff at the hotel were also very helpful 
501158,Strandhotel Alte Donau,No Negative, Very friendly helpful staff newly refurbished room overlooking the river lovely breakfast with opportunity to sit outside close to underground station with an easy journey into central Vienna 
501159,Strandhotel Alte Donau, There was no air conditioning in the room although an electric fan was provided We didn t open a window because the traffic was quite noisy outside , The owners and staff were extremely helpful and the hotel was very clean and inviting The room was bright and modern with a large comfortable bed 
501160,Strandhotel Alte Donau, Fortunately still not an issue but having no elevator is a handicap The room was well isolated but an air conditioning would be welcome Decoration in the rooms is dull , Everybody from the staff is very professional cooperative and available The breakfast is very good and plenty of freshness and variety The beds are fine The hotel has a great view over the Danube and the UN city and it s very close to subway and bus stops And it s just four stops away from the centre The free wi fi works fine in the rooms and there s free parking for the guests They easily arrange for transfer to the airport at a reasonable rate 
501161,Strandhotel Alte Donau,No Negative, The room was modern comfortable and very clean Staff helpful and accommodating Location was excellent close enough to city centre without the noise of the downtown core 
501162,Strandhotel Alte Donau, air conditioner did not work in the beginning of April, responsive and kind personnel picturesque and calm location next to the track does not prevent
501163,Strandhotel Alte Donau, Can t think of anything really, Very helpful and kind staff We had a spacious ground floor room with a little garden Standard quiet room with all usual facilities nothing fancy but clean Breakfast is also standard but including in the room price Private parking is free of charge Five minutes walk to the nearest U1 metro station 7 minutes to the Stephens Platz Very convenient position for an fast and easy access to the city centre 
501164,Strandhotel Alte Donau, Nothing, Everything We felt exactly like home it was our first journey with our little girl who has 4 months and the owner give her a little gift when we left the hotel It was a really nice gesture and we definitely will return back Thanks for everything The breakfast was also excellent
501165,Strandhotel Alte Donau, I would have prefered not carpeting in the room or hallways Some drawers to accommodate my clothes better The latter was not a problem but it could have been if I was sharing the room with another person Not their fault but it would be nice if the shuttle coming from the airport stopped across the road The bus stop is 250m or more from the property , The room was comfortable well lighted and so was the washroom The satff was friendly and the breakfast they offered was also good The location was good for my needs but it would have been also good if one wanted to travel to the centre of Vienna You are just 250m from the subway station 
501166,Strandhotel Alte Donau, For a solo traveler who is not very familiar with the area it may not be the best choice A little far from the city center but close to a train station if you are comfortable with that , Amazingly pleasant staff and super clean facilities I really enjoyed my time there I would not trade the experience for something else I got exposed to the hospitable culture of Viennese people there 
501167,Strandhotel Alte Donau, The breakfast was really meager very few option s and very little amounts of what was offered The towels where spotless clean but of a really cheap standard No air conditioning and we didn t get a fan until the sixth day of our stay although it was between 31 38 degrees Their was one nice member of staff but most weren t I wouldn t go back there and I certainly wouldn t recommend it My daughter stayed their for a month as she was on an elective and her room was awful She was told for the money she was paying that was the best room she could have she paid more than us and there were two of us It was all about the profit margin not about the customer Overall we were all very disappointed , The hotel was spotless as was the cleanliness of the linen etc
