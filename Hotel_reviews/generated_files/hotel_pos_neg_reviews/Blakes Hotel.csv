151965,Blakes Hotel, The tv wasn t working The floor was very sticky The blanket has a cigarette burn We order hot drinks late night and they forgot about it, The decor and the interiors was amazing The morning staff was very nice and professional When we complain about the night staff service they reduce all the room services charges
151966,Blakes Hotel, The lovely little back garden closes at 8pm It s such a shame to have to go inside on a sunny London evening , A luxurious little treat in the middle of one of the best areas of London There are two Tube stations shopping pubs and restaurants and the Victoria and Albert Museum all within easy walking distance 
151967,Blakes Hotel, Bed was not great Didn t feel room was that clean old and dated Whole thing didn t feel fresh , Nice meal friendly staff reasonable price Very busy a bit dated and past it s best for atmosphere Hotel all black and gold decor throughout musty smell and old Def past it s best but quirky 
151968,Blakes Hotel, Bed and size of room Quality of bread over breakfast, Bedroom was extremely small for two people although balcony was nice and bed although nice to look at very uncomfortable to sleep in No space for two suitcases if two people want to move around the room too Breakfast was disappointing I ordered poached eggs on sourdough toast The toast was hard as stone and barely edible 
151969,Blakes Hotel, Love the birds on view when you arrive although the chirping is disconcerting at first Not happy bird chirping , Friendly front desk very comfy bed great people watching Lunch delish cool downstairs restaurant with late night bar food 
151970,Blakes Hotel, The rooms were appointed in a cool unique fashion however the floors were creaky the lighting was very dark the bath tub shower was difficult to go in and out of Shower flow always made bathroom floor slippery wet Also kept bumping my head on closet shelf Cool room but kind of dangerous , The front desk was friendly and very helpful accommodating at all hours of the day Restaurant service was excellent too Felt noticed and pampered Excellent 
151971,Blakes Hotel, The bar downstairs took no notice that we stayed at the hotel and did not accommodate us with the seats , Absolutely stunning hotel The staff was nice enough to upgrade our deluxe room to the suite so we were pleasantly surprised 
151972,Blakes Hotel, Everything is so dark The building is black the rooms are small with dark walls and heavy furniture we moved from a room to another double beds both were very small the cupboards were ridiculousuly small for 2 people and we couldn t move around with the luggage Internet kept breaking Decoration is quite heavy and needs a real revamp Too expensive for the quality and comfort that we got , The location and staff are very good Restaurant and bar are nice too 
151973,Blakes Hotel, We asked for non feather duvets and pillows twice but they didn t change them and when questioned when we were going to bed said they didn t have any alternative to the duck down My wife is allergic to feathers so spent an uncomfortable night Also when we returned after a meal out the bar was closed it was only abut 11 30 and when we expressed our surprise the staff just shrugged it off didn t offer to get a drink and bring it up Disappointing as one of the reasons we booked the hotel was for the quirky decor in the bar and public areas which were all closed by the time we got back Not really good enough for a supposed 5 star and not cheap hotel in central London , The hotel is well located and it looks like the pictures on the website 
151974,Blakes Hotel, little noisy at night from room above different ambience but we think we would enjoy the hotel more on a return visit, Location staff food cleanliness decor
151975,Blakes Hotel, the room the tv was too small and couldn t be seen from the bed the bathroom facilities were poor lighting in the bathroom was poor the bar being g in the restaurant was not good didn t really seem to facilitate families sparse relaxing places although ordered no paper was delivered lastly our key seemed to be able to open three rooms , the staff were good the food was good
151976,Blakes Hotel, Rooms are beautifully decorated the only negative would be they could be a bit brighter lighting but I think this is part of the decoration theme , Amazing Bar and Restaurant one of the best meals we have ever had in London 
151977,Blakes Hotel, The hotel was very dark so coming in of a night time was difficult More lighting needed in the rooms too, Room was stunning and location great staff fabulous
151978,Blakes Hotel, Room extremely small no where to put a suitcase Decor tired an stuck in the 80 s Misleading information gym not on premises and I was expected to pay a 50 fee to use some facility they had an arrangement with No proper lounge no fridge just a cool box set at 3 Degrees No in room tea and coffee facilities which is standard these days Menu very limited as to choice although service was good staff had not been trained properly i e No butter provided lack of condiments unless asked for No better than 3 star standard to say 5 star totally misleading and the price was outrageous , Only location and service
151979,Blakes Hotel, Didn t address our problems with an illegal hairdryer and there were NO TEA FACILITIES No tea This is Britain not America we don t all drink coffee AND it was an issue when I asked for tea making things to be brought to our room, Liked the cool decor and friendly staff 
151980,Blakes Hotel, Plumbing problems toilet blocked shower temperature hard to control Room door key didn t work properly , The staff were great nice ambiance Welcome drinks on arrival Comfy bed 
151981,Blakes Hotel, The only bad thing I would have to mention is the fact that front desk staff told me that 15 min was more than enough time to reach the train station by taxi when really at least half an hour was needed I believe this is due to the fact that few of them are native english speakers which made the conversation harder to lead I ended up missing my train but thankfully there was one only an hour later and it was sunday so no big deal there , Very cozy room n8 beautiful common areas great neighborhood The restaurant isn t too bad either although a bit expensive for what it is 
151982,Blakes Hotel, The room we were allocated wasn t quite 5 star The carpet was worn and had prominent areas of fraying The light above the bed didn t work one of the ceiling lights flickered and the knobs on lighting panels missing Bedside console table noticeably scratched, The staff were lovely courteous and most welcoming 
151983,Blakes Hotel, The rooms looked tired and were very small I did not feel it was good value for money, Work was being carried out at the hotel which I was not informed would be happening and as a consequence the hotel was only partially functioning so we were disappointed
151984,Blakes Hotel, The fact that at 8 00AM the builders working on the hotel started drilling holes in thge wall adjacent to my room We should have been informed that work was taking place when we booked ,No Positive
151985,Blakes Hotel, We was interrupted twice by someone opening the bedroom door within a space of an hour , The room was amazing The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was to die fron
151986,Blakes Hotel, First of all there was construction during our stay They said they will give complimentary breakfast due to this reason Then they tried to get money for breakfast but could not After that they tried to get 50 pounds Per day I couldn t understand for which reason , Just the locat on
151987,Blakes Hotel, 1 Rooms were old worn 2 Internet was INCREDIBLY slow had to bring laptop out to a pub to do work 3 Shower water became cold very quickly after 2 3min 4 Breakfast omelette was rubbery very salty toast was very poor 5 Lots of banging noises due to construction 6 Much of the facilities shut down due to construction , 1 Front desk was generally helpful and friendly 2 Rooms were nicely designed 3 Smoked salmon bagel was very nice 
151988,Blakes Hotel, Currently construction going on due to renovation of restaurant so can get a bit noisy But that should be done soon, Best staff and such a cool property Love the idea of individually designed rooms 
151989,Blakes Hotel, Everything was full of dust during the whole stay the breakfast was the most absurd and pretentious of all tiny room compared to the price you pay to stay here There is no full length mirror and it is constantly dark in the room even if you turn up the lights to the max It is completely depressing and dark I don t get the hype about this place at all , Design location wifi 
151990,Blakes Hotel, The hotel was under construction which it did not tell me on booking com when i checked in i had 2 hours before a meeting and needed to sit on my computer the major renovation below shaking the room adn walls was a problem the staff moved me to a different part of the hotel with a upgrade but there was no desk in the room nor wine glasses nor bed side tables later in the evening there is no bar and the restaurant closes a bit early its a nice hotel just not Contemporary I do not think it should be open during construction I sat in the lobby in the morning quickly on my Mac which kept getting booted of the wifi and the construction started and there was bird poop all on the table where the canaries are really not appetizing i usally stay at Phillip Starcke hotels or Ian Schraeger places so its a bit more utilitarian This had the feeling more of where my auntie would dine with a cup of tea, the location the sleek grey exterior of the building
