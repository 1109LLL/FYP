22321,Les Plumes Hotel, Absolutely nothing , 1 The room was well decorated modern small as per Parisian standards however cozy 2 The shower was amazing and had great LED lights to enjoy your long nice shower 3 The room offered a free Samsung phone to make free local and international calls to certain destinations along with free data 4 Staff were great and polite and extremely helpful They were always ready to assist and guide us before we stepped out 5 Great location 3 mins walking distance from Cadet Metro Pink Line which runs through the city various restaurants and cafes Located in 9th arrondissement safe neighbourhood 
22322,Les Plumes Hotel, Bit small it was noisy outside which I know is out of their control but the location was not great it was on a side street and all tourist attractions required a train journey to access, Lovely shower comfy bed
22323,Les Plumes Hotel, The room is not only very small but mine on the sixth floor had a low ceiling giving me a claustrophobic feeling As some people mentioned in other reviews there are smells in the common areas it is hard to say with such old buildings where these come from The room was fine The staff does not tell you much about the hotel when you arrive I realised that there was a promotion for breakfast only by looking at the paper that comes with the key TV channels mostly limited to French TV I found this area of Paris and the areas around the hotel very dirty , Great neighbourhood I did not know so glad to discover it esp rue des Martyrs which has many lovely shops bakeries eateries and grocers and seemed quite family friendly There are three metro lines nearby one gets quickly to any part of the city and the Gare du Nord is a 13 min walk away The hotel is super well equipped the wifi works very well and there is a nice honesty tea coffee bar and everything seems to be thought through for the enjoyment of guests Air conditioning very good not loud at all and you can control it in the room 
22324,Les Plumes Hotel,No Negative, The bed was super comfy the room was pretty decently sized the shower was excellent and it was quiet So it was a little warm in our room it was 86 outside and I asked the front desk about it They turned it down for us and left it that way They re so accomodating and friendly I would book them again in a heartbeat
22325,Les Plumes Hotel, Breakfast a bit bland The scrambled eggs looked horrible no one would touch them Nice bread cheese and pastries but that s about it , This time we had a good size room clean and modern with a big shower Liked that we could drink in the bar area the wine and champagne bought from the outside shops 
22326,Les Plumes Hotel, The mirror in the bathroom of room 202 is about 7 feet off the floor and above a fixed shelf no average size woman can see herself in it No full length mirror at all Not enough shelf space in the bathroom for myself and my teenage daughter to comfortably store our toiletries , The hotel is lovely great theme of famous literary figures very thoughtful and restrained decoration very nice staff Wonderful surprisingly large bathroom with amazing shower Very nice to have an honesty bar open all the time charming breakfast bar area Good use of space throughout 
22327,Les Plumes Hotel, Ground floor suite is total disaster Just located near to the kitchen Spend tons of euros and wake up with breakfast noises at 7 am Wifi is good in the reception but extremely bad at that suite The room is also very small Room door lock was broken and we can not lock the door Do not choose ground floor suite if possible , Location is the best Just few steps from metro stations Also bus 42 has a stop near the hotel Hotel employees are always helpful and smiling 
22328,Les Plumes Hotel,No Negative, Very welcoming hotel staff very grateful after 24 hour flight to get here Great decor and Nice and quiet just what we needed after a long flight a welcome s quiet room 
22329,Les Plumes Hotel, Breakfast not a 4start as the hotel rated Location extremely noisy you can t sleep at night Internet poor, Clean Newly decorated however no isolation you hear everything in the next door
22330,Les Plumes Hotel, There wasn t anything we didn t like , Couldn t fault our stay in Les Plumes We flew to CDG caught the train to Gard du Nord and walked to the hotel Loved the d cor staff were friendly and helpful bed comfy shower hot and powerful and a great choice for breakfast Within walking distance of plenty of restaurants 
22331,Les Plumes Hotel, There was a weird smell in the room and sometimes it was way too warm The rooms are really small It s claustrophobic a bit I wouldn t rate it for 4 stars And the price for the rooms is way too high for what it really is , The location is great and the staff was very kind and helpful The smartphone given was a big plus because as tourists we could take it with us everywhere and use it maps tripadvisor etc It has unlimited internet and you can use for any type of information 
22332,Les Plumes Hotel, N A, Very cool boutique hotel in a great location Comfortable room Friendly chatty helpful staff on reception Delicious breakfast brought to our room
22333,Les Plumes Hotel, There is a bar downstairs so it could be quite noisy when I slept with window slightly ajar There was a little smelly when i first entered the room The housekeeper didn t clean the room even if I ask for it , The front desk staffs are warm hearted and very helpful Room is nice with complete facilities The location of the hotel is quite good close to one MacDonald one Starbucks and some supermarkets And the bed is quite cozy 
22334,Les Plumes Hotel,No Negative, Hotel provides you with the smartphone which you can use during your stay Internet and calls inside the EU are free of charge which is really convenient when you explore the city 
22335,Les Plumes Hotel, Breakfast was a bit too standard for 4star hotel but on the other hand all fresh products, Extremely friendly and helpful staff Very good location Beautiful and classy room 
22336,Les Plumes Hotel,No Negative, The staff were exceptional at this hotel There was nothing that they would not do for you and were very polite and friendly This is the second time I have stayed here and it was just as great as the first time Thank you for another wonderful stay
22337,Les Plumes Hotel, They like to serve you your coffee tea in the table and make sure everything is fine but sometimes that made us feel a little uncomfortable watched over when picking the stuff we wanted to eat but we know they mean well and most people enjoy being served Not a deal breaker , The staff is super nice They ask you about your day if you are enjoying and give you tips about the city It was also a surprise for me but they provide almost everything you might need for free Need shaving cream they give you a razor kit with razor blade Need a bath robe you got it Even in the last day when we went to get our bags in the end of the day they offered us a coffee or a drink from the bar if we wanted The room has a nice size and even with the bags you don t feel like you can t walk around The bathroom has an hairdryer and it s a nice one so you don t need to take one Also they give you slippers The room has nice windows that block the sound from the street so unless you have someone yelling down there you won t be bothered by the passing cars Also we didn t had any problems with neighbor s noise The room is cleaned everyday and they do a nice job at it The breakfast seems to be just a few things when you first look at the room in the morning but then you notice that you can find a nice variety of cheeses and croissants and yogurts etc all neatly tucked away in cupboards and baskets that make you feel quite at home The location for us was great You have a metro station literally 2min away on foot If you take the metro there you can be in the louve in like 11 13 minutes and in the Eiffel tower in half an hour Paris is a really big city so we felt very happy with the location after going to almost everything that is to see 
22338,Les Plumes Hotel, 1 free bottle of water in room and some free toiletries on arrival but not restocked during our 3 night stay I m sure we could have asked for more , Very comfy bed Free use of a smartphone for the duration of your stay including free European calls and free data great for maps directions Nice idea Good breakfast 
22339,Les Plumes Hotel, Salad was a bit overpriced at 23Eur, Very nice staff perfect location love the bathroom and shower experience The bed was very comfortable and the food is amazing I changed from another hotel into this one because they seriously wanted me to hand out my keys in a tiny garage in Paris without giving me any security for my car The parking is more expensive at this hotel but worth it as you have a safe public peking garage nearby and nobody wants you to hand over your keys which is almost crazy in Paris if you aren t in a 5 star hotel 
22340,Les Plumes Hotel, Definitely above expectations experience based on the price we paid on offer would have been a less excited positive review if we had paid full price , Perfect location nice staff fully renovated clean and cosy hotel 
22341,Les Plumes Hotel, Technical issues upon arrival the heating was out of order luckily it started working soon and very well upon departure the POS terminal was out of order during our stay the WiFi was always strong but we were only rarely able to use it because it did not provide a connection to the Internet probably it was in need of frequent modem reboots , Good location close to the Opera and Galleries Lafayette Only a few minutes walk from 2 metro stations Very nicely decorated comfortable and cozy 
22342,Les Plumes Hotel, The breakfast meal is boring after 2days of staying at the hotel No English speaking channel on the TV , Bed is comfy Bathroom is very clean Staff are exceptionally supportive in terms of navigating the town and approachable Gare du Nord is a walking distance to the hotel Tube station is just a stone throw Samsung mobile phone is available for you to take around 
22343,Les Plumes Hotel, we could hear the footsteps of our upstairs neighbour The room is very small and the walls are very very thin a kettle mini fridge in the room would be nice to have , location is really good the staff was friendly
22344,Les Plumes Hotel, Would have liked tea coffee making in room was only minor gripe, Fantastic hotel attentive staff who couldn t do enough unique style very close to Metro Cadet super comfy bed and good facilities would love to use again
22345,Les Plumes Hotel, The room was very hot when we came in it was put on 25 celcius which is too hot , Nice rooms nicely decorated very good atmosphere intimate hotel good breakfast
22346,Les Plumes Hotel,No Negative, Clean comfortable and excellent service Nothing was too much trouble I needed a Doctor during my stay and Patrick was extremely helpful Didn t try the breakfast so can t comment on that but would definitely recommend this hotel 
22347,Les Plumes Hotel, WiFi not working supplied UserId and Password didn t work for both our rooms , Nice facilities good atmosphere Hygiene and cleanliness far better than usual bathroom shower impressive Also rooms larger than normal Excellent value for money
22348,Les Plumes Hotel, Wifi terrible low speed and signal going on and off every five minute limited space in the room as all Paris hotel small table you can barely work on it with pc, Nice hotel in a quiet but still central area
22349,Les Plumes Hotel, The walls are so thin that I could hear someone typing a text message in the room next door Earplugs are a must , Location honest bar where you can go and make your own drinks the price is a bit to high though My room was very tiny but classy The bathroom was a good size 
22350,Les Plumes Hotel, The breakfast was poor value and didn t offer much choice for the cost The top floor suite was too hot even with air conditioning going full blast although it was 36 degrees outside so can t blame them too much so moved to ground floor suite with no fuss but this suffered some noise from staff preparing breakfast at 7am , The rooms are lovely and individually decorated with style and comfort in mind Staff were very friendly and helpful 
22351,Les Plumes Hotel, Rooms are very small even by Paris standards Air conditioning was hit or miss so do not accept a room on floors 6 or 7 Best room is 503 Large bathroom and larger room Nicely decorated Make sure you have your hard copy print out of your reservation and price in Euros Breakfast is not worth the price A fantastic bakery one block away and Starbucks or McCafe 2 blocks Spend your time out of the hotel not in the cramped breakfast room open to the lobby Plan checkout accordingly as taxis must be called ahead of time and the desk is totally unable to accommodate more than one person at a time , Quiet out of the way location Fantastic access to metro not 2 blocks away Laundromat cafes bakery also in close proximity Hotel staff could not be more helpful Make sure you have a large Paris map easily readable and a large subway map The ones the hotel provides are unusable Bathrooms have wonderful showers water pressure and abundant hot water 
22352,Les Plumes Hotel, Breakfast was very basic although still nice For a beautiful city so popular to attract travelers you have to have adequate English training as the language can be a barrier , Location was great as it was walking distance to various restaurants as well as shops and of course attractions like the Sacre Caeur and Moulin Rouge Shower in our room was just fantastic Room design was comfy and with a interesting taste
22353,Les Plumes Hotel, Street frontage not so appealing but that s Paris in places I guess , Easy access to metro from Cadet Easy to all other transport The staff Anthony Frank and girls at reception where just great to talk to and they just went out of the way to make you comfortable The rooms are just brilliant with the hotel theme running threw the whole hotel to corridors as well Gives you that Parisian feel and calming from the moment you walk in Would go back in a heart beat Thanks for the memories 
22354,Les Plumes Hotel, Normal rooms are a bit small but that is Paris Room could use more light too much ambient lights in the room , The location of the hotel is great Close by is metro and bus station Not far away the Gare du Nord can be reached on foot 15 min walk Staff of the hotel was great and multilingual Rooms were comfy and clean really liked the bathroom with great top shower and ambient LED lighting A queen size bed was comfortable and with extra pillows in the wardrobe All my wishes were respected which is really great Really liked that you can choose your own breakfast and pay piece by piece Rooms are very well equipped 
22355,Les Plumes Hotel, We liked everything, Loved the uniqueness of the place Very quirky Was within 10 ten minute walk of the main shopping area 20 minutes to the Louvre and a mile away from the Moulin Rouge 
22356,Les Plumes Hotel, Breakfast was a bit disorganised every morning we were there we had to ask for things to be brought out and tables were left uncleared , Very friendly and helpful staff Lovely decoration 
22357,Les Plumes Hotel, The prices in general were a little high for what this hotel offered but otherwise there is nothing to complain about , Great bed great shower and very friendly staff on a good quiet street about 15mins walk from Monmartre and 20mins walk from Gare du Nord Proximity to metro stop made getting around really easy 
22358,Les Plumes Hotel, The Internet was incredibly patchy in our room sitting in bed with a device was a no go quite often then need some more wifi extenders , Loved the decor good enough location friendly staff they had an honesty jar for food drink which was a nice touch 
22359,Les Plumes Hotel, The rooms are as almost always in Paris quite small but the space is used optimally I prefer shutters to curtains but that is a very personal preference , I really loved the theme of the decoration writers that was a real plus And the downstairs lounge with the honesty bar is chic and comfortable and it was extremely pleasant to have a drink on the small terrace The location is absolutely terrific if you want to go shopping it is very very close to the rue des Martyrs which is a true Gourmet Gully Our room was also wonderfully quiet 
22360,Les Plumes Hotel, Self service bar would have liked a bar man to mix my cocktail for me , Room was exceptional and staff where very helpful and polite We will be going back again 
22361,Les Plumes Hotel, Room was a little small not much of a view Very little to complain about for price location, Convenient location near local metro lines and local highlights Very friendly helpful staff at all times Lovely room unique design and comfy bed 
22362,Les Plumes Hotel, Cleanliness of the room was not so good Lift and TV not working Very noisy in the morning due to chambermaid bumping her equipment on the walls , Beautiful decoration of the rooms Central location
22363,Les Plumes Hotel, I am used to being able to have coffee tea making facilities in the rooms and there were none so I missed my first drink of the morning but that seems to be the same all over France There are drink making facilities downstairs in the lobby room service You could take some hot water upstairs for hot drinks but it was cool by the time you got there and its not a good idea to be carrying hot water around Hence the slightly lower score for facilities , Great location convenient for Cadet Metro station and many restaurants etc Just a short walk to Monmatre and other tourist destinations The Hotel felt safe and secure but relaxed staff were present and available to help if required but not intrusive Great housekeeping essential for me to enjoy a stay Rooms were well decorated and comfortable No problems at all staying here I would recommend and wish to return one day 
22364,Les Plumes Hotel, Nothing to complain about Some little wear and tear in the room room 502 but I am sure it will be looked after , I was spending a long weekend in Paris with my Mother The location is excellent Cadet metro station is round the corner and the street very quiet The staff were lovely and attentive Breakfast was simple but generous It is a nice happy place and I would stay at Les Plumes again 
22365,Les Plumes Hotel, The location of the hotel was a bit of a walk from central Paris with all the tourist attractions , All of the staff were so helpful and kind and spoke a variety of languages including English The breakfast was delicious and the bar was flexible with the freedom to make your own drinks The room was lovely not a huge room but had a large comfy bed and was generally a beautiful and romantic room 
22366,Les Plumes Hotel, Breakfast is a low standard regarding a four star category and the price paid , The design location and staff The room was very trendy and confortable the size was average for Paris standard Nearby wonderfull restaurants and public transports metro and gare du nord by walk 
22367,Les Plumes Hotel, Not exactly a bad experience but the manager emailed to ask if I wished for something special such as champagne or flowers I replied and said it would be my grand daughter s 18th birthday the day of arrival and he did not respond nothing happened There are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room and no storage noise from road and overlooked by office block so could not open curtains , The friendly and helpful concierges the location
22368,Les Plumes Hotel,No Negative, Very comfortable boutique hotel in a great location Staff extremely welcoming and helpful Room was small but fine for a solo traveler I asked for a quiet room and wasn t disappointed Honesty bar a great addition 
22369,Les Plumes Hotel, Should have checked location Would have preferred different area Poor coffee service Smaller room than we are used too Would not rebook , Pleasant staff 
22370,Les Plumes Hotel, The room was pretty small had a very small window which led to too little daylight in the room The amount of electric light in the room was not sufficient as to my need to be able to read book or newspaper , Nice and friendly staff the cleanness of the room the bath
22371,Les Plumes Hotel,No Negative, I was really surprised by how great this hotel was considering the price It was in a nice location with very easy access to the metro The rooms were really nicely decorated and it was an excellent hotel all around 
22372,Les Plumes Hotel, the bill charged me with a bottle of champagne on arrival which we didn t receive The holiday was to celebrate my wifes 70th birthday toilet extremely small Beds small , friendly helpful staff good shower room cafe across the street
22373,Les Plumes Hotel, Room was kind of small but typical for Paris , It was in a great location The rooms were nicely appointed and the lobby with drinks breakfast was a nice touch 
22374,Les Plumes Hotel, It was our 25th wedding anniversary and I ordered flowers and champagne to find broken glass on our return to our room this was very dissappointing, Location and friendly staff

22376,Les Plumes Hotel, Nothing to complain about , Great location Near bars restaurants and metro Quiet clean and comfortable rooms Great air conditioning tv and wifi Helpful staff 
22377,Les Plumes Hotel, Breakfast is pricey but lots of cafes nearby so not an issue No tea coffee facilities in the room however room service is available , Great location lots of places to eat nearby walking distance to two Metro stations short walk to shopping areas immaculately clean hotel very helpful staff honesty bar with happy hour Smart decor throughout Good price 
22378,Les Plumes Hotel,No Negative, Staff are very attentive and all speak excellent English Rooms are spacious and very clean Massive comfy bed which will be missed Also the hotel is located very close to the Cadet Metro station Les Plumes is a little gem in Paris 
22379,Les Plumes Hotel, Down side to hotel all pictures on internet make the hotel look very big rooms are very small in real life look nothing like pictures on internet Same for breakfast area and reception In room pulled sheets back and found the body hairs you wouldn t want to find so disappointed by that breakfast is very basic advice looking around for that if possible rooms not that sound proof at all , Hotel staff are great very helpful I would say the reception staff make this hotels stay great they go out out off there way to do things for you hotel is close to metro and lots of intresting places to eat around bed is great feels soft but yet very firm 
22380,Les Plumes Hotel,No Negative, Everything was very clean staff was extremely friendly and helpful and spoke English well a plus since my French is nonexistent Two tips 1 Eat breakfast downstairs instead of getting room service more food for less 2 This hotel is not close to the Seine we walked over an hour to the Eiffel Tower This is nice because it is very quiet and inexpensive but be prepared to walk a LOT or take taxis 
22381,Les Plumes Hotel, Not much If the breakfast was cheaper we may gone for it but it was cheaper to walk around the corner for a bite , Great location with access to the Met And the photos do show how nice this place is Incredible value for money
