336799,Flemings Mayfair, Rooms are very basic and are nothing like the Internet images The website needs to be updated to reflect real images of the rooms that have not been renovated Bathrooms are very basic The room was not value for money Very disappointing for the price paid for 3 nights accommodation , Location
336800,Flemings Mayfair, Hot food not included in the breakfast price room service slighty over priced for quantity and not a great variety of food , Frendly staff amazing bed and pillows big tv in room own balcony in room great room air con lovely rain head on the shower in en suite fantastic 
336801,Flemings Mayfair, Shame there was a little construction outside of the hotel as it ruined the ambiance on arrival slightly But once inside that was totally irrelevant , Perfect location So close to Green Park station and a 2 minute walk away from the shops restaurants etc The room was absolutely gorgeous Modern and stylishly classic with cultural features Staff super attentive and helpful Breakfast had a great selection 
336802,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, The staff went to the extra effort of arranging rose petals to placed in the shape of a love heart and a delicious slice of fudge cake was put in the room as it was my partners birthday A real touch of class 
336803,Flemings Mayfair, No real lobby where to sit and meet buisness collegues, The room was all that I expected good sized bathroom in spotless condition and up to all expectations 
336804,Flemings Mayfair, The shower didn t drain properly which meant standing water The room was freezing cold and did not really warm up properly even after having the heating on for a lengthy time , Staff were friendly my booking had not been correctly added to the system so they made me wait on check in for 15 minutes but they were pleasant and helpful The hotel style is very nice most has been completely refurbished and while my bedroom was gorgeous the bathroom needed a bit of work The room was very small 
336805,Flemings Mayfair, We were in an upgraded room and we were kept awake all night by a generator that was right outside our room and was going all night Mentioned this at check out but nothing was done about it , The staff were excellent and very friendly and could not do enough for you Very clean and they upgraded us to a suite on arrival 
336806,Flemings Mayfair, Noisy from other guests bad isolation because of old house Breakfast buffet with small free offer and old fashioned breakfast room people have to wait for seating although a lot of tables have been free, New renovated bathroom coffee machine bed in Deluxe room
336807,Flemings Mayfair, The morning coffee was slow to appear and our room was cleaned even when we had the do not disturb sign on the door and had told two people that we did not need it cleaned, The staff were brilliant very friendly and always happy to help The location was perfect for what we wanted a short walk away from theatres shops restraunts and the Hyde Park Winter Wonderland
336808,Flemings Mayfair, The bed is too short I am 185cm tall and the mattress can not be more than 190cm which is too short for a luxury hotel mattress should be 210cm , While the room was small it was well appointed and newly renovated The bathroom has an efficient layout and works well 
336809,Flemings Mayfair, There was awfully hot in the hotel It is quite peculiar in London in December that after turning off radiator also a c was required to cool down the room Breakfast price quality was poor , Location is excellent 
336810,Flemings Mayfair, The layout is a bit of a hassle because there are multiple levels on each floor so you have to navigate multiple sets of stairs to get from the elevator to your room , Really great location lovely staff great cocktails 
336811,Flemings Mayfair, It s so disappointing that the coffee maker and cattle need to be moved from the designed place to plugged it in , The room was spacious clean location was great staff are so friendly I booked room for three adults and all amenities were provided Check in and out is so fast
336812,Flemings Mayfair, It s a lottery you never know if you will get a renovated room or not also bathroom was ultra small Un renovated rooms are tired Also problems with water temperature in shower and an air conditing until outside my window , Staff are friendly and helpful
336813,Flemings Mayfair, Could do with better soundproofing Was woken at 4 45 when people in next room started showering , wonderfully renovated since last stay Large for London room and all facilities top notch Breakfast and late Sunday check out excellent 
336814,Flemings Mayfair, The price was very expensive overall but it s london Mayfair , Great location and superb food also the staff was excellent in the part of customer service no doubt to come back again when possible
336815,Flemings Mayfair, Room was very small Bathroom products not enough for two women sharing and not replenished during turndown service Room glasses for minibar drinks too small to enjoy a beer or glass of wine , Lovely d cor
336816,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, Food was wonderful as one would expect in a Michelin star restaurant but still We had the New Year s Eve Tasting Menu would unquestionably do this again fantastic food comfortable atmosphere excellent choice The home made granola on the breakfast buffet was really delicious Staff were SO helpful 5 stars to Conci rge service who came through for every request Reception area is underwhelming although it follows current trends in interior d cor which personnally I dislike Rooms in contrast were ultra modern chic and very very comfortable and clean Won t bother putting on photos the professional ones are quite truthful Location of course could not be better 2 mins walk from everything Would do this again in a flash 
336817,Flemings Mayfair, Two major unacceptable issues 1 The room was located pn 1st floor just opposite a huge generator which was creating extremely annoying sound Supposingly the generator was witched off after 10PM but this was not the case for the 3 nights we were there 2 Additionally the temperatur was unmanagable when we checked in the room the temperature was freezing cold We tried to open the old heater but heating did not work The 2nd day when we returned to our room the heating was working and the room temperature are most probably around 28C We tried to lowr the heating turned many times the antique sweating valves without success sleeping in such hot enviroment was total nightmare Defenetly we will never again stay in that hotel and will not recommend it to anyone , The location is good 
336818,Flemings Mayfair, There s nothing not to like about this hotel , I can t think of anything I didn t like about the hotel or my stay From the minute we arrived all the staff were friendly and helpful Nothing was too much trouble The bar offered amazing cocktails and the barman was very knowledgeable The late breakfast on Sunday till 12 and late check out 2pm added to the stay 
336819,Flemings Mayfair, The room was very poor and not like the photo they emailed to show the room type This was most misleading It had no seating and a very small side window The photo showed a room with seating and two large windows They did offer us another room but only on the evening before we were due to check out Also the room lock did not work properly and it was not repaired at once, Location
336820,Flemings Mayfair, Slight lack of attention if asking anything out of the ordinary but wouldn t stop me visiting again, Best eggs benedict for years bar intimate and moody 
336821,Flemings Mayfair, This stay was part of a Christmas surprise for my husband and I had paid in advance because of this so it was more than annoying for him to be presented with a bill for an optional service charge as we left He was too polite to protest and spoil the occasion but I was really irritated A hotel at this level should not need to tack on this tacky charge it totally spoils the overall impression of their service which is otherwise excellent , A beautiful little hotel in a charming part of London with large numbers of attentive front of house staff Slightly dated decor in the room we had this time and a very small bathroom but still extremely pleasant Perfectly located in central London 
336822,Flemings Mayfair, Sweetener required with In room tea making pack Non English staff need to be taught how to make a good pot of tea e g Tea too weak and served with skimmed milk , Service and facilities and breakfast superb 
336823,Flemings Mayfair, Bed was hard and so small our feet dangled out of it Room was small and stuffy View from window to deteriorating building , Amazing location Really friendly staff Beautiful and unique drawing room and bar
336824,Flemings Mayfair, Perceived ttempt to deconstruct my booking into an upgrade for your group to an Appartment I didn t fall for it and the same phrases were used 24 hrs later by the next group checking in Rooms were not available at 1400 after a 200 mile trip to London Staff hassled for one rooom back at 0902, Location decor Ammeniries some staff
336825,Flemings Mayfair, The room was very average not renovated as shown on booking com That being said the room was very clean cozy Also anyone 6 ft tall would find the shower impossible as the ceiling is very low slanted Please note I hate to even mention these negative comments because the hotel itself and staff were absolutely extradionary I would definitely stay here again but I ll upgrade in room selection , Honestly the location was perfect Luxury shopping all around you close to many of our favorite restaurants in the city Walking distance to Buckingham Palace The hotel staff were so friendly attentive Facilities were excellent Also make sure to have a drink at the hotel bar 
336826,Flemings Mayfair, the hotel reacted a bit late on some comments I had but when they reacted they did it in a very good way which solved the problem in a satisfactory way for us , Good hotel in very good location good staff nice bar and good restaurant 1 star This was my second time and we will be going back 
336827,Flemings Mayfair, Housekeeping was a problem due to language barriers the cleaning lady spoke not one word of english which ended up in several requests via supervisor etc although the room was nice it had a very low ceiling , Reservation and reception very kind and helpful 
336828,Flemings Mayfair, Bar shut too early Lol A little awkward getting a taxi with it not being on a man road, We got a free upgrade from studio suit to a 1 bed apartment which was fantastic
336829,Flemings Mayfair, Nothing much wrong Bathroom slightly cramped but mainly due to the low ceilings in an old historic building so not a major issue , Great location in Mayfair for eating drinking shopping and parks Very helpful staff 
336830,Flemings Mayfair, Hotel was nice enough but I m surprised by the 4 star rating I ve stayed at a handful of other nearby 3 star properties that were just as good and usually cheaper Room was small and tight Breakfast included in rate was average at best, Great Mayfair location Convenient to tube parks and tourist locations yet on a quiet side street Staff was super 
336831,Flemings Mayfair, Breakfast was included in our stay but we still had to sign a ticket for 43 pounds even though one of us only had coffee I think it might have been better if we did not have to sign something saying we received 43 pounds worth of food when we just had muffin and coffee , The staff was very helpful We were taking Uber to the airport but the driver could not be there for another 40 minutes Taxi cabs will not take credit cards unless you have a pin number which I did not have The man at the desk was able to get us a hired car to take us to the airport in 15 minutes That was very nice 
336832,Flemings Mayfair, No pillow choice existing ones is very uncomfortable They frequently mistake in blocking money and very slow to release it Staff doesn t respect privacy enter whenever they want with a slight knock , Location is very good Tea room is very comfortable 
336833,Flemings Mayfair, Nothing Tip top, The hotel was immaculate and extremely well appointed The staff were courteous warm and humorous Service couldn t be better 
336834,Flemings Mayfair, Desorganized my room was not ready at 16 30 1 hour and a half after the check in time A maintenance guy entered my room out of the blue without even knocking , Great breakfast Confortable room 
336835,Flemings Mayfair, Room not very useful bathroom doesn t have a light over the mirror no proper towel hanger noisy A C window facing the back of another building , Staff friendliness exceptional room care cleaning and servicing at least twice a day the location 
336836,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, Hotel room breakfast staff all lovely Our room wasn t ready when we arrived but they upgraded our breakfast as a goodwill gesture Would certainly return and recommend
336837,Flemings Mayfair, The WiFi should really be more secure and password protected The breakfast is pricey especially when there are countless cheaper cafes within a block or two , Great bed very clean very quiet cannot beat the location for central London business 
336838,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, The location is excellent across the road from Green Park and within an easy 5 minute walk of Green Park tube station Staff are very friendly and attentive breakfast was excellent with a wide choice Would definitely recommend 
336839,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, Absolutely stunning hotel Modern clean and bright room which was a good size The bed is so comfortable Brilliant location to nearby attractions and public transport Wonderful staff very helpful to give us assistance when needed
336840,Flemings Mayfair, Be aware that the classic double rooms are smaller then the cabins on a cruise boat so book the bigger rooms not sure if this hotel really deserves the SLH label You can recognise a good hotel on the default fresh orange juice for breakfast This hotel has not So not normal for a restaurant hotel claiming this level, the location is just great and the cocktail bar is amazing
336841,Flemings Mayfair, Miscommunication upon arrival after confusion about payments I had made I asked if I had paid for my accommodation in full excluding extras and the staff replied yes In fact I had not paid in full and there was an outstanding amount to pay upon checkout , The decor staff and service were exceptional Upon check in we were escorted to our room which I realised was exceedingly too small to accommodate my daughter and myself for 4 nights I addressed this with reception who swIftly offered me a larger room at no extra cost This really made our stay much more enjoyable and comfortable 
336842,Flemings Mayfair, Nothing, The hotel had a lovely atmosphere The townhouse accommodation was very tastefully restored to reflect the original period of the property Would definitely recommend this accommodation to others 
336843,Flemings Mayfair, The price Guests who had visited previously felt the price had increased dramatically and the previous offer of a free coffee and muffin service was definitely a loss for current guests, Location stunning and room stunning Did have a private outside patio but sadly no view as locked in by tall buildings 
336844,Flemings Mayfair, Female staff at the front desk were like statues need a great deal of training in hospitality The night room service options were very disappointing and consisted of only three choices Thai green curry onion soup or selection of pot luck finger sandwiches nothing could be tailored to order Overall I found the service to be extremely lacking and would not recommend on this basis , Excellent rooms of an impeccable standard 
336845,Flemings Mayfair, Housekeeping is very slow Often only make the room up in late afternoon When advising that that guests ja out for an hour it s not enough time for housekeeping to make it to the room and clean it , Charming feel Casual and much like a home Very small room bathroom Great drawing room bar and restaurant Staff are plentiful and helpful 
336846,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, Everyone goes for a lush weekend once and this hotel was just perfect There was a real concierge that knew everything about London and whose smile made it easy to ask a question 
336847,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, some of the rooms are small but well designed and everything works to a high standard there is something funky about their internet system which would not allow my laptop to connect but worked perfectly with my phone All in all a great hotel with great staff 
336848,Flemings Mayfair, It was all good, Fabulous location and one of the comfiest beds in London Room was small but very well appointed it was great that they had a really good heating airconditioning system that you could control in the room The hotel had a lot of beautiful character about it much more so than the usual large hotel chains 
336849,Flemings Mayfair, We lost TV signal one day and took more than 12 hrs to repair But the staff were nice offering a change in room to a different floor but we did not accept it since it was not too bad to be disconnected a few hours , The location and the friendly attitude of the staff Room was also modern and with adequate space Good WiFi coverage at reasonable speed
336850,Flemings Mayfair, Communication does seem very disorganised though staff are helpful , This is an ideal location for a summer stay in London as you can walk around the parks to Westminster and the theatres easily The tube is only a couple of minutes too The restaurant is very good and reasonable value for the quality of the food 
336851,Flemings Mayfair, Due to the layout of the apartment it is difficult to here the door bell It should be made louder The room service deliverer learned to call the room when she was at the door The minibar checker came into the apartment while I was there It was unsettling , The apartment was spacious and well furnished The kitchen was well equipped There was a dish washer and washer dryer I did not use either but on a longer business trip they would be useful I did use the Nespresso machine 
336852,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, A beautiful hotel at a very convenient location The tube station is very close by Staff was most helpful The restaurant and tea room are excellent We dined at Ormer twice 
336853,Flemings Mayfair, It was too freezing sleep in the bed when Air Condition was cooling because macine was blowing sraight to the bed , Bed was very comfortable Friendly staff 
336854,Flemings Mayfair, Atempted unannoumced servicecharges , Attempted ripoff at checkout Unannoumced servicecharges of various kinds Otherwise quite costy but very nice room friendly and discretely helpful staff good location in Mayfair 
336855,Flemings Mayfair, No, When we arrived and entered our room which was lovely we heard the continual rumble of the subway below which would have kept my wife awake at night the hotel found us another room on the 3rd floor and moved all our belongings to her his room whilst we enjoyed our first day around London and the 1st of our shows in the west end The continental breakfast buffet was excellent and served a great latte coffee for my wife 
336856,Flemings Mayfair, The hotel has great location very close to green park subway station and to Bakingham Palace The room was smaller then expected and the way to it was full with stairs Very friendly stuff , Great location and very clean
336857,Flemings Mayfair, We were near the Elevator and heard it moving up and down all day and night Only one elevator and we had to wait long times for it at the fourth floor , Rooms were very clean 
336858,Flemings Mayfair, There was noise from ventilation or something and there was no view , Very nice room and fantastisc bathroom Location very good and rastypiska breakfast 
336859,Flemings Mayfair, The London weather , My first stay since it was refurbished Very helpful staff and excellent buffet breakfast included but more to the point what wonderful accommodation although only a one night stay I was given a 3 bedroom suite on two levels with sitting room dining room and kitchenette An excellent touch 
336860,Flemings Mayfair, The aisle in the building is very narrow with STEPS if you had a big luggage it would be really inconvenient , Location is great very close to shopping malls and nice restaurants 
336861,Flemings Mayfair, Room was too small for a double However after alerting the staff they have stated they will provide a room with a little more room next time when I reserve It was simply a question of new versus old style rooms Note The staff at this hotel are top notch no request is too small from housekeeping which emergency pressed my wifes suit for a job interview the next day in an hour to the concierge , The chef is Michelin rated and the quality of the menu reflects this Eating dinner in the hotel restaurant was a joy including the service attentiveness wines food Excellent 
336862,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, Upgraded to a studio suite lovely large room Very comfy bed and luxury bathroom The breakfast was plentiful and delicious Staff were very friendly and helpful Excellent location within walking distance of theatres and shops but on a quiet street so peaceful at night We will definitely stay there again 
336863,Flemings Mayfair, beware of the annex we were put in an annex room that you CANNOT access via the hotel the room was small but nice enough it felt more like staff quarters and you did not have the ambiance or even the staff access as you would in the hotels main building as such everything has to be done by coming back onto the street and coming back into the main building this is fair enough if it was a cheap room but at close on 400 for one night you would expect more much more hence its not good value at all if they offer you the annex refuse in fact before you arrive email them and say you do not want one of these rooms as it spoils your experience i stay in london every week and was hoping this would be my regular but i don t think it will be, nice hotel in good location staff were professional and courteous
336864,Flemings Mayfair, Room was a bit small Having the bed and lounge room combined all in one was very cramped Maids knock once on the door then just enter the room As the room is so small there is nowhere you can go Having the TV on the wall behind the lounge seems strange You had to sit or lay on the bed to watch it Having sensor lighting in the bathroom became annoying when you are sleeping As soon as you open the bathroom door the light comes on and shine in your partners face waking them up Same if you leave the door open and move during the night it also triggers the light And yes we did shut the door We both woke up with sore backs lol no not from that , Location was good for what we wanted Only 15 pound cab ride to Embankment wharf for our evening cruise Short walk to major shops We originally ordered the continental breakfast but to upgrade to full buffet breakfast was only 7 50 and it was well worth it All staff were very friendly 
336865,Flemings Mayfair, I think that the quantities offered of toiletries were small They only had one soap How about one for the sink and one for the shower , Cute hotel in a great location 
336866,Flemings Mayfair, I was given a room on the ground floor at the back of the hotel The room had a view into a brick wall My experience was that of being below ground level If I spend about 500GBP night on a room I expect it to at least have a view My room may as well have not had windows at all I found the front desk staff stuffy and very formal It s the sort of place where you feel like you should show up in a Tuxedo ,No Positive
336867,Flemings Mayfair, Toilets for the restaurant always seemed slightly too dark for me personally But this is my only criticism, The staff were more than helpful with any queries that we had and were very friendly Also no problems with any special requirements that we had with the menu Nothing was too much trouble The atmosphere was calm relaxed and welcoming but very professional Location for us was excellent This was a birthday treat from my husband and it could not have been better 
336868,Flemings Mayfair, Stayed there same time last year Attitude and service from both staff and hotel significantly lower than 12 months ago Over 300 per night indicates a certain level of service London or not , Location close to London marathon finish line 
336869,Flemings Mayfair, The room was stuffy and noisy We could hear next door guests , We were upgraded to 103 although it was a double bed we were 2 ladies sharing having originally booked a twin we thought the upgrade would have been better We should have stayed with a twin The room was stuffy and we couldn t open the window and we re not ac fans It was also very noisy We could hear the next door guest using their bathroom The last time we stayed at Flemings we had an apartment so obviously this time we were disappointed with the accommodation but it s still a great hotel
336870,Flemings Mayfair, Booked and paid for the Luxury one bedroom apartment Upon arrival we were given the studio suite which cost less and was not what we were after travelling with a young child we wanted a separate living space Unfortunately there were no more apartments available so we stayed in the suite Staff were apologetic and advised of complementary afternoon tea however when checking out the bill included a charge to afternoon tea Perhaps more attention to detail by the check in staff can address these mishaps , Beautiful hotel with exceptional service
336871,Flemings Mayfair, Got a room with a small Window with a view into a really tight shaft So this was basicly a room without a window Stayed in about 200 different hotels but never had that bad lack of view out of a window And what if its fire Will probably not book any room thru bookings again when you dont warn your customers that you rent out rooms that are close to not having a window ,No Positive
336872,Flemings Mayfair, A little expensive , Huge pillows great breakfast beautiful room lots of Literature you ve got to love a hotel room which has hardback copies of all of the best classics Fantastic bar and bar staff Great location 
336873,Flemings Mayfair, In First they gave us very small room and smells bad too but after arguing with them the manager stepped in and gave us a better room No sound proof you can hear everything outside, Comfy bad
336874,Flemings Mayfair, If you would like to ruin your London trip this is the hotel to choose They threatened us to hold our luggage in pledge for a problem which turned out to be their own accounting mistake They sold us a room with two beds and then when we got there they told us they did not have such a room Two of our colleagues had to sleep in the same bed They have a very unfriendly threatening kind of approach My worst hotel experience so far ,No Positive
336875,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, Very well managed recently tastefully refurbished interiors very friendly staff and great location New star studded restaurant excellent The only negative single lift but in view of the positives I would give that one a pass and made Flemings my first choice for London always
336876,Flemings Mayfair, Tradesman everywhere but London seems to be like that , Bed very comfortable and perfect on the cooler mornings The staff were great every step of the way they gave us a quieter room as we were staying for a week and needed good sleep 5 mins walk to Buckingham Palace and the Ritz 
336877,Flemings Mayfair, The included breakfast is continental buffet and if you want eggs you have to pay an upgrade which I find a bit petty Otherwise everything was ok but I would have expected a better service in such an hotel , The room was nice and quiet The location very good The breakfast fresh but not so varied 
336878,Flemings Mayfair, Radio on the TV did not work and after many attempts by both the staff and ourselves we were eventually brought a separate radio by which time we were going out for the evening Suprised that they didn t offer a slight reduction it s not the money it s the gesture that would have been nice ,No Positive
336879,Flemings Mayfair, N A, Love this hotel Refurbished very classy Very well managed Staff friendly and very helpful Made it our London destination at every stop in town On this trip have introduced our son to the hotel The young generation loved it as well 
336880,Flemings Mayfair, Perhaps the only thing was the size of the room given we had two large cases a bit short on space Outside of this I would say that the mandatory daily service charges were unnecessary but perhaps common in the capital This did put me off leaving a cash tip for the concierge , The quaint style of the hotel is a refreshing change from the standard contemporary offering so many hotels deliver today The staff were appreciative that we were not from London and assisted in every way possible The room although on the small side was immaculate and extremely well presented If you want to get away from the archetypal getaway hotel and experience something more traditional yet still holding modern service this hotel is for you Also the location is perfect for a short stay tourist and the price point is more than fair 
336881,Flemings Mayfair, Windows don t insulate road noise at front so in fact very noisy plus generator at 7am as they are having trouble with kitchens , Nice room good standard
336882,Flemings Mayfair, Our room was very small and the bed far too small for a couple We would recommend this room for a single guest only and would prefer to stay in the main hotel and not the next door property in the future , Staff very friendly as usual and a wonderful location 
336883,Flemings Mayfair, Nothing everything was good Obviously expensive but it is Mayfair , Understated excellence Refined yet not stuffy Staff friendly helpful efficient yet relaxed We booked the 2 bed apartment Everything you could need for a 2 night stay Small stock of complimentary bits for the kitchen replenished daily Quiet intimate bar was great A real gem felt like a home away from home Will be back 
336884,Flemings Mayfair, The lady at the reception was looking strange at us we didn t feel that she is happy to have us there She was a little bit older with dark hair and she was probably manager She was looking the same way everyday We didn t feel comfortable We don t know her name because they do not have the names on uniform We think the staff mainly at the reception should be always smiling and be positive The rest of the staff was very nice , Amazing hotel We loved the bathroom The room was also very beautiful We really enjoyed the stay at Mayfair Flemings hotel The rooms are new modern clean and big enough The underground station is next to the hotel good access anywhere you need 
336885,Flemings Mayfair, I asked for a quiet room Although it was overlooking an internal court yard it was also where the air conditoning units where , A contemporary room within an old setting 
336886,Flemings Mayfair, Size of the room is disrespectful Shower is very uncomfortable and very poorly designed, Except location there is nothing I could have liked about this hotel very disappointed 
336887,Flemings Mayfair, The sound of the water pipes from the floor above my room The view from the window was showing the inside of the building , The design of the room was spectacular Essentials were available in the room such as hair dryer iron and even thread and needle 
336888,Flemings Mayfair, The rooms looked nothing like the pictures on the website Breakfast was basic but ok , The 1st 2nd room were very very small but the third room room 111 was excellent Moved twice due to issues with 2 rooms but the hotel handled it brilliantly Would stay again for this reason 
336889,Flemings Mayfair, Noisy Old shabby bathroom Horrible Wifi connection Poor ventilation stuffy air Loud and very old air conditioner, Good location Friendly staff
336890,Flemings Mayfair, Constant disturbance by Housekeeping staff who seems in a hurry to get room cleaned I stayed in the hotel till 3pm I had house keeping knocking on my door at least 5 times despite the do not disturb sign on , Location is brilliant
336891,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, I cannot fault this hotel in any way Recently stayed in the Studio Suite and was amazed by the generous size of the room and all the features The staff are amazing always professional and cannot do enough for you Our luggage was stored before check in and at check out allowing us to explore the city without any hassle Great location beautifully decorated and the beds are very comfortable I will definitely be returning on my next trip to London 
336892,Flemings Mayfair, I had an internal room and the mobile signal was non existent This was really frustrating even after asking reception Are you sure I can get a mobile signal in the room Poor , I like the hotel

337045,Flemings Mayfair, We were very disappointed with our room Very small One of the windows could not be opened more than a few inches because of the brick wall immediately in front of it The bathroom was awful hardly room for two people to stand aside of each other I am slightly disabled and could not climb into bath to have a shower,No Positive
337046,Flemings Mayfair, All staffs really friendly and pleasant except lady duty manager she is just performing her duty not going above and beyond Staffs don t wear name tags or at least a visible one so did not get her name , Newly renovated rooms All staffs are really helpful Love T London s shampoo Proximity to Green Park tube station walking distance to Bond Street shopping 
337047,Flemings Mayfair, Room was very small and not particularly luxurious staff didn t look happy or friendly The hotel just didn t have a nice vibe The breakfast room was very cold due to mad air conditioning Couldn t do well done toast either warm bread or burnt This is very poor as breakfast was 19 Don t think I will return or recommend , nice welcome from doorman 
337048,Flemings Mayfair, We loved everything I didn t like leaving , We haven t had such a good nights sleep in a loooong time The beds were super comfy the bed linen was super soft the room was lovely and warm the room was super dark when we drew the curtains and it was deadly silent We never heard doors shutting late at night or voices Amazing 
337049,Flemings Mayfair, nothing really The only thing I would say is to sort the heating out in the beautiful bathroom It was the only cold room in the apartment , our original room executive on the 1st floor was lovely but had a noisy a c unit outside the window so we asked to change the room and were upgraded to a beautiful 1 bedroom apartment Thanks Flemings staff you made our stay memorable 
337050,Flemings Mayfair, The bath was too small and deep The mini bar and snacks were very very expensive The dinner menu was to fancy so we ate out We like traditional food , The bed was very comfortable The breakfast was so lovely and the waitress was so attentive 
337051,Flemings Mayfair, It was pretty perfect to be honest The only two points I disliked were the random 5 40 service charge which appeared on the bill service was lovely but most hotels take this as a given and the price for breakfast 52 for two if you took it we didn t , A delightful hotel old fashioned in the best way with excellent facilities staff were extremely welcoming We were upgraded to a suite at no extra cost and the room was charming Comfy bed and large room great bathroom with a powerful shower and attractive toiletries Perfect location comfortable and stylish 
337052,Flemings Mayfair, Nothing We had a super cheap deal on a room and it was a not yet refurbished room however we liked that room it was very clean and excellent value for money in that location , Excellent location mostly superb staff clean and dog friendly though dogs not allowed in the lounge 
337053,Flemings Mayfair, I ve returned since the recent refurbishment I find no plugs sockets next to a bed frustrating Having to use a hairdryer standing in front of a bathroom door irritating A television instead of a mirror on the wall above the only decent surface in a bedroom poor planning For the first time after many stays I felt cramped and that more than one night wouldn t be ideal, Well situated excellent staff and service
337054,Flemings Mayfair, Room was very hot there was no heating on but if you opened windows it was really noisy from the street We didn t spend a lot of time in the room but Im glad I got such a good deal with Booking com I wouldn t have been impressed if I had paid full price, Lovely clean hotel staff very friendly
337055,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, This was the perfect weekend Go to London multiple times per year and always like to try new 4 and 5 star hotels every now and then This one is definitely going to my list of stay again when traveling there The Hotel is amazing and everyone is super nice The Hotel is very clean beds are very comfy staff is very friendly and helpful Didn t get a chance to go the restaurant but will definitely come back again and try it Got an upgrade on arrival which made the weekend even better From all the 4 stars Hotels in central London this is by far one of my favorites 
337056,Flemings Mayfair, No complaints , Staff were very welcoming on arrival Location was perfect right next to underground Loved the room comfy beds with late check out of 2pm 
337057,Flemings Mayfair, The continental breakfast was very limited choice and poor selection for the price Full breakfast however was excellent, Location and all staff very professional and friendly
337058,Flemings Mayfair, Very hard to find fault if i was being really picky i d say the room temperature was slightly to high , Ormer Mayfair is definitely a place to visit if love food Class place all round from the staff to the location to the decor and food 
337059,Flemings Mayfair, The price of breakfast was not made clear don t have the a la carte and items such as a bread roll or just cereal from the buffet breakfast as they charge as if you had had the full quota Stick to one or the other , Great location Can walk to most theatres We stayed in Rm 81 which had just been refurbished so was absolutely lovely and very quiet even though on the road side Ladies there was actually a dressing table mirror and hairdryer plug all in the same place 
337060,Flemings Mayfair, Noise from the elevator in the room no 400 Luckily lift not used through the night but from 7 30am knocking noise everytime lift used, T V and audio package good Bar excellent and all staff brilliant
337061,Flemings Mayfair, The hotel was undergoing some renovations when we went there and this caused us some disturbance in the room from the noise et al, Location was excellent
337062,Flemings Mayfair, The breakfast was not value for money They ran out of sausage and black pudding We were not offered anything extra as an alternative but the table next to us was The breakfast was removed from the bill after we explained at reception , The hotel restaurant was excellent We had a fantastic evening meal in the Ormer Restaurant The tasting menu was superb 
337063,Flemings Mayfair, Breakfast was included but we still had to sign a bill at breakfast which we questioned but we were told it was only to confirm breakfast It was then incorrectly charged to our check out bill and they needed to take it off It is a shame that was our final experience as everything else was great , The staff were all very helpful and we got an upgrade to a 2 bedroom suite which
337064,Flemings Mayfair, Room size for the price seemed excessive even for Mayfair However we knew this before we booked and everything we needed was there , Friendly staff nothing was too much trouble The attention to detail of the decor down to providing umbrellas to go out for the evening was a lovely touch 
337065,Flemings Mayfair, Bathrooms are a bit cramped Hot water pressure fluctuated and there was no hand shower which my girlfriend did not like Construction outside was a bit noisy but no fault of the hotel s , Very nice older hotel Rooms are nicely upgraded the staff is great and the bar lounge is really good Location is great Convenient to Green Park Tube and Hyde Park A very smart area of town 
337066,Flemings Mayfair, Bed was short Expensive cocktail cost 16 plus an unadvertised 4 on top of that to pay No wonder the bar was super quiet They were tasty though Thought I had clicked on breakfast option when booking but it didn t appear on confirmation Couldn t upgrade it in hotel website had 15 more breakfast whereas hotel wanted 40 more when there , Beautiful surrounds and looks Attentive staff
337067,Flemings Mayfair, We called down to book a table at the restaurant on Sunday After we came down dressed we were told the restaurant is closed We had to find a alternate location at around 9 30pm which was not ideal , The atmosphere was amazing and the interior The service is really good and makes you feel relaxed from the time you get in 
337068,Flemings Mayfair, Where do I start 1 Deluxe room was not as depicted on Booking com or hotel website I called twice in advance to ensure refurbishments were complete and requested a quiet room upon booking I was assured that all construction upstairs was complete yet I found myself in a room at the back of the hotel right next to a stairwell with noisy construction taking place all week 2 As a female traveling alone I was surprised that there was no security access cards installed in the lifts and no physical deadbolts on the door When I inquired about security the male hotel staff literally laughed at me and told me This is Mayfair and perfectly safe Yet my friend who was not staying at the hotel easily walked through the hotel lobby at 1am and to my room without anyone asking any questions 3 They cheekily overcharged on room service by charging 50GBP for Open Food rather than charging the a la carte prices shown on the in room dining menu 4 Upon check out they could not get any of their credit card machines to function so they promised to charge my card later and send me the final invoice A week after my departure and I am still waiting , Nespresso machines in the room Great location in Mayfair close to Green Park
337069,Flemings Mayfair, Views from the windows of the room we stayed in were limited but that is expected due to the nature of the location and placing of the hotel , Very comfortable accommodation very clean and modern The staff were very polite professional and helpful It s a great hotel Easy to navigate around the hotel with clear signposts indicating where all of the various amenities in the hotel Although there were building works ongoing Great restaurant and bar with reasonable prices considering the location 
337070,Flemings Mayfair, T Hotel is currently a building site I feel misled by Booking and the rating you gave it I was in room 61 on the ground floor next to a pantry and 2 yards from the dining room People were chatting in the corridor outside the room until late in the evening It is really rubbish ,No Positive
337071,Flemings Mayfair, There were a few lapses by the staff Another room s dirty dishes were left outside our room for more than a day We had to call twice before they were removed There was no secure location to store luggage Our luggage was left unattended and I was able to remove my passport with out anyone noticing This may have been due to construction but it s still not acceptable in a hotel like this , Great location in the heart of everything In house restaurants are excellent The staff were very friendly and attentive The bed was very comfortable and the closet space was sufficient 
337072,Flemings Mayfair, Currently having renovation works in the lobby but don t let it put you off the rooms are stunning and the staff couldn t be better, Staff very polite and happy to help with anything
337073,Flemings Mayfair, nothing, Breakfast is excellent they have Michelin Star resturant inside of the hotel and provide breakfast there Location and room design atmospher everythig is very high standard 
337074,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, The new bar and restaurant very nice that will make the hotel an even better place to stay The staff are all very helpful and polite Location is Perfect 
337075,Flemings Mayfair, Everything was great although they were undergoing some foyer renovations during our stay , Simply amazing From the moment we walked in the door the staff were incredible They go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable It s the loveliest and cosiest room we ve stayed in brand new and very clean with a complimentary Nescafe machine that they keep stocked up The location is right neat Green Park train and underground and just a stroll to Buckingham If I come back to London I will stay here again 
337076,Flemings Mayfair, Rate when I booked included breakfast I was sure but hey it never and at 230 for less than 12 hours with not even a coffee and a croissant for breakfast is a bit tight The room smelt of cigarettes which was confirmed by the lad that fixed our tv that needed a reboot Finally the worst partt was a small grey haired lady at reception whom was clearly someone senior in the business giving a member of staff a public bollocking She said that he was dancing with a guest the night before I think at an event in the hotel and that he and other staff were not concentrating and as a result 15 was short in the till float She said some people don t care here to which the lad being told off defended himself She backed off a little and then said it was not good enough with a stern tone Fair enough one might say But why is a disciplinary hearing being held and heard in public It is a private business matter between employer and employee therefore not to be in the public domain regardless If he did get sacked for the allegation then he has a case for wrongful dismissal id say All that in 11 hours at the Fleming hotel and they charged me for it Wow Never again , Location and building were great Young lad who came to fix our to was very polite and professional 
337077,Flemings Mayfair, there was strong smell of paint and chemicals during our stay every morning at 830 the sounds of construction could be heard loudly in our rooms we called ahead to ask about the renovation and we were told that we would not hear anything as they were putting final touches such as paint and no heavy construction was being done they failed to mention that the building next door was under complete construction and the sounds of jackhammers and drills could be heard easily through the walls , the location was amazing in Mayfair and the rooms are nicely remodeled
337078,Flemings Mayfair, Renovation works were so noisy The workers noise and what they did starts before 8 a m daily The last 4 days they put electrical generator working the whole day It was very annoying ,No Positive
337079,Flemings Mayfair, The double bed was two single beds pushes together Also it was my girlfriends birthday and no effort was made The hotel was notified about this a week in advance ,No Positive
337080,Flemings Mayfair, It was a shame that our stay was just at the end of the refurbishment of the dining room etc which promises to make the hotel even better I also had a problem with operation of the TV which didn t seem very intuitive , The decor was classy and the bath luxurious the hotel staff were all friendly and helpful I was pleased that the hotel more than fitted the bill as a special treat for my Mother in Law s 90th birthday 
337081,Flemings Mayfair, The room was a little small breakfast we ordered to be delivered to the room came half an hour late and was a little bit of a sting in terms of price , The room was beautifully decorated bathroom was lovely Breakfast was good 
337082,Flemings Mayfair, Very poor to no wifi Current building works mean temporary entrance to gym which means going outside fine but covered in bird droppings As a woman needing to dry her hair there was no mirror in the bedroom to enable me to do this in front of a mirror ,No Positive
337083,Flemings Mayfair, N a, My room had been recently renovated and it was amazing WAY better than I expected in a very lush location The staff were professional and friendly Can not find fault with anything Excellent will stay there again 
337084,Flemings Mayfair, Building work ongoing and restaurant will not open till September now This was disappointing Refreshments in entrance very good , Great Location and excellent staff
337085,Flemings Mayfair, Some noise from street major building work in that area , Great location Friendly staff liked the snacks and fresh fruit etc for guests in reception a thoughtful and welcome treat 
337086,Flemings Mayfair, Nothing even though they are currently doing some renovations the hotel was still well presented and had a good feel, Rooms were small but well appointed Very Comfortable Bed and Bathroom had great shower More than enough for a single traveller The Staff very attentive polite and helpful will definitely keep this hotel on my Yes list when visiting London on Business
337087,Flemings Mayfair, Room was very small Building works was very noisy We had loud banging and sanding In my view they should not let the rooms that are near the building works, Breakfast was lovely
337088,Flemings Mayfair, Noise from renovations Doors that auto slam shut loudly Old shower Reception area lobby decor very bare doesn t feel like 4 hotel upon walking in maybe they were renovating , Location Free wifi unlimited devices Lots of lighting options in room Night shift staffs I came across were all very friendly and helpful All day until 9 pm free snacks and drinks self served 
337089,Flemings Mayfair, Construction work was being carried out but the disruption and noise was minimal whilst we were there , Staff were attentive and courteous Location was perfect as we were attending an event at the RAF Club on Piccadilly 
337090,Flemings Mayfair, I had a room on the ground floor Construction site was 1 meter away from my window I was woken up at 7 30 am and wasn t able to sleep Its ok for 1 night stay but until the building next to the hotel is completed I would not recommend staying there There are better places for this price Breakfast is not worth the money, Perfect location
337091,Flemings Mayfair, need to fix the lift they are need better ventilation options in small rooms, bed was very comfy good tea coffee service in room and lobby wifi was reasonable performance too can t beat the location right next to green park 
337092,Flemings Mayfair, They have building works going on and it really did make an impact on us with the very load noise and it caused issues with the kitchen services as well Breakfast was 24 each and really didnt feel like we got value Fried eggs were crispy tomatoes cold and it felt like whoever cooked it didnt know anything about a full english and its qualities Would we stay again No We found it overall a quite dark and dreary hotel as our room was in the corner of the property and lacked light Furniture was dark and made a dim room even worse , Room was great and we had a free upgrade as well Location spot on right next to Hyde Park Staff very attentive and made stay very comfortable indeed 
337093,Flemings Mayfair, There was a great deal of renovation though necessary it was on going throughout my stay , The location was ideal centrally situated to many of London s icons The Underground and bus services were easily accessed and one could walk leisurely through the nearby parks or join the street crowds in the Westminster and Mayfair neighbourhoods 
337094,Flemings Mayfair, The building work meant we were woken up at 8am sharp on Saturday morning with horrendous clattering and banging, The breakfast items in the foyer were great
337095,Flemings Mayfair, It stated check in was at 14 00 but our room was actually not ready until 15 00, The decor was lovely Staff extremely friendly courteous and willing to help with whatever we may have needed We got upgraded to a suite and were delivered a free cake tray complete with candles for my friend s birthday 
337096,Flemings Mayfair, Nothing to dislike, Everything about the hotel was excellent couldn t find any fault the bed was so comfortable staff were very polite and helpful in every way they possibly could have been
337097,Flemings Mayfair, The lift wasn t working The AC in the room wasn t working either They charged me extra for service charge for no reason , Location Check in out was fast 
337098,Flemings Mayfair, The rooms are decorated in a style we are not that fond of , Very friendly and helpdul staff Nice arrangemang with fruit coffe snacks etc on a table in lobby Just Love the Mayfair area 
337099,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, I stayed here with my daughter for a birthday surprise On arrival we received a room upgrade my daughter was presented with birthday cakes It is a lovely hotel with tasteful refurbishments adding to its charm It is in a fantastic location a short stroll through Green park to Buckingham palace also within walking distance of Trafalgar Leicester Square etc The staff were very friendly helpful We fully enjoyed our stay 
337100,Flemings Mayfair, Just the smell of cooked food specially in the morning due to construction activity in the hotel Good thing it will end in July 2016, Everything from the room cleansing to the staff friendly interaction 
337101,Flemings Mayfair, I sprung for the delux room I think it was not the cheapest one and i was expecting a nice big room but it was small and had one window in the corner of the room with a wonderful view of scaffolding and bird poo The pics online were definitely misleading There was also a downpipe loose so In the morning it sounded like a waterfall right outside the window Not what I was expecting for what I paid , The staff were fantastic Very friendly helpful and chatty It felt friendly coming into the hotel The bed was incredible and slept like a log and I Was trying to think of ways to take the bedding and the towels with me Very comfortable 
337102,Flemings Mayfair, Poor staff bad attitude billed incorrectly and tried to add VAT and a service charge to something that was already paid for adding over 200 to the stay When challenged it took a long time to sort , Location
337103,Flemings Mayfair, The slight humming noise of the subway we were on the first floor next time I would stay on a higher floor I am very noise sensitive it did not bother my daughter , The hotel is renovating and the room we had was beautifully done the attention to detail was impressive It was very clean the location is great the staff was great The room lighting was really good 
337104,Flemings Mayfair, Due to renovation work no breakfast was served but we were well informed on beforehand and during the stay , Nice beds nice staff and the location is just perfect for a mini vacation in London 
337105,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel perfect location for good restaurants and shopping Tube station close by too which made getting around London very easy 
337106,Flemings Mayfair, Nothing needed improving It has it all , We had a fabulous time at this hotel It was undergoing refurbishment to upgrade to a michellin star but the room we were in was brilliant The staff were really friendly and helpful The location was fabulous All attractions were in easy reach and just around the corner is an abundance of pubs and restaurants in Shepherds Market Would definitely recommend especially when makeover completed 
337107,Flemings Mayfair, I had an old room nore renovated and the door was so short did not cover the whole and you could here everything from outside so I no I could not sleep well ,No Positive
337108,Flemings Mayfair, I found that the hotel s service and ambience had gone down due to no doubt the ongoing building work I found the noise of the building work that started at 8 00 to be somewhat irritating nothing like the noise of a drill and hammering to start the day off well and breakfast took a very long time to arrive However when I complained they did take the service charge off the breakfast cost I will go again and hopefully the building work will have finished , I have stayed here a number of times as it is a good location and the staff are usually efficient
337109,Flemings Mayfair, The fact that they added a service charge that was not declared up front The amount was fairly insignificant which makes it even more annoying that it wasn t declared in advance Is this a new trend I m unaware of Also my friend found two additional charges on her credit card when she returned home both refunded but that is not the point , Location great room great Staff very pleasant 
337110,Flemings Mayfair, The size of the bathroom was a little small considering the room was for two There was also no iron available in the room There was also work going on which was an annoying disturbance in the morning, The welcome and polite staff that s rested us The complimentary snacks in the lobby The fur throw over the dressing table the Bluetooth radio Above all the coffee machine 
337111,Flemings Mayfair, There are building works being carried out IN the hotel so we were rudely awoken at 7 30 on Saturday morning and it was impossible to sit in the room during the day because of the noise , Location staff appt 
337112,Flemings Mayfair, We was not told there was building work going on you are not supposed to work on a Sunday but we heard some drilling going on in the morning time I think we would should have been told at the time of the booking that work was taking place they did give us a letter when we checked in to say about the work on the Monday and I just thought it would be miner noise but at 7 30 in the morning I could just here work men talking very loud as if they were in the bathroom in my room and at 8 it was so loud I just got up and went to sit in my daughters room on the other side of the hotel ,No Positive
337113,Flemings Mayfair, Nothing to dislike, I could not find anything negative about my stay I knew breakfast would need to be brought to my room due to some discrete internal building and decorating which affected the dining room This did not spoil my enjoyment of breakfast The tray was absolutely loaded with so many different items of food expected in a continental breakfast The fruit salad was particularly good 
337114,Flemings Mayfair, Room was quite small with a very small bathroom Don t like getting a service charge to sit in the hotel bar and have a drink , Very comfortable beds great quality linens friendly team 
337115,Flemings Mayfair, Having to pay extra to guarantee twin beds rather than a double bed as I was staying with my don, Excellent location Helpful staff Clean comfortable quiet room
337116,Flemings Mayfair, The only thing I could say as a negative breakfast staff seemed to be a little disorganised especially when the breakfast room was not full I asked for poached egg had to keep asking them 40mins later my egg arrived Nothing major I know but wouldn t expect this from the Mayfair , The Mayfair is a small hotel compared to other hotels I frequently use in London having said that the Mayfair feels more friendly Concierge were very helpful Our first room was not quite up to my standards reception moved me without question Excellent location quiet street off Regent Street 
337117,Flemings Mayfair, the extra small room you could hardly turn in the bathroom Our original room had no access by lift so this was the alternative not good enough really, the location and friendly staff
337118,Flemings Mayfair, Triple room has two normal beds and a sofa which by any means can t be call a bed For the price you pay for a room it s a shame it is not comfy at all Room decor seems 2 decades older than on the pics Elevator not sufficient for the size of the venue We also didn t like the fact that after picking up our luggage after our check out we were no longer welcome in the hotel main areas I traveled with two elder women who just wanted to rest on the sofa before our evening flight As we were sited and only seated in the lobby we had a security concierge staff constantly standing next to us and checking closely what we were doing We left after 5min and we are never coming back Very unpleasant , The front desk staff was extremely kind and polite We were greeted with port wine which was really nice We also like the bar downstairs it had good selection of wines and whiskeys The breakfast was excellent Overall good experience if not the staff at the check out 
337119,Flemings Mayfair, Do not under any circumstance stay in room 65 whilst refurbishments are underway You will be woken up at 7 30 am by noise so loud you will not be able to so much as make a phone call Also don t expect an apology , The renovated rooms are well decorated 
337120,Flemings Mayfair, The room was too hot and the bed and pillows were a little firm These are very minor points in an excellent stay , Fabulous Great location beautiful hotel and extremely helpful and genuinely friendly staff Amazing value for money The concierge showed me to my room and offered me a cup or tea which was brought up instantly and not added to my bill and they waived the two bottles of water I took from the mini bar Really nice and thoughtful touches 
337121,Flemings Mayfair, Nothing In our case everything worked perfectly , Small hotel cozy lots of parts renovated and a very nice option for those who want the Mayfair area as far as budget goes 
337122,Flemings Mayfair, Standard room on this stay was much smaller than previous standard doubles and bed only really suitable for one person should be classified as a single room only, Location staff and ambience
337123,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, Great location the hotel hidden in a small but pleasant street and still very close to the important London landmarks and events Hotel beautifully designed cosy and clean friendly and helpful staff nice hotel restaurant with really nice food Very good deals even during the busy period 
337124,Flemings Mayfair, Our room was rather small and no view due to windows being blanked, Location was perfect 10 mins walk to piccadilly circus and 5 mins walk to buckingham palace
337125,Flemings Mayfair, No parking The apartment were too tight and not suitable for small children I complained to the hotel to move us But instead they brought door stoppers , The staff were really welcoming and polite 
337126,Flemings Mayfair, The heated floors were too hot and there was no way to turn them down except to have them disabled, Location Comfortable quiet spacious rooms were as described The staff was helpful the breakfast was great and having a private entrance made it feel like a home away from home 
337127,Flemings Mayfair, Would be better have a separated shower bath facility is a bit defective, Great location whereas in the quite area stuff friendliness cosy atmosphere
337128,Flemings Mayfair, The bathrooms were old unattractive and grotty The bedrooms were also far too small and too hot even with air con on Room 330 next to the store towel room meant that I was kept up all night as the washing machine was repeatedly on during the night The wardrobe was far too small in both rooms Over all both rooms need to be modernised , The bar and restaurants area the decor and seating was very tasteful Also the location was brilliant 
337129,Flemings Mayfair, We where offered a bottle of sparking wine to clelbrate our anniversary which was not sent to our room on the Saturday evening even after the reception manager reassured us that it would be Disappointing but they offered us the bottle to take home Overall and wonderful weekend with very friendly staff especially the Romanian Concierge , Location and staff friendlyness
337130,Flemings Mayfair, I was told that my room has been upgraded but I don t think it was I was given a semilar room to the one I saw on the website Worse in fact because it was on the ground floor directly opposite to construction there was work also on the upper floor very very very noisy I am still asking myself what kind of upgrade is this , The fast response by room service and housekeeping teams
337131,Flemings Mayfair, Nothing It s only 3 mins walk away from tube station Perfect location, Everything is great Room is lovely and cozy The breakfast is good Perfect 
337132,Flemings Mayfair, The hotel was being refurbished and my room had constant noise It should not have been let When I addressed reception the manager would come back to me about this he still needs to , Location
337133,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, Pure class in the heart of Mayfair and two mins from the park and the tube The service was second to none London is always expensive and it is definitely worth paying a little extra to stay here 
337134,Flemings Mayfair, decor a little tired suspect it was a room waiting to be upgraded woken early by what sounded like workmen working on adjacent room, Fantastic location Helpful staff
337135,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, Lovely boutique hotel great location friendly staff and really good recently refurbished rooms and public areas Will most definitely stay here again 
337136,Flemings Mayfair, No cooked breakfast before 0800 hrs When I required a decent cooked meal prior to forming up to march on the Cenotaph parade , Located close to my Meeting place and Green Park underground 
337137,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, This hotel exceeded our expectations The service was excellent and the accommodation very comfortable We were warned that there was refurbishment work in progress but were not disturbed by this Very good value for money Would stay there again 
337138,Flemings Mayfair, Minor niggles No hooks to hang robes or clothes on the back of the bathroom door Not many in room tea bags Toast still processed slices soft and barely browned so sub standard compared to the excellent breakfast Staff would respond if asked but shouldn t have to ask , The staff are always very helpful I love the location because it is easy to walk to all the main shopping and theatre areas The room is clean comfortable and the new refurbishment is classy and understated Rooms always quiet so good night s sleep 
337139,Flemings Mayfair, Having to queue and wait a long time for breakfast and not much food choices left and had to ask three times for a cup of tea and it came with no spoon and no milk , The hotel is very comfortable located in a lovely convenient area
337140,Flemings Mayfair, Housekeeping could step up their game a bit in the bathrooms , Rooms are modern and beautiful if small Much better option than the Hilton across the street 
337141,Flemings Mayfair, I was a little disappointed with our room it was tired worn carpets chipped furniture mould in the shabby bathroom I don t think I will return to this hotel such a shame as I ve heard such good things about it , Great location great breakfast great looking lobby 
337142,Flemings Mayfair, Room and bathroom on small side, Great location lovely clean hotel with beautiful decor and newly refurbished rooms Friendly staff and good breakfast 
337143,Flemings Mayfair, Door lock did not close when leaving the room they said they d do something and didn t but the worst was the building noise I was told it was outside the hotel that turned out not to be the case I refused to pay the additional service charge put on the bill , Location is good
337144,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, A beautiful hotel just across the road from Green Park It was a perfect location for our short stay The concierge was brilliant at getting us tickets for the theatre Breakfast was delicious and all the staff were very helpful 
337145,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, Wonderful location right in the heart of Mayfair but in such a quiet street you could enjoy peace and tranquility excellent staff also very professional and friendly 
337146,Flemings Mayfair, I usually stay at the May Fair Hotel whilst I am in London but decided to stay in a boutique hotel for a change Not a great idea I use booking com to book as you don t pay when you book I was surprised to be charged the full amount immediately upon booking 9 months in advance The room was nicely decorated but it smelt damp I found the source of the smell quickly as the grout in the shower area was mouldy it was disgusting The bathroom in general needed a complete update When checking in I was asked what newspaper I wanted and was amazed when I checked out to be charged for the paper The mini bar fridge wasn t cold , The decor was fantastic 
337147,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, The concierge service was outstanding they were even able to organize tickets to a sold out performance We were in one of the small rooms Apart from the size which is usual for London everything was up to standard Most of the rooms appear to have been renovated in the last years and they were currently refurbishing some rooms in another wing 
337148,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, Pretty boutique hotel Elegantly appointed in a Great location I was upgraded to a suite which was very well appointed The staff were friendly and helpful Hard to beat I will return 
337149,Flemings Mayfair, Double bed instead of twin beds then told it s a king size which it wasn t Also woken up by workman on a Sunday at 7 40 who was working in the room opposite Plug sockets on either side of the bed weren t working either , Location
337150,Flemings Mayfair, The standard room is cramped for two people and all the luggage We were not visiting London to hang around the room so it was manageable just not ideal The towel warmer would have been a nice feature if only it worked Maintenance checked it but it still didn t heat up in the morning , The location is close to Piccadilly and Green Park Lots to see and do in this Mayfair area Easy access to pubic transportation good restaurants shopping and Buckingham Palace What could be better The staff are very attentive helpful and polite in that charming British way What could be better We arrived prior to check in time but within 30 minutes we were able to check into our room on the 4th floor Very tastefully decorated comfortable bed with huggable pillows high thread count linens big soft towels First impression Lovely In the morning we chose the Continental breakfast plenty to choose from cereal fruit yogurt juice cherry and apricot danish rolls bread and croissants Add the delicious bottomless pot of tea coffee and one should not need to eat lunch We were happy And we would stay here again maybe get a larger room 
337151,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, The location was great the staff were super friendly and efficient have never had coffee brought so quickly in the morning nothing was too much trouble I had asked the concierge in the morning to have my car ready after a meeting at 5 30pm and it was waiting for me no fuss will certainly stay there next time was also really quiet at night and no traffic noise which for london is unusual 
337152,Flemings Mayfair, Being woken up three times in the middle of the night because someone smoking in their room caused the fire alarm to go off , Helpful friendly staff Intimate atmosphere Very good breakfast 
337153,Flemings Mayfair, After 10pm room service menu very limited but staff helped us order a pizza which was fine , Staff were very helpful in resolving booking to accomodate us better by finding us a twin room atvery short notice Central position was exactly where I needed to be Excellent service from all the staff who were very accomodating to all our requests

337157,Flemings Mayfair, The rooms were a bit smaller than I had expected but they were nicely done We had a room near the fire door which proved to be noisy , Excellent location We took the tube from Heathrow and got off at Green Park station elevators there to street level 
337158,Flemings Mayfair, Fire door misaligned and banged very loudly throughout the night Room doors also very noisy Air conditioning ineffective Sound proofing ineffective from other rooms All of which compromised sleep , Location
337159,Flemings Mayfair,No Negative, I ve stayed often at Flemings they re getting better I love it there wish they could recognize that I do stay a lot and offer some loyalty discount they never remember me and they should That would be probably the only criticism
