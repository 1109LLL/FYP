473841,UNA Hotel Century, We liked everything , We liked the spacious room since we are a family of 4 traveling with a lot of luggage Also we liked the proximity to Milano Centrale 
473842,UNA Hotel Century, Nothing really, Very accommodating when we asked to move room after 1 day as we preferred a lower floor originally 12th We had a small studio Very good and clean 
473843,UNA Hotel Century, The breakfast was not the greatest It was adequate but not nearly as good as the the previous two hotels we stayed at More fresh fruit instead of canned would be an improvement Also scrambled eggs were watery and tasted powdered Boiled eggs were a better choice but it would have been better to have them soft or medium boiled instead of hard boiled Coffee was excellent however , Very comfortable large room for a good price the location was one where you could get the metro to anywhere you wanted to go in just a few stops the metro is clean and easy Also close to the Central train stations which was convenient for our arrival and our day trip to Como Appreciated the offer of extra amenities including a more comfortable pillow The gentleman at reception when we arrived continued to be Our Man in Milan with clear directions and many good suggestions All staff was helpful but Dominico was exceptional 
473844,UNA Hotel Century, Location looked close to the train station but once there I realised that between the cobbled paving cul de sac the hotel is in walking to the station with two cases wasn t really that viable , Lovely hotel large very comfortable room really good on site restaurant 
473845,UNA Hotel Century, The restaurant has a rather small menu , The hotel is about a 5 minute walk to the train station and metro very convenient The hotel is modern and clean the staff is helpful Our junior suite was very comfortable beds were great beautiful bathroom with large shower Lots of choices for breakfast The bar restaurant has outdoor tables that make having an evening drink fun and manageable for people with kids in tow Wifi a bit irritating to get onto but fine once we had signed in 
473846,UNA Hotel Century,No Negative, Good size room nice bits of furniture Good Euro style breakfast nice mixture All you d want from a business hotel so a little bit sterile But would recommend it for business 
473847,UNA Hotel Century, The location was tucked off the street had to pass some homeless people to get there , There was a lot of space the breakfast was good and had a lot of variety 
473848,UNA Hotel Century, nothing, Breakfast was so good Comfortable bed and very large family suite Modern amenities are provided and the view from our room to the city is so nice Location is perfect within walking distance from Milan Central station 
473849,UNA Hotel Century, Not much F B choices, Excellent location where 3 minutes walk from Milan Central Train Station There is a nice Japanese Restaurant nearby the hotel
473850,UNA Hotel Century, A dividing curtain between the two bedroom areas would be even better A liitle expensive Clearer directions from central train station would be welcome Walk out of train station cross plaza turn right then left Hotel is within 200m of station , Clean comfortable large family room with two double beds good bathroom wallsafe and free wifi Good location close to central train station and metro Just four metro stops to Duomo Get a single journey ticket for just 1 50 Excellent breakfast Soya milk was a bonus Professional friendly staff Late checkout possible Reception has a locked room for leaving bags after checkout 
473851,UNA Hotel Century, I had to extend my reservation with 1 day and the receptionists gave me 3 different prices For 5 minutes the price got 80 on top of my initial reservation It was inconvenient for my family to move to another hotel at a more reasonable price so we finally decided to pay I was not happy with the lack of flexibility and reasonable price in this case ,No Positive
473852,UNA Hotel Century, Sometimes there we had a problem setting the air conditioning to what we wanted , Enormous room 40 square meters comfortable bed great breakfast Right next to a street with at least 10 restaurants Helpful staff
473853,UNA Hotel Century,No Negative, Had one night in Milan only and needed to stay close to Milan Centrale UNA Century Hotel had large comfortable modern rooms within a short walk from the train station Roberta at the front desk was very helpful She offered advise for restaurants public transportation as well as things to see while in town Breakfast was quite good with an array of options from breads cheeses and meats to cereals yogurt pastries and juices 
473854,UNA Hotel Century, The property is hard to locate from the street although a sign is provided on the footpath to direct you in between buildings, The property is conveniently located near the train station with the airport link It is quiet and on a leafy street The room was spacious There are plenty of restaurants cafes and convenience stores nearby
473855,UNA Hotel Century, The reception people are not as interactive or lively when interacting with English speaking guest , good hotel close to milano central and easy access to most spots in the city Not much activities for children especially 10 years old Receptionist not too pleasant although the hotel overall is excellent 
473856,UNA Hotel Century, The condition of the room detailing cracked tiles rotting door frame loose radiator trims Not what you expect from a superior room , Great location to explore city centre super selection of local restaurants and few minutes walk to all transport links Particular note was helpful and friendly receptionist Marina 
473857,UNA Hotel Century, wifi connection was really poor and also if you needed bathrob or slippers you had to call and ask when you go to the hotel tired after flight and you need a shower it is really uncomfortable to find out that there are no bathrobe and slippers and that firtstly you need to call to the reception ask for them and then wait when they will deliver , the room size
473858,UNA Hotel Century, Waiting time in breakfast hall due to limited of tables, Wide range of breakfast choice Staff at reception were very friendly It was very easy to access to hotel from anywhere in Milan

473860,UNA Hotel Century, Free wifi was a bit slow and limiting Staff whilst pleasant and efficient could be a bit more welcoming and cheery , Simple and modern furnishings Huge room with an enormous super comfortable bed and an excellent desk for working Excellent breakfast Very close to Centrale FS train station 5 minutes walk Easy to get to all main historical attractions Duomo etc either by metro 10 mins from Centrale or a very pleasant walk 30 40 minutes which is a great way to experience the vibrancy of the city centre Great location for taking a trip by train from Centrale to Lake Como 
473861,UNA Hotel Century, The neighborhood was not safe at night , This Hotel was only one block from the Milan Central Train Station The location while very convenient for the train was not an area that I would feel comfortable walking around at night The hotel was gorgeous and had an amazing breakfast The staff went above and beyond and the security at the hotel was excellent I would highly recommend this hotel for its excellent breakfast high quality of amenities and location to the train station 
473862,UNA Hotel Century, No Heater in rooms when temperature outside is 6 degrees Blanket as thin as a bed sheet and spare blanket in horrible condition Concierge had no information at all regarding places guided me wrong , Location

473866,UNA Hotel Century, The view of our room was not good we had a room on the 2nd floor the hotel has 17 floors I think and we could see a brick wall from the adjacent building i suppose if we had a room in a higher floor there would not be a problem The wifi was OK but a little slow , The hotel is located near the Milan Central station and it is very easy to get to The room was quite big spotlessly clean and the bed was enormous The bathroom was luxurious and well equipped The personnel was very polite and helpful The breakfast area was modern and practical The variety of breakfast choices was quite big and could satisfy everyone

473870,UNA Hotel Century, A bit noisy from the doors of the rooms that lock and unlock noisily No fresh fruit juice for breakfast even though one may replace it with fresh fruit salad available , Good location about 10 minutes walk from the train station and the bus to Linate airport from where we came The room is spacious so is the bathroom very clean The possibility of choosing the pillow according to everyone s preference 
473871,UNA Hotel Century, The sofa bed is too soft and could be changed into a single proper bed because the room is huge and it was a family suite , The croissants were delicious and their coffee machine is superb Walking distance to the Milano centrale station is about 5 minutes Very quite and nice surrounding They different exits and entrances to the hotel and many eateries surrounding the hotel 
473872,UNA Hotel Century, Reception when arrive is not friendly but when check out is worse than arrived Both is female staff Check out staff very slow that we need to buy new train ticket due to late around 2 3 minutes and face is really never smile , Not far from train and metro central

473881,UNA Hotel Century, staff at breakfast restaurant did not well good when they serve hotel guests, Family room quite big interior design wifi was good easy to go to anywhere 
473882,UNA Hotel Century, My pet topic the hairdryers, This hotel is very modern clean and comfortable and a great location with the Milan centrale located just around the corner Rooms are quite spacious and there was plenty of room for our bags The bathroom was also comparatively large Would definitely stay here again 
473883,UNA Hotel Century, need more smile from the staff in the restaurant , The location is perfect Near the Milano Centrale The Breakfast selection is also a bonus Very nice spacious room 
473884,UNA Hotel Century, We requested for a simple packed breakfast for our last morning as we had an early train to catch This request was made twice upon check in and again on our last night there Both times we were assured that it would be possible to get it However we did not get the packed breakfast and the morning receptionist told us that the request was not put through to the kitchen as the night staff had personal problems and did not focus on her work That is surely a sorry excuse , The room was very spacious and nicely furnished Location was great just a short walk from the main train station We arrived about 10am but were allowed early check in which was a bonus point The receptionist Dominique was very pleasant and helpful 
473885,UNA Hotel Century, We stayed only one night so had not time to figure out what could be improved or implemented , Location size of the room amenities cleanliness buffet breakfast parking lot little dogs stayed for free Recommended 
473886,UNA Hotel Century, Maybe a better variety of breakfast offerings for those who spend more than just a few days We stayed a week , Nice variety of cold cereals eggs and bacon always available great variety of sweets and fruits Friendly and helpful service specialists 
473887,UNA Hotel Century, the breakfast needs improvement Other than that everything else was excellent clean spotless spacious room great shower and amenity supply courteous staff powerful aircon 250m from central train station , wide selection of breakfast but items were generally average in taste 
473888,UNA Hotel Century, We didn t like the rude un helping staff especially front door As a couple we asked for a double bed during booking but on arrival there were available only rooms with single beds Housekeeping was closed on our arrival 9 pm and nobody was available to fix the beds Nobody fixed the bed even the next days of our stay The parking was uncomfortable every time you had to get out you had to wait for somebody from the staff to come and open the door Internet was so bad and slow functioning both free and payed version When we called the reception to notify the problem we were told that we were the only people having this issue and they couldn t help us as they were unable to call the technician for a problem concerning only the guest line As we needed the internet for work we were forced to exit the hotel and search for an internet caf , The hotel was clean and had a strategic position for visiting Milan Breakfast was good and had several options both sweet and salty 
473889,UNA Hotel Century, Nothing, We stayed at Una Century again on the return leg of our journey because of its convenient location near the Centrale station As we were catching the 7 55am train to Malpensa we asked the Reception staff if they could pack our breakfast for us They did and it was a generous selection in individual bags for the four of us 
473890,UNA Hotel Century, We were assured that a box breakfast will be available when we checked out at 545am to catch a train and will be too early for breakfast We infact confirmed this twice with the reception However upon checking out there was no such arrangements made Otherwise an overall good experience , We were given early check in since the rooms were available and that was great after a long flight to Milan Helpful check in staff counter and polite Close to the main train station 
473891,UNA Hotel Century, Location Since the property is in a business area and surrounded by other buildings there were limited places to visit see or eat and there was hardly anyone around on the streets This did make walking around in the evening more difficult if not impossible as there was large groups of homeless stationed on the street corner that felt more like skid row They didn t bother us but being 2 females we didn t leave anything to chance Also not the hotel s fault and the rating does not apply Food Drinks Limited selections on both We had breakfast included not worth it unless you are in desperate need of food in the morning And a firm no on the room service , We were only here for 1 evening and we booked it for the proximity to the train station as we flew into Milan and was leaving by train to Venice This was a big plus as the train station was 10mins from the hotel Mobility The property is in a business area It is in front of a light rail line and the metro stop is about 10 15min walk This got us easily to all the sights Comfort The room was clean and nice The hotel had more a of a luxury apartment feel then hotel Normal adminities bed very firm desk sitting area telly and minibar Bathroom was clean and had a walk in rain shower Front desk staff and bar Friendly service was good 
473892,UNA Hotel Century, The rubbish collectors were at work from about 5 30am I was awaken by the noise , Only a short walk from Centrale Station The room was clean and of good size for family of four 
473893,UNA Hotel Century, Service was mediocre Staff were not personable Weird knocking noises in our room forced us to request to change rooms at 4am with little sympathy and assistance from staff , Great location 5 minutes from Central station Lovely well designed and spacious rooms extremely comfortable bed

473897,UNA Hotel Century, Unlike the last time we stayed there the staff particularly upon checking in was unfriendly to the point of being rude Also even though the reservation was clearly for two there were only bathroom towels etc for one , Our room was large comfortable and well furnished It was also very clean The location within an easy 2 block walk of Stazione Centrale was ideal since we traveled by train from the Cinque Terre 
473898,UNA Hotel Century,No Negative, The location is good Most tourist attractions are within 10 min walk The room is well furnitured with Venice style though it s not so spacious if you are with big luggage I like it and reasonable price compared to other hotels 
473899,UNA Hotel Century, The shower was awkward the rainhead sprayed you if you tried to turn it on even standing outside the shower Rainhead was default , Overall the hotel is nice with high end finishes and a good look The staff were great and the location was perfect for our vacation stop Temperature in the room was nice Channels on the TV were reasonable 
473900,UNA Hotel Century, Hotel itself is old and need investments especially for a price they ask Room was not properly cleaned garbage remained in the room was a surprise Free Internet is very pure and even with unlimited package for 15 EUR was not performing much better 15 EUR in our time , Room was ok needs a bit of refurbishment but acceptable 
473901,UNA Hotel Century, I needed an iron and since there was not one in the room I asked at reception and was told no laundry service at the weekend and I could not borrow an iron Minor irritation , The bed was enormous and super comfortable Toiletries were excellent quality and the bathroom was roomy and clean with plenty of towels We found the room quiet and we could sleep without being disturbed Excellent breakfast and wonderful Italian snacks available free in the bar area Would definitely stay again 
473902,UNA Hotel Century, Breakfast wasn t great Cold scrambled eggs and bacon not much variety Diggers woke us up every morning Only one flat pillow with bed which was uncomfortable No bath and robes and slippers not provided as stated in the booking , Location was great 5 mins from central station with direct links to the centre of Milan Staff were friendly Mini bar was replenished every day
473903,UNA Hotel Century, Nothing exciting about the food here so if you can I would eat dinner out in one of the many restaurants nearby , The location close to the Central Railway Station was excellent Hotel rooms were lovely clean and spacious Lovely bathroom and shower 
473904,UNA Hotel Century, I would prefer that basic products like hair conditioner and body cream were available in the room rather than request hotel services to bring these basic things to your room , The front staff were extremely helpful rooms excellent size with very good layout and good amenity

473907,UNA Hotel Century, Nothing comes to mind , A lovely hotel in a great location near to Central Station but in a quiet setting We found it very easily on arrival from Milan Malpensa airport by train and it was a great base from which to pick up our rental car get the bus to Milan Linate airport on departure and to catch the subway into central Milan The suite was lovely clean spacious and nicely furbished Breakfast was good with plenty of selection We wouldn t hesitate in recommending it to other families we travelled with our 2 sons aged 10 and 6 yrs We stayed at either end of our trip for a night each time and it was ideal The staff were very welcoming and even arranged for the bar to stay open to serve us some food when we arrived late from the airport after it had just closed

473915,UNA Hotel Century, It was not clear that extra bed would be a pull out couch There were no glass glasses in room two plastic flimsy glasses in this type hotel I would think a glass would be in order There was one chair for 3 people no closets walls were quite heavily marked Snacks in bar were very limited and quite poor in quality There was very little information forthcoming although they did provide information when asked a specific question We asked for rooms near each other so one group got a room on floor 8 and the other floor 14 really near each other , Room was fine quite large although quite minimalist Shower was large and with great power Lots of lovely large towels Toiletries were lovely 
473916,UNA Hotel Century, Nothing, Hotel was located very close to central train station Our room was very clean and quite large Staff were friendly and the included buffet breakfast was fantastic Several nice restaurants within walking distance as is the metro 
473917,UNA Hotel Century, The staff were only interested if it added money onto the bill Buffet was poor and other options are better value outside of hotel Staff hostile over making changes such as cancelling breakfast and a taxi Bin in bedroom and water was not changed and towels dumped in the room Air conditioning in room was not very good Very disappointed with the attitude of some of the staff , Small but great pool which was well looked after and a simple tram into town

473919,UNA Hotel Century, Couldn t find any tv stations in English that worked Had to have third choice on mains menu as the kitchen was closed 7pm and only had ice cream for dessert , Loved the room Very spacious bathroom was a dream 
473920,UNA Hotel Century, Access by car is not evident for the first time but ok if once located nevertheless the car is not necessarily even not recommended to discover Milano , Recently renovated hotel we had a spacious room for 4 persons with all comfort and very nice and functional decoration Staff is also 4 stars breakfast was great and an ice cool draft and a surprising complete Whisky bar were waiting for the afterwork Next to tramway station and central railway station with Underground But if you like to walk and discover Milano by feet you can also join the historical center by e g crossing the new business complex about 3 km to the duomo You have to visit also the Naviglio district in the SW of Milano A must if you come for the first time and especially if you like good food in a variety of restaurants and locations in an astonishing atmosphere

473927,UNA Hotel Century, The wifi login arrangements were a bit confusing but worked in the end , The hotel is close to Milano Centrale station which is great but is quite a long way from the centre of Milan However the metro system in Milan is very good The hotel felt more like a typical business focussed hotel It is very modern but lacks any atmosphere The rooms are pretty spacious and clean Breakfast in the hotel was good 
473928,UNA Hotel Century,No Negative, The experience of staying at UNA was just fantastic The stuff were extremely helpful the room was stylish clean and comfortable the breakast was sufficient and varied We also got the room on a higher floor with a nice view overlooking the city and a double bed all the things we specified as desirable prerequisites in our booking The hotel is also close to a train metro station which is very convinient The only thing is that it might be diffucult to fnd the entrance once you arrive late so it s better to familiarize yourself with direction prior to the arrival 
473929,UNA Hotel Century, No swimming pool , You could choose what type of pillow you wanted for bed Great location Few minutes walk to milano centrale station 10 min walk to the shops 
473930,UNA Hotel Century, Poor Wifi connection No more than one device can be connected Frequent dropping of signals Room Fridge was not cooling at all , Location was good Room size was decent

473938,UNA Hotel Century,No Negative, This is our second stay at the hotel Love the location if you are traveling by train The renovated rooms are excellent and the toiletries are awesome 
473939,UNA Hotel Century, Highly incompetent staff with poor personal skills I was part of a group of 12 people family with children with 4 rooms for 5 nights stay During a voice controlled dispute about a quoted rate not being honored a manager ripped my phone out of my hands and then called the police The issue was thankfully resolved by the general manger who realized how inappropriate his staff had acted Prior to this act I mentioned that I would be contacting Booking com to let them know about how they are not honoring the rate I also mentioned that I would be posting a review on the manger s aggressive demeanor I then proceeded to take my phone out to take a picture of his badge when before I even took a picture he had ripped the phone out of my hand Borderline assault This all took place in front of my children and family There were numerous other issues but obviously this was the most striking one I will never stay at this hotel again ,No Positive
473940,UNA Hotel Century, Depending on layout of room you hear sounds of next door Don t like so much loud beeping sound when you enter your room , Spacious room Very clean Stable wifi I found very comfortable to work in room 
473941,UNA Hotel Century, Pillows are supposedly the core of their proposition but not only did we not have enough but the ones we had were surprisingly flat , Right by Milano Centrale station Works well if you arrive late and depart the next day Breakfast is good Family room is large Bathroom is modern clean and well equipped 
473942,UNA Hotel Century, Shower was very slow with poor water pressure Breakfast was the same every day with no variations , Everything was clean and well maintained Staff were friendly Hotel was small and quiet 
473943,UNA Hotel Century,No Negative, Spacious rooms with comfortable bed Staff at front desk were friendly and helpful We stayed during a busy weekend in Milan and there the room was a little more expensive than usual 
473944,UNA Hotel Century, The cooked breakfast buffet items weren t hot They need better hot plates to keep these items warm , Chose to stay in this hotel as it was only a short walk from the Central Station This made it very easy to get around Milan on the metro and hop on hop off bus and to from Bergamo airport Room was spacious Bed very comfy Breakfast was quite extensive cooked items fruit yogurts pastries cheeses hams salad Reception staff were helpful The entrance is set back from the road so you really need to look out for the roadside signs for the hotel entrance Some very good restaurants in the area around the hotel 
473945,UNA Hotel Century,No Negative, Nice Breakfast I really liked the list of items on the buffet breakfast room was light Room Bed was comfortable bathtub was super cool chairs and nice view really clean Service Really fast we could order free robs shampoo and bath salt They gave us a quiet room as we requested Receptionists were nice and informative The hotel really made our stay in Milan so much more enjoyable 
473946,UNA Hotel Century, It wasn t easy to find , Food was great Rooms were huge and clean and very modern Very comfortable bed Even when it is close to the station it was located on a quiet street Very safe Staff were very helpful close to LIN airport so even when flying out very early the taxi didn t cost so much
