284876,AC Hotel Victoria Suites a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, The hotel staff failed to arrange a mini van taxi to the airport thou I informed them one day before and I ended up renting two taxi s Some of The staff has poor information about the city , The value for money is far near the Metro station Hop hop bus and Club Barcelona 
284877,AC Hotel Victoria Suites a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, The hotel room feels a bit old the corridors carpets worn out the bath tiles cracked the TV reception was absolutely horrible impossible to watch anything as the picture was distorted and keeps freezing every few seconds Luckily I had my laptop so I could watch movies on it The breakfast was ok but no warm choices except an egg Not much around the property its mostly residential Booked and paid for a room with balcony but didnt get that Also it was supposed to have a cooking facilities but the room I got only had minibar which was also expensive, The rooms are very spacious and the location is in good proximity to the football stadium It is also about 10 mins walk to the metro which will take you into the city centre The bed was quite big which was nice
