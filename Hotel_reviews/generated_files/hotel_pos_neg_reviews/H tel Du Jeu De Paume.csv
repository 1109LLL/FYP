212367,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, A little bit expensive but worth it if you want to be in the Ile Saint Louis , The staff working in the hotel was superb Very helpful on everything very good English Great location Metro and RER station near by 
212368,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, nothing we plan to stay here again on our ext visit to Paris , Staff were extremely accommodating and friendly The room while not large was comfortable with adequate storage space for clothes The neighbourhood was amazing with shops restaurants and speciality purveyors nearby 5 minute walk to metro a little difficult if you have more than one bag but easy if you are bagless 
212369,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, , Exceptional hotel fabulous rooms very friendly and helpful staff great location for local boutique shopping as well as exploring Paris Such a beautiful area We were very impressed 
212370,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, The room we got was small with a mattress that hurt my back and a window open to a smoking area for guests I eventually asked to change rooms and was moved The in house breakfast is 20 euro per person and made breakfast a headache Overall this didn t feel like a four star hotel to me , The location is central and convenient The staff was friendly and helpful 
212371,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, No tea and coffee making facilities in the room but I think hat is pretty common in Europe , Perfect location in a quiet central part of Paris Lots of restaurants nearby Lovely rooms 
212372,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Breakfast was not included Continental Breakfast for 18 euros Found better breakfast in neighborhood for less than 10 euros WiFi was weak and dropped out , NIce Hotel In historic building Great Friendly staff Close to several attractions and fairly close to Metro
212373,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, The room was quite dark with poor lighting and the mattress too soft for my liking Breakfast was not included in rate and given the price not as good as hoped the coffee was often only lukewarm the cheese and ham processed , The location is excellent The staff is very friendly It is quaint and has interesting features 
212374,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, There was a note on the desk in our room asking that food and drinks not be brought into the room for your comfort however a mini bar was located in the room with drinks and nuts for purchase , The staff was extremely friendly and helpful We enjoyed the accommodations The reason I didn t recommend this room for families is that the second bed couch was located on the first floor with the exterior door and the bedroom is upstairs Great location 
212375,H tel Du Jeu De Paume,No Negative, The interior of this hotel is I would say unique The building is lovely and they have done an amazing job of redeveloping it into a stylish and extremely comfortable hotel Our room was lovely as well as quiet The Hotel is in a fabulous location The street is vibrant during the day and quieter at night The Ile Saint Louis generally is the perfect place to stay to explore the centre of Paris There are plenty of places to eat nearby and it is a 3 minute walk to Notre Dame and the Siene Highly recommend in every way We also fell in love with the Hotel dog even though we only saw it once all too briefly 
212376,H tel Du Jeu De Paume,No Negative, The bed was very comfortable The room was a nice size tastefully decorated in a modern french country design Amazing support beams artfully refinished throughout the whole structure Is both comfortable and artsy The staff are exceedingly helpful and friendly they take the time out for you to make reservations help you find facilities and anything else your heart desires The location is amazing You just walk out the door and there are amazing restaurants wonderful boutiques small grocery fresh fruit markets pharmacy and anything else that you might want An 8 minute walk to the front of Notre Dame Cathedral Staying on Ile St Louis was very pleasant experience and this hotel is outstanding I will stay at this hotel my next trip to Paris 
212377,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Being upgraded from Duplex suite in hotel beautiful to an apartment not whats advertised Felt like a bait and switch to me , Location was awesome Easy distance to Notre Dame and many bars restaurants 
212378,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, The room smelled from mould Strange fee for about 9 Euros if you opened a bottle of vine in your room , The champagne from the bar was exquisite The hotel was beautiful with a perfect location 
212379,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, No such thing , Such warm welcoming and helpful staff Genuinely helpful Very cute hotel on the dream location that you almost don t need to leave and still experience the charm of Paris The room was not on the bigger side nothing unusual for the European hotels but it was well designed so nothing was lacking 
212380,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Room typically quite small Could hear neighbors occasionally , Superb location on the island can go south to blvd St Michel west to Notre Dame and north to rue de Rivoli Very quiet room Lovely conversion of old timbered building with modern internal structures 
212381,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Breakfast seems to be a bit expensive for what it serves , All the staff members were very kind and friendly room was very clean and all the tourist sites were within walking distance 
212382,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, A suite with three beds should really have three places to sleep instead of one double bed and a small couch with a pillow The part downstairs did not have a single chair or a piece of furniture Come to think of it the couch is downstairs but the television is upstairs , The location of the hotel is amongst the best in the world Period As one who is in the know of the appartment prices in the same street as the hotel the room prices are actually not that much higher than regular rent of a place of similar size The room size is also quite decent albeit inefficiently used 
212383,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Wish the twin room beds were farther apart but not possible because of the fixed wall shelf A small detail that wouldn t deter me from staying here again , Perfect location helpful staff clean room lovely common areas easy access via public transportation 
212384,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, The price of breakfast was too expensive for what it was , The location and customer service was excellent Everything was within walking distance The staff made fabulous restaurant recommendations and assisted with directions and taxi reservations 
212385,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, The breakfast at 18 euros was a bit expensive try the Cafe St Regis instead for fresh eggs and real atmosphere , Location is great Ile St Louis is a great base and this hotel is set back from the roads so super quiet Rooms a bit larger than average and atrium lobby and breakfast bar area is very nice 
212386,H tel Du Jeu De Paume,No Negative, Front desk staff was VERY helpful Made dinner reservations for us gave directions and instructions on how to take RER to CDG Wonderful old building updated and decorated with an artist s eye 
212387,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Breakfast was OK great fresh buns and Croissant but pure verity of cheese, Location Location Location Beautiful interior design the room was nice comfortable in a good size Very Good Wi Fi
212388,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Walls between rooms were thin was woken on the second night at 2am by people talking in their room next door One bedside lamp fitting in the room didn t work Shower was weak pressure and small I m 6 foot and couldn t fit underneath the shower head which is fixed in place , Room was good size staff were very friendly good location 
212389,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, The room described by Booking com as s Superior Double didn t meet my expectations I wouldn t want to stay in a normal double It was exceptionally cramped with poor quality fittings in the bedroom The hotel website makes no mention of such a room and in fact the room we had looks most like what it describes as a single room albeit with a double bed I feel a bit let down , Location can t be bettered Ideal for walking and situated in a street with restaurants and even some proper shops 
212390,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Our room didn t have enough light for reading in bed , It s hard to believe such a central Paris location could be so peaceful Helpful staff Easy to reach from the metro 
212391,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Breakfast could have been better but with so many good crepe shops and cafes nearby it wasn t any problem , The location of this hotel on Ile St Louis is ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS Easy walk to Notre Dame St Chappelle nearby museums and great eateries General Manager Natalie and her staff were very friendly and helpful And you re just a few steps from the best ice cream and gelato in all of Paris Amarino Bertillion Although the rooms are somewhat small the hotel has a wonderful lobby relaxing area downstairs While we were in Paris there were lots of concerts special events going on around the area but our hotel on Ile St Louis remained nice quiet 
212392,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Phone coverage wasn t good calls were breaking up Wifi not good , Great welcome Good and quiet room Nice toilletries All what was needed Nice breakfast Very good service 
212393,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, The rooms are compact and hotel lacks some important extras view gym fast internet etc that might warrant the price tag Some of the staff were very warm and friendly others less so , It s a very tasteful and interesting restoration of a building with a unique history It is also beautifully located close to everything in a calm and graceful area 
212394,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Nothing , Just wonderful The history of the place the staff couldn t do enough for you The location was prime The breakfast was lovely croissants just to die for 
212395,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Can t really think of anything at all , Wonderfully welcoming pleasant front desk staff Location right in the heart of Paris on Ile St Louis really couldn t not be beat Given the location the price was understandable and the quality of the accommodations bed comfort room bathroom etc was really quite high 
212396,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Small rooms and expensive , The situation was fantastic and we could walk everywhere The staff were very helpful and friendly The location was peaceful and quiet although so close to everything 
212397,H tel Du Jeu De Paume,No Negative, This hotel is extraordinary with the best localization one can have in Paris It is decorated with very well taste and it is very comfortable I will come back 
212398,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, The European pillows were a bit firm If you need a softer pillow ask the staff , The staff are what make this hotel extra special Location is fantastic A little Paris in Paris Lots of lovely restaurants and cafes and shops all around you Close to metro transport All the facilities you need in a hotel are available I ll be back 
212399,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Wish I could have stayed longer , Off the busy street of shops and ice cream parlors on the I lle Saint Louis we walked through the big doors into a tranquil courtyard with the fragrance of star jasmine The staff was lovely There is a living room lounge and bar Great artwork and a tasteful renovation to a very old charming building Big glass elevator Easy card access to room Quiet beautiful room with old beamed ceiling and all else newly appointed 
212400,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, We were in twin beds and they were touching each other so very close This can t be helped in Paris however as the hotel rooms are typically very small , Beds were comfortable Staff was super friendly and helpful 
212401,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, While the room size was small the public areas made up for this Staff very friendly , The ambiance stylish yet inviting The different public areas in which to relax were especially nice tastefully done very comfortable atmosphere 
212402,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Breakfast wasn t included which was unfortunate But a decent bakery was right down the street as well as a few cafes , The hotel is located on the quiet end of the street but only a 2 minute walk to cafes and brasseries facing Notre Dame Rooms were super quiet very comfortable and spacious Full size bathtub was great at the end of a long day of walking The staff were very friendly and helpful Will stay here again 
212403,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Nice bathroom but we had some issues with water escaping from the shower area and wetting the floor Enlarging the glass panels might help , Friendly staff Beautifully done interiors mixing the historic with the modern Clean room comfortable and quiet 
212404,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, The breakfast was either a full one or nothing There was no in between cup of coffee and croissant , Charming hotel centrally located Helpful staff and lovely rooms 
212405,H tel Du Jeu De Paume,No Negative, The staff was fantastic They were very kind and helpful and were quite gracious They were knowledgeable about local restaurants and activities such as concerts at Saint Chapelle The hotel was very quiet unique and clean The breakfast and coffee were delicious The location of the hotel was excellent It was easy to access from the airport CDG within walking distance to all the major museums and very safe 
212406,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Rooms and bathroom a bit small , Perfect location on the Ille with access to all parts of Paris Super friendly and efficient staff and management Rustic French charm and atmosphere Lemon the dog adds the the authenticity Room with window out onto quiet forecourt Separate toilet 
212407,H tel Du Jeu De Paume,No Negative, The front desk staff were terrific helpful and always friendly and patient The atmosphere of the hotel is a warm and welcoming one We would definitely stay there again and will recommend it to our friends traveling to Paris 
212408,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Too many tourists includes us Location location location separate toilet does not have a wash basin have to walk around to bathroom pillows are square and a little overfull for my old neck synthetic doona but no sheet which we prefer full length hanging space beside bed a little oppressive bedside tables a little cramped due to that , good continental breakfast buffet style close to left bank for cheap breakfast out less traffic noise than anywhere else we have stayed in Paris good location for central attractions great walking starting point lovely old building with tasteful renovation to convert tennis court to hotel retaining much of the charm common areas comfortable and open wifi works friendly welcoming helpful and warm staff not stuffy or reserved Happy to use english when they saw us struggle in french helped correct my abysmal pronunciation and improved my vocab towels were good temperature regulation good room deliberately dark furniture to show off old beams to their best we had room 002 with windows opening onto the courtyard originally court they use in fine weather for breakfast Also adjacent to common areas but not noisy while we were there we are early sleepers and risers so walking the Ile was tourist free early adequate numbers of power points to recharge all our devices Samsung LED tv has hdmi access in desktop for playback of movies on your device also good sattelite choice we prefer french stations did not look for CNN or BBC world we booked on a whim and were pleased with room facilities and ambience would happily go there again 
212409,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Look it s an amazing old historic building But why oh why must the teensy toilet room and tiny shower room be separate The light switches were falling off and it seems ridiculous that you are required to use your one room key to power the electricity in the room So one of two occupants can never be in the room alone , Great sitting areas AMAZING location Location can t be beat 
212410,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, The 18 euro breakfast was steep for what you got and if you added eggs you added another 8 euros to it , The location was great Lots of good eating places to choose from In a very quaint area 
212411,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Extra cost for breakfast a bit high but delicious , Friendly helpful staff Characterful charming and comfortable hotel in a wonderful location Plenty of excellent restaurants within 5 minutes walk 
212412,H tel Du Jeu De Paume,No Negative, The staff were outstanding They made our family feel completely welcome They made excellent recommendations for neighborhood restaurants cafes and shops The design of the hotel within the landmark building is unique and shows tasteful renovation carefully integrated with the modern necessities that maintain the historic atmosphere We wish the weather had been warmer so we could use the garden spaces The lobby was a cozy place to relax and have a cognac by the fire after a cold March evening in Paris Because of the location we walked to almost every location we visited We intend to stay here every time we visit Paris 
212413,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, No views from bedrooms but the quietness at night time and the central location more than made up for this , Very comfortable bed and bedrooms of a good size for central Paris Superb location central easy to walk everywhere close to metro but lovely and quiet at night time Lots of cafes and restaurants in the immediate neighbourhood Very friendly staff 
212414,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, showers were not enclosed so we had baths instead to avoid flooding floor The small Kitchen was not well enough equipped to cook for 6 only 2 x hotplates plus microwave no oven and very little prep space It would be fine if you are intending to eat out all the time The television only had bbcworld English speaking and CNN Worse thing of all was the extreme levels of noise from outside at night The apartment is situated in an excellent central and charming area of Paris but it is opposite a very popular restaurant which is open every night People congregate noisily outside well into the early hours and have no concept that other residents exist or are trying to sleep Lots of shouting and loud laughter for hours The apartment has wonderful high windows looking onto the street but the glass and shutters don t provide any protection from the noise Quality earplugs are a must Saying this please remember that the apartment is situated infront of the hotel If you are booking a room in the hotel you should be ok because it is set right back away from the street and looks a really nice place to stay A classy mix of old and new , Beautiful characterful and cosy apartment exposed beams stone walls and mezzanine floor 3 x good sized bedrooms and 2 bathrooms with baths Lovely lovely sitting room area but small kitchen Staff helpful and very kind to allow storage of luggage after checkout Situated in lovely area of paris v close to Notre dame the latin quarter and metro Street is full of little boutiques and bakers very close with a small grocers shop for basic provisions just down the way 
212415,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, The shower wets the bathroom floor A minor inconvenience that surprisingly you still find in many european hotels , Location could not be better Beautiful hotel nice and comfy room 
212416,H tel Du Jeu De Paume,No Negative, Very friendly and helpful staff Great location Very comfortable and relaxing stay Room was was a little small but not unusual for this type of hotel in the centre of Paris Would definitely stay again when next in Paris 
212417,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Room was very small , location was perfect steps from Notre Dame and short walk over the bridge to heart of Paris Walking distance to Louvre Great restaurants steps away Quaint set up
212418,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Sound proofing with the adjacent room wasn t perfect but also not a big deal , The front desk staff made us feel at home in Paris very friendly and helpful when we found out that our outgoing flight to Poland was at a different airport 1 5 hours away Location was near everything Louvre etc but also super quiet Perfect for a good night s sleep after a redeye 
212419,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, Staff at front desk was mostly but not always helpful in making arrangements Breakfast was overpriced, Beautiful facility totally charming and a great location
212420,H tel Du Jeu De Paume, One of the reason I chose this hotel was to use the jacuzzi I actually called few days before to book the time and I was told it would be ok because it was quiet However when I arrived it was broken down and I was not made aware of it We asked to use the hamam instead but when we went it was turned on at only 26 C instead of 40 so we had to leave before it reached the right temperature It is a shame considering we wanted to relax before jumping on a plane the next day The hotel could be easily regain its luxury status if management invest in updating some of the furniture in the rooms which have clearly aged It remains nevertheless a charming place , The location is unique very close to Notre Dame The building history and the open space are impressive The hotel is hidden at the rear of a street building and it is very calm It was a nice place to finish our European holidays
