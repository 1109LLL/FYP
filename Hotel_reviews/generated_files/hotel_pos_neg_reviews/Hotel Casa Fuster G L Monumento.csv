399509,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Pool was VERY small and in the middle of the bar area so not so good for kids who like to splash Bathroom very nice but to get into the shower was a big step over the large tub which when getting out of the shower was slippery and dangerous , Rooms were very comfortable and luxurious Staff was very friendly and helpful for planning things to see We rented a car through the hotel which was very easy they brought the car to the hotel and handled the reservation 
399510,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento,No Negative, Phenomenal ambience Wonderful vistas of Barcelona Staff were always attentive They were particularly helpful in helping me communicate with the car rental when it didn t work properly The breakfast buffet was without compare The dinner at the Galaxo was mouth watering in its presentation and taste was superb 
399511,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, , The building is a landmark and beautiful the location is very good on a quiet street but close to restaurants and luxury shops The staff was very nice and helpful The room was very comfortable It is a wonderful place to stay while enjoying Barcelona I would definitely stay here again
399512,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Hotel defintely needs complete renovation inside 2nd floor wi fi in the room was almost dead rooftop bar service is disgusting Had to leave hotel one day earlier leaving my girlfriend for full stay promised to get my final bill via e mail but didn t receive anything Guess I am done with this hotel , Same old good hotel
399513,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The showers All three rooms we occupied had problems with the showers , Hotel is beautiful To stay in Barcelona at a Modernist building by the genius Catalan architect Domenech is a luxury It s like living during that era Highly recommend

399515,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The fitness centre was very basic and one treadmill was not working , There is a pillow menu breakfast is excellent door staff are fantastic and provide a warm welcome when returning after a day out 
399516,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Rooftop pool is tiny and in the middle of the rooftop bar It is probably oversold , Breakfast was fantastic Included Cava Staff were wonderful helpful and polite Atmosphere was relaxing 
399517,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Everything was great, Very comfortable and quiet Wonderful service the staff was so helpful Location is the best Rooftop bar is lovely I was on my own two days in Barcelona and the concierge made great recommendations and reservations for a seat at the bar at two great restaurants 
399518,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, 1 The shower in the bathroom was not convenient the water was dropping to the bathroom s floor 2 Breakfast was fair but I would have expected more from a 5 stars hotel I did not actually cost at all those 29 euro they were charging for it, 1 Fair price comparable to some 4 stars in the area 2 Great terrace at the roof 3 Beautiful building 4 Location
399519,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Somewhat rigid in their payments policy deducted an advance payment when specifically requested not to do so In the hospitality world try please clients don t annoy them unnecessarily Hotel lacks friendliness as well as a welcoming energy, Good location Comfortable room Reasonable English language TV
399520,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Indolent staff Incompetents who promised to make arrangements and never called back Spanish workers are not energetic and do not care If you see a good waiter they are from somewhere else , Great Location Good restaurants nearby Convenient to everything 
399521,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The service was generally average Staff disengaged waiting times for standing check in were average breakfast in the basement was uncomfortable , The room and view were impressive and the modernist style was cool and funky
399522,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Staff at front desk was unhelpful Not rude or incapable just did not follow through on getting information and not very useful Doormen excellent , Hotel in good location and was nicely appointed
399523,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Rooms are a bit dark and too much furniture, The hotel is nice and service is good But the shower was not working when we arrived so we had to wait for it to be fixed It should have been checked before we arrived
399524,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, As the hotel situated close to a main road I was bothered by the outside noise, A beautiful monomental building in the most prestigiuos erea The service was impeccable
399525,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Very expensive drinks eg June 2017 a pint of lager is about 13 15 Nice to have a rooftop terrace in a city hotel but swimming pool is very small so is more a paddling pool, Excellent friendly helpful staff at the luxury end of the city Impressive traditional hotel Comfy beds and pillows Beautiful downstairs bar
399526,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, There was no place for smokers We had to go outside the hotel or on the roof terrace But at the restaurants no exits for smokers , Bed was huge all was perfectly clean and very silent everywhere Had a very good sleep The roof bar is very nice and the view is amazing although the staff is a bit unexperienced and goofy But the staff that carries the luggage and waits at the door are very very nice and attentive The are very professional and really helpful 
399527,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The restaurant in the evening left a lot to be desired cold plates cold food menu not fully explained and I did tell the hotel my opinion Lunch was good breakfast adequate again cold plates , The ambience history and the great service and attitude of the staff
399528,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Doormen were friendly and courteous the man who initially checked us in at reception was not However as we didn t deal with him again it didn t bother us other than those initial few minutes but not a good first impression Hotel didn t bother to respond either way to a request for an earlier check in it was clearly unavailable when we arrived which is fine but this would have been good to know in advance with a young child , Stayed in a beautiful junior suite two adults one child Cleaning was thorough and great location 
399529,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The price of drinks at the rooftop bar The adjustabiility of the water temperature in the shower mentioned this to the desk when we checked out and they said they d look into it in our room immediately so good response to a minor cavil , The staff were each and every one pleasant helpful and accommodating 
399530,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento,No Negative, Area excellent staff couldnt do enough to help breakfast excellent nothing to fault with the Casa Fuster if returning to Barcelona this hotel is a must 
399531,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The shower is so dated It was difficult getting in and the head wasn t controllable Front door was broke and had to stand outside briefly I think the property needs an update ,No Positive
399532,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Personal at front desk was rude and slow at check in check out process The house itself was a key factor when choosing our hotel Unfortunately when we arrive the outside part was under renovations and thus all covered Since this type of maintenance is scheduled in advance I think the hotel should have warned clients with reservations on that period Also noise from the construction was very annoying at times , Room decoration comfort the architecture of the place Has everything you expect in a hotel of this category expect the personal We had a very pleasant stay 
399533,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Can not think of anything, Location was excellent It was a special day in Barcelona April 24 is St Jordin day so there were LOTS of people which made it interesting Open air markets were fun Trip to Montserrat and wine tours i highly recommend
399534,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Outside of building was undergoing a renovation so scaffolding blocked our view Pool didn t look inviting , Staff was very help full in all respects Room service and housekeeping were very responsive Location was fantastic Within walking distance of several very nice restraunts Breakfast buffet was very good 
399535,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The facade of the building was completely covered which meant no view at all One of the important reason I chose the hotel was for its architectural style It was mentioned that there were repairs going on but I had no idea it would be encased , The suite was beautifully decorated the bar was stylish and the rooftop deck was spectacular 
399536,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento,No Negative, The staff and management were wonderfully attentive and helpful as well as charming and cheerful every moment Truly unimpeachable service Many thanks 
399537,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Work on the facade scaffolding all over workers suddenly passing by breakfast is good but was better last time receptionist at departure , Nice hotel excellent location good cleaning mostly friendly staff quite good breakfast
399538,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Hotel was undergoing a major renovation works Fortunately we are early risers and we re not effected by the noise If you like to sleep in or wake up late you might need to consider other places , Wonderful and funny staff Breakfast room was beautiful and the food options were excellent 
399539,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Parking around there was expensive, The choice for breakfast was great Included lots of vegetables and even churro and chocolate yum Also loved the chef cooking eggs right there for us was great Very attentive staff and wonderful rooms Nice big bathroom with spa and you may even get a lovely surprise with a sauna as a bonus 
399540,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, See above I also suggested the magnifying bathroom mirror magnify a bit more for aging populations , There was one glaring negative The historic building was being cleaned and was covered This meant the curtains were not drawn and the room was somewhat tomb like without light However when I did complain they opened the windows and drew the curtains when they could 
399541,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The hotel was specifically chosen as its the most architecturall hotel in Barcelona when we arrived the building was covered completely in scaffolding you couldn t open your curtains in your bedroom as builders were working on the scaffolding so it was like living in a dungeon This work was ongoing and obviously had been planned for some time There is no excuse as to why they could not inform guests before hand and give people a choice if they wished to stay in a building site or not ,No Positive
399542,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The building was being renovated during our stay construction everywhere they should have informed us , Amazing location excellent staff and very good service 
399543,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The hotel was under construction and we didn t know that However we got a compensation from the hotel free breakfast That was lovely , The hotel was super clean The staff was amazing So friendly and kind The overall experience was amazing 
399544,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Hotel is quite dark and room is so dark it is difficult to find anything Not helped by scaffolding outside whilst exterior is being renovated , Very nice bathroom with excellent spa bath No hooks and doors do not close properly Quiet location in back of hotel 
399545,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The level of door bell at the room It s too high When housekeeping calls my heart was bouncing with fear Same way when they were calling to neighbouring room it was heard in my room The habit of afternoon cleaning I find very annoing I would have substituted it with a light signal at the door green or red So that cleaning knows if they can should enter or not ,No Positive
399546,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Nothing, The location of this property is excellent The staff and hotel itself were superb and they couldn t have been more helpful if they had tried The made us feel at home 
399547,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The bath could have been bigger and getting in and out of the shower was a bit awkward We were not told there was major scaffolding work outside on the building The bed was pulled together by two smaller beds with an awkward line in the middle so difficult to be in the middle , The Chopard toiletries were a nice touch Sheets were soft Well presented room Location was very good and close to the metro 
399548,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The Casa Fuster has 5 Stars May be long long time ago it was justified But from our experienced Hotel Know How all around the world it s far away from 5 Stars The rooms are very noisy You can hear the guests above your room as they would be in yours You can hear the neighbours snoring The housekeeping ladies did a good cleaning job but they re working and talking so noisy that you ll awake between 8 00 9 00 They did not fill up the minibar for 4 days To enter the shower for Senoir guest is terrible To high and to small door Around 40 50 cm I ll attach a picture The swimming pool is roughly 2 x 3 meters The prices in the Bar is far to expensive in compare to other 5 Stars Hotels 8 00 for Cappuccino and small Beer even more The waiters there are cold and distanced not to say bored This is not what the guests feeling comfortable Sorry but we really can t recommend this hotel , The location is perfect
399549,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento,No Negative, The staff here rush to meet your every need and are so warm and friendly Lots of toiletries even razors and tooth brushes very comfortable bed and pillows Large bathroom Beautiful hotel best I ve ever been to 
399550,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, I m happy to tip but bell staff push for tips A bit unwarranted Concierge only reccomended places that they got kickbacks from Resturants w 150 200 seats dreadful Or bus tours only no doing it on your own god forbid you rent a car We stayed there 3 times over 3 weeks quite nice On the 3rd trip we needed a power converter the concierge said they didn t provide them I indicated that that was odd as the last two times they were in our room when we arrived 20 seconds later he found one under the front desk Odd , Public spaces are good Rooftop is lovely 
399551,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, We came back from a rainy day trip in the Hotel A female staff member curly hair told us on Friday evening 16 12 2016 around 7 30 pm that the restaurant kitchen was only open until 8 00 pm and that we could not have a reservation at that moment or some later Later she told the restaurant was fully booked I really doubt about this as the opening times were mentioned differently She proposed to take a reservation for diner in a nearby restaurant La Farga in the Diagonal street She remarked that it was known as the best fish restaurant in Barcelona It seemed to be a bakery and restaurant combination Our diner experience was not at all aligned with what the hotel staff told us We were very disappointed about her advice According to me it was not a professional approach for a 5 hotel , Nice room as requested and available facilities Good bed Facilities for tourists are superb in Barcelona city We enjoyed the Barcelona city bus for 2 days red blue tour VERY good to discover the wonderful city Also the Metro is tourist friendly 
399552,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The lighting system in the room was designed by a psychopath There are about 10 light switches which pretty randomly operate different lights We had to ask the hotel staff to help us turn some lights off they sent a technician it took the guy about 10 minutes to figure it out Breakfast is nice but extremely over priced Can be noisy even with all windows shut Location is not too close to the main attractions but still not bad, Room is very large and comfy Bed is great Hotel staff very nice and helpful Service is great room kept clean at all times Location is nice not as classic as say the Gothic quarter but still nice Nice view from room
399553,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento,No Negative, I travelled with my girlfriend and we really enjoyed the room size bed and the friendly staff Location was also perfect and well connected to the metro lines and major touristic spots will come again 
399554,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Only suggestion is that better reading lights be installed the rooms are quite dark but everything else was fabulous , Location is fantastic and the service is just incredible the concierge front desk bell men all wonderfully helpful friendly courteous Great rooftop bar restaurant with great food and a fantastic view Rooms quite large by European standards nicely furnished big fluffy bath towels 
399555,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The hotel itself is tired and could some renovation and interior redesign For example the runner on the stairs was soiled and the lighting is quite poor in general the hotel looks dated , The staff at this hotel is superb 
399556,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Room size was small No pool is a big draw back for families with kids , Location is excellent its like staying on oxford street in London Rooms are pretty 
399557,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Lift is not installed with security system Not flexible with early arrival and checkin, Staff always greeting u with smile Great view at rooftop which is very accessible
399558,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Nothing, Sumptuous birthday treat Beautiful room upgrade with cava and cake on arriva Roof terrace amazing and location excellent Staff super especially the door men Jazz night brilliant with special personalised birthday song Will never forget it thank you casa fuster 
399559,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Nothing , From the moment we arrived at the hotel until the moment we left a week later we just loved it It is the most beautiful building in a prime location and the interior is stunning Our room was beautifully comfortable and all the staff from the staff who serviced the room to the reception staff and PR staff were exceptional We would particularly commend Alexandria and Luria for ensuring that we went to the best places to eat We met the Deputy General Manager who was utterly charming and helpful ensuring that we could check out in the afternoon and take a shower since our flight was not until the evening All in all we shall definitely return and do not say that about many places It was a treat 
399560,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Services are far behind Not really a 5 star hotel The room is really tiny The design of the bathroom is not reasonable I got hurt every single time I got into the bath There was a night I just back to hotel Then I found out the mirror in the bathroom fall down And they just left it like that All my stuffs were messed up Ridiculous situation I ever met , Nice location 
399561,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, it was a bit expensive and my sister s air conditioner hummed which they fixed , The staff was incredibly friendly Every day on our return we were welcomed back as if it were our home they even remembered that it was my mother s 70th birthday and surprised her with cake and cava the rooms were large for european hotels and the location was very convenient 
399562,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Not really that negative but breakfast staff slightly over efficient at clearing table while still eating, Large bright and comfortable room Good fresh choice at breakfast Small rooftop pool great for cool down after sightseeing on lovely terrace 
399563,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, A longer stay would have been better Had to catch an early flight , l loved the hotel design location efficiency first class staff and friendly services The rooftop terrace was amazing The room had city view was clean and hallway had a nice smell Overall it eclipsed my expectations Would revisit and highly recommend 
399564,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The lift area on level 2 smells Also I could smell cigarette smoke in the bathroom I think the smell came through the ventilation The door is not very sound proof luckily we have another door to our bedroom so that kept the room quieter , Hotel is centrally located Close to all main attraction Casa Mila and Casa Batllo are both within walking distance I like how the hotel uses Gaudi s chair in the lobby and Gaudi s door knots in the rooms The staff are all very welcoming and friendly They gave me great dinner recommendations too The room is spacious 
399565,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento,No Negative, It s a beautiful place to stay in Barcelona a rare case when reality exceeds expectations created by online images The hotel is in a great location close to all the popular Gaudi s masterpieces and 15 min away from express train to the airport The room was clean and tastefully decorated A coffee table was a bit worn out but the rest of the furniture seemed flawless The menu of pillows is an interesting perk There were a bottle of water coffee and tea sets in the room Gym was good sauna was awesome Check out the rooftop which provides magnificent panoramic views The local restaurant on the 2nd level pleased with impecable service and delicious meals 
399566,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, the bathtub is very high you need to be a young gymnast to be able to get in and out , amazing hotel great location the best roof top balcony in Barcelona nice staff very luxurious experience nothing but a positive experience 
399567,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Think the room was a little small and we had difficulty with the bathroom door i e it was impossible to close or even to move the thing at all I also think that in spite of its strengths it is overpriced I don t think that the standard room that we stayed in warrants what they are charging per night Not great value for money in comparison to similar priced hotels elsewhere , Position was perfect Very clean and staff very helpful friendly Breakfast and food in general was excellent as was the service 
399568,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Drainy smell in bathroom at times was really strong The bar downstairs is beautiful but always really quiet Very expensive drinks , Excellent location helpful staff nice room very well kept Nice roof terrace bar with great views 
399569,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, During my entire stay the room was not cleaned Every day I had to talk to the reception to deal with this problem I stayed in this hotel for the last 3 years more than 20 times This happens for the first time Perhaps the hotel has a new management or because is August ,No Positive
399570,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Breakfast they had just one person who didnt know how to cook omelets and gave them burned everytime Breakfast location dark no windows Restaurant also not inviting and not child friendly You expect more for the price being one of the most expensive hotels in barcelona Small pool, Location Clean Good staff Two elevator Rooms spacious 
399571,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Noisy all night the staff were told that we would not like a noisy room but they still gave us one on the first floor above the street you can hear everything on the street , Comfortable beds very nice junior suite
399572,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento,No Negative, The staff was very helpful in suggesting some places for drinks tapas etc We were only there for one night which was a Sunday so there was less going on than a typical night but they took this into account when suggesting where we should go Overall very helpful and courteous 
399573,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Just a recommendation for a restaurant that I felt was a bit pushy and did not meet my needs , Great location beautiful building wonderful staff great rooms What to ask more 
399574,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Some of the information regarding traveling through out the country was confusing but we figured it out, This hotel was great location perfect to access all areas of the city by foot or taxi Staff was amazing and very helpful room was large and very clean We loved Barcelona and our stay
399575,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The pool is tiny not really meant for swimming , The bed was enormous and so comfortable The location of the hotel is fantastic with stunning views The staff were brilliant 
399576,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, We have nothing negative to say about this beautiful hotel and the polite and very friendly staff , A surprise birthday trip was made all the more special by a superb room upgrade upon arrival a bottle of bubbly and a beautifully presented birthday cake Facilities The huge bed was extremely comfy the room was very clean and spacious a decent size spa bath great view from our balcony breakfast plentiful with lots of choice in room dining room service was freshly prepared and delivered in 20 minutes as promised Benefitting from ideal location superb roof terrace romantic lounge bar Overall an amazing break A huge thank you to Nuria and all the staff

399578,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The staff That is the most important thing in a hotel or at least in a luxury hotel I m still waiting for something I asked them They said they will call me back and I m still waiting, The location is very good
399579,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento,No Negative, Loved the roof and the staff The beautiful attention to detail in the architecture The breakfast out of this world Location was the center of Barcelona and little things like an ironing board or an adapter were delivered in minutes The doormen were exceptional with great walking directions The details of the linens in the rooms and the fluffy beds always being made up or made down Definitely would always stay with Casa Fuster 
399580,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Stayed at the suite for 4 nights after 2 nights shower broke down wasn t repaired in till end of my stay I had to shower in the sauna and couldn t go in my room for a full day because of repairmen trying to fix it unsuccessfully The compensation offered certainly didn t compare to the impact on an otherwise perfect vacation , Very friendly and helpful staff
399581,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The breakfast area It gave the impression of being a temporary space and completely lacked atmosphere , Great location close to all retail stores and great restaurants Staff great in all departments a big shout out to the consierge service they were outstanding 
399582,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Breakfast was expensive 25 euros each The pool was more like a pond very small, The Hotel was lovely luxurious and the staff warm and welcoming The door staff were exceptionally helpful and we ate at some lovely restaurants recommended by them
399583,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, As we were traveling with our baby we should have had a larger room We could barely move with the cradle in the room and had to move it everytime we needed to go to the bathroom We ordered a baby soup but it was not ready on time and only had 2 of the 5 ingredients I asked It seemed a good hotel good for who s travelling for business purposes rather than family vacations , Wi Fi was excellent 
399584,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Nothing , I just loved this hotel So much more character than an international chain and right in the center of town The staff couldn t have been more charming 
399585,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento,No Negative, Service was extremely good as was the breakfast Location midpoint between Las Ramblas Sagrada Familia and Parc Guell and very close to Casa Batllo was superb 
399586,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The night we arrived the bar was taken over by a jazz night and there was nowhere to sit and have a quiet drink or cup of tea Felt that the hotel really needed a space for guests to chill , The staff were great and their eating suggestions fabulous
399587,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The bar area is unavailable on Thursday evenings due to a regular jazz club event This means that hotel residents do not have anywhere to order drinks and relax , Very friendly and helpful staff Clean and comfortable rooms 
399588,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The drab lighting hall ways are dark the breakfast place looks like a bombed out building basement it make me angry to see such a beautiful stucture not at least with good lighting glaring lights came from the floor in the breakfast room or no light in other places some CEO should be fired , The owners should spend money on lighting painting decorating it isn t fair to the fine staff that work there 
399589,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, I was shocked not to have tea and coffee making facilities in a 5 star hotel The rooms were extremely dark with very poor lighting Power points were on the floor very strangely placed , the staff were very helpful and polite The location of the Hotel was excellent 
399590,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento,No Negative, Loved how the door staff was so helpful especially the young man Antonio absolutely brilliant kept my 3 year old occupied whilst we checked it Without a doubt 5 star for an amazing stay of 4 nights well recommended

399594,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Our initial contact at the reception of the hotel left much to be desired , We would like to make special mention of Joseba the extremely professional friendly cheerful helpful and knowledgeable porter who escorted us to our rooms An exceptional member of staff

399597,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The concierge desk wasn t too helpful We asked for a restaurant recommendation which we got but the restaurant was mediocre expensive and far away It was hard to figure out why anyone would recommend it although the restaurant appeared to be entirely occupied by tourists from other hotels , Lovely comfortable expansive breakfast 
399598,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Rooms like coffins Looks like the 80s Dated needs big overhaul to charge these prices Room electricals and plumbing dogey because need updateing Very poor breakfast in a basement Have had better choice and presentation in country Australia At 475aud a night very poor Should have look at what the Shangril La for one do as a matter of course in all their establishments Extreamly disappointed at the price Had just stayed at the Alfonso in Seville and felt you certainly got what you had paid for there Overall the hotell is extreamly overpriced Basically just felt ripped off Oh Well live andlearn But will warn friends Your rating is far too high at value for money Will certainly warn friends to avoid far better to be had if you are going to pay these prices , Beautiful building Location Metro outside
399599,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento,No Negative, Fantastic location easy access to everything walking distance to Sagrada Familia Casa Batllo and Casa Pedera easy access to metros shops etc exquisite classic modernista hotel wonderful staff very helpful very comfortable 
399600,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Needed a little help with some restaurant reservations but got answer that everything is booked Later on I managed to get a reservation by myself So concierge service should be improved , It s everything you would expect from a hotel of this type and reputation 
399601,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The room was good but not well maintained some lights were not working and something was always missing in the bathroom and the room , The staff was very friendly and super helpful
399602,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Their service their uselessness , Nothing their reservation office completely misled me and started to add several things to my booking upon my arrival Be careful with this hotel it does not seem how they want it to be and is not a grand luxe hotel 
399603,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, Gym equipment poor Elevator interior design was very poor as well and gave me the impression to be an office building rather than a 5 star boutique hotel , Stunning bathrooms and very cosy rooms Scent in hallways was very nice 
399604,Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento, The swimming pool should not be called as such It s not even 7x4 yards It is simply a place to dip your toes and cool off no swimming possible The gym is rather rudimentary as well , Very helpful and friendly staff We were there for my fianc e s birthday and the hotel provided a surprise chocolate cake and a very good bottle of aged cava This is representative of our whole stay and experience
