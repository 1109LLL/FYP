85479,Hilton London Bankside, There was little I didn t like One thing was that one of the bath robes had a dirty sleeve and there was a small amount dust on the surface of the glass box in the room Also there was a mark on the bathroom floor which looked like dirt at the first glance , The staff were all very friendly and helpful The room was very comfortable and the shower was powerful and hot I liked the selection on the TV and the fact that the bathroom had a speaker so you could hear the TV clearly Plus the breakfast was lovely with the chefs cooking what you want and the waitresses getting drinks if you didn t get them yourself

85486,Hilton London Bankside, Room didn t have drinking water bottles tissue boxes etc The shower drainage was not proper and water was leaking in to the bathroom floor There was no remote to adjust room temperature only the wall mounted control Title of breakfast said fabulous breakfast however there was hardly a few dishes Overall it was not a 5 star setting it was more like a 3 star hotel, Staff was friendly and helpfull 
85487,Hilton London Bankside, Executive club food was awful all dried up Cold breakfast food at 7am Only Prosecco no Champagne or sparkling wine Very poor selection of alcoholic drinks felt like an airport lounge rather than an executive club , Very comfortable hotel spacious with comfy beds nice toiletries good night s sleep Quiet Excellent location plenty of lovely walks Tate Gallery Thames The Shard all close by Staff were so helpful very attentive and professional 
85488,Hilton London Bankside, Checked in at the hotel and they hit me with a 50 per night deposit Did not state this anywhere on your website and only realised I had to pay this when I checked in, Bed was comfy

85496,Hilton London Bankside, After visiting some high end bars in London I felt the drinks at the bar of Hilton Bankside were extremely over priced 28 for two gin tonics I expect to pay city prices but this was excessive Didn t take away from the amazing stay though ,No Positive
85497,Hilton London Bankside, Wrongly advertised on Booking com as having parking no on site parking available was offered a car park 7min drive away grom hotel or 40 a day valet parking Managers did not deal with the issue effectively , Newly refurbished clean tidy hotel 
85498,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Excellent staff rooms and breakfast Very good location close to the river where we went for walks Easy to get to the subway I would definitely stay here next time I am in London 
85499,Hilton London Bankside, Room view, Treated wife to a weekend in London and a meal at the Shard Location great close to tube and attractions Hotel and staff good room lovely but view was a brick wall Slightly disappointed as it was my wife s birthday treat Breakfast made up for it and we were very spoilt 
85500,Hilton London Bankside, No complaints just another quality stay with Hilton did not disappoint , Well presented hotel professional and welcoming staff closely located to Tower Bridge and Borough Markets Room service was delicious Try the fudge brownie you won t be disappointed Facilities were amazing The rental bikes scattered throughout the city are a cheap and easy way to explore the city much better than a tight tight squeeze in the tubes
85501,Hilton London Bankside, If pressed bed and pillows a little soft and lighting took a while to work out , Great location in the thick of it next to Tate Modern but very quiet Lots of attentive staff and the most wonderful spread at breakfast Pretty luxurious 
85502,Hilton London Bankside, The duvet was a little too heavy for the time of year so it was a bit warm at times but that s a minor niggle in an otherwise great stay , Our room type gave us access to the Executive Lounge which was very good and a welcome additional facility particularly as it offered a small breakfast buffet The room was spacious clean and comfortable 
85503,Hilton London Bankside, For the price premium you are paying would have been good to have more TV channels available , The bed was extremely comfortable Spacious wet room Flat screen tv 
85504,Hilton London Bankside, Random on the service firs night got a turn down service without asking second day didn t top up any of the soaps or milk etc Neither did we get the turn down again ad hoc , Very nice comfortable hotel Lots of small extras 
85505,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Kind receptionist Pillow and bed really comfy And they consider my situation kindly change my reservation It was really nice of them Breakfast quality was excellent much better than any other 5 stars hotel 
85506,Hilton London Bankside, It s getting worse Staff is not always attentive to what is needed The front desk lady kept on mispronouncing my surname and I kept on correcting her until she finally got it Water is changing temperature from extreme cold to extreme hot which is especially unpleasant in the shower Wifi disconnects every time when you put the phone down or leave laptop for a minute Most probably they force terminate sessions Need to wait for reconnection which is not really convenient Used to come here but I guess it s my last time , Clean good location 
85507,Hilton London Bankside, The room rate seemed pricey to say that it didn t include breakfast but I guess the location factors into that, The staff are super attentive friendly and helpful It s an area I don t know well and we booked the Hilton as we were heading to the Tate Thanks to the weather being great we spent a lot of time wandering round the area and it s so interesting The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the river with plenty of great restaurants to choose from The tube is close by as are many good attractions One of the best stays I ve had in London
85508,Hilton London Bankside, As a resident we couldn t get a drink in the bar after midnight when we returned from dinner which was disappointing for a London location, Very comfortable and spacious bedrooms and bathrooms
85509,Hilton London Bankside, The restaurant although decor and staff were great the menu was pretty uninspired and to be honest a let down in comparison to everything else, We were visiting the Shakespeare globe theatre so the location is excellent for this The decor is lovely and the bar area is very nice Breakfast was 20 each but there was loads and was very good quality
85510,Hilton London Bankside, The other guests on our floor were soooo noisy as there was a wedding party on this floor I wish the hotel would ve done something about this as we didn t get a very goodnight sleep , The room itself was amazing and so was the hotel staff were nice 
85511,Hilton London Bankside, Nothing not to like , Beatufuil room but what really stood out was the friendly welcoming staff Location is great for central London and is right beside the Tate Modern go up to the viewing platforn for amazing 360 views 
85512,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, The customer service at this Hilton was just brilliant our room was great and had everything we needed the Pool and gym were easy to find and use and felt pretty luxurious You really couldn t be better situated to enjoy the Tate Globe or even a short walk over the bridge to St Pauls 
85513,Hilton London Bankside, The breakfast was excellent but we thought overpriced for anyone on a leisure break, We loved the location the staff were very helpful and friendly The rooms extremely comfortable and quiet
85514,Hilton London Bankside, no view from my room Just a huge concrete wall , The stay was super wonderful Bed was super comfy Breakfast was fabulous Location was great and staff were super helpful 
85515,Hilton London Bankside, It would have been great to have a bath as well as a shower in the room as there was probably space but it didn t detract from our visit and it was clear on the website when I booked so I m only nit picking Also a jacuzzi or steam room with the pool would have just been a perfect way to wind down after a long day of sight seeing , The staff were brilliant so happy and helpful Efficient and attentive I ve never had such great service at breakfast in a hotel before This hotel is very clearly new as it is absolutely spotless and the staff clearly take a lot of pride in their work The complimentary soft drinks in the room Deluxe room were a nice touch to make me feel like I was getting more value for my money 
85516,Hilton London Bankside, There s no tube station nearby and it s about a 15 20 walk to south bank , Room was excellent with a double bath and super comfy beds Breakfast was great and staff were all friendly and helpful 
85517,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Convenient location second time we have stayed at hotel although we did find it a lot more money than the first and we even took advantage of breakfast on original visit 
85518,Hilton London Bankside, We loved everything , The bed was extra comfortable and the stocked fridge compliments of the hotel was an added bonus Staff couldn t do enough for you Excellent weekend stay 
85519,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Beautiful bed linen feather duvet and pillows heaven Hotels please drop those awful man made materials Executive Lounge was so comfortable and relaxing Excellent and very involved staff We loved this hotel 
85520,Hilton London Bankside, The tea and coffee were limited in the room but on request we were able to get additional teabags and milk The view from the room was limited and looked out onto a residential street but it was not unpleasant It was a little expensive for one night B B , The breakfast was very tasty and had a good selection The room was comfortable and bathroom was very clean The pool and jacuzzi were easy to access and staff were helpful 
85521,Hilton London Bankside, I have asked a room with a view There was no nice view from our room although breakfast was excellent and with a lot of choices dinner options were scarce and boring after a couple of days , the bed was a cloud indeed staff was really nice and helpul
85522,Hilton London Bankside, Nothing , Helpful cheerful staff Modern building As a wheelchair user the ground floor with reception restaurant and bar all on one level including entrance meant very easy access without requiring ramps assistance etc 
85523,Hilton London Bankside, As soon as the breakfast serving time approaches it s finish everything is taken away and even if you re finishing having your breakfast they will ask you to leave due to preparation for the next serving , Fabulous decor throughout including the room Lovely restaurant and fab buzzy bar 
85524,Hilton London Bankside, The area wasn t the best of places around the hotel but didn t take to long to get to the Southwark tube station Taxis were easy to get at the hotel too if you need one, The suite was perfect Staff were always happy to help if you needed anything or wanted to know something They especially helped my out with leaving a message in the room to surprise my partner 
85525,Hilton London Bankside, The coffee was awful yak wouldn t pour it in my moped But this is easily fixed , The rooms were nice neat decor and just about the right size The Hotel is clearly very new The breakfast deserves a special mention as it really was excellent minus the coffee I ve stayed at a few Hiltons in the UK and on the whole they are nowhere near the standard you get on the continent but this place was different A definite step up from the normal english Hilton standards Most concierge desks in London are decent but these guys here really knew what they were doing and were worth every penny What they didn t know they either found out for you in 5 minutes or it wasn t worth knowing just like in the movies If I was to go to London again I would definitely stay at London Bankside Well done Hilton hats off 
85526,Hilton London Bankside, Nothing, Modern hotel friendly staff spacious room Well catered lounge good food in restaurant and excellent atmosphere in bar Minutes from the southbank for lovely strolls
85527,Hilton London Bankside, I had indicated that it was my partners 40th Birthday but no special touches for him which was a disappointment to be honest Requested high floor room view to a brick wall not ideal , The muffins 
85528,Hilton London Bankside, , breakfast was absolutely delicious the rooms were beautiful and the bathroom was heavenly the bed was absolutely amazing and this hotel is one of the best that I have ever stayed at Highly recommend it to everyone 
85529,Hilton London Bankside, We requested all rooms on the same floor and when we left our luggage that was the case but upon return to collect room keys they had moved 1 of our 4 rooms to a completely different floor However this was resolved after speaking to a manager, Lovely pool area clean modern rooms great location Overall excellent hotel will definitely be back Tired to add photos but it won t let me
85530,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, The room was spacious the bed was very comfortable the staff was extreme helpful The only disadvantage was that the hotel location was not at the very center but the metro station was 7 min walk so it was minor 
85531,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, everything was as expected for a good hilton hotel the staff extremely accomodating and friendly and the hotel itself just lovely room spacious clean and comfortable with those little extra touches such as room made ready with lighting water and slippers left by the bed at night excellent buffet choice at breakfast 
85532,Hilton London Bankside, I was annoyed that I paid for a deluxe room when Booking com stated the difference was the deluxe was on a higher floor booked as we don t like traffic noise but our room was on floor 1 so total waste of extra money , The room was lovely and modern very comfy beds and fab bathroom We had interconnecting rooms for the children which was perfect 
85533,Hilton London Bankside, We couldn t find out how to turn the side lights and bathroom lights on and off without having to turn everything on and off Location was slightly away from where we wanted to be but wasn t too far a walk from public transport, Very comfortable room complimentary mini bar although no alochol probably for the better very friendly and helpful staff with lots of opportunity for feedback housekeeping came to check all was ok beautifully appointed lobby and room
85534,Hilton London Bankside, Without a tag don t clean up the room on the door just clean up the room or do not disturb The lights were always switched off together by one switch it was impossible switch on just one light No any USB sockets but none of that was a real problem , Good location for walks everywhere friendly crew really good breakfasts recomend for friends 
85535,Hilton London Bankside, Had Sunday lunch at the hotel restaurant OXBO fabulous lunch but the live music was too loud I couldn t talk to my partner without shouting but if that s not your thing check with the restaurant before booking a table as I m sure they could find a table further away from the live band artist , A beautiful hotel friendly staff wonderful breakfast fabulous room and the best sleep for ages 
85536,Hilton London Bankside, Although excellent and very tasty the breakfast buffet could have been a little warmer , The room and bed were extremely comfortable The staff were very friendly and helpful Overall ambience relaxing and luxurious 
85537,Hilton London Bankside, The pool seemed quite warm at first but after a while felt a little on the cold side , Service was really good had a complimentary cake and room decorated with balloons upon arrival as a surprise for partner s birthday The room decorations were so nice and really made it feel extra special The pool and gym were also nice facilities to use 
85538,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Staff were fantastic could not do enough for you I loved the little touches here and there such as after booking in getting ready and then going back out I came back to the room late to find my bed prepared for me to get into it water next to the bed new towels slippers placed next to the bed lovely music on and the lights set on a lovely dim setting could not believe it even when booking a taxi the gentlemen at the door went down the road just to flag one down for me I have been to many of a 5 star hotels but this particular one topped them all Quality of service was amazing breakfast lovely will definitely be using again very soon 
85539,Hilton London Bankside, Breakfast was expensive and it was too special with so many seeds and other specialities We missed cold meats and cheeses That s why we had breakfast there in the first morning and next one we went to a cafe nearby , Extra comfort bed slept extremely good 
85540,Hilton London Bankside, They sorted out the room while I was having breakfast I wasn t leaving until 12 00am so couldn t relax in the room until then so had to go downstairs I thought they would wait until the clients had checked out Liked everything else , Bed was sooooo comfortable I felt like I was in a bid puffed up pillowhad an amazingly comfortable inght sleep 
85541,Hilton London Bankside, We thought the breakfast was a little strange Everything one could ever want and more but putting milk in a little bottle and having eggs fried as you wait didn t really add to the experience This is very critical it s not every day you re treated like royalty All the staff were lovely and very helpful but we were asked if we would like extra coffee and self serving , Everything about the hotel was excellent what you d expect from Hilton We didn t have a view from the room as 3 4 of the window space was a wall 
85542,Hilton London Bankside, Credit card debited automatically this is not good , Very comfortable bed Very nice room Professional staff Very good gym and pool Walking distance to Southwark tube station Close to other attractions such as the Globe theater 
85543,Hilton London Bankside, The first given room was very disappointing and so on Room number 4 was finally OK In number two there clearly had been someone smoking number 3 had hardly any window which you could not tell in the single minute when the room was showed So check the room before you accept it , Excellent bed and linens Very comfortable room and great pool The executive lounge was a super bonus although we did not realize that you need not to book breakfast if you have access to the lounge So we spent quite some unnecessary money 
85544,Hilton London Bankside, Price is quite high but adequate for London and the service provided , Great room great hotel nice staff amazing bar Excellent choice Will definately consider booking this particular Hilton hotel for future London trips 
85545,Hilton London Bankside, Probably a little further out of the city than we would have normally booked Was close to Tate Modern and Borough Market which were both great, The room and bed was very comfortable Bathroom was grest
85546,Hilton London Bankside, We had a first floor room which faced inwards and felt a little oppressive However as it was only a 1 night stay this didn t impact on anything else It was a shame that as the Hilton do an amazing Breakfast that wasn t included , Lovely Lovely Beautiful furnishings and gorgeous Reception area with fragrant flower arrangements Staff very friendly helpful and courteous 
85547,Hilton London Bankside, Rooms could have been brighter but it was a design choice and I am ok with that , Very good breakfast incredibly clean The staff was incredibly courteous friendly and helpful 
85548,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Absolutely fantastic staff super friendly Upgraded to executive suite on check in Was a fantastic night and hotel Close to the tube only a two minute walk away 
85549,Hilton London Bankside, I missed a Nesspresso machine in the room The room s lights schema is very complicated making it almost impossible to go to the bathroom during the night without wakening your partner Impossible to see the sky from the very small room s window , excellent pool bathroom and location 
85550,Hilton London Bankside, room was wheelchair friendly but due to that no shower glas curtain so very wet floors, Very comfortable bed Professional accommodating staff made it possible to check in early in a different room
85551,Hilton London Bankside, This has nothing to do with the Hilton but I do have a gripe about the coffee hotels have in the rooms is filter coffee or those pods such a big leap I hate instant coffee I ordered room service for coffee , I loved the room service and the fact that we got it for a fairly good price as we booked through one of the booking websites So when I say value for money is good I think its expensive otherwise 
85552,Hilton London Bankside, Service in restaurant Coffee given but no milk on table Told to walk to far side of restaurant with coffee and get some milk , Comfy beds and very quiet in room 
85553,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, It was for my partners birthday so at check in we were upgraded which was really nice The room was really spacious and comfy Also after we had come back from being out there was a complimentary birthday cake found that very thoughtful 
85554,Hilton London Bankside, I have no complaints , This is the second time I have visited this hotel and chose it because I enjoyed my stay so much last time The staff are excellent attentive and obviously enjoy working there The best bit of all is the restaurant where I had the world s best burger 
85555,Hilton London Bankside, The bar charged us initially almost 70 for only 4 drinks They charge 4 serving for a handful of popcorn which they serve you without you asking for it So you assume it s free of charge it s not Make sure to check your bill they will change it right away if you inform them The hair dryer cannot be plugged into the bathroom socket You have to dry your hair either on the bed or near the tv using the mirrors of the closet Not really thought through , Breakfast was delicious Too many things to chose from The pool is bigger in real life than on the pictures 
85556,Hilton London Bankside, Lack of gluten free options at breakfast Poor service before my stay The hotel overcharged my account and I wasted hours of time just to correct their mistake This vastly tainted my view of their hotel Took over a month to sort out Didn t even receive any compensation You have to pay for the films In a Premier Inn Hub they come free , The breakfast is good But so it should be for 12 50 
85557,Hilton London Bankside, One of the only things I could say that I didnt enjoy too much was the TV and the way the system worked We couldnt tell what was on the channels and the options we found was a little limited , The staff was very welcoming amazing service from everyone we met at the hotel The room itself was great the bathroom was one of the finest i have stayed in and the bed was very comfortable 
85558,Hilton London Bankside, the cabinets in the room have only a high shelve which is not practical , The hotel has a fantastic atmosphere the mix of wood and industrial components is very nice Great staff and beautiful rooms 
85559,Hilton London Bankside, Pay extra for wifi if staying over 1 night Only 2 options on pillows and firm ones were not firm The bar is done out quite trendy but the music is awful Fairly bland common ways I asked for room on one of top floors but was given a room on 1st floor Staff were not helpful to my wife who tried to check in before i finished work would not let her check in without me and took a lot of haggling to sort out , Location excellent Good size room booked a deluxe 
85560,Hilton London Bankside, The ferryboats on the Thames can be heard inside the rooms when they sound their horn until 9pm , Great breakfast Epic staff on all levels excellent bed Great overall service
85561,Hilton London Bankside, The area around is being developed Lots of construction no noise pollution thankfully In a year or so this hotel will be even more popular than it already is , Comprehensive and delicious breakfast Trendy e g chain mail curtains Really really good bar Great location 
85562,Hilton London Bankside, Not as close to the London Eye and Waterloo station as we d been led to believe A good half hour walk plus , Lovely comfortable room in a very pleasant hotel with friendly helpful staff 
85563,Hilton London Bankside, Nothing , The staff without exception were professional charming and attentive The location is excellent and the room was very very quiet Great bathroom with an amazing shower Highly recommended 
85564,Hilton London Bankside, no default minibar in the room only for charge in advance for the whole set of products in minibar unclean towels shower in the bath w o any water protective device like glass door or special curtain so that everything in the bathroom was wet after shower no toilet brush no shoehorn no euro adapters for sockets, perfect restaurant breakfasts and dinners were delicious not bad location in the center near to the metro station iron in the room complimentary water
85565,Hilton London Bankside, You come to expect reception staff to give you a very brief explanation of how to get to your room For example you ll find the elevators here go to x floor take a left etc but this was missing It s not immediately obvious that you need to scan your keycard to activate the lift either After a days flying not having to think about these things would be a nicer touch , Best Hilton hotel I ve stayed at Normally it s a brand associated with tired and dated facilities in need of an overhaul but this new Hilton in Bankside addresses those issues 
85566,Hilton London Bankside, nothing, The restaurant in the evening food outstanding as was breakfast However the staff were exceptional from the waiter in the bar to the reception concierge brilliant Superb room too All so good 
85567,Hilton London Bankside, the price of the room was expensive but for the location and service we received it was worth it , Bed was extremely comfortable and the staff really made us feel special wonderful stay 
85568,Hilton London Bankside, Breakfast didn t have enough options I expected more cheese and traditional things like meat pies toffee puddings , Perfect location with nice rooms and excellent service 
85569,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Friendly helpful and efficient staff Best hotel buffet breakfast by far top quality yogurts breads and basically your choice of hot food with a chef there to cook whatever you wish Great location easy access to tubes and the Thames Rooms clean and good quality linen and toiletries Definitely recommend 
85570,Hilton London Bankside, The room was beyonc basic Expected more from hilton and because of location , Staff were polite and friendly Breakfast buffet was great Comfortable beds
85571,Hilton London Bankside, We had a great stay there was only two problems that we had We got refused a single shot 25ml for a G T at the main bar which is against the weights and measures act We were very disappointed I understand that their menu states that they are 50ml servings but it s illegal not to serve the single shot When we were eating our breakfast even though it was past 11am there was over 25 people still eating and the cleaner was vacuuming the restaurant I understand that you have to prepare the restaurant for lunch but while people are still eating I feel that it s inappropriate , A lovely warm welcoming from all staff our room was ready early so we were able to check in 2 5 hours early The room was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable The bar downstairs was great variety of drinks avaiable 
85572,Hilton London Bankside, Breakfast very cold was very disappointed as was really looking forward to it Did tell the staff on checkout surprised they didn t offer to discount the 170 room rate which included breakfast because of this as I would have expected to get refunded for a poor and cold breakfast ,No Positive
85573,Hilton London Bankside, The only thing I thought was a let down was breakfast as buffet style and ive stayed in other hiltons which were cooked to order we were abit late up but all pastrys etc were put away and when we asked for some they said none left also no breakfast tea was out , The hotel was brilliant clean stylish The bedroom was great extremely confortable bed and the shower was so good Cant fault the clenliness of the bathroom etc Very quiet room too and good blackout curtains Rarely say I would return but I would 100 return here 
85574,Hilton London Bankside, Therefore the reservation was pre paid one of receptionist arranged me a very dissapoonted room which is located at the back of beyond you cant even have mobile network signal However I notify my discomfort to another receptionist and she helped me to change this room In consequence rooms were seeing walls and street The view was not good It should be spa with a 5 star hotel but it hasnt , Rooms are tidy modern designed clean The location was centre Breakfast were perfect 
85575,Hilton London Bankside, Breakfast price is steep c 20GBP, Updated gym and swimming pool complex Sociable lounge area and restaurant Good size rooms and comfortable beds Location for anyone needing to be close to Blackfriars South Bank The street has a costa sainsburys local pub etc therefore the hotel is well positioned
85576,Hilton London Bankside, This is really micro criticism since everything is so good but there was no bottle opener for the complementary bottles in the mini bar Would be good to provide that in a clearly marked place because maybe it was there somewhere and I just did not find it , The bed is fantastic like a cloud the swimming pool an amazing extra feature and the staff super friendly Great place to stay 
85577,Hilton London Bankside, Disappointed with film options having to pay extra there are a couple of hotels near by that offer free entertainment stream latest films free of charge , The room was comfortable and bed was great 
85578,Hilton London Bankside, The room rate per night could have been lower Other hotels with that level of quality offer a complementary welcome drink , The hotel is very well located The room was extremely generous in size The room was in a very quiet area The complementary internet was fast All the the staff of the hotel were authentically helpful 
85579,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, As soon as I arrived I was greeted with a smile and checked in straight away with my bag taken to my room Amazing service and the rooms were stunning with all the facilities you need Would 100 recommend this hotel to anyone 
85580,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Every single member of staff were so welcoming and couldn t do enough for you The restaurant was brilliant and the bar really very comfortable and a relaxed place to sit in Even when they were closing you didn t feel rushed 
85581,Hilton London Bankside, After a shower the bathroom floor was a bit of a hazard as it was the disabled access bathroom the floor of the bathroom is the shower floor So more bath mats needed there , Breakfast was fab I loved the pancakes made to order The bed was heaven and the staff at reception were excellent All round a great stay 
85582,Hilton London Bankside, Nothing this place absolutely rocks, Amazingly comfortable beds great facilities amazing pool and jacuzzi and staff who were friendly and helpful and i mean every staff member we encountered from the guys in the pool area to check in staff and bellboys
85583,Hilton London Bankside, I don t have any complaints it was fantastic , Reception Check in staff were really friendly remembered us by name the morning when we were checking out too The interior is beautiful along with the room There was an amazing walk in shower spacious bathroom and luxurious king sized bed Everything was great about the hotel will definitely return next time we visit 
85584,Hilton London Bankside, The hotel is 7 minutes walk from the nearest tibe station Southwark The Jubilee line isnot a main tube line so you have to change trains all the time My recommendation is to travel by buses which are closer to the hotel and you can see the city , The stuff is very effective and polite the hotel facilities are suberb We loved the executive launge
85585,Hilton London Bankside, The indoor swimming pool is lovely but quite small Spa services prices are above average The underground station are 5 7 minutes walk however many taxis are available and concierge can always help , For an luxurious experience in London this would be your destination The staff are super friendly and cooperative Ask for a bathtub during your booking to make sure you have one If not you may get a free upgrade how nice is this The room decorations are fancy and luxurious it will surely will be a good test for a vacation or business Will definitely be putting it in my list for next visits 
85586,Hilton London Bankside, The poached fried and scrambled eggs were under cooked There were no beans or plum tomatoes so not liking mushrooms or fried tomato the breakfast was rather dry I was deducted 50 in case of any issues with the room and this money has still not been refunded back to me , The appearance of the hotel The friendliness of staff The cleanliness and presentation of the room The service provided when we requested to drop our bags off early prior to check in The range of cold food available for breakfast

85594,Hilton London Bankside, Quality of cleaning staff members will be BIG issue For example 1 when we entered into the room for the first time one of the water bottle put on the bedside table was opened and 2 on the 2nd day after the room cleaning we found one of the bath robes was put onto my suitcase kissing to the dirty wheel This should not happen to the Hilton brand hotel Hair dryer generates only cold wind no matter how we changed the setting , Staff members at reception and concierge were friendly and addressed questions properly Large room Comfortable bed Proximity to station 5 min walk

85599,Hilton London Bankside, Nothing , The bed was out of this world and the shower in the room was very nice The decor of the room was amazing and the facilities such as the pool were well kept and exceptionally useful 
85600,Hilton London Bankside, Room service meal over cooked we were asked how we wanted them but both came welldone in the end when asked for medium and medium rare burgers could of just been a one off though , The staff were outstanding always polite and welcoming Executive room very clean and comfortable everything was very well thought of The restaurant was excellent and executive lounge worthwhile as it provided a great selection for breakfast 
85601,Hilton London Bankside, Purely that we didn t have breakfast as felt it was very expensive at 25 I am not sure what could warrant that price Everything else was fantastic , Wonderful reception modern and relaxing decor Excellent bed very quiet room courtyard side The staff were top class The location is good closest to Southwark tube and walkable from The Strand covent garden within 20 minutes 
85602,Hilton London Bankside, Nothing , The bed was very comfortable and we didn t really want to get out of it All the staff was very friendly even the cleaning maids were too 
85603,Hilton London Bankside, Bar is a little pricey but it is London afterall , Beds were very comfy and Xmas decorations were amazing hotel is well run and staff are very friendly and helpful
85604,Hilton London Bankside, Poor service from front of house staff and breakfast rate not explained properly meaning ended up paying almost 30 for breakfast , Good facilities and decor
85605,Hilton London Bankside, Shame there was no sauna in the health club Did not like the pillows all soft and soggy I like a firmer pillow Phoned to ask for a firmer pillow was told only one type available IHG hotels have a pillow menu Also breakfast on the last day in the executive lounge I ended up having to go to reception to get them to find someone to serve us staff very apologetic about it Also hairdryer in room only blowing cold air , Staff great conceirge went to collect my friend who got lost trying to find the hotel Decor exceptional and sumptuous efficient reception check in and we got our room upgraded Certainly felt spoilt Loved happy hour in the bar between 4 6 daily get 2 drinks for price of one Hotel lived up to Hilton brand expectation Also beautifully decorated for xmas

85607,Hilton London Bankside, My husband made the booking I arrived earlier to my husband as he is with clients Despite having ID booking confirmation from my husband I was advised that I couldn t check in without him emailing the hotel Told that I would need to sit in reception until he emailed but he was not contactable I was horrified Never ever ever experienced such service I was advised that 5 star hotels operate like this Fact honestly stayed at many 5 star hotels around the world Fact worked in the industry for 5 years Fact 5 star hotels provide truly inspiring service and customer friendly procedures Many achieve this with ease Not here Patronised accused and having to hear what I can only describe as a rehearsed response over and over again I need an email I need an email Had to pay a hidden 50 room cover for insurance which gets refunded when my bank feels like it which is exactly what was said Fact Travelled the world worked in a very reputable travel company and still have contacts My advice stay elsewhere Far far better service far less corporate procedures Never ever again Fine for business travel Solo Quick stop over hotel airport like in experience High on security and processes only , The room was big executive Big comfortable bed and a nice room Staff at breakfast were great exec lounge Great location

85609,Hilton London Bankside, The king sized bed was two smaller sized mattresses placed next to each other I tended to roll a bit towards the middle split though I never fell in A true king sized bed would have been the ideal , The Hilton Bankside has got to be the standard bearer in the hotel hospitality industry This was my second visit there and the service and accommodations were again unparalleled The location is also ideal just adjacent to the Tate Modern and very close to both the Southwark station on the Jubilee line and Burrough Market Though this is not a budget hotel it is also surprisingly affordable given the outstanding quality Is it possible to be in love with a hotel If it is you ll find me on one knee 
85610,Hilton London Bankside, Service in the bar was slow considering it was quiet , I thought the rooms were lovely I liked the modern feel The reception and bar area was very comfortable The beds were extremely comfortable The rooms were fairly quiet Not disturbed by noise

85614,Hilton London Bankside, The fact that I wasn t told until I arrived that I had to pay a 50 deposit for each night that I stayed After leaving being told it would take 10 days to go back into my account and then to find out that they tried to take another 500 from my account once I left The view that we had was onlooking and wasn t very private, The location was amazing Nice tidy room cleaned everyday
85615,Hilton London Bankside, The conceirge dropped my bag and I had two soft drink cans in the bag both were severely broken and all my stuff were soaked Brand new clothes valuable electronics etc , It was a comfortable stay but an incident happened at the end which I didn t like at all

85617,Hilton London Bankside, The room ventilation was rather dry Perhaps some mist water to make the room more airy Windows can t be opened , The rooms a luxury for London We were lucky to have the corner room with huge bathroom I love the colour scheme Breakfast was good and do get the club rooms for an evening drink on the hotel

85623,Hilton London Bankside, The pillows are too soft to sleep on , The full English breakfast was the first class The consiegs are very friendly and helpful The bed is spacious and very comfortable The decorations inside the hotel are modern unique and elegant 
85624,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Breakfast was fantastic a great selection The bed was so comfortable including the pillows and duvet I didn t want to leave The rainfall shower was a bonus too

85628,Hilton London Bankside, It was very expensive 5 65 for a glass of orange juice which I found a lot The breakfast was odd no real buffet and had to wait a while for food to be cooked Wasn t too keen on this and not much options for vegetarians , The bedrooms were fantastic very accommodating and so modern Staff very friendly hotel was exceptional 
85629,Hilton London Bankside, I had to leave If we hadn t had the executive lounge access I think I would not have enjoyed my stay as much simply because I don t like noise and crowds at weekend breaks, Everything was perfect The executive lounge access is a must worth spending that bit more The food is divine the staff at every step are down to earth and welcoming Good sense of humor too Perfect location for Tate Modern 2 min walk plus all other amenities 
85630,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, The staff were incredible at this hotel nothing was too much for them The bed was the comfiest bed I ve ever experienced The breakfast with live station was amazing definitely something for everyone take away cups available for taking drinks with you a perfect start to every day The hotel is BEAUTIFUL and the rooms were spotless and so modern Wireless was fast and we were able to stream movies cannot find a single thing to complain about 
85631,Hilton London Bankside, It s a minor point the gym was too small , The staff was extreamly polite Location was perfect in terms of sight seeing Really close to Southwark underground station 
85632,Hilton London Bankside, My wife didn t sleep well because the bed wasn t comfortable and we did have a room service dinner which sincerely was nothing to write home about Total waste of money and cersar salad was bad taste But apart from that nice place to stay Less I forget if you driving it s going to cost you 40 a day to park and if you use the 2hour s parking time restricted bays it cost you 6 an hour , The staff were very nice and helpful
85633,Hilton London Bankside, Trying to dry hair in a mirror Either a longer hairdryer lead needed or another mirror , Lovely staff We had room service at 11 pm which was very quick and excellent food Loved the decor 
85634,Hilton London Bankside, I didn t like it when I couldn t get Beef or Lamb sausage I don t eat pork I think others too You should provide a variety for people to choose from, I enjoyed the Smoked Salmon the fresh orange juice
85635,Hilton London Bankside, Nothing though I did book late and paid a premium but London was nearly sold out that night apparently start of Fashion week I had to leave early and I didn t get breakfast but from other reviews I should have , Air conditioning was ideally cool to escape from the sweltering heat of the city on the hot day outside it was about 30 degrees yet inside it was cool Staff very attentive at all stages of stay it was a nice treat to get some fresh fruit after checking in delivered to my room 
85636,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Staff v courteous helpful and efficient Bedrooms well laid out and good modern facilities High standard of cleanliness Beds good size and v comfy I ve eaten a lot of hotel breakfasts and this stands out as one of the best in terms of choice and presentation with some good personal touches
85637,Hilton London Bankside, The breakfast never changes It was the same throughout the week we stayed there Wish there could be more varieties and changes , Everything is new and comfortable The staff are nice and helpful Good value for money It takes about 5 10 mins to walk to the nearest underground station But it was compensated by the bus stops nearby We ended up taking a lot of buses which was also fun 
85638,Hilton London Bankside, Clumps of hair in the shower A sign by the room fridge saying to help myself to complementary non alcoholic drinks and snacks when all there was in the fridge was two bottles of water , Really smart hotel Check in and check out were a pleasure 
85639,Hilton London Bankside, The room distance from the elevators Have to walk quite a bit Harder if you are carrying big luggage and the carpet along the walkways don t seems to cooperate well , The location and the room ambiance
85640,Hilton London Bankside, Misunderstanding in booking breakfast was included but they first claimed 50gbp extra Minibar was not replenished Booking through booking com did not count in hhonors loyalty program , Extreme clean rooms 
85641,Hilton London Bankside, Cannot think of anything I didn t like, Size of room plenty of space Everything just how I like it cleanliness good coffee tea facilities nice window dressing preventing any light coming in
85642,Hilton London Bankside, If only a hair dryer was supplied that would have been good But I took my own so no problem really Thought it was fairly common for hotels to have hair dryers , Lovely hotel would love to go again The staff were extremely helpful and polite Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice hotel right in the heart of London 
85643,Hilton London Bankside, My shirt got covered in the hand cream in the downstairs toilets it squirted all over my top as that s the way the dispenser sends it the hotel said it was not their fault and would not knock anything off my bill Ralph Lauren top damaged , The food and drinks
85644,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Breakfast is excellent and the room is very comfortable Especially they provide us free executive lounge for tea time and available to meet with your friend or business partner 
85645,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Brilliant short stay excellent hotel with fantastic facilities including a decent size pool very very good staff and service location is superb Was well worth the 600 mile round trip drive 
85646,Hilton London Bankside, Bed was a little too soft for my liking and quality of toiletries was rather rubbish The bar used to have great bartenders with great vibe now there s just 1 lonely bartender left which took away a lot of atmosphere at what used to be one of my favourite hang out places , Love the pool and the excellent and accommodating concierge service Nice design and room is very clean and well facilitated This is my 5th time staying there 
85647,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, The staff were amazing from start to finish during my 2 night stay the hotel itself is faultless This hotel is the only hotel il be returning toin London for the incredible value for money deals 
85648,Hilton London Bankside, Worst Hilton experience Staff were quite busy when I was checking in Maybe that s the reason I felt they don t have patient They offered me a room without window and charged me a large sum of money when I ask to change the same size room with window I am a solo traveller What surprised me was that they changed to a twin room rather than kingsize room at first so I had to go downstairs twice to ask them to make it right , Location is okay New hotel with good facilities 
85649,Hilton London Bankside, We stayed here for our wedding so I had left notes to inform the hotel prior Upon check in I was told I would not be upgraded to the next room I asked why and I was told it was full nothing more was supplied I thought she would have offered a drink as a comp but nothing Okay fair enough About 2hrs later I was with my sister in law when she checked in and I thought I ll ask again just in case Good thing I did the night manager immediately gave me a new room and apologised for the earlier conversation at check in So not sure why she had such an attitude Anyway the wedding was the next day so we left the hotel at 1pm I was informed by my bridesmaid when she d gone back at 8pm that the room hadn t been cleaned but she d left word with reception that myself and my husband would be back that night if they could clean the room and throw in anything special that would be great Well we got back at midnight the room hadn t been cleaned You d think a hotel like this would be better right The bed mattress was squeaky which implies cheap The pillows were too soft and using more didn t build any support Sad to say but wouldn t go back here , I liked the hotel location and the bathroom was absolutely gorgeous The best part of the stay if I m honest 
85650,Hilton London Bankside, Our visit was too short but we can t fault the hotel for that , From the minute we arrived to the minute we departed we were made feel extra special We will always book this hotel on future visits to London
85651,Hilton London Bankside, Pillows too soft according to my son who was the recipient of this lovely stay but no doubt there was a pillow menu and he didn t ask for an other one , The staff were all very helpful and pleasant
85652,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Great location a couple of minutes walk to the river with easy access to Southbank and the Globe Lovely breakfast with a large range of food choices 
85653,Hilton London Bankside, I d like to have been able to have taken the stairs rather than lift The stairway was hard to find and behind a security release button which felt like it implied a sense that the stairwell s use was not to be encouraged and indeed might even be alarmed But this is a very minor thing really , Everyone was very helpful and friendly Room was very comfortable and well appointed ironing board was a definite plus Room service was fast and great at 1am 
85654,Hilton London Bankside, Everday there s is knocking in our door to do something inside They must finish all the room jobs before the guest come back We usually come back in the night , Everything is good 
85655,Hilton London Bankside, No beans at breakfast Tinned mushrooms View of a fence , Massive most comfortable bed Complimentary water replaced daily lovely bathroom and shower Very nice room
85656,Hilton London Bankside, It is such a shame that most hotels cannot keep a buffet breakfast hot The food was good as was the choice but the cooked food was tepid such a shame , Rooms staff and facilities excellent Very helpful with everything and very good service 
85657,Hilton London Bankside, I was more than surprised to be overcharged for the room They did sort it out but they did not apologize and took the right money from my account when I wasn t in the hotel without checking with me first so tough luck if I didn t agree You can accept a corporate feel for less money but then you expect efficiency This had neither They have a lot to learn about charm and personal service When we complained that we did not have any tea bags in our room we had to ask twice before any arrived and then we were given two teabags penny wise and pound foolish We were in that hotel for 5 days I liked it but it s the first time ever I have not left a tip, Great location Very modern Well laid out Water in the room The swimming pool is really nice the gym the same A handy cocktail bar outside
85658,Hilton London Bankside, The items of food for cooked breakfast aren t kept at a warm enough temperature so by the time you return to your table start eating it s quite cold We didn t appreciate having to wait 20 minutes to check out whilst staff sorted out an overpayment on our bill because they perceived we had alcohol from the mini bar which we hadn t, The 1st thing you notice is wonderful aroma The hotel is modern decorated with excellent taste Our deluxe room felt luxurious the bed was enormous The was a variety of choice at breakfast the pancakes were especially nice The staff were generally very personable eager to make sure you were happy
85659,Hilton London Bankside, But the porridge bit cold Also noticed the jars that contained nuts were open This could trigger an allergic reaction with a person who has a serve nut allergy , The food very good
85660,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, From the time we got there to the time we were checking out the staff at this hotel was phenomenal The rooms are squeaky clean and very spacious The bed was so comfortable we found it hard to get up We also had breakfast ordered up to our room which was great we really felt like they look after all of their guests We also tried out the swimming pool which was also very clean and quiet which was lovely and the opening hours are very ideal especially if you go out during the day you can have a cheeky swim in the evening I would definitely recommend this hotel and I would definitely stay here again 
85661,Hilton London Bankside, Nothing to fault about this hotel , Large room on 6th floor with glimpse of St Pauls Cathedral Very comfortable bed large couch huge new TV large desk and a very modern large bathroom with a huge walk in shower with a massive rain head shower head Everything about this hotel was excellent Staff were very friendly and efficient Location very good about 5 mins walk to Southwark Tube station Tesco Metro next door and a mini Sainsburys across the road Will definitely stay here again 
85662,Hilton London Bankside, Gym could be bigger, Staff were very accommodating arranging short notice laundry service and toiletries Hotel is well positioned near Tate Modern and with easy access to anywhere in London Nice pool
85663,Hilton London Bankside, Service at breakfast Yes I know it was a buffet told coffee would be served at our table had to ask several times Also told waiter would bring certain items they didn t ,No Positive
85664,Hilton London Bankside, Executive lounge breakfast was limited as was drink selection at Distillery Bar Great if you like gin though , Friendly and helpful staff Great location for several attractions and access to City of London
85665,Hilton London Bankside, Needed a mirror in the bedroom and not just wardrobe and bathroom , Staff were warm and friendly and very helpful Hotel is immaculate A hidden gem and definitely my go to place when I m in London from now on 
85666,Hilton London Bankside, Wifi only free for limited time Wifi shoud be free to paying guests for the duration of their stay imho , Excellent staff at check in and breakfast area breakfast itself was excellent with a lot of choice bed was comfortable and room was clean and modern 
85667,Hilton London Bankside, My girlfriend did say the hair dryer was blowing out cold air but we both said we loved every thing about it from the reception to our room , the bed was extra comfy allowing me to enjoy an excellent night sleep and the staff especially the gentlemen who attended to us i believe his name was Felipe was an absolute delight Credit to the Hilton However it must be said that all the other staff did indeed show the same type of friendliness and warmth For a young couple who don t have the financial capability to stay at a Hilton this one of occasion were together we put our money together to enjoy a two day holiday to the best of our abilities was complete with the addition of staying at a Hilton hotel So thank you as we ve never experienced a hotel nor stay like it 
85668,Hilton London Bankside, Restaurant staff let down the hotel Layout of breakfast buffet makes no sense and Breakfast staff totally uncoordinated and with no attention to visiting guests Had to ask 3 times for basic cups of coffee which eventually arrived at the end of the breakfast , Great location and very nice hotel Front office staff very attentive and nice 
85669,Hilton London Bankside, Absolutely nothing , The staff were very friendly and polite as well as quick I ordered fresh milk for my coffee from Guest Services and they delivered it within 3 minutes And they were efficient throughout 
85670,Hilton London Bankside, Receptionists English wasn t great hard to understand , Facilities were very good Very Clean Pool was amazing Restaurant was very good as was staff service Very good location
85671,Hilton London Bankside, The location was ok but further away from u ground than I expected But there were plenty of bus routes neareby We just had not investigated them The hotel design was less impressive than we expected for a Hilton but it did fit into its surroundings well My feeling was that the nearby travel lodge made more of a visual impact , Staff excellent pleasant yet businesslike and efficient comfortable bed and pillows had a good feel to it liked the way the coffee urn and stuff were stored out of sight yet readily accessable 
85672,Hilton London Bankside, At first they gave us room for disabled which we haven t asked and told us it s the same Well it wasn t Apparently they wanted to give to booking visitors those rooms After a lot of conversation they changed our room and the shower was amazing Spent a lot of time though , King size bed was perfect bathroom sooo perfect breakfast incredibly goood Loved everything there Value the money 
85673,Hilton London Bankside, Breakfast in executive lounge was quite normal well actually below the average of hotel breakfasts in London , Lovely new hotel Staffs at reception were nice talkative and they were always able to find out a way to satisfy our demands We upgraded to executive suite which was exceptionally spacious and cozy Love the sofa bed My mom was even wondering the brand of it lol 
85674,Hilton London Bankside, Seems a little petty but there were no tea bags for English Breakfast plenty of other varieties I asked for some and was given more of the same Also no towels in the gym swim area on Thursday morning and no one around to ask for them , The room was well equipped clean and concierge very helpful Had trouble with wifi an they sorted it out straight away Also gave good directions to get to the London Eye Location brilliant and decorations good 
85675,Hilton London Bankside, Nothing was an excellent place to stay and would recommend it to anyone looking to stay a few nights in London , Very central and close to everything staff were helpful and had good knowledge and happy to help 
85676,Hilton London Bankside, Being charged for something from the mini bar which I didn t consume They have offered me a refund but will take up to 8 working days , Great facilities very comfy bed and really quiet room as requested 
85677,Hilton London Bankside, The Clorine level in the pool was to high and made me feel ill Otherwise a perfect hotel , The staff were very attentive and the hotel was clean fresh and modern 
85678,Hilton London Bankside, The only weird thing is that concierge won t actually order you a cab for out of town travel they will hail a black cab at the roadside but not order a saloon Strange , You can just tell from the moment you deal with reception this is a team with service excellence as a top priority i don t find this at all Hiltons and the staff are so professional and responsive Rooms are spacious and have an airy ambience Great location to borough market and London Bridge 
85679,Hilton London Bankside, Not too happy with our bathroom as the water went everywhere when you showered Did not have a view a brick wall , Staff were lovely n particular Hannah on front desk Federica in restaurant and Apran event organiser Bed was comfy Housekeeping were good to keep rooms clean Made good use of the gym and liked the latest kit in particular the treadmill Food was very nice not only for the events we attended ie Wedding and Summer ball but also when we had lunch in the restaurant Thank you 
85680,Hilton London Bankside, Breakfast far too expensive 25 is ridiculous Ate at local cafe overlooking river for 10 Such a pity Eating breakfast in your hotel us part of the whole experience but not at those prices ,No Positive
85681,Hilton London Bankside, Breakfast was a little slapdash We didn t know what hot food we could order and the coffee machines were inefficient and slow They kept running out of milk , Bed was super comfortable It was extremely quiet The curtains kept out all light and the perfume in reception was lovely All staff we encountered were really lovely and helpful and very polite 
85682,Hilton London Bankside, Better explanation on what food is on offer in executive lounge almost missed out on pancakes , Staff couldn t do enough for us superb customer service 
85683,Hilton London Bankside, Nothing could be improved , The staff from the top down were all excellent Very eager to please and helpful beyond the call of duty eg HJ one of the hotel managers sewed one of the strings from my backpack after I couldn t manage it It doesn t get better than that in my mind 
85684,Hilton London Bankside, Glass Coke bottle broke when opening took 2 calls to get room cleaned and replacement by which time I was ready to sleep, Location to my office convenient for tube and trains 
85685,Hilton London Bankside, The online directions for walking from Waterloo were hopeless and incorrect The Pommery in the minibar was disgusting and very expensive , Very comfortable for a short stay Clean and very quiet 
85686,Hilton London Bankside, The air con in our room stopped working in the morning and I reported it to staff immediately after breakfast Arrived back to our room at 3 45pm to find our room hadn t been serviced and the air con still not working As we had to go out again at 4 15pm we had 30 mins to shower change and pack our bags so that staff could move our things while we were out We were given key card to our new room and told that complimentary drinks would be provided When we returned to our new room after the theatre there weren t any drinks in fact the mini bar was empty it hadn t been stocked at all Cooked breakfast was lukewarm at best on our first day was fine on our second 2 day stay Would have expected to be served tea coffee at the table rather than getting own from a machine , Good location rooms well appointed 
85687,Hilton London Bankside, No problems we throughly enjoyed our stay If I ultimately had to critic one thing it would be that although we were told at reception food and drink were free in the executive lounge until a certain time we were unsure about helping ourselves or waiting for service We came in sat down and felt a bit awkward until we had watched a few people and got the general idea of what we should do , Staff very friendly and welcoming upgraded room to executive suit which was beautiful Lovely big bed fabulous bathroom and the shower was great We took advantage of the executive lounge food and drink We really liked the idea of using the room key to access the lounge and using it in the lift to gain access to our room floor it made us feel a bit important hahaha Finger food was lovely waiters and waitresses were very friendly Overall a lovely experience 
85688,Hilton London Bankside, The view out of the window was awful looked out onto another wing of the hotel whereas i prefer to see whats going on in the outside world The bar was also very pricey , The bed was hands down the comfiest bed i ve ever slept in Room was nice and spacious

85691,Hilton London Bankside, The breakfast was not labelled clearly and difficult to distinguish where what anything actually was Very unspecified on the latest checkout available , Excellent service standard
85692,Hilton London Bankside, Breakfast servers need to be quicker with fresh orange and offer of tea and coffee Left queuing at checkout as desk staff on phone, Pillows were good Mattress topper great Air con quiet and effective

85694,Hilton London Bankside, Rooms were dark and gloomy The architect and interior designer got this hotel completely wrong The windows were very small the decor dark grey and the lighting trendy but totally inadequate Ok for moles or those who enjoy a dose of rickets Reception and the restaurant weren t much better Really spoils an otherwise good hotel , Great Location Go and look at a pile of bricks at Tate Modern its art apparently 
85695,Hilton London Bankside, No , The hotel is opened on Oct 2015 so that the facility is brand new and the sound proof is perfect since the underground overground is nearby the staff is very proactive and helpful and the executive lounge is quite good and private the breakfast in the restaurant is perfect

85699,Hilton London Bankside, The London traffic it was terrible, The hotel being 7 months old was a pleasant surprise to what we have stayed in before while in London would stay there again Butler was very good with his knowledge discriptions of where to go
85700,Hilton London Bankside, Was ignored for a few minutes at receception on arrival although three people behind desk The room was not good in so many ways electric cables sitting on top of wardrobe shower that s floods the bathroom tv that you have to watch in front of the door as is doesn t swivel so no tv in bed , Location lovely
85701,Hilton London Bankside, My wife found drying her hair in the room difficult There were no mirrors in the room The only mirror was in the wardrobe and the socket in the opposite wall so I had to sit on the floor or pull the desk chair over but with no surface to put the brush products etc The coiled cable of the hairdryer was too tight to be pulled so made it very difficult to look in the mirror and style my hair Small thing but annoying ,No Positive
85702,Hilton London Bankside, Staff tried to cheat us They continuously kept taking money from our credit cards even after our stay without our acknowledgment The money was returned only after a scandal my bank account went overdraft because of them they told us it was a mistake but you do not take over 1000 pounds by mistake so I don t believe them fraud they just got caught also no compensation from them beware of this hotel,No Positive

85704,Hilton London Bankside, could not get a drink at the bar after 12pm we thought that was ridiculous as we had guests who joined us after a wedding for a late drink and they had to leave because we could not offer them one , everything especially the waiting staff in the morning in the VIP lounge they were all so perfectly polite and courteous nothing was too much simply wonderful 
85705,Hilton London Bankside, I got a last minute deal think it may have cost alot more otherwise , The location is excellent 5 mins walk from the river London Bridge bars and restaurants and Waterloo Brand new hotel rooms and common areas in excellent condition Staff very helpful 
85706,Hilton London Bankside, The lighting in the room was pretty hard to work out so was very hard to get up in the night without accidentally putting on every light in the room, The bed was very comfortable good shower and friendly staff
85707,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Great hotel in a great area Borough Market and trendy eateries near by Close to the tube and other amenities I hope it stays as clean and fresh looking over time 
85708,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Comfiest bed I ve ever slept in Didn t want to get up Wonderful Staff were lovely and polite Room was immaculate and clean Little added extras such as free gummi bears and the ability to leave our luggage after we d checked out just made it that little bit extra special
85709,Hilton London Bankside, The only negative thing I have to mention that the breakfast isn t included in the room price , In overall I had a splendid stay The staff was very friendly the room was clean the bed really comfy and the swimming pool a big plus 
85710,Hilton London Bankside, Liked everything really except there wasn t a view from the window , There was a lot to like with this hotel The King guest room was spacious and well equipped with a good shower in a nice bathroom The pool and gym facilties were great The breakfast buffet was lovely with a lot of choice The staff were very friendly and polite The restaurant and the bar were well designed and the decor all round the hotel was spot on
85711,Hilton London Bankside, I requested a early check in as we had a 5 hour journey to get there on arrival I was told my room wouldn t be ready untill 3pm we arrived at 11 am but the hotel was told of that in advance but could have another which was ready for a further 50 bit steep considering what we payed anyway so we didn t really save anything on booking through booking com Nice hotel but keep it in mind if you want to check in early you will be paying a supplement maybe I m being cynical but I m being honest , Very stylish room the location is excellent for most of the major tourist attractions and the staff were very helpful Dont forget your swim suits or gym clothes as the facilities are first class
85712,Hilton London Bankside, Room service came with no napkins or water Taxi driver was 15 min late, The service is top notch you can tell that everyone truly cares that each and every guest has the best stay possible We came from Vancouver B C Canada and arrived at 10 am exhausted and they gave us our room right away no extra charge I have traveled lots and never had that happen The beds were super comfortable 
85713,Hilton London Bankside, All fab X, I booked this on behalf of my dad who was attending his exhibition at the oxo gallery and I made special requests as he has limited walking ability in order to help him as u couldn t attend The staff were amazing with humans so helpful that they made his opening night at the gallery a very special trip indeed So impressed with this hotel genuine care customer service and disabled facilities excellent Thank u 
85714,Hilton London Bankside, Women s NON vanity area Difficult to use hairdryer only mirror inside wardrobe and bathroom no safety plug in bathroom , The bed was incredibly comfortable They made our stay extra special as it was our wedding anniversary First day breakfast amazing second day a little chaotic 
85715,Hilton London Bankside, You were not able to order a pint of beer it was only served in halves The bar closed at 11am I would have like soft drinks or water in the room as complimentary The mirrors were not near a plug socket so I had to be inventive when drying my hair , The room was a lovely size and very comfortable and peaceful I was able to work well at the desk 
85716,Hilton London Bankside, Room was a little bit small, The beds were super comfy and snugly Very good full English and the staff were so welcoming joining us to a loyalty program with a free room upgrade 
85717,Hilton London Bankside, Drinks in the bar were a bit pricey , Loved the pool and rooms were very comfortable and luxurious especially the bathroom Staff very friendly and helpful too 
85718,Hilton London Bankside, Staff not genuine Where we were seated we heard a member of staff in the restaurant repeat the same exact pleasantries without any true conversation over and over again, Excellent standards and excellent food
85719,Hilton London Bankside, No complaints at all Will be coming back when next staying in London, The Bed was amazingly comfy and so big Loved it Staff were very helpful and always smiling The Shakespeare cocktails were amazing and very well thought up 
85720,Hilton London Bankside, nothing, Staff were very friendly and helpful Room was very clean and comfortable was also very quiet couldn t hear any traffic from outside nor noise from other hotel users Fridge filled with free drinks and snacks was refilled upon our return later in the day Very clean bathroom Lovely shower and ample supplies of towels shower gels etc Location is excellent as only 5 minute walk from Tube Station
85721,Hilton London Bankside, We are a same sex couple At check in the receptionist asked us if we were OK with a double which I had booked in the first place and I said yes that s what I requested He then asked if we would prefer a twin room It made the situation really embarrassing for me as I then had to say no It was like he was dilberately fishing for information All the other staff in the hotel were very nice, Very comfy bed and brand new modern hotel
85722,Hilton London Bankside, Sound proofing of the room needs some work especially because the cleaning personnel is quite noisy with opening and closing doors when cleaning rooms during the late morning hours I got woke up by the sound each morning , Decent location helpfull staff 
85723,Hilton London Bankside, The fact that WiFi was not free for everyone, The food the staff the room and the cleanliness of the whole hotel We also appreciated the complimentary drinks and snacks in the mini fridge 
85724,Hilton London Bankside, The light concept seems rather weird little option to lit only specifc lamps which is a petty as the hotel pretends to care about sustainability Water saving towels get exchanged although they are placed on the hook again real sustainbility looks different Would have liked to be able to open a window air condition is not the best option for energy saving , Very good location and nice and welcoming staff lobby and bar Outstandingly good bed we had a very calm room with nice view 
85725,Hilton London Bankside, It was a challange to find hot water on the shower nob There were not enough towel racks so they were drapped or laying about Volume on the TV was muted because of the recessed installation Price for food and drinks were just outrageously expensive The walking route to the closest Tube station is a little dodgy at night so you might want to take the longer but better lit route , The bedding was outstanding Plus you can easily adjust the temperature to make those down covers delightful They left water at bedside when they turned down the covers at night Service was just impeccable Many tourist sights were within easy walking distance from the hotel and close to a Tube station 
85726,Hilton London Bankside, Can t honestly think of anything apart from drinks was a little pricey but to be expected in London, Lovely modern hotel amazing staff who couldn t do enough for you Was given a free room upgrade on arrival with complimentary mini bar breakfast was good room spacious spotless and bed extra comfy wished we d had stayed extra night Will definitely return 
85727,Hilton London Bankside, The jacuzzi is freezing, Amazing hotel Most friendly staff could not have done anymore for us Cake for birthday girl Slippers Goodnight sign duvet turned back and bottle water when we returned to the room Breakfast in bed and Amazing pool area and loungers for our hangovers
85728,Hilton London Bankside, I got asked twice to upgrade my room It felt a bit pushy , Breakfast was really good I enjoyed the waffles you don t see those that often in hotel breakfasts
85729,Hilton London Bankside, The restaurants didn t have much choice had food in the distillery bar and it took about an hour to come and the quality was poor, The beds were really comfy and the size of the single beds was amazing
85730,Hilton London Bankside, There was little to dislike about the hotel The only slight disappointment was that the Jacuzzi was part of the pool and so not warm and there was no sauna , Great location high tech hotel with very comfortable spacious rooms Lots of small touches that made a difference Nice pool 
85731,Hilton London Bankside, For a 5 hotel everything could be a bit better bathroom had very visible scale marks gym was subpar staff not always understanding English confusing information in leaflets Felt overpriced but can be a London thing , Very close to Blackfriars Tate Modern Globe Great breakfast very nice room staff willing to help 
85732,Hilton London Bankside, It is a bit far from where I visited the most like soho areas But 5 min walking to the tube is fine, The staff are extremely helpful and polite The house keeper always clean my room even with my clothes folded appropriately The bathroom is spacious and clean I also enjoyed the swimming pool a lot

85734,Hilton London Bankside, My husband and I have no complaints , The hotel is in a fabulous location the staff was attentive the rooms were spotless and the beds were super comfortable I highly recommend this hotel 
85735,Hilton London Bankside, The only thing I could have found fault with on our stay was that breakfast was a little unorganised we had to queue different ends of the buffet to order the cooked items and sauces which meant by the time we sat down some items on our plate were cold That said for one of the items the chef personally delivered it to our table My point in only that surely there should be a better way of managing this perhaps order extra items at the table as you are seated and then served by the waiter waitress as I have experienced in the past in order hotels Also it was very pricey 25 EACH if not pre booked and 20 if you had It made the bowls of cereal sold for 7 at the local trendy cereal cafe for a bowl a bargain I m sure Hilton would still make a very healthy profit at 15 per head , The room was spotless and very spacious Breakfast was lovely very tasty and a huge selection We didn t get to use the pool but it looked nice Staff were friendly and welcoming they even facilitated my odd request of putting an inflatable zimmer frame in my friends room for his 40th birthday politely without batting an eyelid Thank you for the lovely stay this hotel deserves its high score 
85736,Hilton London Bankside, A bit pricey More room with bathtub would be great Room is a bit dim for me so brighter room would be nice , The hotel is perfect especially Mr AF is very helpful during my stay there The room is nice and clean The breakfast is great
85737,Hilton London Bankside, The fact we were only given two small milks and two teabags in room so after making a cup of tea in the evening had to go down to reception in the morning to get some more to have a cup when we woke Also the price of breakfast is ridiculous at 25 each on top of an expensive room luckily there is a lovely cafe just up the room called carlos cafe which did a lovely breakfast we were also rudely awakened at 4 30 in the morning by alarms which were set off by someone in the shower apparently ruined a otherwise comfortable night, The room bed and shower were all fabulous the complimentary water and slippers a nice touch 
85738,Hilton London Bankside, No breakfast included in my one night accommodation deal A bit pricey I stayed solo , The staff were all very good at the door room service and reception It goes to show people certainly help make a business successful 
85739,Hilton London Bankside, There were 2 little mistakes made by the staff that are not even worth mentioning here , The total experience was brilliant the combination of very friendly staff with the design and comfort of this hotel is excellent 
85740,Hilton London Bankside, At check in for my previous visit I was offered a voucher for a free drink Although I understand that that might have been an exception I asked the staff member at check in She then asked me if that was pet of my confirmation and I didn t know She informed me that that was not the case and that she could not give me a voucher When I showed the details of the previous check in there was also no notice of a drink included in the reservation Soon recon it was offer of goodwill but unfortunately although understandable it could not be granted this time It s more the tone way it was handled could have been a bit better Can t plug in hairdryer in the bathroom, The best thing is the scent when you come in Great super king Size beds Big TV Fantastic bar Spacious rooms Big bathroom shower AND bath Steam Iron board
85741,Hilton London Bankside, Very busy atmosphere good for a business stay but not if you are looking to relax We received a room adapted for the disabled Not enough wardrobe space and lighting No space to leave our suitcases or to hang the towels , We stayed here for a week and were able to try out all facilities Extremely friendly efficient and helpful staff Excellent breakfast and restaurant Very tidy room and great mattress 
85742,Hilton London Bankside, Having slept in my bed I turned my pillow over the following morning to find that it was soiled with lipstick Tawdry for a top hotel Really made me wonder if the linen had been changed at all , Lovely modern hotel with chic urban feel Great breakfast but would have preferred coffee from a pot Comfortable room 
85743,Hilton London Bankside, The prices for drinks were very expensive , This hotel is one of the finest I have ever had the pleasure of staying in The rooms were modern and beautiful The food was outstanding the service was amazing and the bed was very comfortable I would highly recommend this to everyone Enjoy your stay 
85744,Hilton London Bankside, It s located in a very silent area yet it takes a while to walk to the nearest Underground And there s not much fantastic view you can enjoy from the room , This is a brand new Hilton in London The restaurant is superb It is unusual that you can have such good food in a Hilton hotel The receptionists are very friendly and helpful Also love the fitness centre 
85745,Hilton London Bankside, Given a twin room facing a bleak courtyard and blank wall but cannot fault the room itself , Spacious room new modern and high level of quality would definitely return 
85746,Hilton London Bankside, service at breakfast wasnt good had to ask for T and coffee fetch our own water no breakfast left on the buffett nobody paying attentioni, loved the executive situation with lounge and drinks and canapes
85747,Hilton London Bankside, The only negative comment I have is that the quilt on the bed was a bit stale The cover was clean though , The staff were fabulous very attentive and nothing was too much trouble New hotel with very comfortable rooms 
85748,Hilton London Bankside, Far from city center , The Staff is so friendly especially Ana Barbalata Manager Guest Relations Faris and Yasin from the restaurant the house keeping is unbelievable They make up the room twice daily however the supervisor comes and asks whether there are any comments regarding the cleaning Amazing the rooms are spacious the Hotel is cosy it s ideal for business travelers 
85749,Hilton London Bankside, No iphone docking charging, Wish all Hiltons were like this fresh welcoming and comfortable Great location and close to lovely cafes for breakfast 
85750,Hilton London Bankside, I found the pork chump and Gloucester steak were of poor quality and not value for money My wife enjoyed the Lobster and Salmon , Location is great and we felt secure walking at all times of day and night Breakfast was excellent 
85751,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, The hotel is relatively new and as a result is immaculate where we saw including the public areas and the room There were some complimentary refreshments in the room which was a nice touch The bed was comfortable and as it was a king size it was very roomy The staff were very friendly both checking in and out and in the resteraunt for breakfast There was a very good selection for breakfast including good quality English breakfast and the usual cereals and pastries We had no issues and the hotel is well situated for both facilities and travel Shop right next door if you need any extras Very pleased all round 
85752,Hilton London Bankside, We mentioned it was my wife s birthday and asked for a cot crib when we booked the hotel Staff didn t know about the birthday and didn t put a cot crib In addition even though they upgraded us to a bigger room it only had a shower and not a bath which is not very convenient with a baby Babies don t take showers Only after we mentioned they moved us to a room with a bath They didn t supply a cot crib or an explanation as to why they didn t In past visits to hotels when we mentioned we were coming to celebrate our birthday we had something nice waiting for us in the room Perhaps not a big deal but at least bother to read comments customers write you in advance We personally were disappointed by that It s worth mentioning that the complimentary soft drinks had nothing to do with the birthday In the restaurant our waitress Federica hope I remember the name right was lovely Staff were nice in general as well However it seemed as if the restaurant staff in general were always in some sort of rush even when the restaurant is pretty empty We did come pretty late to the restaurant on both nights but the atmosphere didn t seem quite right One of the nights we got served a totally burnt burger Not sure how the chef thought this was edible But we did get a discount because of that so not much of a problem The desserts were delicious , The hotel decor and the swimming pool Location is pretty good We got upgraded to a bigger room which was nice as well and the room included complimentary soft drinks which was great Staff were nice and polite in general 
85753,Hilton London Bankside, There was no good place for my partner to do her hair No mirror close to a plug or a good place to sit and do her hair Incredibly quiet, Location was great Bed was amazing and the shower incredible
85754,Hilton London Bankside, Can t think of anything , Staff were great really friendly nothing was too much trouble Lounge staff in particular were outstanding Breakfast in the lounge was excellent quality choice 
85755,Hilton London Bankside, We got a smaller darker room with just a small window that was not possible to open I would expect for almost 200 GBP night a bigger room and a bathtube in the bathroom missing bathtube was a key disappointment , The hotel has a charming atmosphere mainly created by devoted highly professional smartly trained yet friendly employees The hotel service couldn t get any better Swimming pool and complimentary minibar refreshments are also lovely I loved the bed which was incredibly comfortable

85757,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, They were very attentive I wanted to get my car cleaned which they arranged for me and got it done while it was with the concierge They also sent up a complimentary cake up as it was our one year anniversary together which was very nice and drinks 
85758,Hilton London Bankside, It was a shame the pool facility was out of order as this was one of the reasons we had booked in the first place We were not made aware of this until we went to the fitness facilities and read the sign that was there , Bed was extremely comfortable and luxurious The shower and bathroom were stunning and everything was beautifully presented Staff were very friendly helpful and professional 12pm checkout allowed us to enjoy our stay even longer 
85759,Hilton London Bankside, Sometimes there would be knocks on the door from housekeeping and the knocks would be quite jarring when you are just relaxing in the room A soft doorbell would be more in keeping with the whole experience but I don t think there are any doorbells , The bed was very comfortable to sleep in and i was very impressed with the level of cleanliness as well as with the housekeeping everyday of the room 
85760,Hilton London Bankside, Well where do I start The hotel made a mistake with my rooms and insisted in was my fault even though I had an email from them confirming my stay and rooms They down graded my rooms and then refused to refund the difference I contacted Bookings com and unfortunately did not get a difference in the room rate Although the hotel then admitted to making a mistake the damage was done The hotel tried the best to do some service recovery offering free breakfast I travel a lot for work and all I can say is don t try and argue with customers until you are 100 sure , Good location great restaurant and bar
85761,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Friendly welcome from Reception Team super comfortable bed great shower lovely early morning swim followed by a tasty Gluten Free breakfast Will book again next time for sure 
85762,Hilton London Bankside, Despite the good quality I find the price level too expensive I have been there for attending a conference where the service was unfortunately not good enough for Hilton standards e g the temperature in the conference room was freezingly cold and was only raised after two hours and a high number of complaints by attendees , Breakfast rooms all was very perfect 
85763,Hilton London Bankside, 12 5 service charges on your bar bill which is already extortionate two small glasses of average wine and a G T was over 40 Check your bill if you didn t book direct mine had an additional 16 added of course it was a computer error and blamed on booking com , Executive lounge deal is well worth the 35 
85764,Hilton London Bankside, I wish we could have stayed longer , We loved this hotel The staff are really friendly the room was great the bar was comfortable and welcoming the food in the restaurant was absolutely amazing an all round superb hotel

85767,Hilton London Bankside, Nothing , Everything was excellent The room was great the gym and the pool were excellent and clean The place smelled fantastic like a spa The breakfast was outstanding The 1200 checkout was so convenient and every member of staff we encountered was extremely polite and attentive without being obtrusive 
85768,Hilton London Bankside, The only thing I would add to the room is a luggage rack and a little more drawer space , I got a great deal through Booking which made this stay exceptional value for money Convenient location for doing business on the south bank I did not use all the facilities but can say that the room was superb excellent choice of decoration very comfortable bed best shower ever nice toiletries all the extras one could need 
85769,Hilton London Bankside, Very overpriced drinks at the bar and the incense in the lobby was very strong and overpowering , Room was very quiet for such a central location Ideal for visiting the Tate Modern and other attractions along the South Bank

85777,Hilton London Bankside, We had requested a gluten free breakfast but when my wife asked in the restaurant she was told that gluten free food was out on display she walked round and had to find someone to ask again as nothing was clearly marked and bread had to be brought out from the kitchen It also cost 80 for 4 breakfasts , The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable 
85778,Hilton London Bankside, Nothing, Plush hotel with everything you would expect from Hilton brand Southwark not traditionally great location but now it is very up and coming and this place is right behind the Tate Modern Lots of bars restaurants etc nearby

85782,Hilton London Bankside, The d cor is smart but dark grey walls dark tiles dim lighting I suppose it is trendy but the overall feeling is a tad grim The music in the bar was far too loud making conversation impossible quite early in the evening when there were only a few people there as though someone were trying to big up a party that wasn t ready to happen , The hotel is new and clean and well equipped We enjoyed the very comfortable beds The location was convenient All the staff we encountered gave us courteous friendly and helpful service

85789,Hilton London Bankside, Breakfast on Sunday was chaotic seemed to be a lack of organisation of staff and lots of items cutlery plates weren t available Also there was no plug point near mirror in room which made using the hairdryer impossible , Staff were friendly and hotel was comfortable and in a great location near Tate Modern Pool is a great bonus 
85790,Hilton London Bankside, I stated in my booking request that i had booked a room as a special engagement trip and asked if anything could be arranged I called and was told something would be arranged upon arriving Upon arriving I was told there was a deluxe upgrade at 45 or another upgrade with lounge access for 90 or so Very awkward time to ask for more money when I was trying to be subtle about the engagement Not the best experience upon checking in Small things like slippers weren t in the room nor the complimentary water and only one bathrobe Felt strange calling for each of these items as I discovered it Not a smooth stay , location was great and the breakfast was very good
85791,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, The room was the cleanest I ve stayed in and very comfortable The design is modern practical and warm Staff were very attentive and helpful Great selection of food at breakfast and the layout means it doesn t feel busy or crowded Will definitely stay here again 
85792,Hilton London Bankside, While centrally located in London direct vicinity of hotel is a bit quiet , New hotel Spacious rooms Nice design of rooms lobby and restaurant Good breakfast Close to Tate Modern 
85793,Hilton London Bankside, The hairdryer is on an extremely short spiraled cable and all plug sockets are low down so trying to dry your hair meant the plug kept coming out of the wall There is also no vanity mirror or area for use whilst drying hair applying make up The only mirrors are in the bathroom and there are no non bathroom plug sockets which is obviously key to safety but doesn t allow for styling hair in mirror whilst drying There were no cotton buds or cotton pads which I feel are standard and means you don t need to pack your own Plus the only time I ve ever needed a sewing kit and non available in the room , The hotel is really nicely presented with attractive modern and stylish d cor The staff are very helpful and friendly they take their position seriously and try hard to ensure you are satisfied The room was really nicely presented with a lovely bathroom robe slippers and toiletries etc 
85794,Hilton London Bankside, Cost of drinks at the bar extortionate , Hotel is great value for central London and with it being so new it is beautiful and clean The bathrooms are especially impressive and the room size facilities are so much better than you get at competitor chains in the area
85795,Hilton London Bankside, While all was top quality from a material perspective staff lets it down Potatoes not quite cooked dirty utensils inexperienced staff privacy intrusive needless process for staff its record keeping keeps up the customer , Location extremely good quality everything bed fittings building ingredients breakfast towels all top notch Stellar wifi 
85796,Hilton London Bankside, Price went up mid booking Although the room was supposed to be soundproofed there was a lot of noise from the room upstairs Sounded like things being dragged across the floor and dropped , Great little cocktail bar attached to the hotel Friendly and helpful staff 
85797,Hilton London Bankside, Location is not the best if you want to be amongst the action Felt i did more walking than what i intended , Beautiful hotel Very modern and stylish Staff very polite and accomodating I felt like royalty from the moment the bulter opened my taxi door for me Couldnt fault the hotel 
85798,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, The hotel is in a quiet area 5 mins walking from the Subway It is very new and well equipped Breakfast is very good and has a large selection We also liked the restaurant and reception personnel specially Patricia Alex and the breakfast cook Very well equipped gym and nice swimming pool Excellent 
85799,Hilton London Bankside, Couldn t open windows so didn t sleep well either night, Immaculate establishment friendliest staff of any hotel I ve stayed at beautifully appointed room and bathroom
85800,Hilton London Bankside, The pool area isn t as well designed as the rest of the hotel I had to remind 2 days out of 3 to get my room cleaned , New place Top staff Great restaurant Good location 
85801,Hilton London Bankside, Room service staff were not as helfull as the rest of the hotels staff, all the facilities in the hotel were very new and well maintained The pool is and workout room were perfect The hotels bar was excellent Front desk staff were extremely helpfull and friendly I really enjoyed my stay The hotels location was a bit far from city attractions but the tube station was 5 7 mins walk from The hotel which was very convenient which made it easy 
85802,Hilton London Bankside, We booked restaurant for the evening on New Year s Eve expecting a romantic 3 course meal as 110 per person website states 3 course meal also on arrival until no one took our order for a while we were then told it was a buffet I couldn t fault the food but the price is ridiculous , Easy location short walk from underground Staff were very helpful and kind staff appeared to go out of their way to make your stay that extra special
85803,Hilton London Bankside, Slightly on the pricey side but it was the Hilton so that was to be expected Also the location although not far from some things was a little bit out of the way , The great service from the staff who were polite and especially helpful the massive comfy bed and the amazing shower The room was clean and tidy the TV was great with a variety of channels The hotel itself was gorgeous and the lobby was amazing Would definitely recommend it 
85804,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Brand new hotel with a very modern yet warm design Staff were excellent Great value for money thanks to excellent price from Booking com Best hotel I ve stayed at in London by some time 
85805,Hilton London Bankside, No complaints whatsoever , Best London hotel we have stayed in a long time and we were attracted to It due to it being brand new It did not disappoint and we will definitely be booking again as so many of the usual favourites have gone downhill Book quick before it gets discovered 
85806,Hilton London Bankside, All very pricey I know it s a central London hotel but the quality of food and drinks didn t match the price , Nice room 324 mind you we expected that as the reception staff said one of his favourite rooms New hotel and everything was fresh and clean 
85807,Hilton London Bankside, View of a massive wall but this meant we had absolute privacy and at this dark time of the year did not cause us a problem , A special anniversary The staff were so kind and this new hotel was a real treat We loved everything about it 
85808,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Absolutely incredible staff The hotel was exceptional in all areas We stayed with a small baby and the staff not only made us feel special but were accommodating in every sense The lounge setup was incredible with afternoon tea canap s and happy hour every day Wonderful 
85809,Hilton London Bankside, The only thing was the music in the bar having a cocktail listening to weird euro rave pop isn t my idea of relaxing , Great location breakfast was excellent and the room was faultless quiet and king size bed equals a great nights sleep 
85810,Hilton London Bankside, Could be more variety at breakfast A spa with jacuzzi would add much fun , The hotel is very new and fresh beautifully decorated Helpful staff especially Phillip at vip lounge little extras in the room such as dessert and a stocking filled with candy and a huge and comfortable king size bed 5 minutes walk from tube or railway Had a great stay 
85811,Hilton London Bankside, Nothing at all , The staff were amazing and extremely professional from check in to check out A special mention to the barmen who were extensively knowledgeable about their work and happily discussed and suggested new drinks for my partner and I to try We stayed over the Christmas period and were surprised with a stocking on our door on Christmas Morning a truly magical and relaxing stay thank you 
85812,Hilton London Bankside, The fact my room was 149 but 199 was taken from my account pending and it s still showing as pending leaving me 50 short Not cool , Everything
85813,Hilton London Bankside, The only negative thing is room service They dont clean properly and i have communicated this many times to the reception , The hotel is new and everything was excellent ANA the guest relations manager was really nice and helpful I would surely come again to this hotel
85814,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, The staff were totally amazing from start to finish including the room service I cannot speak more highly of the hotel or its team can t wait for my next stay 
85815,Hilton London Bankside, No hot choc in the room That was the worst thing we had to endure the hotel is excellent, Christmas Carollers and roasted chestnuts on arrival Breakfast 
85816,Hilton London Bankside, A suspicious cleaning lady entered our room on Saturday night at 9 45pm startled when seeing me mumbled something about us wanting to do laundry then high tailed it out , The staff were great after finding out it was my girlfriends birthday they left us a delicious cake in our room Everything is new and sharp 
85817,Hilton London Bankside, Wife had an issue that there were no mirrors to get ready in outside of bathroom and its a bit strange the set up with the lights We did have a maid walk in on us both naked at 6pm which wasn t great but Hotel were apologetic and gave us free breakfast Nothing that I would say should put you off from staying here At 25 breakfast is a bit pricey but if u get it there is lots to eat , The hotel was very clean room was very modern and spacious enough Breakfast was very good and lots of it with good variety staff were very friendly and all in all a nice place to stay Room service was pricey but good service and nice food 
85818,Hilton London Bankside, A SMALL POINT BUT A SWIMMING POOL AND SPA WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CHERRY ON THE CAKE, IF ONLY HOTELS SUCH AS THE SHARD HAS STAFF AS HELPFUL AND HAPPY AS AT THIS HOTEL AMAZINGLY WARM AND FRIENDLY
85819,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, In a word perfect It s new clean fresh classy contemporary and very very impressive Service from all levels was spot on The room I had was clean spacious well furnished warm and with a nice comfy bed Location is great only 2 3 minutes walk to the Tate Modern and Bankside The bar is a lovely place to be and whilst drinks aren t cheap one has to remember the location This place oozes class and sophistication I will be back 
85820,Hilton London Bankside, The facilities in the room are so discreet that the hairdryer appeared to be in a secret cupboard it s by the door in case you re looking for it , Shower was fabulous Bed was like a fluffy cloud
85821,Hilton London Bankside, Bar area very noisy that time of the year I guess but otherwise nothing else , Quick and easy checkin very polite staff all the way from the doorman to the desk Rooms very comfortable and quiet Great toiletries Good restaurant 
85822,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, This is a top rank hotel for business with all the comforts you would expect Had a great nights sleep Not the cheapest but considerably good value compared to other side of river and within 20 or 30 mins walk of all the important government stuff 
85823,Hilton London Bankside, Breakfast rather expencive 25 pr person , Check in was very expeditious an freindly To the staff s surprise there was no safety deposit box in our room We were promptly given a new room with a safety deposit box Restaurant staff were also friendly and service minded Breakfast and dinner was very good 
85824,Hilton London Bankside, Ordered cocktails but my friend was so convinced hers did not taste like any of the flavours she read the whole menu and it fitted the description of one of the alcohol free cocktails Queried with the barman who was completely dismissive , Stylish uncluttered clean and comfortable room Friendly and helpful staff except one Really handy location for tube and local attractions 
85825,Hilton London Bankside, I paid extra for room with city view I was expecting a view of London Skyline but I had a view of a block of flats through a small window City View means your room faces the outside of the hotel whereas non view rooms overlook an internal courtyard which in my opinion is a better view than City View I don t think City View should be used in description as it s misleading , Friendly helpful staff modern clean hotel handy location for tourists Very comfortable room especially the bed we enjoyed perfect sleeps Breakfast was excellent with a wide choice on offer 
85826,Hilton London Bankside,No Negative, Location is great for Central London Great looking hotel and rooms Good facilities such as spa and bar but didn t use as we spent most of our time out 
85827,Hilton London Bankside, The hair dryer was hard to find Might be good to have a note in the binder so guests don t have to search Would also appreciate a box of tissues near the bed , Loved the desk space the complementary drinks in the fridge a choice of sparkling water would be nice and the overall design of the room I would stay here again 
85828,Hilton London Bankside, Not really bad More of the if I had been told my room was an inside room facing other rooms across a courtyard I might have requested one with a view of London But as we were only there one night it was not important, Difficult to pick put one thing But from the meet and greet to checkout terrific 
85829,Hilton London Bankside, I must say the breakfast prices if you didn t include it in your stay were incredibly expensive 25 pp for a buffet that doesn t have that much of a selection is pretty ridiculous Tasty and well cooked though , Everything about this place was perfect The staff were absolutely superb The rooms were immaculate The pool and gym facilities were OK nothing too fancy And the location was spot on Will definitely go again 
85830,Hilton London Bankside, ONLY THING the only mirrors were in the wardrobes with poor lighting so couldn t really do my makeup properly also there was no plug near so had to dry my hair without a mirror , Lovely welcome Room was a really good size with a massive comfy bed and comfy pillows Everything you need including kettle tea s hairdryer shampoo s ect Lovely touch of having our slippers laid out for in the morning Amazing room service breakfast
85831,Hilton London Bankside, fyi the area around is not hip but I liked that I could walk to my meetings on the other side of the Thames crossed on the millennium bridge Access tube is ok a bit of a walk and limited lines This is a 4 star facility hotel with 5 star service fine by me , New hotel all facilities top notch Swimming pool is great 18m long 1 2 depth suitable for 3 swimmers at the same time I swam solo twice which is very nice Quiet

85842,Hilton London Bankside, Nothing at all All was well in place , The Hilton crew changed my prospective on Hilton Hotels Such a warm welcome which sometime might make you feel that it was for someone else and you are mistakenly been welcomed Every member of the crew is owning the place I guess Over all perfect stay Look out for Ama She is the guest relationship manager She will help you with any concern you have 
85843,Hilton London Bankside, See below If it wasn t for that it would have scored 5 out of 5 , Reception staff were wonderful couldn t do enough to help Actually every member of staff was the same If I have one issue is that I and a friend were challenged repeatedly about being guests by security I understand its their job but it did make us feel uncomfortable 
85844,Hilton London Bankside, Expensive parking which is understandable for central London but at least should have a 20min free parking area to unload, Superb hotel Very posh Reasonably priced for a 5 star hotel in central London Close to attractions Terrific breakfast Very very impressed with the hotel and staff
