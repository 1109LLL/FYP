331922,Hotel Palace GL, Lighting in bathroom could have been brighter some of the breakfast staff whilst being efficient could have done with more people skills last day was disappointing when it took 45 mins for my order of 1 poached egg, Comfy pillows Excellent and friendly greeting from Julie who showed us around when we first arrived first impressions are so important good range for breakfast we were on level 6 and the balcony allowed us to view and hear the street and surrounding area from a different perspective
331923,Hotel Palace GL, Everything was wonderful , The staff was very helpful and our room was fabulous We ordered room service which was beautifully delivered and delicious We loved the tv in the mirror above the mantle The bathroom was large and luxurious 
331924,Hotel Palace GL, Restaurant a little on the expensive side, Magnificent hotel staff very friendly and could not do enough for you room beautifully appointed entrainment in the restaurant and cocktail bar excellent and very enjoyable
331925,Hotel Palace GL, There was a little confusion at breakfast which was the fault of the reception but they weren t very apologetic about it All got sorted quickly though , Very helpful and friendly staff We had a bottle of champagne waiting for us in the room as it was our 25th wedding anniversary which was a very nice touch 
331926,Hotel Palace GL, Absolutely nothing , Everything was lovely Our rooms 515 no 516 were spacious clean comfortable Beds were just right and they have a pillow menu Bathrooms were well appointed with premium toiletries Staff were so friendly helpful and professional Old fashioned charm Located very close to the main shopping strip and about 10 15 mins walk to the gothic area 
331927,Hotel Palace GL, That I had to leave , This hotel was just perfect in every way Walking distance to all the major areas in the city center for shopping sight seeing eating etc The staff is amazingly friendly and helpful They make you feel special The room is large and beautiful and modern e g the bathroom but retains a very old world feeling The common areas are gorgeous The breakfast was scrumptious and it is in a lovely setting I could not have been more pleased and I am EXTREMELY picky about hotels I would stay here every time I come to Barcelona without even looking at another hotel 
331928,Hotel Palace GL, Taxis don t seem to know it as El Palace but as The Ritz even after many years , Friendly and efficient staff big luxurious room comfortable bed and fully equipped bathroom The new pool area and roof garden was great We have been visiting since 2010 and it just keeps getting better 
331929,Hotel Palace GL, Was our first trip there so everything felt wonderful Can t think of anything to change , Service great Complimentary wine and cake Rooftop area very relaxing Afternoon tea in large bar beyond reception was lovely Live music in bluesman bar was brilliant 
331930,Hotel Palace GL,No Negative, Hotel Palace GL is probably the best hotel I ve stayed at so far It s located in the upscale Eixample neighborhood yet in short walking distance to the old town and La Rambla The hotel is very elegantly decorated Staff were very diligent and friendly our room was large with a huge bathroom the bed was extremely comfortable The rooftop terrace and restaurant were excellent Everything was just perfect We had such a pleasant stay here Highly recommended 
331931,Hotel Palace GL, The only negative is the price of the breakfast in the hotel would definitely recommend exploring the cafe s around the hotel as they are much better value , The view from the roof top bar was spectacular The room was top notch a good size very quite and comfortable The Bathroom was well laid out modern and scrupulously clean with and great shower 
331932,Hotel Palace GL, Area of improvement we were little bored with having the same breakfast every day for 4 days even the dishes were the same and kept at the same place I am sure that the chef can do better for a 5 star hotel as per my travel experience Though the breakfast was very good with vegetable sandwich fresh fruits and salmon the different dips etc , We stayed 4 nights and checked out on 26 Jun The hotel has palace interiors very clean housekeeping does the room makeup as and when you want The concierge is very information and helpful for example they got of tickets for the best Flamence show in town the same day which otherwise is usually fully book The black rice with seafood in their menu is a must try The pool is small but more of a relaxation The hotel was very considerate for our 2 children and upgraded our room too for a comfortable stay They have 2 bookings in my name and had reserved 2 rooms it was duplicate booking and we were worried of the cancellation fee but they understood our problem and waived it They could also get us baby sitting for about 20EUR hour in case we wanted but we were not sure if our kids would really adjust The parking is public right next building and is something like either 3 2EUR hour or 30 day flat rate and the concierge can park it for you and get your car when you want
331933,Hotel Palace GL, Nothing, Breakfast is great and so is the restaurant on the rooftop The staff is beyond helpful the people at the concierge desk went out of their way to make our stay a wonderful experience The location is great and the decor is beautiful 
331934,Hotel Palace GL, We didn t eat breakfast there because it was too expensive for what we eat for breakfast , We like the spacious room with its Spanish d cor and ambience For every other Barcelona accommodation we looked at on the internet the rooms were decorated in modern d cor We prefer a style that reflects the country we are visiting Having stayed in Barcelona before this time we requested a quiet room away from a busy street and El Palace exceeded our need We felt safe walking around the neighborhood late in the evening We splurged on this hotel and it exceeded our expectations Highly recommended to others 
331935,Hotel Palace GL, They even helped me when my iPhone was stolen by pickpocket on street , The staff was tremendous Concierge and doorman and front desk were all first rate 
331936,Hotel Palace GL, An old fashioned de luxe hotel it was very expensive Gran Via C C is a very busy road and on a lower floor the noise would have been intrusive The pool was very small and not good for adults , The room and the bed were very comfortable but not good value 
331937,Hotel Palace GL, Nothing to say , We enjoyed everything from luxury breakfast to nice romantic evenings in the rooftop bars and restaurants with life music from extremely cozy bed to tropical shower Really good attitude and attention for all your needs 
331938,Hotel Palace GL, Clunky huge room key you had to leave at front desk Time to switch to cards , Spectacular building just remodeled Not cheap by any means but very beautiful and very attentive staff Rooftop bar and Winter Garden Restaurant had spectacular views 
331939,Hotel Palace GL,No Negative, The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous But we were extremely lucky The front desk upgraded us to a Junior suite Wow It was wonderful And we so appreciated it He saw that we were staying for a while and upgraded us because he had space That s pretty darn fantastic Many hotels do not let the front desk make those kinds of decisions It was a great decision And the conceige was always very helpful And everyone welcomed us and acknowledged us when we came and went Bravo 
331940,Hotel Palace GL, The only downside to our trip was the service on the rooftop bar and restaurant We were mostly ignored when we were up there and the service was horrendously slow and sometimes did not come at all We were even refused entry on one night when we went up or a drink because they were too busy Not good enough in my opinion it was like they were not part of the same hotel Rude and obnoxious We did report this to the hotel when we checked out The rooftop area is beautiful and one of the main attractions for this hotel Peace and tranquility in a city is a rare touch its just a shame the staff that worked up there let it down , Staff were excellent room was beautiful and the hotel is in a great location everything in walking distance The facilities in the hotel were very good Would definitely stay here again and did not want to leave 
331941,Hotel Palace GL, It has a marvelous rain shower that overflowed the shower pan when we used it the first time We just didn t use the rain head again as there was a handheld available , This is a beautiful classic luxury property providing all of the best amenities and service you expect in a fine European hotel We will stay here again The staff was excellent the bar and all of the restaurants including room service were very good and the location is fantastic It is close to everything yet quiet and peaceful 
331942,Hotel Palace GL, Bathroom too dark shower not ideal countertop material looks cheap with water easily accumulating requires constant mopping with face towel, Public space is elegant bedroom s high ceiling and bright
331943,Hotel Palace GL, Our only slight disatisfaction was that the shower tiles were in need of an overhaul Otherwise the whole of our stay was Perfect, Everyone working at the hotel during our stay was exceptional These people included Reception Staff Front Desk the Doormen the Concierege The Maids Waiters and Waitresses All of whom were professional extremely polite and courteous They were very welcoming knowlegeable and warm and friendly at all times Your staff at every level are a credit to your hotel We were celebrating our 22nd Wedding Anniversay and the Concierege made it even more special by leaving a gift of Champagne and Chocolates along with a congratulatory anniversary message in our room We asked them to make a reseveration for us at a restaurant of their recommendation We were looking for a good steak house and they did not disappoint the Restaurant Lomo Alto was a superb dining experience We would like to thank everyone at the Hotel Palace GL for making our stay so memorable 
331944,Hotel Palace GL, The pillows were a bit too soft the head falls in and if someone sleeps on the side their head can crush their arm and wake them up in the middle of the night , Excellent location right in the middle of the city perfect connection to the airport bus and the airport My fianc e forgot her shirt I called the hotel and they not only found it but are sending it back free of charge A true 5 star treatment 
331945,Hotel Palace GL, Room Service Restaurants in general We were very much surprised that in Barcelona one of the world capital for cusine the food in all hotel restaurants were NOT TASTY and the service was SLOW , Location
331946,Hotel Palace GL,No Negative, I was totally astonished by the lobby when I just got arrived the picture as attached Staff were really nice and attentative Location was also great just few minutes away from the luxury street Passeig de Gracia The restaurant at top roof was also fantastic and we had a pleasant dinner with my friends I will certainly stay here when I have chance to visit Barcelona again 
331947,Hotel Palace GL,No Negative, An excellent hotel We would definitely stay here again The staff were attentive nothing was too much trouble The hotel breakfast buffet was sumptuous The hotel was very clean It was centrally located ideal for a city break 
331948,Hotel Palace GL, I don t think our trip could have been improved Job well done , The styling of this hotel is right on point it is glamorous and royal as the hotel name probably suggests but at the same shows a modern twist The breakfast room is light airy with high ceilings and beautiful flooring The lobby is grand to say the least The roof top terrace and restaurant where we enjoyed an excellent Bloody Mary whilst exploring the hotel is painted with murals and the view over Barcelona from the highest viewpoint up a further set of stairs is impressive Breakfast was superb with a great choice which even included an oriental selection alongside your more traditional options of full english hams cheeses breads croissants etc etc The Spa massage was lovely we had a couples massage in the same room and despite telling the lady that I don t fall asleep during massages I was soon waking myself up by snoring The concierge were superb throughout Lastly it was my wife s birthday and not only were we supplied with a bottle of cava upon arrival in our room but they also remembered the actual day of her birthday and brought her a cake at breakfast Oh and don t miss the jazz club which opens at 11pm it was great to pop into after a meal out in Barcelona it was busy to say the least 
331949,Hotel Palace GL,No Negative, Fantastic service Great bonus to my Birthday was a lovely upgrade to a Junior Suite Charming hotel beautiful ambiance amazing interior a true feel of a palace 
331950,Hotel Palace GL, Michelin restaurant in the hotel we did not get reservation in 2 days Despite the fact that the restaurant was not fully occupied , I liked everything I felt like an aristocrat coming into full service exclusive hotel with wonderful palace design excellent breakfast and the garden amazing roof restaurant with panoramatic view on the city Service superb this is place where they care of every detail There is night bar with night amusement st that lot of new fashion hotels are missing nowadays we will come definitely back 
331951,Hotel Palace GL, Lack of communication between staff due to language barrier there was few misunderstandings regarding reservations for dinner with in the hotel which is not a big deal but I would strongly suggest that all receptionists must be fluent in international language English due to the nature of visitors from all over the world Also all staff should be aware that which customers are staying with in the hotel and which ones are just visiting , Great hotel with beautiful decor and ambiance Very mush equivalent to the Ritz London Food is great including afternoon tea and very good value for money compared to local restaurant s food or street food We had a great warm welcome staff are lovely very friendly and accommodating I will definitely be back 
331952,Hotel Palace GL, Not a thing , Only bouquets There is nothing to criticise We stayed four nights and apart from the teenagers not being able to use the pool which was undergoing a winter clean we had a wonderful time The checkin service was excellent and we really appreciated the personal information and being shown to our rooms The beds were very comfortable and the sheets were silky soft sorry Ritz in Madrid you set a very high standard but we think that they have beaten you The room decor was luxurious yet not too fussy The bathrooms were completely refurbished and even though my personal favourite marble finish was missing they were very functional and pleasant L occitane toiletries are always pleasant too We attended the Thursday night blues and jazz bar and thorougly enjoyed the band We ate at the restaurant 1919 because Caelis was fully booked and thoroughly enjoyed that too At our departure we couldn t resist a family photo with the obliging front of house staff A very memorable trip at a wonderful hotel 
331953,Hotel Palace GL, nothing, a real old luxury hotel in the good sense of the word beautiful bars restaurants especially the bluesmenbar There were 2 live concerts nice atmosphere spacious luxury rooms very friendly staff

331955,Hotel Palace GL, The food in the restaurant was mediocre and expensive , The hotel was 100 great The location is slightly out of the way more for an experienced traveler but otherwise i will gladly stay there again and will suggest it to my traveling friends 
331956,Hotel Palace GL, Shower in bath pointed in the direction of the bathroom floor so constantly flooding Drinks were very expensive, The rooms were excellent very spacious and clean and the property is within walking distance of everything

331959,Hotel Palace GL, Expensive although you really do get what you pay for here , The room was stunning Very comfortable and a good size The staff were all very helpful and friendly The food was amazing The hotel wasn t too far away from the centre of town so was a nice little walk to and from and an underground was close too

331961,Hotel Palace GL,No Negative, All of the staff were welcoming helpful and professional They provided excellent advice directions and recommendations The bartender in the gorgeous roof top patio made us the best mojitos we re every had Hotel Palace is upmarket formerly the Ritz but the staff were not the least but snooty Our room was wonderful on the 4th floor a corner room overlooking the main street It was luxurious and beautiful The decor throughout is elegant and tasteful The bathroom was stunning We also found the location very good for our walks through beautiful neighbourhoods and close to many of the main sites of Barcelona We took cabs to Gruell Park and one distant restaurant but other than that all was within walking distance I hope to return to Barcelona and I wouldn t stay anywhere else 
331962,Hotel Palace GL, My room was very gloomy because over looking the inner courtyard Although it was a junior suite A bit depressing Food options were limited, Furniture was comfortable and the bathroom was very nice Clean 
331963,Hotel Palace GL, Having to leave , Nice gesture of a bottle of champagne upon arrival nothing was too much trouble and the cleanliness and comfort of the room and hotel in general was class leading along with the food a VERY nice hotel to stay at will make a return visit some time

331965,Hotel Palace GL, None, Service was exceptional We had to make two requests from housekeeping and room service and both were delivered within a few minutes The bed was very comfortable The hotel had kept its charm from when it was established in 1919 offering 21st century comfort

331967,Hotel Palace GL, breakfast is too expansive but not perfect coffe point is not good no coffee machine no green tea TV very small and works is not correct I did not like bar menu on roof level no children menu, Perfect location and personal food at restaurant is the best comfortable bathroom but room is small

331970,Hotel Palace GL, Nothing really to grumble about except that if you don t do the inclusive breakfast deal it costs 29 euros for the full menu A patisserie across the road therefore does good business , Old world values coupled with modern ideas that coupled together give the hotel a good feeling Was impressed with our room and the rooftop garden restaurant and pool also the Herb Garden The service provided by the staff in general is excellent About ten minutes walk from the Rambelas shoping and restaurants and stops for the Open Top Tour buses A visit to the food market is a must do especially if shellfish are your favourites 
331971,Hotel Palace GL, In room carpets require a bit of refresh due to unpleasant odor , Excellent service and location very spacious and clean rooms and very good breakfast Amazing view from the rooftop bar
331972,Hotel Palace GL,No Negative, The pure professionalism of all the staff was absolutely top notch They were so helpful at all times The rooftop pool was amazing with breathtaking views of this wonderful city I must say it s really nice when you come back after a day roaming the sights and the concierge remembers your room number professional without a doubt

331978,Hotel Palace GL,No Negative, The hotel interior is fantastic very nice decoration Breakfast is OK We had a nice surprise from hotel management on my birthday occasion Recommend 
331979,Hotel Palace GL, We relied on the concierge for information regarding the location of the hotel as to where we wanted to go We were misinformed and told there wasn t any point going to the area where all the top designers were ie Louis Vuitton etc on the Sunday that we were there because stores weren t opened on Sunday s and on the Monday because it was a national holiday Everything was supposedly shut down After dinner on Monday our last night we happened to come across a very lively street full of restaurants hotels and shops that were opened Louis Vuitton Gucci and other big designers were closed at the time but we didn t know if they were closed because of the holiday or because it was just late Several stores were still opened when we arrived late in the evening so It was really disappointing to know we weren t provided with the correct information especially after spending so much money to be in a hotel that was to provide good and knowledgeable service , The room
331980,Hotel Palace GL, The drinks at the roof top pool are very expensive 18 for two glasses of water and a beer is over the top , The concierge were extremely helpful and friendly The facilities were outstanding and the whole hotel is incredibly luxurious 
331981,Hotel Palace GL,No Negative, All staff were amazing they responded to our email confirming our requests before traveling When we arrived the guest relation personnel meat us and went through all the hotel facilities and escorted us to our beautiful room where we found a lovely card congratulating my husband for his birthday and us for our 40th wedding anniversary a bottle of champagne and a delicious chocolate cake the location of the hotel is at an excellent location very accessible to all attractions and within walking distance in the classy quiet suburb L eixample the decor is grand we felt we are staying in a palace we loved the roof top garden we highly recommend it 
331982,Hotel Palace GL, Music at the rooftop 80s with low quality italian disco and every day the same in loop Pity especially nowadays with the availability of internet radio of all kind jazz electro pop etc for all tastes and generation , Excellent stay in this palace at Barcelona To recommend Jazz soul and Funky bands playing on Thu Fri and Sat in a cosy bar 
331983,Hotel Palace GL, The tv to me it actually ruined the the greatness of the room and its facilities Its so hard to watch and covered in a poster I dont know what was the idea of it I was trying to watch a match of barcelona and it was very hard for me to watch it Screen is very small and covered in black tented poster I just found it so weird in a great hotel like the gl palace, Location Cleanliness Comfort Value for money Facilities Staff was very kind and helpful Food service was great I totally recommend to stay in it 
331984,Hotel Palace GL, Still using the old keys , First of all I want to say that I haven t been in a friendly hotel like this one all the people working there are friendly and helpful the hotel itself amazing well decorated and very clean 
331985,Hotel Palace GL, rug in lobby a bit worn out and dated, room was spacious and decorated exquisitely Awesome bathroom Rooftop bar restaurant and pool were wonderful

331988,Hotel Palace GL, Not being able to stay longer , Everything was amazing We were in love with the decor the staff were great and the room was very comfortable We wish we had more time to explore this wonderful place 
331989,Hotel Palace GL, My only complaint is the fact that you feel the vibration of the subway throughout the building even on the 6th floor It did not keep me awake at night but it was noticeable Also having to be escorted by hotel personel to the roof top terrace was a little inconvenient as you could not go there straight from your room , What a classy hotel The staff was attentive and service minded I enjoyed coming back to a clean and made up room in the evening with my bed opened for the night a chocolate on my pillow fresh water on the mantel and my slippers next to my bed on a small rug Old world charm and service with modern amenities such as a TV hidden in the mirror above the fireplace dimmable spotlights and a nice rain shower and modern fixtures in the bathroom The bedroom was large and roomy for European standards The large room behind the lobby is great for meeting up with friends for a drink if it s too hot on the roof top terrace 
331990,Hotel Palace GL, We were confused by difference btween continental and full breakfast the in line stations made me unsure whether I was helping myself to the wrong food , The quakirty and variety of food at breakfast and Diana Garden Rest was exceptional The attention and help of staff at the concierge and treasury was excellent and helpfull 
331991,Hotel Palace GL, We found the drink at the entrace to the lounge area a little too sweet for our liking perhaps water with a dash of lemon would be a suggestion , The staff were all so friendly and very helpful where ever we were in the hotel The service at Concierge was above our expectations the door men were so nice and the staff including the room girls were really nice and very discreet We loved to be able to have a swim in the rooftop pool which made this hotel very special We travelled with our family from Australia and 7 of us had a great time 
331992,Hotel Palace GL, only 1x huge key per room instead of several keycards outdated and cumbersome if two people share a room and need to coordinate how when to get into the room rooftop pool is tiny and has very restrictive and annoying policy closes at 18 00 although normally people would do sightseeing beach excursions etc during the day and then use the pool early to late evening Like this you get home to the hotel in the evening and can t go for a refreshing swim very silly the pool should be open until 22 00 children allowed at the pool good for families annoying and get wet from splashing about for non parents poolbar and hotel generally totally overpriced e g one cocktail at the pool EUR 29 a coke at the pool EUR 8 Adding breakfast for 1 week around EUR 1 000 these extras are exaggerated and disproportionate considering the high room rate Paying for luxury when it is luxury is fine but paying for luxury when receiving commodity is annoying tiny fitness room and spa not luxury generally relatively small rooms with tiny balconies not luxury , good central location rooftop pool terrace is nice with good view over the city elegant entrance and main hall on ground level friendly helpful staff l occitante personal care bath products
331993,Hotel Palace GL, Lobby of the is tiered at least change a carpet would be nice as the rest of the hotel has been renovated , Good bad pillow was little tough for my wife but overall room was good Negative think is the pictures on the website it gives you a wrong impression as the hotel it self does not have that luxury feel Location is superb and a specially if you young and willing to hang out all night Remind me of some area in New York with a Madrid sharm No wonder why all hotel was full with the British guest Also if you have time to spend at the hotel they have almost full buffet at bar from 2pm till 11 pm Which is very nice addition Staff is nice and friendly 
331994,Hotel Palace GL, Hotel is located in the heart of the city in walking distance from several sight seeing locations About a 20 min Taxi ride from the beach , Beautiful hotel Spacious rooms with luxury bathrooms Great staff Amazing roof top view with a pool

331996,Hotel Palace GL, Unnecessarily difficult to get served order more drinks or even pay in the roof top bar Food was slightly inconsistent Recommended restaurant for outside of the hotel need to be updated , Very friendly staff especially at the front desk 
331997,Hotel Palace GL,No Negative, All guests should first go to rooftop deck to get their bearings the view is amazing Concierge staff was excellent and couldn t have been more helpful They even helped me find the official Barcelona Football Club store so I could buy a gift 
331998,Hotel Palace GL, The lifts were slow and were a few times out of order Breakfast freshness can improve for the price but breakfast overall was very good The location is noisy so the pool is not too quiet The sauna maya sauna was unusual , We were happy in this place and felt very well treated Extremely helpful and friendly staff Comfortable room equipment Great windows regarding noise insulation Beautiful vintage decoration 
331999,Hotel Palace GL, No , Great location Just 5 min walk from Catalunya de palace where you have direct bus to airport and also 3 min to train station Of course close to many of landmarks They welcomed us with champagne as I have mentioned that I was visiting them to celebrate my husband s birthday They are really nice
