247439,The Beaumont Hotel, I personally didn t think the food was all that great The minestrone I had was very think and too tomatie The breakfast poached eggs came overcooked an on one slice of toast The bacon sandwich was dry Not to standard for the hotel or the price , The hotel design location and staff were amazing 
247440,The Beaumont Hotel,No Negative, Great location and charming theme and tasteful decor throughout the hotel The service was simply excellent All staff members are most welcoming and accommodating Cleaning service was also exceptional with great attention to details I look forward to returning to the Beaumont Thank you for a wonderful experience 
247441,The Beaumont Hotel,No Negative, This is my second stay at the Beaumont and it only gets better I love this hotel so much that I would only consider staying there during my frequent visits to London It s a hidden gem in the heart of the city 
247442,The Beaumont Hotel, can t think of anything, The location of this hotel is excellent but the staffs and services provided are even more impressive This hotel isn t cheap but if this is the price range you are looking at i believe you cant find a better deal than this hotel in terms of the location service and amenities I will definitely stay here again next time i am visiting London
247443,The Beaumont Hotel,No Negative, The service was exceptional All staff incredibly care about small details Each single employee in the hotel makes me feel that they know my personal preferences and serve me accordingly There exceptional service influenced the whole trip rather than just the stay in the hotel That was through their very helpful and knowledgeable concierge The location is perfect It is located in the hub however it is away from city noise The room and the bath were clean and elegant This stay raised my standards of Hotels service quality 
247444,The Beaumont Hotel, Hmmm can t think of anything significant , Loved the size of the room Very friendly staff Loved the cub room every morning Mostly loved location and neighborhood safe and friendly 
247445,The Beaumont Hotel, More availability of spa appointments, The front of house staff were excellent The waiting staff were very good The bedroom and the standard of cleaning were first class Best UK hotel we have ever stayed in 
247446,The Beaumont Hotel, Nil, Excellent location friendly staff and found everything ready for me to check in Few steps to oxford street The room size is good Plan to return to it soon
247447,The Beaumont Hotel, The Colony Grill The food not as good as the other restaurants of the group, The staff It was like being at home with family The bed super confortable and wow for the linen
247448,The Beaumont Hotel, Some of the staff at the front desk were not attentive and not friendly, A stylish hotel in a great location few steps away from the Oxford Street and the Bond Street Station Clean room with comfortable beds and big shower Angel the gentleman from the Concierge and Virginie were friendly and helpful 
247449,The Beaumont Hotel,No Negative, A fantastic attention of all the Staff Hotel with a nicy Ardeco style We loved all the details The location is perfect close to the center to Hide Park very quiet A very very nice hotel 
247450,The Beaumont Hotel, Staff not listening to what you order The wife booked a hair appointment and this was fully confirmed by the hotel manager but when she went for the appointment nobody was there She called reception who did nothing Waited 30 mins and went to reception to be advised that the hair dresser had an accident and could not make it The hotel is also very dark and not really up to four star standard yet alone the claimed five star Also the hotel and it s story is all fabricated by its owner Built in a lie I guess which sets the tone Dissapointed and would not return, Bathroom was very clean
247451,The Beaumont Hotel, Room was a bit on the small size , Wonderful personnel Most helpful and pleasant Everything in the room in mint condition and high quality Location great 
247452,The Beaumont Hotel, I wished the room was bigger but it s hard to find a large room in London s hotels , Calm and very clean hotel Staff are Very nice n helpful Well located 
247453,The Beaumont Hotel, Nothing, This was one of the best hotels i have ever been to and I have been around the world Staff are professional and very friendly at the same time the hotel decoration is beautiful gives the feeling of old english the room was fantastic comfortable will all needed amenities every thing in the room and minibar is complementary not including alcohols all tips are also included in the rate so you don t have to tip any one nor do they expect to be tipped The hotels restaurants service delicious meals There is nothing I disliked it was all great and beyond our expectations Highly recommend and would definitely come back here again 
247454,The Beaumont Hotel, I would have liked a bath in the room not just a shower but for that you need to book a Premium room not a classic I will know next time , The attention to detail The wonderful ambience and kind little gestures Any issue was solved immediately Friendly and welcoming staff 
247455,The Beaumont Hotel, London restaurants are hard to get a table at I wished that the concierge was a bit more influential to get us in those places they re not bad but not fantastic there was a sewage problem at the hotel when we went there the smell was really bad and we couldn t enjoy the facilities because of it they gave us a cupcake and a letter to apologize , really nice staff spacious rooms nice d cor great location 
247456,The Beaumont Hotel, The room key had on multiple occasions functional issues both in the elevator and in the room This made my stay rather uncomfortable with the doubt lurking at the back of my mind that the key may fail again and it was sort of embarrassing to always go to the front desk to get the key re magnetized Also the F B menu needs a revamp not the best but good enough for 2 nights Third night you ll get bored of the menu , The Cub room was awesome The spa was excellent The staff was well trained The doormen were passionate and I loved that they loved their jobs Excellent human resources at the Beaumont
247457,The Beaumont Hotel, There was nothing to dislike , Everything at The Beaumont is fabulous The staff couldn t be nicer or more helpful I tried to tip the bellman as I left and he said no I m so happy to help you The location is PERFECT the restaurant is wonderful too I love the rooms and the Art Deco decor is beautiful My friend Ty recommended this hotel and I have stayed twice now I will go and stay again 
247458,The Beaumont Hotel, There was construction across the street from my room but the rooms are well insulated so it wasn t too bad , Everything about this property is top notch Room service was a treat so if you re feeling jet lagged don t miss out on ordering in because excellent food with your feet up when your tired can t be beat The in room breakfasts were great too Every attention to detail is paid in this beautifully done hotel Staff are extremely attentive Wouldn t hesitate to stay here here again 
247459,The Beaumont Hotel, Mattress too soft and feather pillows no good to someone who has allergies Current construction outside window , Great to have sit down breakfast no up and down to a buffet Nice change 
247460,The Beaumont Hotel, There s 5 service charge on top of your room bill which they don t tell you about until it s time to pay for your stay then they make you feel like you have to pay it We didn t feel service was worth 70 when we were only staying two nights and didn t even spend much time in the hotel The other disappointment was residents breakfast whichonly included scones which were fresh and lovely and tea coffee However if you wanted something different you had to pay extortionate prices , Complementary snacks were wonderful 
247461,The Beaumont Hotel, Nothing , The decorative touches in the room and all the common areas made me feel like I was in an Art Deco hotel Could not believe it was only two years old 
247462,The Beaumont Hotel, The staff was attentive and as polite as you would expect from such a hotel but it was nothing exceptional or memorable Also the concierge does try to push for arranging taxis or reservations I understand that the commission they get is an important part of their income but he seemed to take it personally every time we ordered an Uber , The location was both very central and also on a quiet side street The rooms were very well appointed and sleep quality was excellent My favourite touch was the vintage Daimler courtesy car Very cool indeed 
247463,The Beaumont Hotel, Nothing It was perfection , I loved everything about this hotel The service was impeccable and the amenities were extraordinary The staff attended to my every need They knew what I wanted before I did 
247464,The Beaumont Hotel, Not that much important However the lobby needs refreshment since its next to the restaulrent , The location was perfect towards Selfirege s main gate and Oxford Street Very friendly staff with their unlimited assessment with smile Rooms were quite good size comparing with other round hotels

247468,The Beaumont Hotel, Breakfast is not good at all You have to pay for everything except tea coffee juice bread At least make 1 main course free I e eggs, Everything except breakfast
247469,The Beaumont Hotel,No Negative, The attentiveness of the staff the bathroom was beautifully laid out and the added touch of Beaumont cards and dice in the room I can highly recommend the spa I had a therapist called Serena and she was brilliant Loved the Daimler car and driver nice bonus for guests 
247470,The Beaumont Hotel, I was prepared to pay for a late checkout but could only stay until 1pm The invoice was wrong there were 2 instead of 1 restaurant spendings accounted on our name Breakfast service could be better , In the hart of London but in a quiet surroundings
247471,The Beaumont Hotel, The breakfast was confusing and while we had booked inclusive breakfast we were charged 45 When we complained it wasn t explained what was inclusive and what was extra and we only had pancakes and toast with orange juice and toast and the oragange juice never arrived the cost was removed from the bill It could have been communicated better though to avoid spoiling our otherwise excellent stay, Excellent location facilities staff and hotel fabulous
247472,The Beaumont Hotel, We stay there include breakfast but when checkout they charge the breakfast didn t notice us in advance that only continental breakfast is included , Almond croissant in the restaurant is very delicious 
247473,The Beaumont Hotel,No Negative, The staff are externally friendly I had the standard room but it was just enough for me my favourite part is always the large windows the bigger the windows the better And the fact that the mini bar is free an extra Favourite hotel and definitely I will always be staying at the beaumount

247475,The Beaumont Hotel, The breakfast room lacks windows and natural sunlight , The location is a stone throw away from the bustling Oxford street the property is gorgeous and super well maintained he staff is very courteous and always wants to help the design of the room is very well thought and everything in the minibar is Free 
247476,The Beaumont Hotel, Nothing , We stayed at this hotel on the day we were married The staff made every effort to make our stay super special and for that reason it will always be our favourite hotel in London The rooms were lovely and breakfast was delicious

247478,The Beaumont Hotel, No Taxi Driver knows Balderton Street but all know Brown Hart Gardens As I know London I had to explain that Balderton runs parallel to Duke Street What about some colour in the facade Plants or Flags , Excellent staff good quiet room excellent location
247479,The Beaumont Hotel, Some of the receptionists need further training in how to deal with guests and their needs The duty managers are great as well as the head receptionists , Concierges were very helpful and nice they were kind in dealing with guests
